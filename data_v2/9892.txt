his album to be totally acoustic delaney colin interview with damien leith travel down under 20 august 2007 retrieved 21 september 2007 knowing that he was well known by australian public as new australian idol he knew that it was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from records produced by previous idol contestants as many of their records predominantly featured up beat pop songs he noted that music he was making could make album harder to sell commercially as a result he and his producers spent time to work on songs which would appeal to a broader audience leith did this by holding onto several elements in his music that people had enjoyed on australian idol adams cameron q a with damien leith herald sun 26 july 2007 retrieved 15 september 2007 however he still wanted to show new elements to album so he held on some elements of acoustic music leith comments we didn t want to be too acoustic or too rocky i ve been conscious of people who bought winner s journey but also conscious about grabbing a new audience as well i think this album s got all those kind of winner s journey elements falsetto and emotional thing but it s got a lot of me in it too damien leith was also conscious of lyrics we wrote he added a few emotional ballads which contained strong lyrics but had left out songs he thought were too depressing leith spent seven months of recording and writing and worked with bryon jones james roche and ross fraser initially he wanted album to be released in march but it was pushed back to august partly due to prolonged success of winner s journey and partly because of large number of songs they had to cull writing and inspiration songs he wrote were inspired by his family and friends a few of songs explored themes of love and fulfilment not just for weekend was a song he wrote after birth of his second son jagger song beautiful is a love song written to his wife eileen other songs in album explored much darker themes blew it all away is a heartfelt song about suicide of a friend which happened shortly after another friend died from cancer another song alone was inspired from a friend who was struggling after his father s death shine like sun is about a friend in ireland who was experiencing a rough relationship leith wrote or co wrote a total of nine tracks out of twelve in album incidentally first single and opening track 22 steps was a song he did not write it was written by canadian singer songwriter andy stochansky another non original track leith recorded was a cover of fleetwood mac s
