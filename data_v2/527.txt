traditional gardens is a garden dedicated to collection cultivation preservation and display of a wide range of plants labelled with their botanical names it may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants herb gardens plants from particular parts of world and so on there may be greenhouses shadehouses again with special collections such as tropical plants alpine plants or other exotic plants visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours educational displays art exhibitions book rooms open air theatrical and musical performances and other entertainment botanical gardens are often run by universities or other scientific research organizations and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy or some other aspect of botanical science in principle their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants for purposes of scientific research conservation display and education although this will depend on resources available and special interests pursued at each particular garden origin of modern botanical gardens is generally traced to appointment of professors of botany to medical faculties of universities in 16th century renaissance italy which also entailed curation of a medicinal garden however objectives content and audience of today s botanic gardens more closely resembles that of grandiose gardens of antiquity and educational garden of theophrastus in lyceum of ancient athens early concern with medicinal plants changed in 17th century to an interest in new plant imports from explorations outside europe as botany gradually established its independence from medicine in 18th century systems of nomenclature and classification were devised by botanists working in herbaria and universities associated with gardens these systems often being displayed in gardens as educational order beds with rapid rise of european imperialism in late 18th century botanic gardens were established in tropics and economic botany became a focus with hub at royal botanic gardens kew near london over years botanical gardens as cultural and scientific organisations have responded to interests of botany and horticulture nowadays most botanical gardens display a mix of themes mentioned and more having a strong connection with general public there is opportunity to provide visitors

garden braunschweig germany victoria giant amazon water lily role of major botanical gardens worldwide has been considered so broadly similar as to fall within textbook definitions following definition was produced by staff of liberty hyde bailey of cornell university in 1976 it covers in some detail many functions and activities generally associated with botanical gardens a botanical garden is a controlled and staffed institution for maintenance of a living collection of plants under scientific management for purposes of education and research together with such libraries herbaria laboratories and museums as are essential to its particular undertakings each botanical garden naturally develops its own special fields of interests depending on its personnel location extent available funds and terms of its charter it may include greenhouses test grounds an herbarium an arboretum and other departments it maintains a scientific as well as a plant growing staff and publication is one of its major modes of expression this broad outline is then expanded botanic garden may be an independent institution a governmental operation or affiliated to a college or university if a department of an educational institution it may be related to a teaching program in any case it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands it is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden although it may be artistic nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on plants essential element is intention of enterprise which is acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge a contemporary botanic garden is a strictly protected natural urban green area where a managing organization creates landscaped gardens and holds documented collections of living plants and or preserved plant accessions containing functional units of heredity of actual or potential value for purposes such as scientific research education public display conservation sustainable use tourism and recreational activities production of marketable plant based products and services for improvement of human well being new royal horticultural society dictionary of gardening 1999 points out that among various kinds of organisations now known as botanical gardens are many public gardens with little scientific activity and it cites a more abbreviated definition that was published by world wildlife fund and iucn when launching botanic gardens conservation strategy in 1989 a botanic garden is a garden containing scientifically ordered and maintained collections of plants usually documented and labelled and open to public for purposes of recreation education and research this has been further reduced by botanic gardens conservation international to following definition which encompasses spirit of a true botanic garden a botanic garden is an institution holding documented collections of living plants for purposes of scientific research conservation display and education botanical gardens network thumb right singapore gardens by bay worldwide there are now about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 countries mostly in temperate regions of which about 550 are in europe 150 of which are in russia 200 in north america and an increasing number in east asia these gardens attract about 300 million visitors a year historically botanical gardens exchanged plants through publication of seed lists these were called in 18th century this was a means of transferring both plants and information between botanical gardens this system continues today although possibility of genetic piracy and transmission of invasive species has received greater attention in recent times international association of botanic gardens was formed in 1954 as a worldwide organisation affiliated to international union of biological sciences more recently coordination has also been provided by botanic gardens conservation international bgci which has mission to mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for well being of people and planet bgci has over 700 botanic 118 countries and strongly supports global strategy for plant conservation by producing a range resources and publications and by organizing international conferences and conservation programs communication also happens regionally in united states there is american public gardens association formerly american association of botanic gardens and arboreta and in australasia there is botanic gardens of australia and new zealand history and development history of botanical gardens is closely linked to history of botany itself botanical gardens of 16th and 17th centuries were medicinal gardens but idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of beautiful strange new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from european colonies and other distant lands later in 18th century they became more educational in function demonstrating latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures then in 19th and 20th centuries trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany precursors idea of scientific gardens used specifically for study of plants dates back to antiquity grand gardens of ancient history thumb hanging gardens of babylon with tower of babel in background a 16th century hand coloured engraving by martin heemskerck near eastern royal gardens set aside for economic use or display and containing at least some plants gained by special collecting trips or military campaigns abroad are known from second millennium bce in ancient egypt mesopotamia crete mexico and china in about 2800 bce chinese emperor shen sent collectors to distant regions searching for plants with economic or medicinal value it has also been suggested that spanish conquest of mesoamerica influenced history of botanical garden as gardens in tenochtitlan established by king also gardens in and elsewhere greatly impressed spanish invaders not only with their appearance but also because indigenous aztecs employed many more medicinal plants than did classical world of europe early medieval gardens in islamic spain resembled botanic gardens of future an example being 11th century huerta del ray garden of physician and author ibn wafid 999 1075 ce in toledo this was later taken over by garden chronicler ibn bassal fl 1085 ce until christian conquest in 1085 ce ibn bassal then founded a garden in seville most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included morocco persia sicily and egypt medical school of montpelier was also founded by spanish arab physicians and by 1250 ce it included a physic garden but site was not given botanic garden status until 1593 physic gardens botanical gardens in modern sense developed from physic gardens whose main purpose was to cultivate herbs for medical use as well as research and experimentation such gardens have a long history in europe for example aristotle 384 bce 322 bce is said to have had a physic garden in lyceum at athens which was used for educational purposes and for study of botany and this was inherited or possibly set up by his pupil theophrastus father of botany there is some debate among science historians whether this garden was ordered and scientific enough to be considered botanical and suggest it more appropriate to attribute earliest known botanical garden in europe to botanist and pharmacologist antonius castor mentioned by pliny elder in 1st century though these ancient gardens shared some of characteristics of present day botanical gardens forerunners of modern botanical gardens are generally regarded as being medieval monastic physic gardens that originated after decline of roman empire at time of emperor charlemagne 742 789 ce these contained a a garden used mostly for vegetables and another section set aside for specially labelled medicinal plants and this was called or more generally known as a physic garden and a or orchard these gardens were probably given impetus when charlemagne issued a capitulary capitulary de villis which listed 73 herbs to be used in physic gardens of his dominions many of these were found in british gardens even though they only occurred naturally in continental europe demonstrating earlier plant introduction pope nicholas v set aside part of vatican grounds in 1447 for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote teaching of botany and this was a forerunner to university gardens at padua and pisa established in 1540s

print of botanical garden of oldest academic botanic garden still at its original location in 17th century botanical gardens began their contribution to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants if a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection then first true botanical gardens were established with revival of learning that occurred in european renaissance these were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools used as resources for teaching and research superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations a factor that probably contributed to creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine origins in italian renaissance botanical gardens of southern europe were associated with university faculties of medicine and were founded in northern italy at orto botanico di pisa 1544 orto botanico di padova 1545 orto botanico di firenze 1545 orto botanico dell universita di pavia 1558 and orto botanico dell universita di bologna 1568 precisely dating foundation of botanical gardens is often difficult because government decrees may be issued some time before land is acquired and planting begins or existing gardens may be relocated to new sites or previously existing gardens may be taken over and converted here physicians referred to in english as apothecaries delivered lectures on mediterranean simples or that were being cultivated in grounds student education was no doubt stimulated by relatively recent advent of printing and publication of

east especially bulbous plants from turkey clusius laid foundations of dutch tulip breeding and bulb industry and he helped create one of earliest formal botanical gardens of europe at leyden where his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate this garden near its original site of leyden in 1601 was a perfect square divided into quarters for four continents but by 1720 though it was a rambling system of beds struggling to contain novelties rushing in and it became better known as his libri decem 1605 is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted

often labelled they were botanical gardens in sense of building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around world although their collection policies were determined by those in day to day charge of them they tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were indeed often under general parks administrations community engagement second half of 20th century saw increasingly sophisticated educational visitor service and interpretation services botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution ecology or taxonomy horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders plants from different parts of world special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants alpine plants cacti and orchids as well as traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants specialised gardens like in frankfurt germany 1869 one of world s leading orchid and succulent plant collections have been very popular there was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and

support this being especially true of botanical gardens attached to universities botanical gardens have always responded to interests and values of day if a single function were to be chosen from early literature on botanical gardens it would be their scientific endeavour and flowing from this their instructional value in their formative years botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and needs of general public scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities not by its living collections interest in economic plants now has less relevance and concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared while a fascination with curious beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish in recent times focus has been on creating an awareness of threat to earth s ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between world of botanical science and general public education programs can help
