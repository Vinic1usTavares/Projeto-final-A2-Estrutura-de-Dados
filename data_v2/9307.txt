lennon at college explaining that they were both extremely well educated and very eager for information harry organised a students film society where he showed orphee by jean cocteau and salvador dali and luis bunuel s l age d or meeting lennon had been a shock for harry as lennon often dressed like a teddy boy and was a disruptive influence at college despite his misgivings about lennon harry

echo about emerging liverpool music scene but neither paper was interested in stories about music that was popular with teenagers classified ads in liverpool echo for local groups were always under heading of jazz but paper refused to change this policy despite pleas from promoters and groups who actually paid for them harry planned to produce a jazz newspaper called storyville 52nd street and contacted sam leach owner of a club called storyville leach promised to fund newspaper but failed to turn up for three meetings with harry leaving him no other option but to find another investor harry thought starting a fortnightly newspaper covering liverpool s rock n roll music scene would be more successful and would differ from national music newspapers such as new musical express and melody maker which only wrote articles about current chart hits and artists mersey beat photographer dick matthews a friend from jacaranda heard about harry s problems with leach and introduced harry to a local civil servant jim anderson who lent harry ps50 this enabled harry to found mersey beat in 1961 harry decided to publish newspaper every two weeks covering music scene in liverpool wirral birkenhead new brighton crosby and southport as well as warrington widnes and runcorn he thought up name mersey beat by thinking about a policeman s beat area of duty which had nothing to do with a musical beat virginia gave up her accountancy operator job at woolworth s and worked full time for ps2 10 a week also contributing a mersey roundabout article while harry lived on his senior city art

instrument and record stores such as cramer lea rushworth draper and cranes paper released its first edition on 6 july 1961 selling out all 5 000 copies paper s circulation increased rapidly as harry started featuring stories about groups in manchester birmingham sheffield and newcastle with circulation growing to 75 000 as newspaper s sales rose it became known as teenagers bible local groups were soon being called beat groups and venues started advertising concerts as beat sessions with circulation rising paper s offices were moved downstairs to a larger two roomed office cavern club s doorman pat paddy delaney was employed to deliver copies a secretary pat finn was hired as well as raymond caine to promote advertising space harry later said newspapers television theatres and radio were all run by people of a different generation who had no idea of what youngsters wanted for decades they had manipulated and controlled them suddenly there was an awareness of being young and young people wanted their own styles and their own music just at time they were beginning to earn money which gave them spending power mersey beat was their voice it was a paper for them crammed with photos and information about their own groups which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout britain as its coverage extended to other areas because of employment situation in liverpool at time daily worker newspaper denounced enthusiasm of younger people in liverpool by saying mersey sound is sound of 30 000 people on dole liverpool groups between 1958 and 1964 merseyside area had about 500 different groups which were constantly forming and breaking up with an average of about 350 groups playing concerts on a regular basis in 1961 harry and cavern club s dj bob wooler compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of which had almost 300 names in 1962 mersey beat held a poll to find out who was most popular merseyside group when votes were counted rory storm hurricanes were in first place but after looking through postal votes again harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink in same handwriting and from same area of liverpool so dubious votes were declared void this was suspected to have been storm himself but harry had no idea that beatles had done exactly same thing results were announced on 4 january 1962 with beatles in first place results were printed in issue 13 of mersey beat on 4 january 1962 with front page announcing beatles top poll such was popularity of poll rushworth s music store manager bob hobbs presented lennon and george harrison with new guitars at time many groups in liverpool complained to harry that his newspaper should be called mersey beatles as he featured them so often harry asked a local singer priscilla white to contribute a fashion column after writing an article called swinging cilla in which he wrote cilla black is a liverpool girl who is starting out on road to fame harry s mistake came about because he could not remember her surname which he knew was a colour but white decided to keep it as a stage name two years later harry arranged for her to sing for epstein at blue angel club leading to a management contract in late 1962 harry wrote an article called take a look up north asking for a r men from london to travel up to liverpool and see what was really happening with music scene but not one record company sent an a r representative to liverpool journalist nancy spain once wrote an article for news of world newspaper stating that bill and virginia harry were mr mrs mersey beat and when bob dylan visited liverpool to appear at odeon he specifically asked for harry to act as his guide to city beatles and brian epstein harry often heard lennon mccartney and harrison rehearsing or playing in art college canteen in basement but after sutcliffe joined quarrymen harry complained that sutcliffe should be concentrating on art and not music as he thought he was a competent but not brilliant bassist as harry and sutcliffe were members of liverpool college of art s student union committee they put forward idea that college should buy its own p a system for college dances which quarrymen often played at but equipment would later be appropriated by group and taken to hamburg as late as 7 march 1962 students union sent pete mackey to ask lennon to either return equipment or pay for it but lennon told him it had been sold in hamburg harry asked lennon to write a short biography of beatles for first issue of mersey beat which harry titled being a short diversion on dubious origins of beatles translated from sic john lennon lennon was very grateful that harry printed his dubious origins piece without editing it and later gave harry a large collection of drawings poems and stories approximately 250 telling harry he was free to publish whatever he liked under pseudonym of which was appropriated from a daily express column beachcomber harry convinced epstein to sell 12 copies of first mersey beat newspaper at his north end music stores nems which sold out in one day resulting in epstein having to order more copies after ordering and selling 144 copies of second issue epstein invited harry to his office for a glass of sherry proposing idea that he epstein should write a record review column it was published in third issue on 3 august 1961 entitled stop world and listen to everything in it brian epstein of nems epstein saw numerous posters around liverpool advertising concerts by beatles as well as in second issue of mersey beat which had beatles sign recording contract on front cover as beatles had recorded my bonnie single with tony sheridan in germany some months after its release epstein supposedly as stated in his biography asked his assistant alistair taylor about single because a customer one raymond jones had asked epstein for single on 28 october 1961 which made epstein curious about group harry and mccartney repudiated this story as harry had been talking to epstein about beatles for a long time being group he promoted most in mersey beat and by mccartney saying brian epstein knew perfectly well who beatles were they were on front page of second issue of mersey beat beatles were due to perform a lunchtime concert at cavern club on 9 november 1961 not far from epstein s nems store epstein asked harry to arrange for him and taylor to watch beatles perform without queuing at door harry phoned owner ray mcfall who said he would inform doorman on day delaney to let epstein in epstein and taylor

a newspaper and wearing nothing but his underpants performing on stage with a toilet seat around his neck and one of mccartney sitting on a toilet after epstein became beatles manager lennon rushed into harry s office and asked for them back saying brian epstein insists i ve got to get them back pictures everything you ve got i must take it all with me now when epstein finally secured a recording contract with emi he sent harry a telegram from london to mersey beat office to announce news last issues and london on 13 september 1964 epstein approached harry to create a national music
