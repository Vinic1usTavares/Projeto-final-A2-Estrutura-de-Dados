guallatiri is a high volcano in chile it is located southwest of nevados de quimsachata volcanic group and is sometimes considered to be part of that group it is a stratovolcano with numerous fumaroles around summit summit may be composed of either a lava dome or a pyroclastic cone while lower flanks of volcano are covered by lava flows and lava domes volcano s eruptions have produced mostly dacite along with andesite and rhyolite guallatiri has been active in historical times with a number of eruptions latest in 1960 fumarolic and seismic activity is ongoing and has resulted in deposition of sulfur and other minerals on volcano volcano is covered by an ice cap above elevation guallatiri along with several other volcanoes is part of lauca national park geography guallatiri is located in putre commune of parinacota province in arica y parinacota region of chile towns of putre and are closest to volcano other nearby communities include ancuta and name of volcano comes from aymara meaning place of with meaning andean goose volcano is also known as guallatire and volcano is located in lauca national park along with two higher and parinacota volcanoes volcanoes parinacota guallatiri and form eastern limit of lauca basin sometimes guallatiri is considered to be part of nevados de quimsachata volcanic chain a long chain of volcanoes other volcanoes with historical phreatic phreatomagmatic activity in northern chile include irruputuncu isluga lascar and san pedro further fumarolic activity has been reported at alitar lastarria olca ollague putana and tacora geology thumb geological map of guallatiri guallatiri is a high complex volcano formed mainly by lava flows but also featuring dacitic or andesitic lava domes such as domo tinto on southern flank volcano is wide and above basement rocks total volume of volcano cannot be known with certainty as it varies but it amounts to between 40 86 cubic kilometers volcano s foot covers a surface of about summit is formed by a pyroclastic cone alternative interpretations see it as a lava dome or a hydrothermally altered scree covered lava plug vent lies south of summit and summit crater is breached westwards and northwards lava flows radiate from summit and lava domes dot its flanks some lava flows are up to long and high and thick lava flows are particularly noticeable on western and northern slope of volcano lava bombs are found on northern flanks probably carried there by glaciers other eruption products include ash flows and tephra layers former are particularly developed on south southwest flank and tephras particularly on southern eastern flanks guallatiri is underpinned by rocks of lauca formation which has an age of 10 0 5 million years an older basement domain known as lupica formation is exposed north west and south of volcano and contains sediments and volcanic rocks it is of oligocene miocene age like other volcanoes in area it formed on top of chilean altiplano guallatiri may have formed during pliocene with a second stage of volcanic activity recommencing during pleistocene volcano started forming about 710 000 years ago two stages of volcanic activity in pleistocene holocene have been identified although a three stage chronology of volcanic activity has been proposed as well this proposal envisages two earlier lavic stages and a third stage characterized by emission of pyroclastics and lava domes volcanic activity in quimsachata volcanic chain migrated south from now deeply eroded and volcano to more recent capurata and guallatiri volcanoes there is evidence indicating that lava flows forming stage i of volcanic activity were erupted during middle pleistocene and lava domes forming stage ii were erupted in pleistocene holocene lava bombs on northern flank suggest that eruptions which produced small amounts of rocks occurred in recent times glaciation and hydrology guallatiri has glaciers including one on summit and an ice cap above elevation it is most southern volcano in central andes with an ice cap as south of guallatiri tropical summer precipitation is insufficient to support glaciation only south of 27deg does winter precipitation become sufficient to support glaciers again fumaroles have melted holes in glaciers thin moraines are preserved on flanks at altitudes of these glaciers drain towards chungara river a number of streams and dry valleys originate on guallatiri parts of western and southern flank drain into rio lauca petrology guallatiri has erupted andesite dacite and rhyolite with dacite dominating pyroxene andesites are found up to of altitude analysis of lava at domo tinto lava dome has indicated that phenocrysts include amphibole biotite pyroxene and some apatite mafic inclusions have also been found in domo tinto rocks domo tinto eruption may have been triggered by injection of basaltic andesite into two magma chambers containing crystalline andesite native deposits of sulfur are also found and sulfur is most common mineral in fumarolic deposits but arsenic boron calcium and silicon are also found such fumarolic deposits at guallatiri and other andean volcano lastarria aside from pure sulfur also consist of anhydrite baryte cristobalite galena gypsum magnetite pyrite quartz and domo tinto rocks have been analyzed for isotope and chemical composition studies they are potassium rich calc alkaline rocks as is typical for andean volcanism in this area on basis of petrology magma temperatures of tinto rocks have been estimated at for andesitic component and for basaltic andesite component sio2 contents range from 58 to 75 with dacites having a content of 63 70 eruptive activity solfataric activity is ongoing in 1985 and 1987 yellow sulfur bearing steam clouds were reported reaching heights of above summit fumaroles cluster in two places in crater and on southern flank where they reach over down fumaroles are reported to make jet like noises and temperatures range from aster imaging has indicated temperature anomalies of up to 8 kelvins water vapour and carbon dioxide making up bulk of gases other components are hydrogen chloride hydrogen fluoride hydrogen sulfide methane and sulfur dioxide mud pots have also been observed likewise volcano features ongoing seismic activity including about two earthquakes per day and three seismic swarms in 2011 2012 another earthquake swarm was associated with 2001 peru earthquake no deformation of edifice has been observed however lava dome domo tinto was k ar dated at 5 000 3000 bp its eruption was probably a relatively tranquil effusive eruption present day volcanic activity is generally poorly documented with minor phreatic eruptions recorded ash eruptions are reported in first half of 19th century in 1913 and 1959 glow was observed in summit crater and a phreatic eruption was reported in 1960 activity is also reported for 1779 1802 1826 1831 1850 1859 1864 1864 1870 1902 1904 1908 1912 and 1959 guallatiri is one of northern chile s most active volcanoes in 2015 volcano alert levels on guallatiri was temporarily raised due to deformation of edifice and changes in seismic activity threats and preparedness chilean national geology and mining service keeps a record of regular reports of activity status of guallatiri which is considered to be chile s 27th most dangerous volcano a hazard map exists of guallatiri with three areas of different risk red zone occupies areas interested by late activity of volcano and river valleys in total most of upper parts of volcano orange and yellow zones are areas threatened in case of medium large and large scale eruptive activity respectively ash falls flank eruptions lahars and pyroclastic flows are hazards associated with guallatiri town of guallatiri on its southern flank is especially threatened as are southern and eastern flanks in general explosive activity with eruption columns of height may result in ashfall in arica and putre depending on season there are villages with hundreds of people including small villages in western bolivia that may be impacted by guallatiri tephra religious and archeological importance unlike on several other andean summits no inka archeological sites are visible on guallatiri perhaps discouraged by persistent volcanic activity it is said that townsfolk living in town of guallatire worshipped mountain from capurata a nearby mountain even today churches in ancuta and guallatire point towards volcano see also list of volcanoes in bolivia list of
