uss helena cl 50 was a light cruiser built for united states navy in late 1930s ninth and final member of class brooklyns were first modern light cruisers built by us navy under limitations of london naval treaty and they were intended to counter japanese as such they carried a battery of fifteen guns same gun armament carried by helena and her sister were built to a slightly modified design with a unit system of machinery and an improved anti aircraft battery completed in late 1939 first two years of helenas career consisted of peacetime training that accelerated as tensions between united states and japan increased through 1941 she was torpedoed at attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 and was repaired and modernized in early 1942 after returning to service helena was assigned to forces participating in guadalcanal campaign in south pacific there she took part in two major night battles with japanese vessels in october and november 1942 first battle of cape esperance on night of 11 12 october resulted in a japanese defeat with helenas rapid fire 6 inch battery helping to sink a heavy cruiser and a destroyer second first night of naval battle of guadalcanal in early hours of 13 november saw a similar defeat imposed on japanese again helenas fast shooting helped to overwhelm a japanese task force that included two fast battleships one of which was disabled by heavy american fire and sunk next day helena sank a destroyer and damaged several others in action while emerging relatively unscathed during her tour in south pacific she also escorted convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to marines fighting on guadalcanal and bombarded japanese positions on island and elsewhere in solomons following american victory on guadalcanal in early 1943 allied forces began preparations to advance along solomon chain first targeting new georgia helena took part in a series of preparatory attacks on island through mid 1943 culminating in an amphibious assault in kula gulf on 5 july next night while attempting to intercept a japanese reinforcement squadron helena was torpedoed and sunk in battle of kula gulf most of her crew were picked up by a pair of destroyers and one group landed on new georgia where they were evacuated next day but more than a hundred remained at sea for two days ultimately making land on japanese occupied vella lavella there they were hidden from japanese patrols by solomon islanders and a coastwatcher detachment before being evacuated on night of 15 16 july helenas wreck was located in 2018 by paul allen design thumb left helena at her launching ceremony as major naval powers negotiated london naval treaty in 1930 which contained a provision limiting construction of heavy cruisers armed with guns united states naval designers came to conclusion that with a displacement limited to a better protected vessel could be built with an armament of guns designers also theorized that much higher rate of fire of smaller guns would allow a ship armed with twelve of guns to overpower one armed with eight 8 inch guns during design process of which began immediately after treaty was signed us navy became aware that next class of japanese cruisers would be armed with a main battery of fifteen 6 inch guns prompting them to adopt same number of guns for brooklyns after building seven ships to original design additional changes were incorporated particularly to propulsion machinery and secondary battery resulting in st louis sub class of which helena was second member helena was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load ship was powered by four parsons steam turbines each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by eight oil fired babcock wilcox boilers unlike brooklyns two st louis class cruisers arranged their machinery in unit system alternating boiler and engine rooms rated at turbines were intended to give a top speed of ship had a cruising range of at a speed of she carried four curtiss soc seagull floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail her crew numbered 52 officers and 836 enlisted men ship was armed with a main battery of fifteen 6 in 47 caliber mark 16 guns in five 3 gun turrets on centerline three were placed forward two of which were placed in a superfiring pair facing forward with third being directly pointed aft other two turrets were placed aft of superstructure in another superfiring pair secondary battery consisted of eight 38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets with one turret on either side of conning tower and other pair on either side of aft superstructure as designed ship was equipped with an anti aircraft aa battery of eight guns but her anti aircraft battery was revised during her career ship s belt armor consisted of on a layer of of special treatment steel and her deck armor was thick main battery turrets were protected with faces and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick helenas conning tower had 5 inch sides modifications main prewar alterations to ship revolved around her anti aircraft battery in 1941 navy decided that each member of brooklyn class was to be equipped with four quadruple anti aircraft guns but guns were in short supply and helena was only member of class to have received any of her 1 1 in guns by november 1941 guns helena received were placed in mounts for 50 cal guns which were transferred to wheeled carts that could be moved to different firing positions ship was reconstructed in 1942 during repairs as a result of damage sustained in japanese attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 sg surface search radar sc air search radar and fc and fd fire control radar sets for her main and secondary batteries were installed along with a new anti aircraft battery of eight oerlikon cannon and sixteen bofors guns in quadruple mounts along with a director for each bofors mount her 1 1 in guns were removed to arm her sister ships and ship s armored conning tower had proved to inhibit good all around visibility so it was removed and an open bridge was erected in its place in addition weight savings achieved by removing tower helped to offset increased weight from larger anti aircraft battery conning tower along with those of several of brooklyn class cruisers that were also rebuilt in 1942 were later installed on reconstructed battleships that had been sunk at pearl harbor service history thumb helena in 1940 construction and early career us navy awarded contract for helena to new york navy yard on 9 september 1935 and keel for new ship was laid down on 9 december 1936 her completed hull was launched on 28 august 1938 and after completing fitting out she was commissioned into fleet on 14 december 1939 world war ii had broken out in europe in september that year but for time being united states remained neutral after entering service ship was occupied with sea trials and initial training and she embarked on a major shakedown cruise abroad on 27 december bound for south american waters she stopped in guantanamo bay an american leased naval base in cuba on way before arriving in buenos aires argentina on 22 january 1940 from there she continued on to montevideo uruguay on 29 january while in latter port crew inspected wreck of german heavy cruiser that had recently been scuttled after battle of river plate previous month helena got underway again in mid february to return to united states again passing through guantanamo bay on way after returning she was dry docked for repairs from 2 march to 14 july she took part in training exercises and sea trials over next several months until september when she was transferred to pacific fleet she passed through panama canal toward end of month and arrived in san pedro california on 3 october from there she continued on to pearl harbor hawaii to join rest of fleet arriving there on 21 october over course of next year fleet spent its time conducting training exercises and shooting practice as tensions with japan rose over latter s war against china during this period from 14 july 1941 to 16 september ship was dry docked for maintenance at mare island naval shipyard in california it was during this period that ship received her 1 1 inch guns helena was slated to be dry docked for another periodic maintenance in december 1941 and was moored in port with minelayer tied alongside on 6 december awaiting her turn in shipyard ships happened to be moored in berth normally reserved for battleship which was currently in dry dock ship s commander was at that time captain robert henry english world war ii attack on pearl harbor thumb helena center left at 1010 dock after attack oglala has been towed astern where she capsized smoke clouds from burning destroyers and rise in distance beyond helena while those from battleship are visible to right battleship is down by bow but has not yet sunk left on morning of 7 december japanese launched their surprise attack on american fleet with a first wave of forty nakajima b5n torpedo bombers fifty one aichi d3a dive bombers and fifty b5n high level bombers escorted by forty three mitsubishi a6m zero fighters japanese expected pennsylvania to be in her normal berth three minutes into attack which had begun at 07 55 a b5n torpedo bomber dropped its torpedo at what its pilot expected to be battleship torpedo passed underneath oglala and exploded against helenas hull on starboard side nearly amidships blast tore a hole in hull that flooded starboard engine and boiler rooms and severed wiring for main and secondary guns ship s crew raced to their battle stations and two minutes after torpedo hit backup forward diesel generator had been turned on restoring power to guns oglala was less fortunate than helena as blast effect loosened hull plates on minelayer and caused her to capsize first pilot had mistaken superimposed silhouettes of two ships backlit by sun to be pennsylvania second torpedo bomber in wave closed to within of helena and oglala when pilot realized first pilot s mistake breaking off his attack run and causing two more pilots to do same four other pilots pressed their attacks but all of their torpedoes missed by this time ship s anti aircraft guns were beginning to engage japanese attackers forcing one of bombers to drop their torpedo before they reached an ideal launch position one of torpedoes went wide and hit a transformer station while other three ran deep and embedded themselves in harbor floor during these attacks one of fighters strafed ship causing little damage at same time that first wave had begun their attacks japanese aircraft carriers launched a second wave consisting of eighty one dive bombers fifty four high level bombers and thirty six fighters as helenas anti aircraft guns got into action they helped to fend off further attacks from second strike wave while other men worked to control flooding by closing many watertight hatches in ship heavy anti aircraft fire was credited with disrupting aim of several japanese bombers which failed to hit vessel with an estimated four near misses of these one struck pier while other three landed in water on her starboard side helenas anti aircraft battery provided a heavy barrage of fire during attack she fired approximately 375 shells from her 5 inch guns around 3 000 rounds from her 1 1 inch guns and about 5 000 rounds from her 50 cal guns she was credited with shooting down six japanese aircraft out of a total of twenty nine aircraft downed in raid twenty six men were killed in initial attack and another five later died of their wounds while another sixty six were injured but recovered a significant number of casualties were result of torpedo hit with many of remainder from bomb fragments from near misses two days after attack helena was moved into dry dock no 2 in pearl harbor for an inspection and temporary repairs to allow her to return to west coast of united states steel plates were welded over torpedo hole and on 31 december helena was re floated she got underway for mare island for permanent repairs and modifications on 5 january 1942 in company with a convoy bound for california vessel arrived in shipyard on 13 january and was dry docked six days later repair work was completed by 4 july with initial sea trials taking place on 3 to 4 july only directors for 40 mm guns still en route from manufacturer were left to be fitted directors arrived shortly thereafter and were installed on 10 july helena then conducted a brief period of training that lasted until 15 july when she returned to mare island to have her sg radar installed she departed mare island later that month moving to san francisco where she joined six transports bound for south pacific transports carried a contingent of seabees to espiritu santo there helena joined task force tf 64 then in midst of fighting around guadalcanal guadalcanal campaign thumb helena on 1 july 1942 off mare island over course of next two months helena and rest of tf 64 were occupied with covering reinforcement convoys to support marines fighting on guadalcanal and escorting carrier battle groups in area while helena operated with carrier on 15 september a japanese submarine attacked fleet and hit wasp with three torpedoes inflicting fatal damage helena picked up some four hundred survivors from wasp and carried them back to espiritu santo shortly thereafter captain gilbert c hoover came aboard ship to replace english by this time task force consisted of helena her sister ship heavy cruisers and and destroyers and following actions along matanikau in late september and early october decision was made to send further reinforcements to island and so 164th infantry regiment of americal division embarked on a pair of destroyer transports tf 64 provided close escort for vessels screening them to west to prevent japanese forces from intercepting them by this time unit was commanded by rear admiral radm norman scott who conducted one night of battle practice with his ships on 8 october before embarking on operation ships patrolled to south just out of range of japanese aircraft based in rabaul over course of 9 and 10 october and each day at 12 00 scott took his ships north to rennell island where they would be in position to reach savo island to block a japanese squadron if it was detected by air on 11 october american aerial reconnaissance detected japanese vessels moving toward island carrying their own reinforcements and scott decided to try to intercept them battle of cape esperance thumb right map showing movements of goto s and jojima s forces during battle light gray line skirting savo island depicts goto s planned approach and exit route for bombardment mission hatsuyuki is misidentified as unknown to scott japanese had sent a group of cruisers and destroyers to bombard american garrison on guadalcanal this unit commanded by rear admiral aritomo goto consisted of heavy cruisers and and destroyers and as two squadrons approached each other in darkness at southern end of slot shortly before 22 00 on 11 october three of four american cruisers launched their floatplanes but helena did not receive instruction from scott aboard his flagship san francisco and so her crew dumped aircraft overboard to reduce risk of fire in event of a battle by 22 23 american ships had arranged themselves into a line in order farenholt duncan laffey san francisco boise salt lake city helena buchanan and mccalla this was despite fact that helena and boise both carried sg radar which was significantly more effective than sc sets carried by other vessels distance between each ship ranged from visibility was poor because moon had already set leaving no ambient light and no visible sea horizon helenas radar operators picked up oncoming japanese squadron at 23 25 fixing their position as being away at 23 32 shortly after helena initially detected japanese scott had reversed course of his ships steaming to southwest as goto s vessels steamed perpendicular to scott s course this would place american squadron in position to cross t of japanese formation officers aboard helena assumed that scott was aware of contacts based on his course reversal by 23 45 gunnery radar of american flagship finally detected japanese at a range of only which was confirmed by lookouts on american vessels hoover requested permission from scott to open fire and after receiving what he interpreted as an affirmative answer he ordered his guns to begin firing at 23 46 other ships in squadron quickly followed helenas example goto was at that time still unaware of americans presence and his ships were not prepared for action having assumed that after battle of savo island american naval forces would not challenge japanese warships at night initial salvos struck aoba inflicting serious damage and mortally wounding goto causing further confusion on japanese ships after only a minute of firing scott ordered his ships to cease firing because he was concerned they were accidentally shooting at leading trio of destroyers which had fallen out of formation during course reversal fire from american ships did not actually stop at this point and after clarifying position of his ships he ordered tf 64 to resume firing at 23 51 during this period captain of furutaka turned to port to escape heavy american fire but reversed course at 23 49 to come to aid this maneuver rewarded furutaka with numerous shell hits from several warships including helena at least one of which detonated torpedoes in her deck launchers and causing a major fire kinugasa also immediately turned to port but unlike furutaka her captain continued to withdraw along with hatsuyuki avoiding any damage to his vessel fubuki turned to a course parallel with american squadron initially targeted by san francisco and boise and set on fire fubuki then drew heavy fire from most of other vessels in confused close range action either helena or boise only ships armed with 6 inch guns accidentally hit farenholt causing flooding and a fuel leak that forced her to withdraw from battle at around midnight scott sought to reorganize his squadron to more effectively pursue japanese vessels he ordered his ships to flash their fighting lights and come back into formation at 00 06 lookouts aboard helena and boise spotted wakes of torpedoes that had been launched by kinugasa as she withdrew shortly thereafter kinugasa opened fire with her main battery inflicting serious damage to boise after a short duel between kinugasa and salt lake city scott broke off action as japanese continued to flee northeast despite having been hit more than forty times aoba survived battle though furutaka eventually succumbed to progressive flooding as did fubuki helena contributed to both vessels demise despite having defeated japanese bombardment force scott missed a second group of warships carrying reinforcements to guadalcanal and they were able to deposit their men and supplies without incident shortly after battle new fast battleship was transferred to tf 64 which now came under command of radm willis lee by this time unit also included helena san francisco light cruiser and six destroyers on 20 october helena came under attack from a japanese submarine while she patrolled between espiritu santo and san cristobal but torpedoes missed over course of 21 24 october japanese land based reconnaissance aircraft made repeated contacts with tf 64 as a japanese fleet approached area but in battle of santa cruz islands that began on 25th japanese concentrated their air attacks on american carriers of tf 17 and 61 and lee s ships saw no action on 4 november helena was back off guadalcanal to provide fire support during koli point action helena san francisco and destroyer shelled japanese positions as they came under attack from elements of 164th infantry regiment and 8th marines ultimately annihilating japanese defenders by 9 november naval battle of guadalcanal thumb approximate routes of japanese force under abe red line and u s force under callaghan black line as they head towards each other early on 13 november in ironbottom sound between savo island cape esperance and lunga point on guadalcanal green area near lunga point on guadalcanal marks location of henderson field in early november both sides began preparations to resupply their forces fighting on and around guadalcanal an american convoy carrying 5 500 soldiers and supplies was organized to be covered by tf 16 centered on carrier washington was detached from tf 64 to strengthen covering force and cruiser unit was reorganized as tf 67 4 and assigned as close escort commanded by radm daniel j callaghan unit now included in addition to helena heavy cruisers san francisco and light cruisers atlanta and and destroyers laffey sterett and overall command rested with radm richmond k turner meanwhile japanese had assembled a convoy of their own carrying 7 000 men and supplies for army already on guadalcanal it was to be supported by a bombardment force of two fast battleships a light cruiser and eleven destroyers a total of four heavy and one light cruisers and six destroyers would cover convoy on 12 november callaghan s ships and their transport vessels arrived off guadalcanal and while they unloaded a japanese artillery battery opened fire on transports helena and then some of destroyers returned fire to suppress japanese gunners a japanese airstrike interrupted work two ships were damaged but helena emerged unscathed reconnaissance aircraft detected approach of japanese bombardment force convoy and a detached group of destroyers turner believed that japanese aimed to either attach tf 67 4 and transports as they withdrew that night or to bombard americans on guadalcanal he decided to keep callaghan s unit off guadalcanal and to send convoy off with an escort of just three destroyers and two destroyer minesweepers as tf 16 was too far south to be able to reach area callaghan escorted convoy through channel before turning back west to position his ships between japanese squadron and garrison on guadalcanal approaching japanese force commanded by radm hiroaki abe centered on battleships and callaghan arranged his ships in a single column as scott had done at cape esperance and he similarly failed to realize advantage that sg radar equipped ships provided eschewing those vessels so equipped for san francisco scott had transferred to juneau which did mount an sg but it was placed as rearmost cruiser abe s ships reached area off cape esperance at around 01 25 on 13 november by which time his vessels had fallen into disarray due to bad weather that greatly hampered visibility destroyers he believed were screening his advance were in fact out of position abe was aware of callaghan s presence off guadalcanal earlier in day but did not know his current whereabouts at 01 30 he received a report from observers that there were no american vessels off lunga point leading him to order his ships to begin preparations for a bombardment by this time helena had already picked up abe s ships six minutes before at a distance of callaghan was not aware as san francisco had not yet detected japanese thumb left ironbottom sound between savo island center and guadalcanal left where majority of warship surface battle of 13 november took place both sides destroyers encountered each other at 01 42 continued confusion on callaghan s part led to contradictory orders that threw american squadron into disarray just as two forces collided in ensuing close range melee he ordered odd ships fire to starboard even ships fire to port although he had not assigned any numbering system beforehand abe received incomplete reports from his destroyers causing him to hesitate briefly before ordering his ships to open fire at 01 48 as american and japanese ships engaged each other in chaotic battle helena initially engaged destroyer disabling her searchlight but drawing return fire that did insignificant damage bombarded by several other vessels akatsuki exploded under heavy fire and quickly sank helena then shifted fire to destroyer at 02 04 only to be forced to check her fire when san francisco passed between two vessels helena nevertheless scored several hits that forced to disengage japanese destroyer was only saved from destruction by an attack by destroyers and that caused helena to engage them received a hit that disabled one of her boiler rooms forcing her to withdraw as well while was set on fire during this period one of her 40 mm guns fired at cruiser as she steamed in opposite direction helena then continued to maneuver among both sides burning vessels firing on a number of retreating japanese vessels as san francisco which had been badly damaged by hiei continued on through melee helena turned to follow her to try to protect her from further harm in course of 38 minute action american squadron was badly damaged and both callaghan and scott were killed in confused fighting latter by friendly fire from san francisco helena emerged relatively unscathed having received five hits that did negligible damage and killed one man two american destroyers were sunk three more were disabled as were two cruisers in return hiei was badly damaged and would later be scuttled after repeated american air attacks next day prevented her withdrawal one destroyer had been sunk and a second was badly damaged and more importantly callaghan s ships had prevented abe from bombarding airfield on guadalcanal hoover senior surviving officer in shattered american squadron ordered all vessels still in action to withdraw to southeast at 02 26 while japanese retreated in opposite direction hoover collected san francisco juneau sterett and o bannon and escorted them south at 11 00 japanese submarine fired a spread of torpedoes at san francisco that missed but one hit juneau torpedo detonated one of ship s magazines and combined with damage she had sustained previous night caused her to rapidly sink hoover decided that helena was too valuable to risk stopping to pick up what he assumed to be very few survivors and other vessels in group were too damaged to stop either he instead signaled to a passing b 17 bomber but report of fate was not delivered promptly preventing other vessels from attempting rescue operations admiral william halsey subsequently relieved hoover of command citing his failure to ensure a prompt report of sinking was made to attack submarine or to mount rescue operations after war halsey expressed regret over episode noting that hoover had been exhausted by previous night s fighting and that he had been motivated by need to preserve his ship and those under his temporary command captain charles p cecil replaced hoover as ship s commander operations in 1943 thumb left helena obscured by flash of her guns during a bombardment of munda in may 1943 beginning in january 1943 helena took part in several attacks on japanese positions on island of new georgia in preparation for planned new georgia campaign first of these took place from 1 to 4 january when helena still as part of tf 67 covered a group of seven transports carrying elements of 25th infantry division to guadalcanal unit at that time included six other cruisers and five destroyers and was commanded by radm walden l ainsworth ainsworth left four cruisers and three destroyers to cover convoy on 4th taking helena her sisters and and two destroyers to bombard munda in early hours of 5 january ships fired a total of some 4 000 shells but inflicted little significant damage to japanese airfield ships returned to guadalcanal at 09 00 and began recovering their reconnaissance floatplanes when a japanese airstrike arrived and damaged two of other cruisers though helena was not targeted ship had received new 5 inch shells fitted with proximity vt fuses and her use marked first time they were used successfully in combat helena and rest of her unit then returned to espiritu santo to refuel and replenish ammunition remaining there until morning of 22 january halsey had ordered ainsworth to make an attack on vila on island of kolombangara to neutralize airfield there and on 23 january he conducted a feint toward munda to throw off japanese aircraft who might have launched night torpedo attacks against his vessels as at munda ainsworth left a pair of cruisers and three destroyers to provide distant support while he took helena nashville and four destroyers into kula gulf to shell airstrip a black cat pby catalina provided spotting support while two cruisers fired around 3 500 shells from main and secondary gun inflicting significant damage on airfield and equipment japanese launched group of eleven floatplanes to scout for ainsworth s cruisers while a second group of thirty mitsubishi g4m bombers but american ships used rain squalls to evade floatplanes along with long range 5 inch fire directed by sc and fd radars to keep aircraft at bay at dawn a group of five p 38 fighters arrived to escort ships during their continued withdrawal thumb st louis left honolulu center and helena right off espiritu santo in june 1943 on 25 january helena and rest of squadron arrived back in espiritu santo helena continued to operate with tf 67 patrolling for japanese vessels and escorting convoys to guadalcanal as that campaign ground on into february she was present as part of distant support for convoy operation that resulted in battle of rennell island on 29 30 january but tf 64 was too far south to come to aid of tf 18 during action on 11 february submarine attempted to torpedo helena while cruising off espiritu santo but cruiser s escorting destroyers fletcher and o bannon sank submarine with assistance from one of helenas seagull floatplanes helena thereafter went to sydney australia on 28 february arriving there on 6 march for an overhaul she was taken to sutherland dock in cockatoo island dockyard on 15 march for repair work that lasted two days she then got underway on 26 march to return north to espiritu santo to resume bombardment operations against new georgia as part of what was now designated tf 68 helena arrived in espiritu santo on 30 march and rejoined ainsworth s unit as preparations for new georgia campaign increased ships made repeated patrols into slot ainsworth s cruisers were also occupied with extensive training for upcoming operations while off guadalcanal refueling from a tanker helena received instructions to get underway as quickly as possible as a large japanese airstrike was detected on radar she and rest of cruiser unit steamed to northwest of savo island to avoid raid they escaped damage but attack forced americans to cancel planned cruiser patrol that night on night of 12 13 may ainsworth took his cruisers to shell vila and munda helena was tasked with bombarding former and she fired a total of 1 000 shells at island during attack invasion of new georgia began on 30 june helena and rest of tf 68 patrolled at northern end of coral sea at that time she cruised with st louis honolulu and their escorting destroyer screen that consisted of o bannon and by 1 july ships were about south of new georgia and on 3 july they reached tulagi where a false report of a japanese airstrike briefly sent ships crews to their battle stations allied plan called for a second landing on new georgia in kula gulf on northeastern side of island a landing here would block resupply route for japanese forces fighting on island and it would also deny their use of gulf to escape once they were defeated as they had done on guadalcanal landing at rice anchorage thumb helena right underway with st louis left and honolulu center behind helena in june 1943 having attacked japanese positions around kula gulf on several occasions ainsworth knew that japanese would be expecting further attacks as new georgia campaign got underway he instructed cruiser commanders to expect japanese naval forces to intervene to be prepared to evacuate damaged ships and if necessary to beach badly damaged vessels in rice anchorage on 4 july american invasion force assault troops loaded aboard destroyer transports departed tulagi at 15 47 with honolulu in lead followed by st louis and helena four destroyers took up positions around them to screen for submarines while destroyer transports sailed independently at same time a group of three japanese destroyers and left bougainville with a contingent of 1 300 infantry aboard to reinforce garrison on new georgia nicholas and strong reached kula gulf first scanning it with their radar and sonar sets to determine if any japanese warships were in area cruisers and other two destroyers then entered gulf to prepare to bombard japanese positions at vila honolulu opened fire first 00 26 on 5 july and cecil ordered helenas gunners to follow suit ninety seconds later black cats circling overhead coordinated ships fire other vessels quickly joined in bombardment which lasted about fourteen minutes before american column turned east to move to rice anchorage to shell targets there after six minutes of shooting ships departed helena having fired over a thousand rounds of 6 and 5 inch shells in two bombardments during latter period helenas crew noted shell splashes from japanese artillery batteries near ship but none of american vessels were hit unbeknownst to americans three japanese destroyers had arrived in gulf while they were still shooting illuminated by gun flashes american vessels were quickly identified by japanese over away thumb left helena in south pacific 1943 transport group then entered gulf and steamed close to shore to prevent intermingling with ainsworth s squadron which had turned north at 12 39 to leave gulf captain kanaoka senior destroyer commander in charge of reinforcement operation decided to withdraw as well to avoid engaging a superior force with his ships loaded with soldiers and supplies niizuki only radar equipped destroyer directed aim of all three vessels which launched a total of fourteen long lance torpedoes before withdrawing at high speed to escape back to bougainville one of these torpedoes struck strong which was still stationed at entrance of gulf on sentry duty destroyer was fatally damaged but attack alerted ainsworth that there were japanese warships in area o bannon and chevalier were detached to pick up survivors while ainsworth prepared to search for submarine he assumed to have been responsible as none of his ships had detected three japanese destroyers on their radars strong sank at 01 22 with 239 of her crew taken off by other destroyers though some additional survivors were missed in darkness and were later picked up by transport group ainsworth s ships then resumed their cruising formation at 02 15 for voyage back to tulagi during bombardment shell hoist for left gun in turret no 5 broke down while propellant cases repeatedly jammed in turret no 2 work on turrets began immediately as vessels steamed back to tulagi ammunition hoist was quickly restored to working order but gun in turret no 2 took more than five hours of work before jammed case could be removed and replaced with a modified short case that allowed shell that was still in gun to be fired clearing it for normal use at 07 00 destroyer joined squadron which reached tulagi in early afternoon where ships immediately began refueling shortly thereafter ainsworth received orders from halsey to return to kula gulf as reconnaissance aircraft had spotted japanese destroyers departing from bougainville to attempt planned reinforcement run that he had inadvertently disrupted night before ainsworth was to intercept destroyers and prevent landing of more japanese forces on island he ordered ships to end refueling and prepare to get underway jenkins replaced strong and destroyer took place of chevalier which had been damaged in an accidental collision with sinking strong battle of kula gulf thumb helena in action at kula gulf seen from light cruiser note bright flashes of gunfire are due to use of older gunpowder for main armament these flashes gave japanese a target for their torpedoes since previous night s reinforcement run had been aborted japanese assembled a group of ten destroyers to make a larger effort next night niizuki now flagship of rear admiral teruo akiyama and destroyers and were to escort other seven destroyers nagatsuki hatsuyuki and carried 2 400 troops and supplies meanwhile american force intending to block their advance had formed up by 19 30 and began voyage back up slot as americans steamed toward kula gulf crews got their vessels ready for action including closing all of watertight doors to reduce risk of flooding and turning off all lights to prevent detection by japanese american squadron passed point at entrance to gulf early on 6 july at which point vessels reduced speed to visibility was poor owing to heavy cloud cover ainsworth had no information as to specific composition or location of japanese force and patrolling black cats could not detect them in conditions japanese destroyers had already entered gulf and begun unloading their cargoes niizuki detected american ships on her radar at 01 06 at a range of about akiyama took his flagship suzukaze and to observe americans at 01 43 while other destroyers continued to disembark soldiers and supplies by that time ainsworth s ships had already detected three ships off kolombangara at 01 36 as two sides continued to close akiyama recalled other destroyers to launch an attack american vessels transitioned into a line ahead formation with nicholas and o bannon ahead of cruisers line turned left to close range to japanese vessels before turning right to move toward an advantageous firing position american radars picked up akiyama s escort detachment along with another group of destroyers that was racing to join him ainsworth decided to attack first group and then turn about to engage second at about 01 57 american vessels opened up with radar directed rapid fire between three cruisers they fired around close to 1 500 shells from their 6 inch batteries in span of just five minutes helena quickly expended flashless propellant charges that had been kept after previous night s bombardment mission thereafter transitioning to normal smokeless propellant which created large flashes every time guns fired helena initially targeted leading destroyer niizuki with her main battery while her 5 inch guns engaged following vessel niizuki also received heavy fire from other american ships and was quickly sunk taking akiyama down with her helena then shifted fire to next closest vessel but by that time suzukaze and tanikaze had both launched eight torpedoes at american line they then fled to northwest using heavy smoke to conceal themselves while their crews reloaded their torpedo tubes both destroyers received minor hits during their temporary withdrawal but were not seriously damaged thumb us navy damage report drawing of torpedo damage to helena ainsworth instructed his ships to turn to right at 02 03 to begin engaging second group of destroyers but shortly thereafter three of or torpedoes struck helena on port side inflicting serious damage first torpedo hit about from bow abreast of forward most turret about below waterline it caused a major explosion that may have been result of a magazine detonation blast destroyed no 1 turret tore open hull almost to keel and severed bow from rest of hull rest of hull began to flood as force of blast collapsed bulkheads below turret no 2 but even after severe damage inflicted by first torpedo aft main guns continued to fire and ship had not yet been fatally damaged she remained able to steam at 25 knots despite increased drag two minutes after first torpedo hit second and third torpedoes struck ship in quick succession much lower in hull than first had hit as much as below waterline this was below where ship s belt armor might have reduced scale of damage inflicted these hit further aft in machinery spaces breaking keel flooding forward engine and boiler rooms and breaching bulkheads that allowed water into aft engine room flooding disabled ship s engines and left her immobilized and without electrical power another gaping hole had been blasted into hull which exacerbated flooding caused by first hit it quickly became clear that helena would not be able to survive these hits and two minutes after third hit cecil gave order to abandon ship he remained on bridge with a signalman who attempted to flash a distress message with a signal lamp to no avail cecil then ordered another man to dump classified documents overboard before he ordered those still on bridge to evacuate as well with keel having been broken by second and third hit girders that supported hull structure began to buckle collapsing entire structure amidships and breaking hull in half center third of ship quickly sank but bow and stern remained afloat for some time before flooding caused them both to point upward as they filled with water ainsworth and other vessels captains were not immediately aware that helena had been disabled owing to course change general confusion that resulted from heavy smoke and gunfire during battle and fact that most attention was directed at oncoming second group of japanese destroyers in ensuing action several of japanese destroyers were hit and forced to disengage after which ainsworth attempted to reorganize his force at around 02 30 he quickly realized that helena was not responding to radio messages and ordered his ships to begin searching for missing cruiser at 03 13 radar picked up a contact some away destroyer closed with it and confirmed it was helenas bow pointing up out of water survivors thumb radford steaming into tulagi with 444 men from helena aboard ainsworth ordered radford to immediately begin search for survivors and shortly thereafter instructed nicholas to join rescue operation ainsworth ordered destroyers to proceed to russell islands by dawn to avoid being attacked by japanese aircraft remaining pair of destroyers screened honolulu and st louis as they withdrew to avoid possibility of a retaliatory japanese air attack nearly a thousand men were in water clinging to life rafts and waiting to be picked up by destroyers which reached men at 03 41 some men had brought flashlights when they abandoned helena to signal their position to destroyers as destroyers moved into position their crews hung nets over sides for survivors to climb but shortly after rescue effort began nicholas radar operators detected a contact approaching at high speed both she and radford broke off rescue operation to prepare to engage suzukaze and tanikaze both of which had turned northwest to reload their tubes after torpedoing helena they had returned southeast to search for niizuki but after failing to locate her they withdrew having come within of nicholas with japanese destroyers having departed nicholas and radford returned to resume rescue operations at 04 15 destroyers lowered their whaleboats to assist with search for survivors at 05 15 destroyers radar sets picked up amagiri approaching latter was also searching for niizuki when lookouts spotted two american destroyers amagiri turned to engage as nicholas and radford did same nicholas and amagiri launched torpedoes at each other before closing and engaging with guns before amagiri broke off and disengaged to west during short engagement whaleboats continued to search for helena survivors at around 06 00 destroyers had returned but another radar contact mochizuki again prompted their departure a short skirmish at long range produced no results apart from further delaying rescue operations in light of ainsworth s order to avoid being caught by japanese aircraft and with daylight fast approaching nicholas and radford withdrew leaving four of their whaleboats behind to help ferry men to american positions on new georgia in course of night s operations nicholas had picked up 291 while radford had rescued 444 cecil who had survived sinking and refused to be pulled aboard one of destroyers instead took command of whaleboats that remained behind he supervised loading of three of boats fourth had broken its rudder and was of little use to ensure that none became overloaded and capsized and directed their route out of gulf each whaleboat pulled a raft cecil sought to bring flotilla away from japanese occupied kolombangara to avoid drawing enemy fire after sailing for much of day boats finally reached a beach thought to be near american lines so boats got as close to shore as they could and men waded ashore they had landed at a small peninsula on northwestern side of new georgia some seven miles north of american lines men remained there overnight as it was too late to try to pass through dense jungle in meantime another pair of destroyers and arrived in kula gulf to search for survivors from helena early on morning of 6 july they combed waters at mouth of gulf before observers aboard destroyers spotted men on beach gwin sailed as close to beach as she could get at 07 45 while woodworth covered her approach after setting fire to whaleboats helena survivors 88 men in total were picked up by gwin and arrived back in tulagi at 15 20 that day thumb left map of new georgia island group showing new georgia kolombangara and vella lavella upright 1 5 a significant number of men were still in water some life rafts remained in area while a number of men had climbed onto still floating bow or clung to pieces of floating wreckage a b 24 liberator heavy bomber passed area at low altitude to search for survivors and its pilot reported seeing men who had climbed aboard floating bow along with other groups in water bomber also dropped three life rafts one of which sank survivors were subjected to brutal conditions while at sea few provisions no shelter from sun and no warmth at night when temperatures plummeted as day wore on a group of about 50 men took two rafts in an attempt to reach kolombangara but current proved to be too strong for them to overcome as day wore on groups of men began to drift apart men in one of rafts rigged an improvised sail in an attempt to reach vella lavella next island to west of kolombangara other groups of men were pulled there by current as men reached coral reef that surrounded island on 8 july they were met by locals who helped pull men to shore and put them in contact with coastwatcher station coastwatchers organized a relief effort to bring men inland to avoid japanese garrison and patrols that routinely swept coastal areas solomon islanders gathered groups of men as they made landfall over course of late 7 to early 8 july and took some of them 104 in total to house of a chinese merchant in interior of island others were collected at two different points on island to hide men from japanese these two groups numbered 50 and 11 respectively coastwatchers contacted their superior on guadalcanal and informed him of situation on island turner s staff there immediately began making plans to launch a rescue operation though number of men to be retrieved from an enemy occupied island complicated effort as typical methods via submarine or pt boat would not be able to accommodate 165 men on vella lavella they settle on using a pair of destroyer transports to evacuate men escorted by eight destroyers allied naval forces had not yet penetrated as far as vella lavella during campaign which brought them dangerously close to strong japanese naval and air forces plan called for two smaller groups both of which were located further north than main group to meet inland and proceed to coast where they would signal waiting transports main group of survivors would proceed to a different evacuation point operation was initially planned for 12 july but reports that japanese vessels were operating in area forced a postponement until night of 15 july and led to second battle of kula gulf four destroyers took up a defensive position to northwest to block a possible attack by japanese forces while rest of force steamed to south of kolombangara and then north through vella gulf at 01 55 on 16 july men flashed recognition signal to waiting transports which lowered three higgins boats to ferry men to vessels along with helena survivors boats evacuated a downed american pilot and a captured japanese pilot before units moved south to other evacuation point again higgins boats ferried group to transports along with several chinese merchants and their families flotilla arrived back in tulagi that afternoon and disembarked survivors who were then transferred to french colony of new caledonia where they met men who had been pulled from water on night of sinking out of a crew of almost 1 200 168 men were killed either during battle or while men were adrift aftermath a memorial was erected in helena montana to commemorate both cruisers named helena cl 50 and including artifacts from both vessels wreck was discovered on 11 april 2018 by research ship operated by paul allen during an expedition to solomons to search for wrecks of warships sunk during fighting there allen confirmed
