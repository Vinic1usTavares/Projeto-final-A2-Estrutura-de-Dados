a genetically modified organism gmo is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques exact definition of a genetically modified organism and what constitutes genetic engineering varies with most common being an organism altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and or natural recombination a wide variety of organisms have been genetically modified gm from animals to plants and microorganisms genes have been transferred within same species across species creating transgenic organisms and even across kingdoms new genes can be introduced or endogenous genes can be enhanced altered or knocked out creating a genetically modified organism is a multi step process genetic engineers must isolate gene they wish to insert into host organism and combine it with other genetic elements including a promoter and terminator region and often a selectable marker a number of techniques are available for inserting isolated gene into host genome recent advancements using genome editing techniques notably crispr have made production of gmo s much simpler herbert boyer and stanley cohen made first genetically modified organism in 1973 a bacteria resistant to antibiotic kanamycin first genetically modified animal a mouse was created in 1974 by rudolf jaenisch and first plant was produced in 1983 in 1994 flavr savr tomato was released first commercialized genetically modified food first genetically modified animal to be commercialized was glofish 2003 and first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was aquadvantage salmon in 2015 bacteria are easiest organisms to engineer and have been used for research food production industrial protein purification including drugs agriculture and art there is potential to use them for environmental purposes or as medicine fungi have been engineered with much same goals viruses play an important role as vectors for inserting genetic information into other organisms this use is especially relevant to human gene therapy there are proposals to remove virulent genes from viruses to create vaccines plants have been engineered for scientific research to create new colors in plants deliver vaccines and to create enhanced crops genetically modified crops are publicly most controversial gmos majority are engineered for herbicide tolerance or insect resistance golden rice has been engineered with three genes that increase its nutritional value other prospects for gm crops are as bioreactors for production of biopharmaceuticals biofuels or medicines animals are generally much harder to transform and vast majority are still at research stage mammals are best model organisms for humans making ones genetically engineered to resemble serious human diseases important to discovery and development of treatments human proteins expressed in mammals are more likely to be similar to their natural counterparts than those expressed in plants or microorganisms livestock are modified with intention of improving economically important traits such as growth rate quality of meat milk composition disease resistance and survival genetically modified fish are used for scientific research as pets and as a food source genetic engineering has been proposed as a way to control mosquitos a vector for many deadly diseases although human gene therapy is still relatively new it has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency and leber s congenital amaurosis many objections have been raised over development of gmo s particularly their commercialization many of these involve gm crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on environment other concerns are objectivity and rigor of regulatory authorities contamination of non genetically modified food control of food supply patenting of life and use of intellectual property rights although there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food gm food safety is a leading issue with critics gene flow impact on non target organisms and escape are major environmental concerns countries have adopted regulatory measures to deal with these concerns there are differences in regulation for release of gmos between countries with some of most marked differences occurring between us and europe one of key issues concerning regulators is whether gm food should be labeled and status of gene edited organisms definition what constitutes a genetically modified organism gmo is not always clear and can vary widely at its broadest it can include anything that has had its genes altered including by nature taking a less broad view it can encompass every organism that has had its genes altered by humans which would include all crops and livestock in 1993 encyclopedia britannica defined genetic engineering as any of a wide range of techniques among them artificial insemination in vitro fertilization e g test tube babies sperm banks cloning and gene manipulation european union eu included a similarly broad definition in early reviews specifically mentioning gmos being produced by selective breeding and other means of artificial selection staff economic impacts of genetically modified crops on agri food sector p 42 glossary term and definitions european commission directorate general for agriculture genetic engineering manipulation of an organism s genetic endowment by introducing or eliminating specific genes through modern molecular biology techniques a broad definition of genetic engineering also includes selective breeding and other means of artificial selection retrieved 5 november 2012 they later excluded traditional breeding in vitro fertilization induction of polyploidy mutagenesis and cell fusion techniques that do not use recombinant nucleic acids or a genetically modified organism in process a narrower definition provided by food and agriculture organization world health organization and european commission says that organisms must be altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and or natural recombination there are examples of crops that fit this definition but are not normally considered gmos for example grain crop triticale was fully developed in a laboratory in 1930 using various techniques to alter its genome cartagena protocol on biosafety in 2000 used synonym living modified organism and defined it as any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained through use of modern biotechnology secretariat of convention on biological diversity montreal 2000 cartagena protocol on biosafety to convention on biological diversity modern biotechnology is further defined as in vitro nucleic acid techniques including recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid dna and direct injection of nucleic acid into cells or organelles or fusion of cells beyond taxonomic family genetically engineered organism geo can be considered a more precise term compared to gmo when describing organisms genomes that have been directly manipulated with biotechnology term gmo originally was not typically used by scientists to describe genetically engineered organisms until after usage of gmo became common in popular media united states department of agriculture usda considers gmos to be plants or animals with heritable changes introduced by genetic engineering or traditional methods while geo specifically refers to organisms with genes introduced eliminated or rearranged using molecular biology particularly recombinant dna techniques such as definitions focus on process more than product which means there could be gmos and non gmos with very similar genotypes and phenotypes this has led scientists to label it as a scientifically meaningless category saying that it is impossible to group all different types of gmos under one common definition it has also caused issues for organic institutions and groups looking to ban gmos it also poses problems as new processes are developed current definitions came in before genome editing became popular and there is some confusion as to whether they are gmos eu has adjudged that they are changing their gmo definition to include organisms obtained by mutagenesis in contrast usda has ruled that gene edited organisms are not considered gmos production thumb upright a gene gun uses biolistics to insert dna into plant tissue alt creating a genetically modified organism gmo is a multi step process genetic engineers must isolate gene they wish to insert into host organism this gene can be taken from a cell or artificially synthesized if chosen gene or donor organism s genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library gene is then combined with other genetic elements including a promoter and terminator region and a selectable marker a number of techniques are available for inserting isolated gene into host genome bacteria can be induced to take up foreign dna usually by exposed heat shock or electroporation dna is generally inserted into animal cells using microinjection where it can be injected through cell s nuclear envelope directly into nucleus or through use of viral vectors in plants dna is often inserted using agrobacterium mediated recombination biolistics or electroporation as only a single cell is transformed with genetic material organism must be regenerated from that single cell in plants this is accomplished through tissue culture in animals it is necessary to ensure that inserted dna is present in embryonic stem cells further testing using pcr southern hybridization and dna sequencing is conducted to confirm that an organism contains new gene traditionally new genetic material was inserted randomly within host genome gene targeting techniques which creates double stranded breaks and takes advantage on cells natural homologous recombination repair systems have been developed to target insertion to exact locations genome editing uses artificially engineered nucleases that create breaks at specific points there are four families of engineered nucleases zinc finger nucleases transcription activator like effector nucleases talens and cas9 system adapted from crispr talen and crispr are two most commonly used and each has its own advantages talens have greater target specificity while crispr is easier to design and more efficient history right thumb upright herbert boyer pictured and stanley cohen created first genetically modified organism in 1973 humans have domesticated plants and animals since around 12 000 bce using selective breeding or artificial selection as contrasted with natural selection process of selective breeding in which organisms with desired traits and thus with desired genes are used to breed next generation and organisms lacking trait are not bred is a precursor to modern concept of genetic modification various advancements in genetics allowed humans to directly alter dna and therefore genes of organisms in 1972 paul berg created first recombinant dna molecule when he combined dna from a monkey virus with that of lambda virus herbert boyer and stanley cohen made first genetically modified organism in 1973 they took a gene from a bacterium that provided resistance to antibiotic kanamycin inserted it into a plasmid and then induced other bacteria to incorporate plasmid bacteria that had successfully incorporated plasmid was then able to survive in presence of kanamycin boyer and cohen expressed other genes in bacteria this included genes from toad xenopus laevis in 1974 creating first gmo expressing a gene from an organism of a different kingdom left thumb upright in 1974 rudolf jaenisch created first genetically modified animal in 1974 rudolf jaenisch created a transgenic mouse by introducing foreign dna into its embryo making it world s first transgenic animal however it took another eight years before transgenic mice were developed that passed transgene to their offspring genetically modified mice were created in 1984 that carried cloned oncogenes predisposing them to developing cancer mice with genes removed termed a knockout mouse were created in 1989 first transgenic livestock were produced in 1985 and first animal to synthesize transgenic proteins in their milk were mice in 1987 mice were engineered to produce human tissue plasminogen activator a protein involved in breaking down blood clots in 1983 first genetically engineered plant was developed by michael w bevan richard b flavell and mary dell chilton they infected tobacco with agrobacterium transformed with an antibiotic resistance gene and through tissue culture techniques were able to grow a new plant containing resistance gene gene gun was invented in 1987 allowing transformation of plants not susceptible to agrobacterium infection in 2000 vitamin a enriched golden rice was first plant developed with increased nutrient value in 1976 genentech first genetic engineering company was founded by herbert boyer and robert swanson a year later company produced a human protein somatostatin in e coli genentech announced production of genetically engineered human insulin in 1978 insulin produced by bacteria branded was approved for release by food and drug administration in 1982 in 1988 first human antibodies were produced in plants in 1987 a strain of pseudomonas became first genetically modified organism to be released into news 14 june 2002 gm crops a bitter harvest when a strawberry and potato field in california were sprayed with it thomas h maugh ii for los angeles times 9 june 1987 altered bacterium does its job frost failed to damage sprayed test crop company says first genetically modified crop an antibiotic resistant tobacco plant was produced in 1982 china was first country to commercialize transgenic plants introducing a virus resistant tobacco in 1992 in 1994 attained approval to commercially release flavr savr tomato first genetically modified food also in 1994 european union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to herbicide making it first genetically engineered crop commercialized in europe an insect resistant potato was approved for release in us in 1995 genetically altered potato ok d for crops lawrence journal world 6 may 1995 and by 1996 approval had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop carnation in 6 countries plus eu in 2010 scientists at j craig venter institute announced that they had created first synthetic bacterial genome they named it and it was world s first synthetic life form first genetically modified animal to be commercialized was glofish a zebra fish with a fluorescent gene added that allows it to glow in dark under ultraviolet light it was released to us market in 2003 in 2015 aquadvantage salmon became first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use approval is for fish raised in panama and sold in us salmon were transformed with a growth hormone regulating gene from a pacific chinook salmon and a promoter from an ocean pout enabling it to grow year round instead of only during spring and summer bacteria bacteria were first organisms to be genetically modified in laboratory due to relative ease of modifying their chromosomes this ease made them important tools for creation of other gmos genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be added to a plasmid and inserted into bacteria for storage and modification bacteria are cheap easy to grow clonal multiply quickly and can be stored at 80 degc almost indefinitely once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research a large number of custom plasmids make manipulating dna extracted from bacteria relatively easy their ease of use has made them great tools for scientists looking to study gene function and evolution simplest model organisms come from bacteria with most of our early understanding of molecular biology coming from studying escherichia coli scientists can easily manipulate and combine genes within bacteria to create novel or disrupted proteins and observe effect this has on various molecular systems researchers have combined genes from bacteria and archaea leading to insights on how these two diverged in past in field of synthetic biology they have been used to test various synthetic approaches from synthesising genomes to creating novel nucleotides bacteria have been used in production of food for a long time and specific strains have been developed and selected for that work on an industrial scale they can be used to produce enzymes amino acids flavourings and other compounds used in food production with advent of genetic engineering new genetic changes can easily be introduced into these bacteria most food producing bacteria are lactic acid bacteria and this is where majority of research into genetically engineering food producing bacteria has gone bacteria can be modified to operate more efficiently reduce toxic byproduct production increase output create improved compounds and remove unnecessary pathways food products from genetically modified bacteria include alpha amylase which converts starch to simple sugars which clots milk protein for cheese making and which improves fruit juice clarity panesar et al 2010 enzymes in food processing fundamentals and potential applications chapter 10 i k international publishing house majority are produced in us and even though regulations are in place to allow production in europe as of 2015 no food products derived from bacteria are currently available there genetically modified bacteria are used to produce large amounts of proteins for industrial use generally bacteria are grown to a large volume before gene encoding protein is activated bacteria are then harvested and desired protein purified from them high cost of extraction and purification has meant that only high value products have been produced at an industrial scale majority of these products are human proteins for use in medicine many of these proteins are impossible or difficult to obtain via natural methods and they are less likely to be contaminated with pathogens making them safer first medicinal use of gm bacteria was to produce protein insulin to treat diabetes other medicines produced include clotting factors to treat haemophilia human growth hormone to treat various forms of dwarfism interferon to treat some cancers erythropoietin for anemic patients and tissue plasminogen activator which dissolves blood clots outside of medicine they have been used to produce biofuels summers rebecca 24 april 2013 bacteria churn out first ever petrol like biofuel new scientist retrieved 27 april 2013 there is interest in developing an extracellular expression system within bacteria to reduce costs and make production of more products economical with greater understanding of role that microbiome plays in human health there is potential to treat diseases by genetically altering bacteria to themselves be therapeutic agents ideas include altering gut bacteria so they destroy harmful bacteria or using bacteria to replace or increase deficient enzymes or proteins one research focus is to modify lactobacillus bacteria that naturally provide some protection against hiv with genes that will further enhance this protection if bacteria do not form colonies inside patient person must repeatedly ingest modified bacteria in order to get required doses enabling bacteria to form a colony could provide a more long term solution but could also raise safety concerns as interactions between bacteria and human body are less well understood than with traditional drugs there are concerns that horizontal gene transfer to other bacteria could have unknown effects as of 2018 there are clinical trials underway testing efficacy and safety of these treatments for over a century bacteria have been used in agriculture crops have been inoculated with rhizobia and more recently to increase their production or to allow them to be grown outside their original habitat application of bacillus thuringiensis bt and other bacteria can help protect crops from insect infestation and plant diseases with advances in genetic engineering these bacteria have been manipulated for increased efficiency and expanded host range markers have also been added to aid in tracing spread of bacteria bacteria that naturally colonize certain crops have also been modified in some cases to express bt genes responsible for pest resistance pseudomonas strains of bacteria cause frost damage by water into ice crystals around themselves this led to development of ice minus bacteria that have ice forming genes removed when applied to crops they can compete with non modified bacteria and confer some frost resistance thumb this artwork is made with bacteria modified to express 8 different colors of fluorescent proteins other uses for genetically modified bacteria include bioremediation where bacteria are used to convert pollutants into a less toxic form genetic engineering can increase levels of enzymes used to degrade a toxin or to make bacteria more stable under environmental conditions has also been created using genetically modified bacteria in 1980s artist jon davis and geneticist dana boyd converted germanic symbol for femininity z into binary code and then into a dna sequence which was then expressed in escherichia coli this was taken a step further in 2012 when a whole book was encoded onto dna paintings have also been produced using bacteria transformed with fluorescent proteins viruses viruses are often modified so they can be used as vectors for inserting genetic information into other organisms this process is called transduction and if successful recipient of introduced dna becomes a gmo different viruses have different efficiencies and capabilities researchers can use this to control for various factors including target location insert size and duration of gene expression any dangerous sequences inherent in virus must be removed while those that allow gene to be delivered effectively are retained while viral vectors can be used to insert dna into almost any organism it is especially relevant for its potential in treating human disease although primarily still at trial stages there has been some successes using gene therapy to replace defective genes this is most evident in curing patients with severe combined immunodeficiency rising from adenosine deficiency ada scid although development of leukemia in some ada scid patients along with death of jesse in a 1999 trial set back development of this approach for many years in 2009 another breakthrough was achieved when an eight year old boy with leber s congenital amaurosis regained normal eyesight and in 2016 glaxosmithkline gained approval to commercialize a gene therapy treatment for ada scid as of 2018 there are a substantial number of clinical trials underway including treatments for hemophilia chronic granulomatous disease cystic fibrosis and various cancers most common virus used for gene delivery come from as they can carry up to 7 5 kb of foreign dna and infect a relatively broad range of host cells although they have been know to elicit immune responses in host and only provide short term expression other common vectors are associated viruses which have lower toxicity and longer term expression but can only carry about of dna herpes simplex viruses make promising vectors having a carrying capacity of over and providing long term expression although they are less efficient at gene delivery than other vectors best vectors for long term integration of gene into host genome are retroviruses but their propensity for random integration is problematic lentiviruses are a part of same family as retroviruses with advantage of infecting both dividing and non dividing cells whereas retroviruses only target dividing cells other viruses that have been used as vectors include measles viruses newcastle disease virus poxviruses and most vaccines consist of viruses that have been attenuated disabled weakened or killed in some way so that their virulent properties are no longer effective genetic engineering could theoretically be used to create viruses with virulent genes removed this does not affect viruses infectivity invokes a natural immune response and there is no chance that they will regain their virulence function which can occur with some other vaccines as such they are generally considered safer and more efficient than conventional vaccines although concerns remain over non target infection potential side effects and horizontal gene transfer to other viruses another potential approach is to use vectors to create novel vaccines for diseases that have no vaccines available or vaccines that do not work effectively such as aids malaria and tuberculosis most effective vaccine against tuberculosis bacillus calmette guerin bcg vaccine only provides partial protection a modified vaccine expressing a m tuberculosis antigen is able to enhance bcg protection it has been shown to be safe to use at phase ii trials although not as effective as initially hoped other vector based vaccines have already been approved and many more are being developed another potential use of genetically modified viruses is to alter them so they can directly treat diseases this can be through expression of protective proteins or by directly targeting infected cells in 2004 researchers reported that a genetically modified virus that exploits selfish behaviour of cancer cells might offer an alternative way of killing tumours since then several researchers have developed genetically modified viruses that show promise as treatments for various types of cancer perett linda 30 june 2011 measles viruses genetically modified to treat ovarian cancer national cancer institute benchmarks retrieved 5 september deena 31 august 2011 cancer fighting virus shown to target tumors alone reuters science retrieved 5 september 2012 in 2017 researchers genetically modified a virus to express spinach proteins virus was injected into orange trees to combat citrus greening disease that had reduced orange production by 70 since 2005 natural viral diseases such as myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease have been used to help control pest populations over time surviving pests become resistant leading researchers to look at alternative methods genetically modified viruses that make target animals infertile through have been created in laboratory as well as others that target developmental stage of animal there are concerns with using this approach regarding virus containment and cross species infection sometimes same virus can be modified for contrasting purposes genetic modification of myxoma virus has been proposed to conserve european wild rabbits in iberian peninsula and to help regulate them in australia to protect iberian species from viral diseases myxoma virus was genetically modified to immunize rabbits while in australia same myxoma virus was genetically modified to lower fertility in australian rabbit population outside of biology scientists have used a genetically modified virus to construct a lithium ion battery and other materials it is possible to engineer bacteriophages to express modified proteins on their surface and join them up in specific patterns a technique called phage display these structures have potential uses for energy storage and generation and tissue regeneration with some new materials currently produced including quantum dots liquid crystals and nanofibres battery was made by engineering m13 so they would coat themselves in iron phosphate and then assemble themselves along a carbon this created a highly conductive medium for use in a cathode allowing energy to be transferred quickly they could be constructed at lower temperatures with non toxic chemicals making them more environmentally friendly fungi fungi can be used for many of same processes as bacteria for industrial applications yeasts combines bacterial advantages of being a single celled organism that is easy to manipulate and grow with advanced protein modifications found in eukaryotes they can be used to produce large complex molecules for use in food pharmaceuticals hormones and steroids yeast is important for wine production and as of 2016 two genetically modified yeasts involved in fermentation of wine have been commercialized in united states and canada one has increased malolactic fermentation efficiency while other prevents production of dangerous ethyl carbamate compounds during fermentation there have also been advances in production of biofuel from genetically modified fungi fungi being most common pathogens of insects make attractive biopesticides unlike bacteria and viruses they have advantage of infecting insects by contact alone although they are out competed in efficiency by chemical pesticides genetic engineering can improve virulence usually by adding more virulent proteins increasing infection rate or enhancing spore persistence many of disease carrying vectors are susceptible to fungi an attractive target for biological control are mosquitos vectors for a range of deadly diseases including malaria yellow fever and dengue fever mosquitos can evolve quickly so it becomes a balancing act of killing them before plasmodium they carry becomes infectious disease but not so fast that they become resistant to fungi by genetically engineering fungi like metarhizium anisopliae and to delay development of mosquito infectiousness selection pressure to evolve resistance is reduced another strategy is to add proteins to fungi that block transmission of malaria or remove plasmodium altogether a mushroom has been gene edited to resist browning giving it a longer shelf life process used crispr to knock out a gene that encodes oxidase as it didn t introduce any foreign dna into organism it was not deemed to be regulated under existing gmo frameworks and as such is first crispr edited organism to be approved for release this has intensified debates as to whether gene edited organisms should be considered genetically modified organisms and how they should be regulated plants thumb upright tissue culture used to regenerate arabidopsis thaliana plants have been engineered for scientific research to display new flower colors deliver vaccines and to create enhanced crops many plants are pluripotent meaning that a single cell from a mature plant can be harvested and under right conditions can develop into a new plant this ability can be taken advantage of by genetic engineers by selecting for cells that have been successfully transformed in an adult plant a new plant can then be grown that contains transgene in every cell through a process known as tissue culture much of advances in field of genetic engineering has come from experimentation with tobacco major advances in tissue culture and plant cellular mechanisms for a wide range of plants has originated from systems developed in tobacco it was first plant to be altered using genetic engineering and is considered a model organism for not only genetic engineering but a range of other fields as such transgenic tools and procedures are well established making tobacco one of easiest plants to transform another major model organism relevant to genetic engineering is arabidopsis thaliana its small genome and short life cycle makes it easy to manipulate and it contains many homologues to important crop species it was first plant sequenced has a host of online resources available and can be transformed by simply dipping a flower in a transformed agrobacterium solution in research plants are engineered to help discover functions of certain genes simplest way to do this is to remove gene and see what phenotype develops compared to wild type form any differences are possibly result of missing gene unlike genetic engineering allows targeted removal without disrupting other genes in organism some genes are only expressed in certain tissue so reporter genes like gus can be attached to gene of interest allowing visualization of location other ways to test a gene is to alter it slightly and then return it to plant and see if it still has same effect on phenotype other strategies include attaching gene to a strong promoter and see what happens when it is over expressed forcing a gene to be expressed in a different location or at different developmental stages thumb suntory blue rose some genetically modified plants are purely ornamental they are modified for flower color fragrance flower shape and plant architecture first genetically modified ornamentals commercialized altered color carnations were released in 1997 with most popular genetically modified organism a blue rose actually lavender or mauve created in 2004 roses are sold in japan united states and canada other genetically modified ornamentals include chrysanthemum and petunia as well as increasing aesthetic value there are plans to develop ornamentals that use less water or are resistant to cold which would allow them to be grown outside their natural environments it has been proposed to genetically modify some plant species threatened by extinction to be resistant to invasive plants and diseases such as emerald ash borer in north american and fungal disease in european plane trees papaya ringspot virus devastated papaya trees in hawaii in twentieth century until transgenic papaya plants were given pathogen derived resistance however genetic modification for conservation in plants remains mainly speculative a unique concern is that a transgenic species may no longer bear enough resemblance to original species to truly claim that original species is being conserved instead transgenic species may be genetically different enough to be considered a new species thus diminishing conservation worth of genetic modification crops thumb upright wild type peanut top and transgenic peanut with bacillus thuringiensis gene added bottom exposed to borer larva alt genetically modified crops are genetically modified plants that are used in agriculture first crops developed were used for animal or human food and provide resistance to certain pests diseases environmental conditions spoilage or chemical treatments e g resistance to a herbicide second generation of crops aimed to improve quality often by altering nutrient profile third generation genetically modified crops could be used for non food purposes including production of pharmaceutical agents biofuels and other industrially useful goods as well as for bioremediation thumb kenyans examining insect resistant transgenic bacillus thuringiensis bt corn alt left there are three main aims to agricultural advancement increased production improved conditions for agricultural workers and sustainability gm crops contribute by improving harvests through reducing insect pressure increasing nutrient value and tolerating different abiotic stresses despite this potential as of 2018 commercialized crops are limited mostly to cash crops like cotton soybean maize and canola and vast majority of introduced traits provide either herbicide tolerance or insect resistance soybeans accounted for half of all genetically modified crops planted in 2014 adoption by farmers has been rapid between 1996 and 2013 total surface area of land cultivated with gm crops increased by a factor of 100 isaaa 2013 annual report executive summary global status of commercialized biotech gm crops 2013 isaaa brief 46 2013 retrieved 6 august 2014 geographically though spread has been uneven with strong growth in americas and parts of asia and little in europe and africa its socioeconomic spread has been more even with approximately 54 of worldwide gm crops grown in developing countries in 2013 although doubts have been raised most studies have found growing gm crops to be beneficial to farmers through decreased pesticide use as well as increased crop yield and farm profit majority of gm crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides usually a glyphosate or based one genetically modified crops engineered to resist herbicides are now more available than conventionally bred resistant varieties in usa 93 of soybeans and most of gm maize grown is glyphosate tolerant most currently available genes used to engineer insect resistance come from bacillus thuringiensis bacterium and code for delta a few use genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from b thuringiensis is cowpea trypsin inhibitor cpti cpti was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice less than one percent of gm crops contained other traits which include providing virus resistance delaying senescence and altering plants composition left thumb golden rice compared to white rice golden rice is most well known gm crop that is aimed at increasing nutrient value it has been engineered with three genes that beta carotene a precursor of vitamin a in edible parts of rice it is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin a a deficiency which each year is estimated to kill 670 000 children under age of 5 and cause an additional 500 000 cases of irreversible childhood blindness original golden rice produced 1 g of carotenoids with further development increasing this 23 times in 2018 it gained its first approvals for use as food plants and plant cells have been genetically engineered for production of biopharmaceuticals in bioreactors a process known as work has been done with duckweed lemna minor algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii 10 december 2012 engineering algae to make complex anti cancer designer drug retrieved 15 april 2013 and moss patens biopharmaceuticals produced include cytokines hormones antibodies enzymes and vaccines most of which are accumulated in plant seeds many drugs also contain natural plant ingredients and pathways that lead to their production have been genetically altered or transferred to other plant species to produce greater volume other options for bioreactors are and biofuels unlike bacteria plants can modify proteins post translationally allowing them to make more complex molecules they also pose less risk of being contaminated therapeutics have been cultured in transgenic carrot and tobacco cells including a drug treatment for gaucher s disease weinreb and koby for globes 2 may 2012 fda approves gaucher treatment vaccine production and storage has great potential in transgenic plants vaccines are expensive to produce transport and administer so having a system that could produce them locally would allow greater access to poorer and developing areas as well as purifying vaccines expressed in plants it is also possible to produce edible vaccines in plants edible vaccines stimulate immune system when ingested to protect against certain diseases being stored in plants reduces long term cost as they can be disseminated without need for cold storage don t need to be purified and have long term stability also being housed within plant cells provides some protection from gut acids upon digestion however cost of developing regulating and containing transgenic plants is high leading to most current plant based vaccine development being applied to veterinary medicine where controls are not as strict animals vast majority of genetically modified animals are at research stage with number close to entering market remaining small as of 2018 only three genetically modified animals have been approved all in usa a goat and a chicken have been engineered to produce medicines and a salmon that has increased growth despite differences and difficulties in modifying them end aims are much same as for plants gm animals are created for research purposes production of industrial or therapeutic products agricultural uses or improving their health there is also a market for creating genetically modified pets larisa 20 guidance for industry usa center for veterinary medicine link mammals thumb some chimeras like blotched mouse shown are created through genetic modification techniques like gene targeting process of genetically engineering mammals is slow tedious and expensive however new technologies are making genetic modifications easier and more precise murray joo 20 genetically modified animals canada first transgenic mammals were produced by injecting viral dna into embryos and then embryos in females embryo would develop and it would be hoped that some of genetic material would be incorporated into reproductive cells then researchers would have to wait until animal reached breeding age and then offspring would be screened for presence of gene in every cell development of crispr cas9 gene editing system as a cheap and fast way of directly modifying germ cells effectively halving amount of time needed to develop genetically modified mammals left thumb a porcine model of hemophilia a mammals are best models for human disease making genetic engineered ones vital to discovery and development of cures and treatments for many serious diseases knocking out genes responsible for human genetic disorders allows researchers to study mechanism of disease and to test possible cures genetically modified mice have been most common mammals used in biomedical research as they are cheap and easy to manipulate pigs are also a good target as they have a similar body size and anatomical features physiology pathophysiological response and diet nonhuman primates are most similar model organisms to humans but there is less public acceptance towards using them as research animals in 2009 scientists announced that they had successfully transferred a gene into a primate species marmosets for first time their first research target for these marmosets was parkinson s disease but they were also considering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and huntington s disease human proteins expressed in mammals are more likely to be similar to their natural counterparts than those expressed in plants or microorganisms stable expression has been accomplished in sheep pigs rats and other animals in 2009 first human biological drug produced from such an animal a goat was approved drug is an anticoagulant which reduces probability of blood clots during surgery or childbirth and is extracted from goat s milk britt erickson 10 february 2009 for chemical engineering news fda approves drug from transgenic goat milk accessed 6 october 2012 human alpha 1 is another protein that has been produced from goats and is used in treating humans with this deficiency another medicinal area is in creating pigs with greater capacity for human organ transplants pigs have been genetically modified so that their organs can no longer carry retroviruses or have modifications to reduce chance of rejection pig lungs from genetically modified pigs are being considered for transplantation into humans there is even potential to create chimeric pigs that can carry human organs livestock are modified with intention of improving economically important traits such as growth rate quality of meat milk composition disease resistance and survival animals have been engineered to grow faster be healthier and resist diseases modifications have also improved wool production of sheep and udder health of cows goats have been genetically engineered to produce milk with strong spiderweb like silk proteins in their milk a gm pig called was created with capability of digesting plant phosphorus more efficiently than conventional pigs they could reduce water pollution since they excrete 30 to 70 less phosphorus in manure dairy cows have been genetically engineered to produce milk that would be same as human breast milk this could potentially benefit mothers who cannot produce breast milk but want their children to have breast milk rather than formula researchers have also developed a genetically engineered cow that produces allergy free milk thumb mice expressing green fluorescent protein scientists have genetically engineered several organisms including some mammals to include green fluorescent protein gfp for research purposes gfp and other similar reporting genes allow easy visualization and localization of products of genetic modification fluorescent pigs have been bred to study human organ transplants regenerating ocular photoreceptor cells and other topics in 2011 green fluorescent cats were created to help find therapies for hiv aids and other diseases as feline immunodeficiency virus is related to hiv there have been suggestions that genetic engineering could be used to bring animals back from extinction it involves changing genome of a close living relative to resemble extinct one and is currently being attempted with passenger pigeon genes associated with woolly mammoth have been added to genome of an african elephant although lead researcher says he has no intention of creating live elephants and transferring all genes and reversing years of genetic evolution is a long way from being feasible it is more likely that scientists could use this technology to conserve endangered animals by bringing back lost diversity or transferring evolved genetic advantages from adapted organisms to those that are struggling humans gene therapy uses genetically modified viruses to deliver genes which can cure disease in humans although gene therapy is still relatively new it has had some successes it has been used to treat genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency and leber s congenital amaurosis treatments are also being developed for a range of other currently incurable diseases such as cystic fibrosis sickle cell anemia parkinson s disease gallaher james gene therapy treats parkinson s disease bbc news health 17 march 2011 retrieved 24 april 2011 cancer diabetes heart disease and muscular dystrophy these treatments only effect somatic cells meaning any changes would not be inheritable germline gene therapy results in any change being inheritable which has raised concerns within scientific community in 2015 crispr was used to edit dna of non viable human embryos in november 2018 he announced that he had edited genomes of two human embryos in an attempt to disable ccr5 gene which codes for a receptor that hiv uses to enter cells he said that twin girls lulu and nana had been born a few weeks earlier and that they carried functional copies of ccr5 along with disabled ccr5 and were still vulnerable to hiv work was widely condemned as unethical dangerous and premature fish genetically modified fish are used for scientific research as pets and as a food source aquaculture is a growing industry currently providing over half consumed fish worldwide through genetic engineering it is possible to increase growth rates reduce food intake remove allergenic properties increase cold tolerance and provide disease resistance fish can also be used to detect aquatic pollution or function as bioreactors several groups have been developing zebrafish to detect pollution by attaching fluorescent proteins to genes activated by presence of pollutants fish will then glow and can be used as environmental sensors glofish is a brand of genetically modified fluorescent zebrafish with bright red green and orange fluorescent color it was originally developed by one of groups to detect pollution but is now part of ornamental fish trade becoming first genetically modified animal to become publicly available as a pet when in 2003 it was introduced for sale in usa gm fish are widely used in basic research in genetics and development two species of fish zebrafish and medaka are most commonly modified because they have optically clear membranes in egg rapidly develop and one cell embryo is easy to see and with transgenic dna zebrafish are model organisms for developmental processes regeneration genetics behaviour disease mechanisms and toxicity testing their transparency allows researchers to observe developmental stages intestinal functions and tumour growth generation of transgenic protocols whole organism cell or tissue specific tagged with reporter genes has increased level of information gained by studying these fish gm fish have been developed with promoters driving an over production of growth hormone for use in aquaculture industry to increase speed of development and potentially reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks this has resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species including salmon trout and tilapia technologies a biotechnology company have produced a salmon called aquadvantage salmon that can mature in half time as wild salmon it obtained regulatory approval in 2015 first non plant gmo food to be commercialized as of august 2017 gmo salmon is being sold in canada sales in us are expected to start in second half of 2019 insects thumb overexpression of methyl cpg binding protein 2 in drosophila impairs climbing ability right compared to control group left in biological research transgenic fruit flies drosophila melanogaster are model organisms used to study effects of genetic changes on development fruit flies are often preferred over other animals due to their short life cycle and low maintenance requirements they also have a relatively simple genome compared to many vertebrates with typically only one copy of each gene making phenotypic analysis easy drosophila have been used to study genetics and inheritance embryonic development learning behavior and aging discovery of in particular p element in drosophila provided an early method to add transgenes to their genome although this has been taken over by more modern gene editing techniques due to their significance to human health scientists are looking at ways to control mosquitoes through genetic engineering malaria resistant mosquitoes have been developed in laboratory by inserting a gene that reduces development of malaria parasite and then use homing endonucleases to rapidly spread that gene throughout male population known as a gene drive this approach has been taken further by using gene drive to spread a lethal gene in trials populations of aedes aegypti mosquitoes single most important carrier of dengue fever and zika virus were reduced by between 80 and by 90 staff march 2011 cayman demonstrates potential newsletter march 2011 retrieved 20 september 2011 another approach is to use a sterile insect technique whereby males genetically engineered to be sterile out compete viable males to reduce population numbers other insect pests that make attractive targets are moths diamondback moths cause us 4 to 5 billion of damage each year worldwide approach is similar to sterile technique tested on mosquitoes where males are transformed with a gene that prevents any females born from reaching maturity they underwent field trials in 2017 genetically modified moths have previously been released in field trials in this case a strain of pink bollworm that were sterilized with radiation were genetically engineered to express a red fluorescent protein making it easier for researchers to monitor them silkworm larvae stage of bombyx mori is an economically important insect in sericulture scientists are developing strategies to enhance silk quality and quantity there is also potential to use silk producing machinery to make other valuable proteins proteins currently developed to be expressed by silkworms include human serum albumin human collagen a chain mouse monoclonal antibody and n silkworms have been created that produce spider silk a stronger but extremely difficult to harvest silk and even novel silks other thumb upright frog expressing green fluorescent protein alt left systems have been developed to create transgenic organisms in a wide variety of other animals chickens have been genetically modified for a variety of purposes this includes studying embryo development preventing transmission of bird flu and providing evolutionary insights using reverse engineering to recreate dinosaur like phenotypes a gm chicken that produces drug an enzyme that treats a rare condition in its egg passed us regulatory approval in 2015 genetically modified frogs in particular xenopus laevis and xenopus tropicalis are used in developmental biology research gm frogs can also be used as pollution sensors especially for endocrine disrupting chemicals there are proposals to use genetic engineering to control cane toads in australia nematode caenorhabditis elegans is one of major model organisms for researching molecular biology rna interference rnai was discovered in c elegans and could be induced by simply feeding them bacteria modified to express double stranded rna it is also relatively easy to produce stable transgenic nematodes and this along with rnai are major tools used in studying their genes most common use of transgenic nematodes has been studying gene expression and localization by attaching reporter genes transgenes can also be combined with rnai techniques to rescue phenotypes study gene function image cell development in real time or control expression for different tissues or developmental stages transgenic nematodes have been used to study viruses toxicology diseases and to detect environmental pollutants thumb upright transgenic hydro expressing green fluorescent protein gene responsible for albinism in sea cucumbers has been found and used to engineer white sea cucumbers a rare delicacy technology also opens way to investigate genes responsible for some of cucumbers more unusual traits including hibernating in summer eviscerating their intestines and dissolving their bodies upon death flatworms have ability to regenerate themselves from a single cell until 2017 there was no effective way to transform them which hampered research by using microinjection and radiation scientists have now created first genetically modified flatworms bristle worm a marine annelid has been modified it is of interest due to its reproductive cycle being synchronized with lunar phases regeneration capacity and slow evolution rate cnidaria such as hydra and sea anemone are attractive model organisms to study evolution of immunity and certain developmental processes other animals that have been genetically modified include snails geckos turtles crayfish oysters shrimp clams abalone and sponges regulation genetically modified organisms are regulated by government agencies this applies to research as well as release of genetically modified organisms including crops and food development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975 at asilomar california asilomar meeting recommended a set of guidelines regarding cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology cartagena protocol on biosafety was adopted on 29 january 2000 and entered into force on 11 september 2003 it is an international treaty that governs transfer handling and use of genetically modified organisms one hundred and fifty seven countries are members of protocol and many use it as a reference point for their own regulations universities and research institutes generally have a special committee that is responsible for approving any experiments that involve genetic engineering many experiments also need permission from a national regulatory group or legislation all staff must be trained in use of gmos and all laboratories must gain approval from their regulatory agency to work with gmos legislation covering gmos are often derived from regulations and guidelines in place for non gmo version of organism although they are more severe there is a near universal system for assessing relative risks associated with gmos and other agents to laboratory staff and community they are assigned to one of four risk categories based on their virulence severity of disease mode of transmission and availability of preventive measures or treatments there are four biosafety levels that a laboratory can fall into ranging from level 1 which is suitable for working with agents not associated with disease to level 4 working with life threatening agents different countries use different nomenclature to describe levels and can have different requirements for what can be done at each level thumb upright a label marking this peanut butter as being non gmo alt thumb upright detail of a french cheese box declaring gmo free production i e below 0 9 alt there are differences in regulation for release of gmos between countries with some of most marked differences occurring between us and europe regulation varies in a given country depending on intended use of products of genetic engineering for example a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety some nations have banned release of gmos or restricted their use and others permit them with widely differing degrees of regulation in 2016 thirty eight countries officially ban or prohibit cultivation of gmos and nine algeria bhutan kenya kyrgyzstan madagascar peru russia venezuela and zimbabwe ban their importation most countries that do not allow gmo cultivation do permit research using gmos european union eu differentiates between approval for cultivation within eu and approval for import and processing while only a few gmos have been approved for cultivation in eu a number of gmos have been approved for import and processing cultivation of gmos has triggered a debate about market for gmos in europe depending on coexistence regulations incentives for cultivation of gm crops differ us policy does not focus on process as much as other countries looks at verifiable scientific risks and uses concept of substantial equivalence emily marden risk and regulation u s regulatory policy on genetically modified food and agriculture 44 b c l rev 733 2003 whether gene edited organisms should be regulated same as genetically modified organism is debated usa regulations sees them as separate and does not regulate them under same conditions while in europe a gmo is any organism created using genetic engineering techniques one of key issues concerning regulators is whether gm products should be labeled european commission says that mandatory labeling and traceability are needed to allow for informed choice avoid potential false advertising and facilitate withdrawal of products if adverse effects on health or environment are discovered american medical association and american association for advancement of association for advancement of science aaas board of directors 2012 statement by aaas board of directors on labeling of genetically modified foods and associated press release legally mandating gm food labels could mislead and falsely alarm consumers say that absent scientific evidence of harm even voluntary labeling is misleading and will falsely alarm consumers labeling of gmo products in marketplace is required in 64 countries labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold gm content level which varies between countries or voluntary in canada and us labeling of gm food is voluntary while in europe all food including processed food or feed which contains greater than 0 9 of approved gmos must be labelled in 2014 sales of products that had been labeled as non gmo grew 30 percent to 1 1 billion controversy there is controversy over gmos especially with regard to their release outside laboratory environments dispute involves consumers producers biotechnology companies governmental regulators nongovernmental organizations and scientists many of these concerns involve gm crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on environment these controversies have led to litigation international trade disputes and protests and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries most concerns are around health and environmental effects of gmos these include whether they may provoke an allergic reaction whether transgenes could transfer to human cells and whether genes not approved for human consumption could outcross into food supply thumb upright a protester advocating for labeling of gmos there is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food but that each gm food needs to be tested on a case by case basis before introduction nonetheless members of public are much less likely than scientists to perceive gm foods as safe legal and regulatory status of gm foods varies by country with some nations banning or restricting them and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation gene flow between gm crops and compatible plants along with increased use of broad spectrum herbicides can increase risk of herbicide resistant weed populations debate over extent and consequences of gene flow intensified in 2001 when a paper was published showing transgenes had been found in landrace maize in mexico crops center of diversity gene flow from gm crops to other organisms has been found to generally be lower than what would occur naturally in order to address some of these concerns some gmos have been developed with traits to help control their spread to prevent genetically modified salmon inadvertently breeding with wild salmon all fish raised for food are females triploid 99 are reproductively sterile and raised in areas where escaped salmon could not survive bacteria have also been modified to depend on nutrients that cannot be found in nature and genetic use restriction technology has been developed though not yet marketed that causes second generation of gm plants to be sterile other environmental and concerns include a decrease in biodiversity an increase in secondary pests non targeted pests and evolution of resistant insect pests in areas of china and us with bt crops overall biodiversity of insects has increased and impact of secondary pests has been minimal resistance was found to be slow to evolve when best practice strategies were followed impact of bt crops on beneficial non target organisms became a public issue after a 1999 paper suggested they could be toxic to monarch butterflies follow up studies have since shown that toxicity levels encountered in field were not high enough to harm larvae accusations that scientists are playing god and other religious issues have been ascribed to technology from beginning with ability to genetically engineer humans now possible there are ethical concerns over how far this technology should go or if it should be used at all much debate revolves around where line between treatment and enhancement is and whether modifications should be inheritable other concerns include contamination of non genetically modified food supply chartered institute of environmental health 2006 proposals for managing coexistence of gm conventional and organic crops response to department for environment food and rural affairs consultation paper october 2006 rigor of regulatory process american medical association 2012 report 2 of council on science and public health labeling of bioengineered foods to better detect potential harms of bioengineered foods council believes that pre market safety assessment should shift from a voluntary notification process to a mandatory requirement p 7 consolidation of control of food supply in companies that make and sell gmos exaggeration of benefits of genetic modification or concerns over use of herbicides with glyphosate other issues raised include patenting of life and use of intellectual property rights there are large differences in consumer acceptance of gmos with europeans more likely to view gm food negatively than north americans gmos arrived on scene as public confidence in food safety attributed to recent food scares such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other scandals involving government regulation of products in europe was low this along with campaigns run by various non governmental organizations ngo have been very successful in blocking or limiting use of gm crops ngos like organic consumers association union of concerned scientists greenpeace and other groups have said that risks have not been adequately identified and managed and that there are unanswered questions regarding potential long term impact on human health from food derived from gmos they propose mandatory labeling or a moratorium on such
