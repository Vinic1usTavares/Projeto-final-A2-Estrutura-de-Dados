albert speer march 19 1905 september 1 1981 was minister of armaments and war production in nazi germany during most of world war ii a close ally of adolf hitler he was convicted at nuremberg trials and sentenced to 20 years in prison an architect by training speer joined nazi party in 1931 his architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within party and he became a member of hitler s inner circle hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including reich chancellery and nazi party rally grounds in nuremberg in 1937 hitler appointed speer as general building inspector for berlin in this capacity he was responsible for central department for resettlement that evicted jewish tenants from their homes in berlin in february 1942 speer was appointed as reich minister of armaments and war production using doctored statistics he promoted himself as having performed an armaments miracle that was widely credited with keeping germany in war in 1944 speer established a task force to increase production of fighter aircraft it became instrumental in exploitation of slave labor for benefit of german war effort after war speer was among 24 major war criminals arrested and charged with crimes of nazi regime at nuremberg trials he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for use of slave labor narrowly avoiding a death sentence having served his full term speer was released in 1966 he used his writings from time of imprisonment as basis for two autobiographical books inside third reich and spandau secret diaries speer s books were a success public was fascinated by an inside view of third reich speer died of a stroke in 1981 little remains of his personal architectural work through his autobiographies and interviews speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover monstrous crimes of third reich he continued to deny explicit knowledge of and responsibility for holocaust this image dominated his historiography in decades following war giving rise to speer myth first theme of myth posits that after his appointment as minister of armaments he revolutionized german war machine second theme is that he was an apolitical technocrat beginning in 1980s myth began to fall apart armaments miracle was attributed to nazi propaganda adam tooze wrote in wages of destruction that idea that speer was an apolitical technocrat was absurd martin kitchen writing in speer hitler s architect stated that speer was intimately involved in final solution early years and personal life speer was born in mannheim into an upper middle class family he was second of three sons of luise mathilde wilhelmine hommel and albert friedrich speer in 1918 family leased their mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in heidelberg henry t king deputy prosecutor at nuremberg trials who later wrote a book about speer said love and warmth were lacking in household of speer s youth his brothers ernst and hermann bullied him throughout his childhood speer was active in sports taking up skiing and mountaineering he followed in footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture speer began his architectural studies at university of karlsruhe instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because hyperinflation crisis of 1923 limited his parents income in 1924 when crisis had abated he transferred to much more reputable technical university of munich in 1925 he transferred again this time to technical university of berlin where he studied under heinrich tessenow whom speer greatly admired after passing his exams in 1927 speer became tessenow s assistant a high honor for a man of 22 as such speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies in munich speer began a close friendship ultimately spanning over 50 years with rudolf wolters who also studied under tessenow in mid 1922 speer began courting margarete margret weber 1905 1987 daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers relationship was frowned upon by speer s class conscious mother who felt were socially inferior despite this opposition two married in berlin on august 28 1928 seven years elapsed before margarete was invited to stay at her in laws home couple would have six children together but albert speer grew increasingly distant from his family after 1933 he remained so even after his release from imprisonment in 1966 despite their efforts to forge closer bonds party architect and government functionary joining nazis 1931 1934 thumb left upright speer shows hitler a project at obersalzberg in january 1931 speer applied for nazi party membership and on march 1 1931 he became member number 474 481 same year with stipends shrinking amid depression speer surrendered his position as tessenow s assistant and moved to mannheim hoping to make a living as an architect after he failed to do so his father gave him a part time job as manager of his properties in july 1932 visited berlin to help out party before reichstag elections while they were there his friend nazi party official karl hanke recommended young architect to joseph goebbels to help renovate party s berlin headquarters when commission was completed speer returned to mannheim and remained there as hitler took office in january 1933 organizers of 1933 nuremberg rally asked speer to submit designs for rally bringing him into contact with hitler for first time neither organizers nor rudolf hess were willing to decide whether to approve plans and hess sent speer to hitler s munich apartment to seek his approval this work won speer his first national post as nazi party commissioner for artistic and technical presentation of party rallies and demonstrations shortly after hitler came into power he began to make plans to rebuild chancellery at end of 1933 he contracted paul troost to renovate entire building hitler appointed speer whose work for goebbels had impressed him to manage building site for troost as chancellor hitler had a residence in building and came by every day to be briefed by speer and building supervisor on progress of renovations after one of these briefings hitler invited speer to lunch to architect s great excitement speer quickly became part of hitler s inner circle he was expected to call on him in morning for a walk or chat to provide consultation on architectural matters and to discuss hitler s ideas most days he was invited to dinner in english version of his memoirs speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his monthly dues he assumed his german readers would not be so gullible and told them nazi party offered a new mission he was more forthright in an interview with william hamsher in which he said he joined party in order to save germany from communism after war he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance like many of those in power in third reich he was not an ideologue although he was an avowed anti semite historian magnus brechtken discussing speer said he did not give anti jewish public speeches and that his anti semitism can best be understood through his actions which were anti semitic brechtken added that throughout speer s life his central motives were to gain power rule and acquire wealth nazi architect 1934 1937 thumb left cathedral of light above when troost died on january 21 1934 speer effectively replaced him as party s chief architect hitler appointed speer as head of chief office for construction which placed him nominally on hess s staff one of speer s first commissions after troost s death was zeppelinfeld stadium in nuremberg it was used for nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in leni riefenstahl s propaganda film triumph of will building was able to hold 340 000 people speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide overweight nazis nuremberg was site of many official nazi buildings many more buildings were planned if built german stadium would have accommodated 400 000 spectators speer modified werner march s design for olympic stadium being built for 1936 summer olympics he added a stone exterior that pleased hitler speer designed german pavilion for 1937 international exposition in paris berlin s general building inspector 1937 1942 thumb upright hitler in paris in 1940 with speer left and sculptor arno breker in 1937 hitler appointed speer as general building inspector for reich capital this carried with it rank of undersecretary of state in reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over berlin city government it also made speer a member of reichstag though body by then had little effective power hitler ordered speer to develop plans to rebuild berlin these centered on a three mile long grand boulevard running from north to south which speer called prachtstrasse or street of magnificence he also referred to it as north south axis at northern end of boulevard speer planned to build a huge domed assembly hall over high with floor space for 180 000 people at southern end of avenue a great triumphal arch almost high and able to fit arc de triomphe inside its opening was planned existing berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled and two large new stations built speer hired wolters as part of his design team with special responsibility for prachtstrasse outbreak of world war ii in 1939 led to postponement and later abandonment of these plans plans to build a new reich chancellery had been underway since 1934 land had been purchased by end of 1934 and starting in march 1936 first buildings were demolished to create space at vossstrasse speer was involved virtually from beginning in aftermath of night of long knives he had been commissioned to renovate palace on corner of vossstrasse and wilhelmstrasse as headquarters of sturmabteilung sa he completed preliminary work for new chancellery by may 1936 in june 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30 000 reichsmark and estimated chancellery would be completed within three to four years detailed plans were completed in july 1937 and first shell of new chancellery was complete on january 1 1938 on january 27 1938 speer received plenipotentiary powers from hitler to finish new chancellery by january 1 1939 for propaganda hitler claimed during topping out ceremony on august 2 1938 that he had ordered speer to complete new chancellery that year shortages of labor meant construction workers had to work in ten to twelve hour shifts schutzstaffel ss built two concentration camps in 1938 and used inmates to quarry stone for its construction a brick factory was built near oranienburg concentration camp at speer s behest when someone commented on poor conditions there speer stated got used to making bricks while in egyptian captivity chancellery was completed in early january 1939 building itself was hailed by hitler as crowning glory of greater german political empire thumb left a holocaust train arriving at auschwitz concentration camp during chancellery project pogrom of kristallnacht took place speer made no mention of it in first draft of inside third reich it was only on urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing ruins of central synagogue in berlin from his car kristallnacht accelerated speer s ongoing efforts to dispossess berlin s jews from their homes from 1939 on speer s department used nuremberg laws to evict jewish tenants of non jewish landlords in berlin to make way for non jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing eventually 75 000 jews were displaced by these measures speer denied he knew they were being put on holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were completely free and their families were still in their apartments he also said en route to my ministry on city highway i could see crowds of people on platform of nearby railroad station i knew that these must be berlin jews who were being evacuated i am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as i drove past i presumably had a sense of somber events matthias schmidt said speer had personally inspected concentration camps and described his comments as an outright farce martin kitchen described speer s often repeated line that he knew nothing of dreadful things as hollow because not only was he fully aware of fate of jews he was actively participating in their persecution as germany started world war ii in europe speer instituted quick reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris before long these units would be used to clear bomb sites speer used forced jewish labor on these projects in addition to regular german workers construction stopped on berlin and nuremberg plans at outbreak of war though stockpiling of materials and other work continued this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for armament industry speer s offices undertook building work for each branch of military and for ss using slave labor speer s building work made him among wealthiest of nazi elite minister of armaments appointment and increasing power thumb upright speer wearing organisation todt armband and wehrmacht general eduard dietl at rovaniemi airport in finland december 1943 on february 8 1942 minister of armaments fritz todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from hitler s eastern headquarters at rastenburg speer arrived there previous evening and accepted todt s offer to fly with him to berlin speer cancelled some hours before take off because previous night he had been up late in a meeting with hitler hitler appointed speer in todt s place martin kitchen points out that choice was not surprising speer was loyal to hitler and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for military qualified him for job hitler also appointed speer as head of organisation todt a massive government controlled construction company characteristically hitler did not give speer any clear remit he was left to fight his contemporaries in regime for power and control he proved to be ambitious unrelenting and ruthless speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in army but in whole armed forces it did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control speer was feted at time and in post war era for performing an armaments miracle in which german war production dramatically increased this miracle was brought to a halt in summer of 1943 by among other factors first sustained allied bombing other factors probably contributed to increase more than speer himself germany s armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor todt naval armaments were not under speer s supervision until october 1943 nor luftwaffe s armaments until june of following year yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under speer s control another factor that produced boom in ammunition was policy of allocating more coal to steel industry production of every type of weapon peaked in june and july 1944 but there was now a severe shortage of fuel in september 1944 romanian oil fields came into range of bombers from united states army air forces usaaf oil production became so low any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle as minister of armaments speer was responsible for supplying weapons to army with hitler s full agreement he decided to prioritize tank production and he was given unrivaled power to ensure success hitler was closely involved with design of tanks but kept changing his mind about specifications this delayed program and speer was unable to remedy situation in consequence despite tank production having highest priority relatively little of armaments budget was spent on it this led to a significant german army failure at battle of prokhorovka a major turning point on eastern front against soviet red army as head of organisation todt speer was directly involved in construction and alteration of concentration camps he agreed to expand auschwitz and some other camps allocating 13 7 million reichsmarks for work to be carried out this allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at auschwitz increasing total human capacity to 132 000 included in building works was material to build gas chambers crematoria and morgues ss called this professor speer s special programme speer realized that with six million workers drafted into armed forces there was a labor shortage in war economy and not enough workers for his factories in response hitler appointed fritz sauckel as a manpower dictator to obtain new workers speer and sauckel cooperated closely to meet speer s labor demands hitler gave sauckel a free hand to obtain labor something that delighted speer who had requested 1 000 000 voluntary laborers to meet need for armament workers sauckel had whole villages in france holland and belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to speer s factories sauckel obtained new workers often using most brutal methods in occupied areas of soviet union that had been subject to partisan action civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in germany by april 1943 sauckel had supplied 1 568 801 voluntary laborers forced laborers prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to speer for use in his armaments factories it was for mistreatment of these people that speer was principally convicted at nuremberg trials consolidation of arms production thumb speer with luftwaffe field marshal erhard milch and aircraft designer willy messerschmitt may 1944 following his appointment as minister of armaments speer was in control of armaments production solely for army he coveted control of production of armaments for luftwaffe airforce and kriegsmarine navy he set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition his close relationship with hitler provided him with political protection and he was able to outwit and outmaneuver his rivals in regime hitler s cabinet was dismayed at his tactics but regardless he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power by july 1943 he had gained control of armaments production for luftwaffe and kriegsmarine in august 1943 he took control of most of ministry of economics to become in admiral donitz s words europe s economic dictator his formal title was changed to reich minister for armaments and war production he had become one of most powerful people in nazi germany speer and his hand picked director of submarine construction otto merker believed that shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output this belief proved incorrect and speer and merker s attempt to build kriegsmarines new generation of submarines type xxi and type xxiii as prefabricated sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to failure of this strategically important program designs were rushed into production and completed submarines were crippled by manufacturing flaws which resulted from way they had been constructed while dozens of submarines were built few ever entered service in december 1943 speer visited organisation todt workers in lapland while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months he was under dubious care of professor karl gebhardt at a medical clinic called where patients mysteriously failed to survive in mid january of 1944 speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill concerned about retaining power he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of armaments ministry from his bedside speer s illness coincided with allied big week a series of bombing raids on german aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production his political rivals used opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with hitler he lost hitler s unconditional support and began to lose power in response to allied big week adolf hitler authorized creation of a fighter staff committee its aim was to ensure preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production task force was established by march 1 1944 order of speer with support from erhard milch of reich aviation ministry production of german fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944 growth however consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for allied aircraft on august 1 1944 speer merged fighter staff into a newly formed armament staff committee thumb upright survivors of muhldorf concentration camp upon liberation in 1945 muhldorf supplied slave workers for weingut i project fighter staff committee was instrumental in bringing about increased exploitation of slave labor in war economy ss provided 64 000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including mittelbau dora prisoners worked for junkers messerschmitt henschel and bmw among others to increase production speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce those who feigned illness slacked off sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps in 1944 this became endemic over half a million workers were arrested by this time 140 000 people were working in speer s underground factories these factories were death traps discipline was brutal with regular executions there were so many corpses at dora underground factory for example that crematorium was overwhelmed speer s own staff described conditions there as hell largest technological advance under speer s command came through rocket program it began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry speer enthusiastically supported program and in march 1942 made an order for a4 rockets predecessor of worlds first ballistic missile v2 rocket rockets were researched at a facility in peenemunde along with v 1 flying bomb v2 s first target was paris on september 8 1944 program while advanced proved to be an impediment to war economy large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness rockets were built at an underground factory at mittelwerk labor to build a4 rockets came from mittelbau dora concentration camp of 60 000 people who ended up at camp 20 000 died due to appalling conditions by summer of 1944 speer had lost control of organisation todt and armaments he opposed assassination attempt against hitler on july 20 1944 he was not involved in plot and played a minor role in regime s efforts to regain control over berlin after hitler survived after plot speer s rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in party he lost yet more authority defeat of nazi germany thumb speer left karl donitz and alfred jodl right after their arrest by british army in flensburg in northern germany in may 1945 losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of allied strategic bombing campaign caused collapse of german economy from late 1944 air attacks on transport network were particularly effective as they cut main centres of production off from essential coal supplies in january 1945 speer told goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year however he concluded that war was lost after soviet forces captured important silesian industrial region later that month nevertheless speer believed that germany should continue war for as long as possible with goal of winning better conditions from allies than unconditional surrender they insisted upon during january and february speer claimed that his ministry would deliver decisive weapons and a large increase in armaments production which would bring about a dramatic change on battlefield speer gained control over railways in february and asked himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair by mid march speer had accepted that germany s economy would collapse within next eight weeks while he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture so that they could be used after war he still supported war s continuation speer provided hitler with a memorandum on march 15 which detailed germany s dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure three days later he also proposed to hitler that germany s remaining military resources be concentrated along rhine and vistula rivers in an attempt to prolong fighting this ignored military realities as german armed forces were unable to match allies firepower and were facing total defeat hitler rejected speer s proposal to cease demolitions instead he issued nero decree on march 19 which called for destruction of all infrastructure as army retreated speer was appalled by this order and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it during a meeting with speer on march 28 29 hitler rescinded decree and gave him authority over demolitions speer ended them though army continued to blow up bridges by april little was left of armaments industry and speer had few official duties speer visited fuhrerbunker on april 22 for last time he met with hitler and toured damaged chancellery before leaving berlin to return to hamburg on april 29 day before committing suicide hitler dictated a final political testament which dropped speer from successor government speer was to be replaced by his subordinate karl otto saur speer was disappointed that hitler had not selected him as his successor after hitler s death speer offered his services to so called flensburg government headed by hitler s successor karl donitz he took a role in that short lived regime as minister of industry and production speer provided information to allies regarding effects of air war and on a broad range of subjects beginning on may 10 on may 23 two weeks after surrender of german forces british troops arrested members of flensburg government and brought nazi germany to a formal end post war nuremberg trial thumb right nuremberg defendants listen to proceedings speer top seated row fifth from right speer was taken to several internment centres for nazi officials and interrogated in september 1945 he was told that he would be tried for war crimes and several days later he was moved to nuremberg and incarcerated there speer was indicted on four counts participating in a common plan or conspiracy for accomplishment of crime against peace planning initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace war crimes and crimes against humanity chief united states prosecutor robert h jackson of u s supreme court said speer joined in planning and executing program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into german war industries which waxed in output while workers waned in starvation speer s attorney hans presented speer as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non ideologue speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for use of slave labor and forced labor he was acquitted on other two counts he had claimed that he was unaware of nazi extermination plans and this probably saved him from hanging his claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007 on october 1 1946 he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment three of eight judges two soviet and american francis biddle advocated death penalty for speer other judges did not and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions imprisonment on july 18 1947 speer was transferred to spandau prison in berlin to serve his prison term there he was known as prisoner number five speer s parents died while he was incarcerated his father who died in 1947 despised nazis and was silent upon meeting hitler his mother died in 1952 a nazi she had greatly enjoyed dining with hitler wolters and longtime speer secretary annemarie kempf while not permitted direct communication with speer in spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out requests speer put in letters to his wife only written communication he was officially allowed beginning in 1948 speer had services of toni proost a sympathetic dutch orderly to smuggle mail and his writings thumb left speer spent most of his sentence at spandau prison in 1949 wolters opened a bank account for speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from speer s activities during war initially funds were used only to support speer s family but increasingly money was used for other purposes they paid for toni proost to go on holiday and for bribes to those who might be able to secure speer s release once speer became aware of existence of fund he sent detailed instructions about what to do with money wolters raised a total of dm158 000 for speer over final seventeen years of his sentence prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs speer was able to have his writings sent to wolters however and they eventually amounted to 20 000 pages he had completed his memoirs by november 1953 which became basis of inside third reich in spandau diaries speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a faustian bargain for which he endured a harsh prison sentence much of speer s energy was dedicated to keeping fit both physically and mentally during his long confinement spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns flower beds shrubbery and fruit trees to make his daily walks around garden more engaging speer embarked on an imaginary trip around globe carefully measuring distance travelled each day he mapped distances to real world geography he had walked more than ending his sentence near guadalajara mexico speer also read studied architectural journals and brushed up on english and french in his writings speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison a gross exaggeration his sentence amounted to 7 300 days which only allotted one and a half days per book speer s supporters maintained calls for his release among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were charles de gaulle and us diplomat george wildman ball willy brandt was an advocate of his release putting an end to de nazification proceedings against him which could have caused his property to be confiscated speer s efforts for an early release came to nought soviet union having demanded a death sentence at trial was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence speer served a full term and was released at midnight on october 1 1966 release and later life speer s release from prison was a worldwide media event reporters and photographers crowded both street outside spandau and lobby of berlin hotel where speer spent night he said little reserving most comments for a major interview published in der spiegel in november 1966 although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career his sole project a collaboration for a brewery was unsuccessful instead he revised his spandau writings into two autobiographical books and later published a work about himmler and ss his books included inside third reich in german erinnerungen or reminiscences and spandau secret diaries speer was aided in shaping works by joachim fest and wolf jobst siedler from publishing house he found himself unable to re establish a relationship with his children even with his son albert who had also become an architect according to speer s daughter hilde schramm one by one my sister and brothers gave up there was no communication he supported hermann his brother financially after war however his other brother ernst had died in battle of stalingrad despite repeated requests from his parents for speer to repatriate him following his release from spandau speer donated chronicle his personal diary to german federal archives it had been edited by wolters and made no mention of jews david irving discovered discrepancies between deceptively edited chronicle and independent documents speer asked wolters to destroy material he had omitted from his donation but wolters refused and retained an original copy wolters friendship with speer deteriorated and one year before speer s death wolters gave matthias schmidt access to unedited chronicle schmidt authored first book that was highly critical of speer speer s memoirs were a phenomenal success public was fascinated by an inside view of third reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight importantly he provided an alibi to older germans who had been nazis if speer who had been so close to hitler had not known full extent of crimes of nazi regime and had just been following orders then they could tell themselves and others they too had done same speer provided a whitewash for an entire generation of older germans so great was need to believe this speer myth that fest and siedler were able to strengthen it even in face of mounting historical evidence to contrary thumb speer s grave in heidelberg speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers in october 1973 he made his first trip to britain flying to london to be interviewed on bbc midweek program in same year he appeared on television program world at war speer returned to london in 1981 to participate in bbc newsnight program he suffered a stroke and died in london on september 1 he had remained married to his wife but he had formed a relationship with a german woman living in london and was with her at time of his death his daughter margret nissen wrote in her 2005 memoirs that after his release from spandau he spent all of his time constructing speer myth speer myth good nazi after his release from spandau speer portrayed himself as good nazi he was well educated middle class bourgeois and could contrast himself with psychopaths and murderers who in popular mind typified bad nazis in his memoirs and interviews he had distorted truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as myths speer took his myth making to a mass media level and his cunning apologies were reproduced countless times in post war germany isabell trommer writes in her biography of speer that fest and siedler were co authors of speer s memoirs and co creators of his myths in return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements speer siedler and fest had constructed a masterpiece image of good nazi remained in place for decades despite historical evidence indicating that it was false thumb alt black and white photograph of a group of men wearing business suits raising their right arms in a nazi salute speer during a visit to a munitions factory in may 1944 speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an apolitical technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover monstrous crimes of third reich after speer s death matthias schmidt published a book that demonstrated that he had ordered eviction of jews from their berlin homes by 1999 historians had amply demonstrated that he had lied extensively even so public perceptions of speer did not change substantially until heinrich breloer aired a biographical film on tv in 2004 film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal adam tooze in his book wages of destruction said speer had manoeuvred himself through ranks of regime skilfully and ruthlessly and that idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was absurd trommer said he was not an apolitical technocrat instead he was one of most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in nazi regime kitchen said he had deceived nuremberg tribunal and post war germany brechtken said that if his extensive involvement in holocaust had been known at time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death image of good nazi was supported by numerous speer myths in addition to myth that he was an apolitical technocrat he claimed he did not have full knowledge of holocaust or persecution of jews another myth posits that speer revolutionized german war machine after his appointment as minister of armaments he was credited with a dramatic increase in shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping germany in war another myth centered around a faked plan to assassinate hitler with poisonous gas idea for this myth came to him after he recalled panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system he fabricated additional details brechtken wrote that his most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a french journalist in 1952 journalist described an invented scenario in which speer had refused hitler s orders and hitler had left with tears in his eyes speer liked scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of hitler s leadership despite his opposition to 20 july plot he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to plotters he maintained hitler was cool towards him for remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers this formed a key element of myths speer encouraged speer also falsely claimed that he had realised war was lost at an early stage and thereafter worked to preserve resources needed for civilian population s survival in reality he had sought to prolong war until further resistance was impossible thus contributing to large number of deaths and extensive destruction germany suffered in conflict s final months denial of responsibility thumb left alt a group several hundred naked men is crowded in an enclosed courtyard with garage doors visible on three sides new prisoners awaiting disinfection in garage yard of mauthausen concentration camp speer maintained at nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of holocaust he admitted only to being uncomfortable around jews in published version of spandau diaries more broadly speer accepted responsibility for nazi regime s actions historian martin kitchen states that speer was actually fully aware of what had happened to jews and was intimately involved in final solution brechtken said speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility speer was photographed with slave laborers at mauthausen concentration camp in 1942 taylor writes had photo been available at nuremberg trials he would have been hanged in 2005 daily telegraph reported that documents had surfaced indicating that speer had approved allocation of materials for expansion of auschwitz concentration camp after two of his assistants inspected facility on a day when almost a thousand jews were massacred heinrich breloer discussing construction of auschwitz said speer was not just a cog in work he was terror itself speer denied being present at posen speeches to nazi leaders at a conference in posen poznan on october 6 1943 himmler said during his speech grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from earth and later jews must be exterminated speer is mentioned several times in speech and himmler addresses him directly in 2007 guardian reported that a letter from speer dated december 23 1971 had been found in a collection

armaments miracle thumb right german city of cologne in ruins at end of war speer was credited with an armaments miracle during winter of 1941 42 in light of germany s disastrous defeat in battle of moscow german leadership including fromm thomas and todt had come to conclusion that war could not be won rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end war without defeat speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of war economy he produced spectacular statistics claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production a fourfold increase in artillery production and he sent further propaganda to newsreels of country he was able to curtail discussion that war should be ended armaments miracle was a myth speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims production of armaments did go up however this was due to normal causes of reorganization before speer came to office relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in quality of output to favor quantity by july 1943 speer s armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on battlefield meant prospect of losing war could no longer be hidden from german public brechtken writes that speer knew germany was going to lose war and deliberately extended its length thus causing deaths of millions of people in death camps and on battlefield who would have otherwise lived kitchen said there can be no doubt that speer did indeed help to prolong war longer than many thought possible as a result of which millions were killed and germany reduced to a pile of rubble architectural legacy thumb left alt colour photograph of a cylindrical structure schwerbelastungskorper in 2011 little remains of speer s personal
