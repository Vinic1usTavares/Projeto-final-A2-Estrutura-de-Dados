dormition and extensive archival research has gradually convinced scholars that wethey s assessments were not entirely correct and that his catalogue decisions may have distorted perception of whole nature of el greco s origins development and discovery of dormition led to attribution of three other signed works of domenicos to el greco modena triptych st luke painting virgin and child and adoration of magi and then to acceptance of more works as authentic some signed some not such as passion of christ pieta with angels painted in 1566 d alberge collector is vindicated as icon is hailed

is a greek term for painter e arguments of these catholic sources are based on lack of orthodox archival baptismal records on crete and on a relaxed interchange between greek orthodox and roman catholic rites during el greco s youth based on assessment that his art reflects religious spirit of roman catholic spain and on a reference in his last will and testament where he described himself as a devout catholic some scholars assume that el greco was part of vibrant catholic cretan minority or that he converted from greek orthodoxy to roman catholicism before leaving island s mcgarr st francis receiving stigmata j romaine el greco s mystical vision j sethre souls of venice 91 f according to archival research in late 1990s el greco was still in candia at age of twenty six it was there where his works created in spirit of post byzantine painters of cretan school were greatly esteemed on 26 december 1566 el greco sought permission from venetian authorities to sell a panel of passion of christ executed on a gold background un della passione del nostro signor christo in a lottery byzantine icon by young domenicos depicting passion of christ painted on a gold ground was appraised and sold on 27 december 1566 in candia for agreed price of seventy gold ducats panel was valued by two artists one of them was icon painter georgios one valuation was eighty ducats and other seventy equal in value to a work by titian or tintoretto of that period therefore it seems that el greco traveled to venice sometime after 27 december 1566 j sethre souls of venice 90 in one of his

cuevas appears to have outlived el greco and although master acknowledged both her and his son he never married her that fact has puzzled researchers because he mentioned her in various documents including his last testament most analysts assume that el greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment k myth of el greco s madness came in two versions on one hand gautier believed that el greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity t gautier 217 on other hand public and critics would not possess ideological criteria of gautier and would retain image of el greco as a mad painter and therefore his maddest paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his madness l this theory enjoyed surprising popularity
