persoonia terminalis also known as torrington geebung is a rare shrub belonging to family proteaceae and native to northern new south wales and southern queensland in eastern australia reported as a subspecies of persoonia nutans in 1981 it was described as a species by lawrie johnson and his colleague peter weston in 1991 two t terminalis and p t recognised both are found on well drained acidic soils in sclerophyll forests and p t terminalis is also found on granite outcrops although similar in appearance they differ in leaf length and curvature both have a restricted range with p t terminalis found in an area of under p terminalis grows to with an upright or spreading habit and narrow short leaves up to in length yellow flowers mainly appear in december and january australia s temperate zone summer and are followed by purple striped green drupes stone fruit fruit of persoonias are edible and dispersed by wild vertebrates taxonomy persoonia terminalis was first reported by lawrie johnson of royal botanic gardens sydney in 1981 edition of flora of new south wales citation is collected in flora of new south wales volume 2 p 14 he viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of persoonia nutans a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct queensland botanists trevor donald stanley and estelle m ross classed p terminalis as part of persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work flora of south eastern queensland they considered it more likely a species in its own right as they believed description of queensland populations did not match p oxycoccoides from central new south wales upon re examining persoonia nutans and persoonia oxycoccoides johnson and peter weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species and that persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991 type specimen was collected south of torrington pub on torrington road by weston and ecologist peter richards and is now housed in national herbarium of new south wales which is part of royal botanic gardens and domain trust sydney and office of environment and heritage herbarium houses over 1 2million other specimens generic name persoonia is derived from name of south african botanist christiaan hendrik persoon specific name terminalis refers to inflorescences clusters of flowers that are in this species at ends of branchlets its common name is torrington geebung it is classified within genus as within lanceolata group which consists of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage these species will often interbreed with each other in areas where two members of group occur p terminalis has been reported to interbreed with persoonia and persoonia sericea two other members of group two subspecies are recognised p t subsp recurva has shorter leaves with margins more curved downwards that reach a maximum of in length while p t subsp terminalis has longer straighter leaves measuring a maximum of long description alt left thumb persoonia terminalis subsp recurva persoonia terminalis grows as a shrub reaching a height of with an upright or spreading habit it has smooth bark although new growth is covered in fine hair small narrow leaves are wide and long with a convex upper surface and margins curved downwards new leaves can be hairless or slightly hairy if latter they lose hair with age they are is both leaf surfaces are same colour or slightly surfaces slightly different leaves are rougher than those of other persoonias yellow flowers mainly appear in december and january summer in temperate zone of australia although occasional flowers have been seen as late as july they are terminal that is arising at ends of branchlets where they appear in groups of one to five p terminalis is described as mostly which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a scale leaf at its junction with stem a proportion of flowers have a true leaf at this junction instead and are described as each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth that splits into four segments or tepals and contains both male and female parts within this central style is surrounded by anther which splits into four segments these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above they provide a landing area for insects attending to stigma which is located at tip of style flowers are followed by development of fleshy purple striped green drupes these are long by wide with remnant style at end distribution and habitat persooniat subsp terminalis is found in torrington area on western parts of far northern tablelands in new south wales roughly halfway between glen innes and queensland border at an altitude of between above sea level it grows on acidic sandy or stony granite soils in dry sclerophyll forest region is dotted with granite outcrops where subspecies is a component of saxicola shrubland and prostanthera low shrubland in torrington area and allocasuarina shrubland in severn river reserve it is rated 2r on rotap list persooniat subsp recurva has two disjunct populations one is found on north western slopes in new south wales near warialda north west of and other is southwest of inglewood in southeastern queensland between above sea level it grows on acidic sandstone based sandy soils in dry sclerophyll forest within warialda state conservation area it is found in black cypress pine callitris dirty gum eucalyptus woodland and smooth barked apple angophora black cypress pine woodland although p t recurva has not been recorded from kings plains national park it could be expected to be found there due to availability of suitable habitat it is rated as 3r on rotap list both subspecies are commonly found near severn river nature preserve as well as in nature reserve where they are components of a woodland ecological community dominated by smooth barked apple and long fruited bloodwood corymbia which grows on sandstone soils ecology persoonia terminalis grows in a bushfire prone habitat where fire is essential for many species to regenerate p t terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed which lies dormant in soil large numbers of persoonia seedlings appear after fire however rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too frequent intervals of less than five years which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before next fire colletid bees of subgenus within genus leioproctus exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of persoonia bees of subgenus in same genus also specialise in feeding on persoonia flowers but do not appear to be effective pollinators fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates such as kangaroos and possums as well as currawongs and other large birds cultivation potential horticulturists and scientists rodger elliot and david l jones have proposed that cultivating plant would aid in its conservation cultivating plant would most likely require good water drainage a sunny or part shaded position and acidic soil p terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts and is expected to fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth though plants of genus persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation notes references external links category flora of new south wales terminalis category plants described in 1991 category
