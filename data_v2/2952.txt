history of human activity in indiana a u s state in midwest began with migratory tribes of native americans who inhabited indiana as early as 8000 bc tribes succeeded one another in dominance for several thousand years and reached their peak of development during period of mississippian culture region entered recorded history in 1670s when first europeans came to indiana and claimed territory for kingdom of france after france ruled for a century with little settlement in this area it was defeated by great britain in french and indian war seven years war and ceded its territory east of mississippi river britain held land for more than twenty years until after its defeat in american revolutionary war then ceded entire trans allegheny region including what is now indiana to newly formed united states u s government divided trans allegheny region into several new territories largest of these was northwest territory which u s congress subsequently subdivided into several smaller territories in 1800 indiana territory became first of these new territories established as indiana territory grew in population and development it was divided in 1805 and again in 1809 until reduced to its current size and boundaries it retained name indiana and was admitted to union in 1816 as nineteenth state newly established state government set out on an ambitious plan to transform indiana from a segment of frontier into a developed well populated and thriving state state founders initiated an internal improvement program that led to construction of roads canals railroads and state funded public schools despite noble aims of project profligate spending ruined state s credit by 1841 state was near bankruptcy and was forced to liquidate most of its public works acting under its new constitution of 1851 state government enacted major financial reforms required that most public offices be filled by election rather than appointment and greatly weakened power of governor ambitious program of indiana s founders was realized when indiana became fourth largest state in terms of population as measured by 1860 census indiana became politically influential and played an important role in union during american civil war indiana was first western state to mobilize for war and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during war following civil war indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in u s presidential elections it helped decide control of presidency for three decades during indiana gas boom of late 19th century industry began to develop rapidly in state state s golden age of literature began in same time period increasing its cultural influence by early 20th century indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries it experienced setbacks during great depression of 1930s construction of indianapolis motor speedway expansion of auto industry urban development and two wars contributed to state s industrial growth during second half of 20th century indiana became a leader in pharmaceutical industry due to innovations of companies such as eli lilly early civilizations following end of last glacial period about twenty thousand years ago indiana s topography was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon caribou and saber toothed cats while northern indiana had been covered by glaciers southern indiana remained unaltered by ice s advance leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities justice pp 13 and hoosiers p 3 indiana s earliest known inhabitants were paleo indians evidence exists that humans were in indiana as early as archaic stage 8000 6000 bc barnhart and riker pp 19 25 hunting camps of nomadic clovis culture have been found in indiana justice p 12 carbon dating of artifacts found in wyandotte caves of southern indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 bc justice p 56 these nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern indiana early woodland period in indiana came between 1000 bc and 200 ad and produced adena culture it domesticated wild squash and made pottery which were large cultural advances over clovis culture natives built burial mounds one of this type has been dated as oldest earthwork in anderson s mounds state park allison pp iv v natives in middle woodland period developed hopewell culture and may have been in indiana as early as 200 bc hopewells were first culture to create permanent settlements in indiana about 1 ad hopewells mastered agriculture and grew crops of sunflowers and squash around 200 ad hopewells began to construct mounds used for ceremonies and burials hopewells in indiana were connected by trade to other native tribes as far away as central america josephy p 108 for unknown reasons hopewell culture went into decline around 400 and completely disappeared by 500 late woodland era is generally considered to have begun about 600 ad and lasted until arrival of europeans in indiana it was a period of rapid cultural change one of new developments which has yet to be explained was introduction of masonry shown by construction of large stone forts many of which overlook ohio river romantic legend attributed forts to welsh indians who supposedly arrived centuries before christopher columbus reached caribbean allison p 9 however archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that cultural development was engendered by mississippian culture allison p vii mississippians thumb right view of mound a at angel mounds evidence suggests that after collapse of hopewell indiana had a low population until rise of fort ancient and mississippian culture around 900 ad josephy pp 105 109 ohio river valley was densely populated by mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 ad their settlements like those of hopewell were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds some of these remain visible at locations near ohio river mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than mounds built by hopewell agrarian mississippian culture was first to grow maize in region people also developed bow and arrow and copper working during this time period mississippian society was complex dense and highly developed largest mississippian city of cahokia in illinois contained as many as 30 000 inhabitants they had a class society with certain groups specializing as artisans elite held related political and religious positions their cities were typically sited near rivers representing their cosmology central developments were dominated by a large central mound several smaller mounds and a large open plaza wooden palisades were built later around complex apparently for defensive purposes remains of a major settlement known as angel mounds lie east of present day evansville mississippian houses were generally square shaped with plastered walls and thatched roofs justice p 69 for reasons that remain unclear mississippians disappeared in middle of 15th century about 200 years before europeans first entered what would become modern indiana mississippian culture marked high point of native development in indiana it was during this period that american bison began a periodic east west trek through indiana crossing falls of ohio and wabash river near modern day vincennes these herds became important to civilizations in southern indiana and created a well established buffalo trace later used by european american pioneers moving west justice p 75 before 1600 a major war broke out in eastern north america among native americans it was later called beaver wars five american indian iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors iroquois were opposed by a confederation of primarily algonquian tribes including shawnee miami wea pottawatomie and illinois jennings p 18 these tribes were significantly less advanced than mississippian culture that had preceded them tribes were semi nomadic used stone tools rather than copper and did not create large scale construction and farming works of their mississippian predecessors war continued with sporadic fighting for at least a century as iroquois sought to dominate expanding fur trade with europeans they achieved this goal for several decades during war iroquois drove tribes from ohio valley to south and west they kept control of area for hunting grounds jennings p p 53 as a result of war several tribes including shawnee migrated into indiana where they attempted to resettle in land belonging to miami iroquois gained military advantage after they were supplied with firearms by europeans with their superior weapons iroquois subjugated at least thirty tribes and nearly destroyed several others in northern indiana dunn p 55 european contact when first europeans entered indiana during 1670s region was in final years of beaver wars french attempted to trade with algonquian tribes in indiana selling them firearms in exchange for furs this incurred wrath of iroquois who destroyed a french outpost in indiana in retaliation appalled by iroquois french continued to supply western tribes with firearms and openly allied with algonquian tribes dunn pp 55 p 43 a major battle and a turning point in conflict occurred near present day south bend when miami and their allies repulsed a large iroquois force in an ambush thompson pp 38 40
