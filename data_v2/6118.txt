battle of machias august 13 14 1777 was an amphibious assault on massachusetts town of machias in present day eastern maine by british forces during american revolutionary war local militia aided by indian allies successfully prevented british troops from landing raid led by commodore sir george collier was executed in an attempt to head off a planned second assault on fort cumberland which had been besieged in november 1776 british forces landed below machias seized a ship and raided a storehouse result of raid was disputed collier claimed action was successful in destroying military stores for an attack on fort cumberland although such stores had not been delivered to machias while defenders claimed that they had successfully prevented capture of machias and driven off british background thumb left a 1776 nautical chart of machias bay machias is at very top machias bay is on coast of eastern maine machiasport is located near outlet of machias river into bay upriver and north from machiasport river branches leading left west to machias and east to east machias small community of machias located in eastern district of massachusetts that is now state of maine was a persistent thorn in side of british naval authorities since start of american revolutionary war in june 1775 its citizens rose up and seized a small naval vessel and community had ever since been a base for privateering duncan pp 211 217 in 1777 john allan an expatriate nova scotian was authorized by second continental congress to organize an expedition to establish a patriot presence in western part of nova scotia present day new brunswick although congress authorized him to recruit as many as three thousand men massachusetts government was only prepared to give him a colonel s commission and authority to raise a regiment in eastern massachusetts to establish a presence in st john river valley allan based his effort in machias and had by june landed some forty men in area leamon pp 90 91 however british authorities in halifax had received some intelligence of allan s intended mission and a larger british force arrived at st john river on june 23 men that allan had left at settlements near mouth of river skirmished with british but then withdrew upriver allan was forced to make a difficult overland journey back to machias after his small force retreated up river he was joined on this journey by a number of sympathetic maliseet indians that he had persuaded to join american cause leamon p 92 in early august massachusetts provisional congress voted to disband forces recruited for allan s expedition because of imminent threat posed by army of general john burgoyne in upstate new york acts and resolves pp 87 90 papers documenting allan s fairly elaborate plans including a projected attack on fort cumberland were taken during conflict on st john river and fell into hands of captain sir george collier second in command to admiral arbuthnot in naval station at halifax gwyn p 64 this spurred collier to act since there had already been one attempt on fort cumberland previous year he therefore organized an assault on machias allan s base of operations and source of many of his recruits because collier and commander of land forces at halifax general eyre massey gwyn pp 60 61 did not get along collier decided to launch expedition without taking on any british army troops he sailed from halifax in late july in frigate accompanied by brig planning to use marines aboard those ships in ground operations he was joined by frigate and sloop while making passage to machias gwyn p 65 defense of machias consisted of local militia under command of colonel jonathan eddy leader of 1776 attack on fort cumberland he had been warned that british were organizing an attack militia laid a log boom across machias river and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver armed with cannons taken from local privateers defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty maliseet passamaquoddy and penobscots that colonel allan had called to machias to explain what had gone wrong with his expedition leamon p p 103 battle collier s fleet arrived at mouth of river early on august 13 he boarded 123 marines onto hope and ordered her and blonde up river word of this reached militia and thirty five men mustered to oppose them ships reached log boom and a firefight began between two forces militia resistance was sufficient to keep british from attempting a landing that day early next morning under cover of fog marines were landed they cut log boom seized a sloop carrying lumber and set fire to a storehouse seizing stores of flour rice corn shoes and ammunition before returning to ships two ships then moved further up river until they reached town itself all along way they were harassed by musket and cannon fire from shore as militia and their indian allies positioned themselves to dispute possible landing sites when darkness set in indians reportedly began chanting and shouting in an attempt to magnify their numbers at this point to great surprise and astonishment of every one in less than half an hour after coming to an anchor brig sloop both under way without firing a gun and made down river against tide of flood hope however ran aground while making its way downstream in twilight militia hauled a swivel gun to a nearby shore and peppered her with shot next morning before she was refloated by tide and made her way into machias bay smith p 684 aftermath thumb upright colonel jonathan eddy colonel allan ascribed militia s success to british concerns that they might be entering a trap he also grandiosely likened encounter to another battle writing not an action during war except bunker hill there was such a slaughter american estimates of british casualties ran from forty to one hundred while claiming their own casualties at one killed and one wounded british reported their losses as three killed and eighteen wounded which were mainly incurred when hope grounded after departing from machias collier cruised maine coast capturing smaller american ships and raided communities on sheepscot river there he captured a frigate laden with mast timbers destined for france gwyn p 66 in his report collier declared mission a success and claimed to have successfully forestalled another invasion of nova scotia he also believed that with another one hundred men destruction of machias would have been compleat general massey whose troops had been preparing to participate in expedition but were excluded by collier s abrupt departure from halifax wrote that collier wanted whole honour of destroying machias and that he stole out of halifax made a futile attack on machias was most shamefully drove from thence publications of cambridge historical society p pp 103 104 machias was not attacked again during war although it became somewhat isolated when british occupied castine in 1779 establishing colony of new ireland leamon pp 104 106 collier returned to successfully defend new ireland from american patriot penobscot expedition machias and other parts of eastern maine were successfully occupied by british forces during war of 1812 where again british created colony of new ireland but were returned to united states control after war p 107 see also military history of nova scotia
