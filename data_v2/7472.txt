philadelphia s municipal election of november 7 1961 involved election of district attorney city controller and several judgeships democrats swept all of city races but saw their vote totals much reduced from those of four years earlier owing to a growing graft scandal in city government district attorney james c crumlish jr and city controller alexander hemphill both incumbents were returned to office several ballot questions were also approved including one permitting limited sales of alcohol on sundays background thumb easily reelected in 1959 mayor richardson dilworth grew less popular by 1961 in 1957 and 1959 philadelphia democrats had achieved citywide victories over republicans capping a string of electoral wins that had begun in 1951 their 1959 victory especially indicated a complete domination of city s politics as mayor richardson dilworth carried 58 of 59 wards in his reelection bid he and other democrats running for citywide seats took nearly two thirds of vote it was followed up by a resounding success in presidential election of 1960 when democratic senator john f kennedy carried state thanks to a 330 000 vote majority in philadelphia coalition of independent reformers and organization democrats looked to further increase their success in 1961 with democratic city committee chairman william j green jr predicting a margin of 100 000 votes in off year election as election neared however some cracks began to show in democrats dominance dilworth held a neighborhood meeting to announce a plan to charge for parking in south philadelphia and was pelted with rocks and garbage in a near riot even more embarrassing to a party that had been elected on a platform of reform was an investigation that year into political corruption and bribery in city hall republicans demanded that a grand jury be convened to investigate further but judge raymond pace alexander who had served as a democratic city councilman from 1952 to 1959 rejected their petition while green asked voters for for continuance in office on solid accomplishments republican city committee chairman wilbur h hamilton drew attention to scandals and called erstwhile reform movement a broken idol that promised much and delivered little district attorney thumb 1961 philadelphia district attorney s race by ward with crumlish in blue and smith in red philadelphia elects a district attorney independently of mayor in a system that predates charter change since 1957 district attorney elections have followed mayoral and city council elections by two years in that year philadelphians reelected victor h blanc as district attorney of philadelphia by a thirteen percentage point margin three years later governor david l lawrence appointed blanc to court of common pleas blanc s first assistant paul m served as acting district attorney while common pleas judges decided on a replacement who would serve until 1961 election fight for interim post became a battle between political factions with green s preferred candidate james c crumlish jr getting judges approval in march 1961 crumlish ran for a full four year term that fall republicans nominated theodore b smith jr a former assistant district attorney who had been in private practice since 1958 without primary opposition smith and republicans accused crumlish of being a tool of democratic party machine and said that he covered up corruption in graft investigation democrats were confident of an easy victory for crumlish but he won by just 47 000 votes margin was far less than expected and worst showing for democrats in a district attorney contest since 1947 crumlish trailed all citywide democratic candidates which philadelphia inquirer reporter joseph c attributed to growing perception of corruption in party and in district attorney s office in particular city controller philadelphia elects a city controller to sit at head of an independent auditing department controller approves all payments made out of city treasury and audits executive departments as an independently elected official controller is not responsible to mayor or city council office was created under 1919 city charter and later given expanded powers as one of good government reforms intended to reduce corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to reform coalition of 1951 democrat alexander hemphill had been elected to office in 1957 and ran for reelection he was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in democratic politics who had worked with reformers in campaigns that ultimately defeated republican organization in 1951 hemphill was organization s nominee in 1957 but often clashed with dilworth and others his investigation had brought to light initial evidence leading to graft charges against members of his own party hemphill s opponent was joseph c bruno a west philadelphia lawyer who fended off a surprisingly strong primary protest vote for joseph a schafer an accountant from northeast philadelphia despite hemphill s investigation into alleged misconduct democratic party s scandals reduced his totals as well though still giving him a 55 000 vote victory over bruno hemphill continued in office until 1967 when he resigned to run for mayor judges and magistrates although pennsylvania s judges are elected in partisan elections there had been a tradition of not challenging re election of incumbents to that end judicial candidates were typically endorsed by both major parties but in 1953 democrats broke informal pact and endorsed just three of sitting judges resulting in an unusually intense contest by 1957 old order was mostly re established as all but one of sitting judges were endorsed for re election by both parties and returned to office without opposition in 1961 four common pleas court judges and two orphans court judges were on ballot and all were cross endorsed in accordance with sitting judge principle all were reelected to ten year terms including victor h blanc former district attorney there were also seven seats open for magistrate a local court duties of which have since been superseded by philadelphia municipal court in magistrate races a limited voting law meant that each political party could nominate four candidates and voters could only vote for four with result being that majority party could only take four of seven seats leaving three for minority party democrats took maximum number of four magistracies with all four of their incumbents being reelected led by harry c schwartz remaining three seats went to republicans with one spot going to only gop incumbent on ballot thomas a connor other two republicans elected were 42nd ward leader john p walsh and former police captain luke a mcbride who edged out court stenographer george j woods ballot questions at may primary two referendums were proposed first would permit sunday alcohol sales in hotels that had liquor licenses second would borrow 10 million for school construction both passed gathering 67 6 and 75 9 of vote respectively in november five more questions were on ballot all asking voters permission to borrow money for various infrastructure improvements all five approving a total of 65 million in loans passed by a two to one margin aftermath 1961 election confirmed democrats in power but their reduced margins and increased association with machine politics signaled beginning of end for party s coalition with independent good government reformers dilworth in particular saw election as a warning sign telling party that they must watch your ps and qs to avoid further setbacks even so green s control over federal patronage through kennedy administration and dilworth s resignation in 1962 to run for governor left democratic
