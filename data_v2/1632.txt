by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer naito 2006 p 36 in black frankenstein making of an american metaphor author elizabeth young theorized that crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as zip pinhead whose real name was william henry johnson and joseph merrick elephant man young 2008 p 81 it is also possible that crane found thematic

henry johnson henry who is described as a very handsome negro known to be a light a weight and an eminence in suburb of town crane 1899 p 6 is friendly toward jimmie later that evening henry dresses smartly and saunters through town inciting catcalls from friends and ridicule from local white men on his way to call on young bella farragut who is extremely taken with him that same evening a large crowd gathers in park to hear a band play suddenly nearby factory whistle blows to alert townspeople of a fire in second district of town men gather hose carts and head toward blaze that is quickly spreading throughout dr trescott s house mrs trescott is saved by a neighbor but cannot locate jimmie who is trapped inside henry appears from crowd and rushes into house in search of boy finding him unharmed in his bedroom unable to retreat way he came henry carries jimmie wrapped in a blanket to doctor s laboratory and hidden stairway that leads outside he discovers fire has blocked this way out as well and collapses beside dr trescott s desk a row of nearby jars shatters from heat spilling molten chemicals upon henry s upturned face dr trescott returns home to find his house ablaze after he is told by his hysterical wife that jimmie is still inside he rushes into house by way of laboratory s hidden passageway he finds jimmie still wrapped in blanket and carries him outside hearing that henry is inside house dr trescott attempts to re enter but is held back another man goes into house and returns with badly burned thing that used to be henry johnson injured men and boy are taken to judge denning hagenthorpe s house across street to be treated but while it is thought that dr trescott and jimmie will survive their injuries henry is pronounced as good as dead he is mourned as a hero by town henry johnson survives however under watchful eye of dr trescott who treats injured man out of gratitude for saving his son s life hagenthorpe a leading figure in town urges trescott to let henry die stating that he will hereafter be a monster a perfect monster and probably with an affected brain no man can observe you as i have observed you and not know that it was a matter of

psyche to a local negro household but henry s presence proves troubling for family s well being and he is moved to another one night henry visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake including bella farragut who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met not welcome anywhere else henry is eventually moved to carriage house in newly built trescott home despite dr trescott s protection henry is branded a monster by townspeople who avoid trescotts as a result although previously henry s friend jimmie now mocks him daring his friends to approach disfigured man once leading doctor in whilomville trescott s reputation suffers greatly as does that of his wife who no longer receives visitors style story is told from point of view of a selectively omniscient narrator who seemingly chooses whether or not to divulge plot points as they occur causing a pattern of expectation on part of reader giles 1992 p 52 although novella is separated into 24 chapters some critics among them charles b ives thomas gullason and marston believe these chapters are further divided into two parts chapters 1 9 lead up to henry s injury whereas chapters 10 24 map town s response schaefer 1996 p 258 critic david halliburton wrote in his 1989 book color of sky a study of stephen crane that monster displayed a more chastened and exact style than crane s earlier works which were often a mixture of clever bawdiness and epic dramatics both of which are seen respectively in maggie a girl of streets and red badge of courage halliburton 1989 pp 2 3 edwin h cady believed monster is best indication of writer crane may have become had he lived longer showcasing a style that is technically proficient controlled and broadly insightful schaefer 1996 p 256 monster relies heavily on crane s signature use of imagery and symbolism wolford 1989 p 49 frequent images and metaphors dealing with sight appear several times in story especially in regard to townspeople s lack of vision both literally and morally townspeople are similarly depicted using imagery of either animals or machines characterizing them as both bestial and mindless schaefer 1996 p 260 color imagery is also prevalent for example fire both literal and symbolic features prominently throughout story schaefer 1996 p 241 while critics as early as edward garnett in 1921 pointed to crane s heavy use of irony in monster other critics such as michael d warner question whether crane intended story to be read as ironic or if this is result of author s oddly contradictory attitude toward his characters warner 1985 p 76 in his introduction to 1921 s men women and boats one of first crane anthologies vincent starrett noted difference in tone between monster and 14 other tales that crane set in fictional whilomville he wrote realism is painful one blushes for mankind but while this story really belongs in volume called whilomville stories it is properly left out of that series whilomville stories are pure comedy and monster is a hideous tragedy weatherford 1997 p 313 critic william m morgan noted stories similar fascination with pure animal spirits and meanings of boyhood but differentiated monster focus on a larger more mature and modernizing community morgan 2004 p 72 paul sorrentino also pointed to style differences noting story s focus on adult characters rather than children as well as overall length of story at more than 21 000 words it dwarfs other whilomville tales sorrentino 2006 p 138 however there is disagreement among critics as to whether monster should be considered a short story or a novella crane called it a novelette and library of america edition refers to it as a novella young 2008 p 258 themes thumb stephen crane in 1894 print of a portrait by artist and friend corwin k linson question of morality plays a large role in monster especially in terms of compassion and tolerance several critics have pointed to novella s non absolute stance on these themes mainly in regard to dr trescott s ethical dilemma in his devotion to henry a black man and his son s savior as author patrick dooley points out what is at stake in monster is that if trescott is a moral man crane has rejected common sense morality if trescott s actions are and saintly however he is to be applauded and admired but ordinary moral behavior of average people and competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged dooley 1993 p 97 crane scholar stanley wertheim also noted duplicitous morality depicted by town of whilomville which exhibits prejudice fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill various critics have written about story s paradoxical themes of deformity and monstrosity not only does henry johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster but trescotts suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society mitchell 1990 p 180 trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when it becomes clear that townspeople s actions make them more monstrous than man they shun for his deformity as professor and critic lee clark mitchell asked in his essay face race and disfiguration in stephen crane s monster is monster disfigured black man or is it town that comes to dis figure him mitchell 1990 p 175 similarly harold bloom called monster an example of invasion myth made worse by fact that monster is born from within townspeople s collective mind henry monster is therefore generated by its fears of social instability its prejudices about appearance including racism and its all consuming passion for gossip and drama bloom 2004 p 330 trescott only man in town not to see henry as an invader also becomes ostracized by frenzied small town mentality bloom 2004 p 331 race is a polarizing theme throughout story as william m morgan wrote while white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless and black characters as warm and amusing town s racial hierarchy is omnipresent morgan 2004 p 82 slavery is referred to several times throughout story as critic nan goodman noted as a post civil war work monster revisits slavery s legacy as well as its effects on modern african americans like henry johnson at beginning of story it is made clear that white townspeople tolerate henry because he behaves himself and knows his place as a black man wolford 1989 p 47 later when henry struggles through burning house to save jimmie it is said that he was submitting submitting because of his fathers bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration goodman 2000 p 120 however while his suffering is central to story henry johnson is never really fleshed out as a character before fire he strikes in quick succession minstrel s poses of an old time happy go lucky negro who charms children and women alike despite his heroism morgan stated henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype morgan 2004 p 83 critics such as lillian gilkes and john r cooley have noted crane s lack of racial sensitivity while writing monster although they note that author was simply exhibiting unconscious racism in order to fulfill literary conventions of late 19th century schaefer 1996 p 252 in his 2002 essay blunders of virtue problem of race in stephen crane s monster john clemen sums up critics tendency to either ignore evidence of crane s racism to dismiss it as a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes or to reconfigure it within his irony in such a way as to enable story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight clemen 2002 p 121 reception and legacy thumb right monster is sometimes compared to mary shelley s frankenstein 1818 monster received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary critics before its publication crane s friend joseph conrad wrote while responding to a partial draft damned story has been haunting me i think it must be fine schaefer 1996 p 243 william dean howells an early champion of crane proclaimed novella to be greatest short story ever written by an american monteiro 2000 p 6 spectator concluded that monster alone would have cemented crane s literary reputation its reviewer wrote if mr crane had never written anything else he would have earned right of remembrance by this story alone monteiro 2009 p xix reviewer for critic dismissed it as an unpleasant story there is humor in telling but it is humor of a rather grim character wertheim 1994 p 423 julian hawthorne son of author nathaniel hawthorne also ultimately disliked novella calling it an outrage on art and humanity wertheim 1994 p 422 he did however point to similarities between crane s monster and victor frankenstein s creation in mary shelley s most famous work stating that crane like shelley before him successfully depicted an innocent outsider being tormented by townspeople who are themselves made monstrous by their irrational fears weatherford 1997 p 22 other critics have since echoed comparison between shelley s character and henry johnson elizabeth young explained parallels in that similar to frankenstein narrative in which a male body is hideously transformed in a scientist s laboratory and brought back by scientist from dead johnson s disfigurement takes place in a doctor s laboratory and it is trescott that ultimately saves him young 2008 p 84 monster and other stories was last collection of crane s work to be published during his lifetime in mid 20th century novella received a resurgence of critical attention especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th century new york critic chester l wolford wrote that story reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years story is indeed an excoriation of social conditions for blacks but more important it is an excoriation of all communities all societies in all places and all times wolford 1989 p 48 african american author ralph ellison called monster alongside mark twain s adventures of huckleberry finn one of parents of modern american novel schweik 2008 p 218 in a 1999 article critic james nagel stated that no other work of short fiction in decade was more important thematically and nothing until william faulkner s bear so enriched genre of united states nagel spring 1999 p 48 screenwriter and director albert band adapted crane s novella for 1959 film face of fire starring cameron mitchell as dr trescott and james whitmore as johnson unlike in original story johnson was depicted as
