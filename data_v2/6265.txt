shadow of templars and smoking mirror video game designer writer and director charles cecil began working on scenario for broken sword revolution software s third game following lure of temptress 1992 and beneath a steel sky 1994 in 1992 which would be set in paris with a knights templar storyline after visiting paris and reading holy blood and holy grail cecil was certain templars would be a good subject for a game cecil dave cummins and jonathan l howard began work on story and design cecil and cummins attended a film writing course and their script was read by senior bbc scriptwriter and dramatist alan drury steve ince who created initial location sketches for game before working on beneath a steel sky was promoted to producer halfway through project in 1994 cecil and noirin carmody met with sean brennan then head of publishing at virgin interactive and virgin agreed to publish game s pc version but were not interested in publishing game on playstation feeling that only 3d games would sell for console as a result cecil contacted sony computer entertainment who agreed to publish game for console tony warriner and david sykes were game s designer programmer carmody executive producer game uses virtual theatre engine as do revolution s previous two games one of cecil s goals was to depart from humour based adventure games more popular at time by creating a game with good pacing and a complex storyline a reason he thought knights templar would be an ideal subject broken sword offered a unique conversation icon system which would not reveal to player what protagonist was about to say cecil s intention was to make game more cinematic although aiming at designing a game with a cinematic feel cecil felt game should not resemble interactive movies of that time which he felt were mimicking movies he wanted to create two protagonists who would exchange ideas helping drive game along he made george american and nico french to appeal to us and european markets revolution believed they needed to utilise best of other creative industries hand drawn artwork was animated by artists including don bluth studios eoghan cahill and neil breen and red rover studio s mike burgess resulting in graphics animated in a style resembling classic animated films game s final cost was one million pounds broken sword ii smoking mirror was conceived in 1997 by cecil and revolution s crew hoggins tom january 4 2011 broken sword ii smoking mirror interview daily telegraph retrieved march 12 2012 artwork for broken sword 2 was developed through a number of stages initially pencil drawings were made of characters which were then digitally coloured in before being cleaned up background layouts were produced in a similar way also starting out as pencil designs they were all drawn by eoghan cahill and neil breen who both previously worked on original broken sword game while they were now working together with amy and lee taylor music in game was again composed by barrington pheloung with bob sekar adding closing score while rolf saxon returns to voice actor of george jennifer caron hall a bilingual actress and daughter of french actress leslie caron was cast as nico theatre director edward hall director rehearsed assembled actors and took no more than a week to record entire game according to an interview given by rolf saxon in 2011 alternative magazine game was first released for windows on october 31 1997 sleeping dragon and angel of death revolution first discussed idea of a third broken sword in 2000 at first sleeping dragon was planned to have similar cartoon quality visuals to first two broken sword games however revolution decided not to use flat look claiming it lacked visual depth team wanted game to look believable but not necessarily realistic similar to japanese animated films textures were hand drawn to achieve cartoon look while light map employed to create realistic lighting advances in hardware plus changes in methodology allowed game to move to 24 bit color to make game feel like a film revolution brought in a cinematic consultant bob keen who made sure game conveyed emotions and atmospheres appropriate for each scene music in game was composed by ben mccullough voice recording was scheduled to take five days however entire process took four days voices were recorded with voice actors together enabling better getting into their parts full script is 6 000 lines in total similar to broken sword ii while rolf saxon returns to voice george nico was this time played by sarah crook game s final cost was two million pounds revolution software and thq announced broken sword angel of death on august 17 2005 according to charles cecil broken sword was originally planned to be a trilogy but that after release of broken sword sleeping dragon demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming though sleeping dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as pc this approach required certain development compromises as pc version was held back by constraints of console versions as a result angel of death was written for pc only so as to really push boundaries in terms of technology and graphics as a series first revolution was not only developer but was co developed by revolution and sumo digital cecil believed that because of requirement for ever larger team sizes it was no longer possible to maintain a large development team to write single original titles resulting in revolution closed production side in order to concentrate on design and sumo to concentrate on production it is first game to be ambx enabled broken sword sleeping dragon was criticised for featuring a high number of action elements cecil stated that he aimed to put player under pressure while he still stood behind this principle he thought action elements were not right approach sleeping dragon was also criticised for using a high number of crate puzzles resulting in cecil reducing number of them music in game was composed by ben mccullough and features tracks by ubernoise while rolf saxon returns to voice george stobbart nicole nico collard was this time played by katherine pageon shadow of templars director s cut and smoking mirror remastered on march 21 2009 ubisoft released a special edition of shadow of templars for wii and nintendo ds according to cecil
