neil gaiman to revive dc s 1974 1976 series sandman written by joe simon and michael fleisher and illustrated by jack kirby and ernie chua gaiman had considered including characters from dream stream including kirby sandman brute glob and brothers cain and abel in a scene for first issue of his 1988 miniseries black orchid while scene did not make it into later drafts because roy thomas was using characters in infinity inc gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series gaiman mentioned his treatment in passing to dc editor karen berger while months later berger offered gaiman a comic title to work on he was unsure his sandman pitch would be accepted weeks later berger asked gaiman if he was interested in doing a sandman series gaiman recalled i said um yes yes definitely what s catch berger said there s only one we d like a new sandman keep name but rest is up to you gaiman crafted new character from an initial image of a man young pale and naked imprisoned in a tiny cell waiting until his captors passed away deathly thin with long dark hair and strange eyes gaiman patterned character s black attire on a print of a japanese kimono as well as his own wardrobe gaiman wrote an eight issue outline and gave it to dave mckean and leigh baulch who drew character sketches berger reviewed sketches along with some drawn by gaiman and suggested sam kieth as series artist mike dringenberg todd klein robbie busch and dave mckean were hired as inker letterer colorist and cover artist respectively mckean s approach towards comics covers was unconventional for he convinced berger that series s protagonist did not need to appear on every cover berger karen introduction sandman preludes and nocturnes original series debut issue of sandman went on sale november

exploring sandmans part of dc universe it started in august 2018 summary sandmans main character is dream titular sandman also known to various characters throughout series as morpheus shaper shaper of form lord of dreaming dream king dream sneak cat of dreams murphy kai and lord l zoril who is anthropomorphic personification of dreams at start of series morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years morpheus escapes in modern day and after avenging himself upon his captors sets about rebuilding his kingdom which has fallen into disrepair in his absence character s initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment at start of series but challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years in its beginnings series is a very dark horror comic later series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology ultimately placing its protagonist in role of a tragic hero storylines primarily take place in dreaming morpheus s realm and waking world with occasional visits to other domains such as hell faerie asgard and domains of other endless many use contemporary united states of america and united kingdom as a backdrop dc universe was official setting of series but well known dc characters and places were rarely featured after 1990 a notable exception is lyta hall formerly fury of 1980s super team infinity inc who figures prominently in kindly ones story arc and her superhuman abilities are not ignored most of storylines take place in modern times but many short stories are set in past taking advantage of immortal nature of many of characters and deal with historical individuals and events such as in short story men of good fortune themes and genre sandman comic book series falls within dark fantasy genre albeit in a more contemporary and modern setting critic marc buxton described book as a masterful tale that created a movement of mature dark fantasy which were largely unseen in previous fantasy works before it archive requires scrolldown comic book also falls into genres of urban fantasy epic fantasy historical drama superhero and is written as a metaphysical examination of elements of fiction in which neil gaiman accomplished through artistic use of unique anthropomorphic personifications mythology legends historical figures and occult culture making up most of major and minor characters as well as plot device and even settings of story in its earliest story arcs sandman mythos existed primarily in dc universe and as such numerous dc characters made some appearances or were mentioned later series would reference dcu less often while continuing to exist in same universe critic hilary goldstein described comic book as about concept of dreams more so than act of dreaming in early issues responsibility and rebirth were primary themes of story rauch 2003 p 76 as dream finally liberates himself from his occultist captors he returns to his kingdom which had fallen on hard times due to his absence while also facing his other siblings who each have their own reaction to his return story is structured not as a series of unconnected events nor as an incoherent dream but by having each panel have a specific purpose in flow of story dreams became core of every story arc written in series and protagonist s journey became more distinct and deliberate many vertigo books since such as and y last man have adopted this kind of format in their writing creating a traditional prose only seen in imprint collected editions sandman was initially published as a monthly serial in 32 page comic books with some exceptions to this

literary merit were i to list 100 best single comic book issues i have ever read three would come from this collection whether you have read sandman before or are a first timer this is one book you need to buy this fall stories within are magnificent and care taken in reproducing gaiman s work is same you d expect for any great work of literature adaptations into other media film throughout late 1990s a film adaptation of comic was periodically planned by warner bros parent company of dc comics roger avary was originally attached to direct after success of pulp fiction collaborating with pirates of caribbean screenwriters ted elliott and terry rossio in 1996 on a revision of their first script draft which merged preludes and nocturnes storyline with that of doll s house avary intended film to be in part visually inspired by animator jan s work avary was fired after disagreements over creative direction with executive producer jon peters best known for batman and superman lives it was due to their meeting on sandman film project that avary and gaiman collaborated one year later on script for beowulf project carried on through several more writers and scripts a later draft by william farmer reviewed at ain t it cool news was met with scorn from fans gaiman called last screenplay that warner bros would send him not only worst sandman script i ve ever seen but quite easily worst script i ve ever read gaiman has said that his dissatisfaction with how his characters were being treated had dissuaded him from writing any more stories involving endless although he has since written endless nights by 2001 project had become stranded in development hell in a q a panel at comic con 2007 gaiman remarked i d rather see no sandman movie made than a bad sandman movie but i feel like time for a sandman movie is coming soon we need someone who has same obsession with source material as peter jackson had with lord of rings or sam raimi had with spider man that same year he stated that he could imagine terry gilliam as a director for adaptation i would always give anything to terry gilliam forever so if terry gilliam ever wants to do sandman then as far as i m concerned terry gilliam should do sandman in 2013 dc president diane nelson said that a sandman film would be as rich as harry potter universe david s goyer announced in an interview in early december that he would be producing an adaptation of graphic novel alongside joseph gordon levitt and neil gaiman jack thorne was hired to write script on october 16 2014 gaiman clarified that while film was not

announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with studio over creative direction of film on november 9 2016 i09 reported that heisserer had turned in his draft of script but left film stating that film should be an hbo series instead television due to prolonged development period of film in 2010 dc entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation film

that warner bros television was licensing rights to produce a tv series and that supernatural creator eric kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt saga in march 2011 it was announced via neil
