gentlemen of philadelphia in a three day match starting september 29 on a small ground at belmont september grass was coarse it had been rolled so that ball moved very quickly across ground australian side fielding first dropped many catches and could not cope with short boundary allowing philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs king came in to bat last at number 11 making 36 runs leading australian bowlers hugh trumble and george giffen took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively when australians came to bat they hoped that they would by now have recovered from their tiring journey but

gentlemen of philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs cricket world was stunned that a single american city could turn out a side capable of beating full strength of australia australians won

a low level of competition in 1897 tour started on june 7 at oxford ending in late july at oval almost 2 months later schedule included fifteen matches against all of top county cricket teams oxford and cambridge university teams marylebone cricket club and two other sides though only a few of counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto field while tour initially aroused some curiosity many english fans lost interest until bart king and philadelphians met full sussex team at brighton on june 17 king demonstrated his batting ability in first innings with a fourth wicket stand of 107 with john lester he then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and philadelphia dismissed sussex for 46 in less than an hour king took 6 for 102 in sussex s second innings helping philadelphians to victory by 8 wickets despite excitement surrounding king s performance americans did not fare well overall and results may have been worse than hoped for by tour s promoters philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches losing nine and earning a draw in remaining four after their win against sussex only other win of tour came against warwickshire during this match king took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs according to wisden cricketers almanack king proved himself to be best bowler on american side and had to do much of work he bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else in

philadelphian team returned to england in 1903 this proved to be king s most successful tour particularly his performances in matches against lancashire and surrey king played in 13 of 15 matches on

gentlemen of ireland s first innings in 1909 was followed by a hat trick in second innings there is an apocryphal story of king emulating a famous baseball pitcher of day rube waddell by sending all his fielders back into pavilion and finishing off opponent s innings on his own king and belmont were playing trenton in halifax cup at elmwood cricket ground some versions of story have him banishing fielders and then calling one of them to a position back and to leg side this fielder was stationed there to pick up bails which landed at his feet after king bowled his trademark angler this story was disputed some years later by captain of trenton who claimed that when he went in to bat that afternoon king had four balls left in his over he claimed to have hit first delivery to cover point but of course there was no one there ball stopped within three feet of boundary and king had to chase it by time he got back we had run six captain claimed to be only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off king but commended bowler on his ability to spin a tale thanks to his dominant performance over his career and his renown in world of cricket king was elected an honorary member of incogniti cricket club in 1908 and an honorary life member of marylebone cricket club in 1962 when plum warner was asked to name greatest bowler who ever lived he said that john barton king at top of his power and speed was at least equal of greatest of them all king is credited as one of first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately other bowlers in his time could sometimes get ball to swing but king was one of first to do so at will with an old or new ball he made use of a lethal delivery which he called angler a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher to confuse english batsmen he would come in with ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher he was famous for his late swing in and out and would produce in swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder he described it as an in swinger which if properly bowled would change direction sharply in last 10 or of flight king used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen after a tour to philadelphia by an australian side in 1896 george giffen said philadelphians really have some high class players but it was fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that
