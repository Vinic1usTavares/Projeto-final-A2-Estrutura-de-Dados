dramatic theme of film was family disharmony and it took expected sentimental approach for era marie who identifies with her grandmother resolves that she is also only in way by virtue of being a cripple site states thanhouser seemed to have had a special sensitivity for feelings of children which is reflected in this film release and reception single reel film approximately 1 000 feet long was released on january 31 1911 billboard praised marie eline s acting also noting good photography in its review moving picture worlds review states part played by grandmother and one played by child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch heart person who can sit through this and not feel tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion new york dramatic mirror was open in its praise of film and its portrayal of subject through good acting but it also noted technical faults with film continuity reviewer wrote it was noticed that old lady s bag was brought on immediately already packed when she left son s house and when she left home it looks planned beforehand similar incidents have hurt excellence of a number of this company s superior films it would take time in life and a split in film would have done it such things spoil illusion to a spectator walton of moving picture news who typically praised thanhouser films deviated from norm by immediately dismissing film as a whole by stating this theme is getting threadbare a foreign film is almost identical son s wife acts brutally to her husband s mother things are set right by a child compare gaumont s twilight of a soldier s life etc acting of child is charming and of old lady a womanly concept even to details wife s grabbing old lady s bag umbrella etc was as one said who sat next to me a bit too rushed this criticism of theme was accurate because gaumont film company release had a nearly identical plot except that that grandma was an elderly soldier similarities between two films likely are coincidental because gaumont film was released four days prior q david bowers wrote a modern synopsis of production which contains more details than official publication from thanhouser company bowers was present for showing of this film at iona college in new rochelle on october 7 1988 and stated that film was met with cheers by an audience of about 400 persons a print of
