operation coburg 24 january 1 march 1968 was an australian and new zealand military action during vietnam war operation saw heavy fighting between 1st australian task force 1 atf and north vietnamese army and viet cong during wider fighting around long binh and bien hoa american and south vietnamese intelligence reports had indicated that an imminent communist offensive during tet new year festival was likely and in response australians and new zealanders were deployed away from their base in phuoc tuy province to bolster american and south vietnamese forces defending long binh bien hoa complex north east of saigon 1 atf deliberately established fire support bases astride communist lines of communication in vicinity of village of trang bom expecting that they would attempt to destroy them australians subsequently clashed with viet cong during early patrols in area of operations ao columbus while later fire support base fsb andersen was repeatedly subjected to major ground assaults although operation was mounted too late to prevent attacks on saigon australians and new zealanders successfully disrupted communist lines of communication limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack long binh bien hoa complex while they were also able to successfully interdict their withdrawal causing heavy casualties operation was also significant as it was first deployment of 1 atf outside its tactical area of responsibility taor in phuoc tuy and in this it set a precedent for later operations outside province meanwhile remaining australian forces in phuoc tuy province also successfully repelled repeated viet cong attacks against ba ria and long dien as part of tet offensive that had engulfed population centres across south vietnam background military situation thumb

offensive at 18 00 on 29 january 1968 south vietnamese forces began a 36 hour ceasefire in celebration of arrival of year of monkey earlier communists had declared a seven day ceasefire as part of tet festival that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in vietnamese society however unbeknown to south vietnamese and their allies north vietnamese leadership had decided to use ceasefire to launch a large offensive in south in order to break deadlock that had developed in conflict despite reluctance of democratic republic of vietnam president ho chi minh and defence minister general vo nguyen giap primarily brainchild of general nguyen chi thanh upcoming offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among south vietnamese people against government and its american supporters yet prudence required that south vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby while american and allied forces under general william westmoreland free world military forces remained on full alert however despite such measures fighting at khe sanh had largely succeeded in diverting american resources and attention away from saigon and towards demilitarized zone affording communists element of surprise meanwhile after a number of viet cong units mistakenly began planned offensive against south vietnam a day early attacking several towns in i and ii corps on morning of 30 january president of republic of vietnam nguyen van thieu subsequently cancelled ceasefire regardless offensive proper began in early hours of 31 january when 85 000 to 100 000 north vietnamese and viet cong troops simultaneously assaulted population centres and allied installations across south vietnam us and south vietnamese intelligence reports of impending attacks had afforded some forewarning and although failures had caught some allied units unprepared they did not come as a complete surprise indeed growing threat had earlier prompted lieutenant general frederick weyand commander of iii corps tactical zone to request use of 1st australian task force 1 atf now at full strength with three infantry battalions and support arms outside of their usual base in phuoc tuy province in order to defend vital bases in long binh bien hoa complex north east of saigon request was subsequently approved although australians only agreed on basis that one of their battalions 3rd battalion royal australian regiment 3 rar would remain at nui dat to secure it in case of attack prelude opposing forces on 24 january 1968 1 atf headquarters under command of brigadier ron hughes inserted by air into their new area of operations between bien hoa and long khanh provinces east of bien hoa approximately from nui dat initially force would consist of two battalions 2nd battalion royal australian regiment and 7 rar with armour from a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment m2a2 howitzers from 106th battery and 108th battery 4th field regiment royal australian artillery 161st royal new zealand artillery as well as aviation assets in support while later elements of 3 rar would also be committed victor company from royal new zealand infantry regiment was attached to 2 rar for operation coincidentally they would be operating in same area that 1 rar had fought in as part of us 173rd airborne brigade in november 1965 on that occasion 1 rar had encountered heavy resistance in a series of bunker systems protecting key communist supply lines at gang toi this time 1 atf would establish itself astride communist s lines of communication in expectation of provoking an aggressive response from north vietnamese and viet cong within days australians would establish a fire support base in order to deny communists access to suitable sites for launching rocket attacks on important allied bases and installations in long binh bien hoa complex including airbase at bien hoa and large long binh logistics depot thumb 200px right alt a black and

plan to protect these bases a combined us australian force would establish a screen to interdict movement along northern approaches to long binh bien hoa 1 atf was subsequently allocated north eastern sector into a new area of operations named ao columbus only sparsely inhabited ao columbus was situated east of long binh between highway 1 to south and song dong nai river to north rectangular in shape it measured from east to west and from north to south west of ao was mainly covered in jungle whilst grassland predominated in east meanwhile bien hoa airbase itself would be defended by us 199th light infantry brigade occupying ao uniontown to west across song dong nai us 101st airborne division occupied ao manchester while south vietnamese 18th infantry division defended its taor to north west concept of operations for operation coburg called for two infantry companies from 7 rar to move by road with rear echelon units in order to secure fsb andersen that had been established north of trang bom for easy access to route 1 remainder of battalion was deployed by helicopter along with 2 rar nz while 4th field regiment raa was inserted by road task force maintenance area was subsequently located at andersen with 1 atf re supplied throughout operation by elements of 1st australian logistic support group deployed forward in long binh fsb harrison was located to west of andersen with both bases positioned so that each could support other in event of attack a small number of sasr patrols would be used to provide reconnaissance for task force people s army of vietnam pavn forces identified in ao columbus included north vietnamese army and viet cong units and consisted of a battalion group from 274th regiment from viet cong 5th division a battalion of 84a artillery rocket regiment nva equipped with rocket launchers and mortars and a small element of dong nai regiment as well as other main force elements of 273rd regiment from viet cong 9th division local force elements included a number of company and platoon strength units in addition to various district and village guerrilla forces these forces were believed to be lying in wait to attack nearby american bases as part of planned offensive battle patrolling in ao columbus 24 january 16 february 1968 thumb 200px left alt a black and white image of new zealand soldiers and an armoured personnel carrier during operation coburg new zealanders from w coy rnzir patrolling during operation coburg february 1968 australians began an intensive patrol program in ao columbus and were soon fighting up to platoon sized viet cong units in a series of bunker complexes between 25 29 january australians conducted reconnaissance in force operations and a series of minor patrol clashes followed up to end of january on 26 january b company 2 rar nz fought a two hour action against about 25 viet cong entrenched in a bunker system while on same day 9 platoon c company 2 rar nz also assaulted and occupied a camp initially believed to be of similar strength and held it for 19 hours after repeated attacks from a viet cong force estimated to be of company strength meanwhile whilst providing flank security new zealanders in v company 2 rar nz engaged in a series of skirmishes which resulted in 12 viet cong dead and many weapons captured with two new zealanders wounded on 27 january there were heavier contacts still resulting in 14 australians wounded and one viet cong killed although 1 atf was well placed to deny communists use of its ao it was increasingly obvious that there was little role for sas indeed heavy presence of viet cong prevented them from operating normally and first attempt to insert a patrol was called off due to presence of hostile forces in vicinity of landing zone two viet cong were subsequently killed and patrol was extracted after only 30 minutes a second attempt lasted only fifteen minutes longer and they were also extracted following a brief contact finally two patrols were joined together in an effort to provide more protection and on 29 january they patrolled out from 7 rar battalion headquarters after only 30 minutes australians encountered a small party of viet cong however they tried again two hours later but were detected following day they tried for a third time and were contacted unable to operate effectively sas patrols were withdrawn and returned to nui dat on 1 february meanwhile on 29 january d company 7 rar contacted a battalion concentrating in bunkers during a two and half hour battle that saw nine australian casualties including one killed while seven viet cong were also killed on 31 january viet cong overran village of trang bom just south west of fsb andersen australians reclaimed it that afternoon only for communists to attack again next day once again australians recaptured it this time in savage house to house fighting involving d company 2 rar nz and a squadron 3 cav c company 3 rar was subsequently inserted to assist with protection of fsb harrison in response to attack on trang bom d company 7 rar was dispatched forward to search area lead platoon advanced on a viet cong camp later found to be battalion size and was almost destroyed in ensuing firefight with half platoon soon becoming casualties another platoon was moved forward to aid their extraction close support from artillery protected australians from further casualties however and viet cong was eventually forced to withdraw six australians had been killed and 36 wounded in engagements up to that point while one new zealander had also died and one wounded more than 40 viet cong had been killed and nine wounded in early hours of 31 january key installations in long binh bien hoa complex in ao uniontown had come under heavy attack by viet cong 5th division as part of second prong of communist attacks against saigon with tet offensive erupting across south vietnam bien hoa airbase received heavy rocket fire that caused extensive damage to buildings aircraft and facilities while long binh logistics depot and prisoner of war camp were also hit over next three days us 199th light infantry brigade later reinforced by us 11th armored cavalry regiment and an infantry battalion from us 101st airborne division were forced into heavy combat fending off communist indirect fire and ground attacks by 1 february americans had gained upper hand however out last remaining viet cong following a sweep of bien hoa that cleared town thumb 200px right alt a colour picture of a four man australian sas patrol wearing their distinctive tiger stripe uniforms an australian sasr patrol attacks on bien hoa forced a change in tactics for australians and 1 atf s mission was quickly changed from reconnaissance in force to a blocking operation designed to intercept withdrawing communist forces between 31 january and 1 february australian battalions moved into company blocking positions and a number of minor contacts occurred resulting in some viet cong casualties and capture of more weapons and equipment once in position intensity of these clashes increased as australians sprung platoon ambushes indeed during early february nature of contacts in ao columbus began to change with australians increasingly faced by larger company sized main force units located in static defensive positions during first week of february viet cong began streaming through ao retreating from saigon in wake of heavy losses during tet although viet cong managed to avoid becoming decisively engaged around 90 were killed and five captured as australians maintained their blocking positions c company 7 rar had been detached in order to protect task force headquarters as well as to act as a reserve and was particularly heavily engaged during this phase force had been gradually patrolling when north of trang bom on morning of 5 february it contacted a large viet cong force consisting of a regimental headquarters and three companies in a well constructed defensive position defended by several heavy machine guns australians assaulted position on three occasions over next three days in vicious fighting supported by airstrikes artillery and helicopter gunships during one such attack on 7 february lieutenant mark moloney one of company s platoon commanders charged forward with six rocket launchers to attack a series of bunkers single handed moloney succeeded in destroying several before he fell badly wounded he survived and for his actions was recommended for a victoria cross moloney s award was never made however although gunner michael williams and corporal graham griffith were both awarded military medal for their actions under fire battle continued for seven hours with australians eventually routing defenders in bunker system in a battle later hailed as probably one of most brilliant actions ever fought by an australian rifle company however amidst confusion of tet such efforts went largely unnoticed by western press early same morning night harbour occupied by new zealanders from v company 2 rar nz had been attacked by a viet cong force consisting of elements of three companies from 274th regiment shortly after stand to at 06 15 incident proved to be most intense fighting involving new zealand forces in vietnam to that point and over course of an hour attack was successfully repelled with assistance of highly accurate artillery support from 108th battery raa operating in direct support as well as from mortar fire viet cong withdrew following arrival of a light fire team of gunships leaving behind 13 dead and a number of other blood trails nine new zealanders were wounded in engagement six of whom subsequently required evacuation by helicopter elsewhere tet had also engulfed phuoc tuy province and although stretched thin remaining australian forces there were soon drawn into heavy combat as viet cong units simultaneously attacked main provincial towns dunstan was forced to dispatch task force reaction force from nui dat with a company 3 rar under command of major brian howard moving to reinforce south vietnamese government forces following an attack by a 600 strong force from d445 vc battalion on ba ria provincial capital before first light on 1 february fighting from street to street in a series of firefights at close quarters australians successfully repelled attack killing 40 viet cong later on 3 february d company 3 rar spoiled a harassing attack on long dien and conducted a sweep of hoa long overall fighting in phuoc tuy between 1 9 february resulted in 50 viet cong killed 25 wounded and one prisoner five australians were killed and 24 wounded while australians in ao columbus had successfully interrupted pre positioning of communist forces on one of main approaches to saigon in hindsight they had been deployed too late to interfere seriously with offensive over period 9 12 february 1 atf redeployed moving south back towards fire support bases remaining companies of 3 rar subsequently relieved 7 rar and moved north on 11 february with w company from rnzir joining them on 12 february while 2 rar nz returned to nui dat on 13 february fsb harrison was abandoned and all command and support elements concentrated at fsb andersen contact was minimal during this period with just three viet cong killed fighting at fsb andersen

andersen south vietnam 1968 australian defence of fsb andersen was left to 3 rar m113 armoured personnel carriers from 1 troop a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment and a troop of engineers from 1st field squadron artillery support was provided by 161st field battery royal new zealand artillery and american m109 self propelled medium guns of b battery 2 35th artillery regiment a radar detachment from 131st divisional locating battery was also attached as were elements of 161st reconnaissance flight a company 3 rar together with supporting arms was left to defend base while other three rifle companies and new zealand rifle company continued reconnaissance in force operations throughout ao airstrikes and artillery also targeted known viet cong base areas however number of ground contacts was limited late on evening of 17 18 february viet cong and north vietnamese army launched an assault on fsb andersen first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and mortar barrage in early hours of morning followed by two waves of infantry each of company size attack focused on south west of perimeter manned by 3 rar s echelon and mortar platoon as well as an american medium artillery battery perimeter wire was subsequently breached but attack was repulsed by mortar counter battery fire claymore mines and heavy weight of machine gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and american gunners communist barrage had had a devastating effect falling among american and new zealand gun positions mortar lines and battalion echelon as well as scoring a direct hit on an australian engineer standing patrol a second attack shortly after this time from north was repelled by small arms fire from forward australian pits total viet cong casualties were unknown although four bodies were found on wire at dawn while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of perimeter and a suspected mortar base plate location seven australians and one american were killed while 22 australians and three americans were wounded thumb 200px right alt a black and white image of a new zealand howitzer during operation coburg a 105 mm m2a2 howitzer from 161 battery royal new zealand artillery fires during operation coburg as a result of growing threat to australian base decision was made to reinforce fsb andersen with c company 3 rar flown in by time of second attack two nights later apcs had also been redeployed to cover south east ridge and southern approach from trang bom communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 february this time focussing on south east and was preceded by heavy machine gun fire attack was stopped short of wire regardless forward pits were hit by rifle grenades while assault pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges only casualties were four viet cong killed final attack on 28 february also began with a mortar attack but communist assault wave was broken up by mortar fire and was forced to withdraw to east three americans were wounded a clearing patrol later revealed that viet cong had inserted a mortar team to edge of rubber trees by night in a and a cart and had then manhandled tubes into position 3 rar s defence of fsb andersen was first occasion in history of their operations in vietnam that an australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in defence throughout later part of operation patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched ao and although contact was infrequent patrols had been effective in denying subsequent use of area to launch rocket attacks against bases in long binh and bien hoa aftermath casualties operation coburg ended on 1 march 1968 with 3 rar and w coy rnzir redeploying to nui dat by air fighting had cost australians 17 killed and 61 wounded while allied casualties included one new zealander killed and thirteen wounded and one american killed and six wounded communist casualties included at least 145 killed 110 wounded and 5 captured with many more removed from battlefield large quantities of weapons and equipment were also captured by australians overall coburg was considered a success by australians and americans although they had been inserted too late to prevent attacks during tet 1 atf had successfully disrupted communist lines of communication limiting their freedom of manoeuvre to attack long binh bien hoa complex while australians had also successfully interdicted viet cong withdrawal causing heavy casualties operation was also significant because it had also been first deployment of 1 atf outside phuoc tuy and in this it set a precedent for later operations outside province royal australian regiment and 3rd cavalry regiment were subsequently awarded battle honour bien hoa one of only five presented to australian units during war assessment at strategic level general uprising never eventuated and in late february communist offensive collapsed suffering more than 45 000 killed against south vietnamese and allied losses of only 6 000 men it had been a tactical disaster for communists regardless offensive was a turning point in war prior to tet american commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning war arguing that westmoreland s strategy of attrition had reached point where communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced yet scale of fighting and surprise and violence with which offensive was launched had shocked public contradicting such predictions of imminent victory confidence in military and political leadership collapsed as did public support for war in america ultimately tet was a publicity and media triumph for communists and hanoi emerged with a significant political victory in its wake president lyndon johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office subsequent operations tet had a similar effect on australian public opinion and caused growing uncertainty in government about determination of united states to remain militarily involved in southeast asia amid initial shock prime minister john gorton unexpectedly declared that australia would not increase its military commitment in vietnam beyond current level of 8 000 personnel war continued without respite however and between may and june 1968 1 atf was again deployed away from phuoc tuy in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive australians subsequently took up positions north east of saigon during operation toan thang i to interdict communist lines of communication fighting a series of significant actions over a 26 day period that became known as battle of coral balmoral notes footnotes citations references category
