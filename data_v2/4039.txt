southampton s town walls are a sequence of defensive structures built around town in southern england although earlier roman and anglo saxon settlements around southampton had been fortified with walls or ditches later walls originate with move of town to current site in 10th century this new town was defended by banks ditches and natural curve of river and coastline normans built a castle in southampton but made no attempts to improve wider defences of town until early 13th century when southampton s growing prosperity as a trading centre and conflict with france encouraged construction of a number of gatehouses and stone walls to north and east sides of settlement in 1338 southampton was raided by french forces town s defences proved inadequate particularly along quays on west and south of city edward iii ordered some immediate improvements to southampton s town walls but it was not until 1360s that substantial work began over coming decades town was entirely enclosed by a 2 km 1 25 mile long stone wall with 29 towers and eight gates with advent of gunpowder weapons in 1360s and 1370s southampton was one of first towns in england to install new technology to existing fortifications and to build new towers specifically to house cannon southampton s town walls remained an important defensive feature during 15th century gatehouses sometimes being used as important civic facilities including acting as town s guildhall and housing town s gaol from end of 17th century their importance steadily declined and walls were slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout 18th and 19th centuries this process continued into early 20th century until in post war years walls were recognised as an important historical feature of southampton conservation projects have since occurred and walls are now promoted as a tourist attraction history 1st 10th centuries several earlier settlements were built near modern southampton featuring protective town walls following roman conquest of britain in ad 43 fortress settlement of clausentum was established it was an important trading port and a defensive outpost for town of winchester located on site of manor today a suburb of modern southampton clausentum was defended on its eastern landwards side by a flint stone wall and two ditches grinsell p 208 after fall of roman empire in 7th and 8th centuries anglo saxons built a planned settlement called close to current location of southampton approximately on location of later st mary s church at least some parts of this burh town had a ditch dug around it 3 m 10 feet wide and 1 5 m 5 feet deep and possibly was defended by a bank of earth creighton and higham p 56 in 10th century viking raids prompted settlement of southampton to move to its current location 11th 13th centuries thumb arundel tower on north east corner of circuit by time that normans conquered england in 1066 town of southampton occupied a rectangular area overlooking mouth of river test an important medieval waterway it was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to north and east mackenzie p 212 pounds p 152 southampton at this time was a relatively large town but not as significant as in later medieval period dyer p 62 normans built a castle within town on site of a probable large english hall and considerable damage was caused to surrounding local buildings as space was opened up for new fortification drage p 119 ottaway p 171 liddiard p 19 during years of anarchy in which empress matilda and stephen fought for control of england southampton was held by william le gros bishop of winchester and a supporter of stephen white p 7 when henry ii came to throne in 1153 he took back southampton and carried out improvements to castle as part of his attempt to improve general standard of security in south by second half of 12th century southampton was increasingly important for coastal defence and as a base for operations on continent pounds p 152 following threat of french invasion in 1170s henry ii invested modest additional resources in castle but no efforts were undertaken to improve town s ditches and banks brown 1962 p 42 pounds p 78 thumb left tudor merchants hall l and west gate r by 12th century southampton was an important trading port with trade routes to normandy levant and gascony mackenzie p 212 both town and castle played an important role in this trade in part forming a warehouse for king s imports this process being managed by a crown bailiff brown 1999 p 156 former castle hall was turned into a subterranean vault in 13th century probably for storing wine mackenzie p 212 brown 1999 p 156 stone houses often combining accommodation and storage facilities began to be built in southampton by wealthiest merchants particularly in prosperous western and southern parts of town but these properties could not be easily defended against attack creighton and higham p 70 english channel was contested militarily between england and france during 13th century and southampton was both an important base for naval operations and a tempting target for raiders hughes p 123 at start of 13th century additional work was therefore conducted to improve town s defences king granted ps100 in 1202 and again in 1203 to help develop earth banks around town by 1217 east gate had been built probably of stone turner pp 170 171 in 1260 a murage grant was given to southampton by edward i allowing town to tax selected imports to build and maintain new stone walls these initial murage grants ran from 1260 to 1275 and were then renewed between 1282 and 1285 and from 1286 to 1291 turner p 171 by end of this work many of earth banks in north and east of town had been converted to stone there appears to have been little interest in defending west and south quays however probably because doing so would have hampered southampton s merchants when they moved their trading goods in and out of

stone towers of bargate and some of semi circular wall towers work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to south and west of town construction may have begun at south gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near western docks turner p 172 hughes p 135 msh2247 southampton her accessed 19 october 2011 later investigations by crown would suggest that some of monies raised in these murage grants had been however contributing to poor standard of town defences which included large gaps in walled circuit turner p 172 in 1338 there was a successful french attack on southampton town s defences particularly in west proved quite inadequate and french succeeded in burning numerous buildings down particularly along western quays and damaging castle ottaway p 171 turner p 172 msh23 southampton her accessed 20 january 2011 edward iii responded to raid by taking immediate steps to shore up southampton s defences and ordering town to be fully enclosed by stone walls in 1339 sheriff conscripted workmen and specialists to improve defences and money to pay for building materials was raised by commuting prison sentence of a senior official in southampton to a fine turner p 173 murage grants were reinstated in 1345 but economy of southampton had been temporarily devastated by raids and indeed never fully recovered turner p 173 hughes p 131 coppack pp 19 20 king s instructions to fully enclose town with walls could not be carried out nonetheless by 1350s southampton had mounted mangonel and siege engines on existing walls creighton and higham p 110 in 1360 king conducted an inquiry into southampton s defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to examine how best to improve them turner p 173 creighton and higham p 183 commission came to a number of conclusions town walls should be better maintained and kept clear of housing and other obstructions number of gateways in walls should be reduced and a water filled ditch should be built to further reinforce walls on west enquiry also concluded that outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing sea should be filled in to form a more defensible line resulting work on southampton s defences resulted in considerable improvements by late 14th century town was completely encircled by 2 km 1 25 miles of stone walls some existing buildings including a dovecote were reinforced and pressed into service as part of defences creighton and higham p 147 south gate was built to protect southern quays with a wide archway complete with parapets and machicolations building work proved very expensive however and despite mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from citizens parliament had to be asked several times in 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by southampton turner pp 174 175 in 1370 french made a successful attack on portsmouth commencing a new sequence of raids along english coast emery p 284 in due course first edward then richard ii responded by improving defences in south of england part of this involved improving condition of southampton castle where owing in part to theft of building materials including stone and lead by citizens of town defences were in a poor condition emery pp 284 298 mackenzie p 213 henry yevele who oversaw improvements to castle probably also constructed arcades along western walls in 1380 this involved adopting 1360 proposal to block up properties along western quay to form a solid wall and adding three towers and gunports sir john sondes and john polymond were appointed by king in 1386 to further improve town walls working with sir john arundel castle governor polymond and arundel towers were probably named after these men around this time turner p 175 one of major changes from 1370s onwards was adaptation of town walls to mount gunpowder weapons creighton and higham p 111 at this time cannon were still unreliable only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required construction of specialist gunports cannons fired stone cannonballs which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications rather than as an offensive weapon by besiegers pounds p 253 turner p 175 first gunports in britain were installed in 1360s on isle of wight but southampton was not far behind around 1378 to 1379 ongoing french threat led to gunports for handguns being built into western arcade wall and by 1382 town bought its own gun creighton and higham p 111 msh919 southampton her accessed 14 october 2011 god s house tower was built to defend southern quays around 1417 and sluices that controlled level of town s moats and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points and by 1439 catchcold tower had also been constructed again designed to accommodate gunpowder weapons turner p 175 kenyon p 146 another change in 1370s was formalisation of process of guarding and maintaining walls creighton and higham p 191 during invasion scare of 1377 edward instructed mayor to review these processes it appears that four wards of town were surveyed and each property was assigned a piece of wall to maintain varying according to size of property creighton and higham p 190 for these purposes walls were measured out in units called or embrasures four wards were also responsible for security and policing of town 15th 16th centuries thumb god s house gate l and tower r on south east corner of walls threat of french attack continued throughout 15th century instead of relying on murage grants more funds for town walls were directly granted by king in 1400 including an ongoing annual grant of ps100 concerns increased significantly after invasion scare of 1457 when french troops successfully attacked town of sandwich on south coast griffiths p 815 indeed guns on southampton s walls were fired at french raiding ships same year kenyon p 147 walls continued to be maintained for rest of century with ps40 being allocated annually between 1478 and 1485 for this purpose turner p 176 by contrast castle fell into a rapid decline and its inner bailey became used first as a rubbish tip then for small scale agriculture msh23 southampton her accessed 20 january 2011 nonetheless a report on quality of walls around 1460 noted that on north and east sides of southampton walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for a man to stand on them a wood and earth wall walk had been built behind walls but this was proving very expensive to maintain creighton and higham p 89 this contemporary assessment of weakness of eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation in places it was only 0 76 m 2 49 feet thick compared to a typical thickness in other english town walls of around 1 m 3 28 feet creighton and higham p 155 hughes p 134 a survey in 1454 undertaken against background of another french invasion scare shows that 1377 system for maintaining walls was still in operation a town gunner had also been appointed by 15th century earning highest salary of any local official and was responsible for maintaining guns and manufacturing gunpowder as late as mid 16th century additional improved rectangular gunports similar to those on device forts along channel were added to west gate by quays several of gatehouses played an important part in administration of town in 15th century south gate formed main administrative centre for port during period housing clerk of king s ships and collecting customs revenue msh2247 southampton her accessed 19 october 2011 it was expanded in 1430s and 1440s but was in poor condition again by 1480s resulting in fresh construction work around site bargate was partially used as a prison from 15th century in a similar fashion to many other towns pugh p 103 and higham pp 170 171 msh2240 southampton her accessed 14 october 2011 first floor of building had been used as town s guildhall from at least 1441 onwards and treasury was kept in one of towers creighton and higham p 169 msh2240 southampton her accessed 14 october 2011 elaborate feasts were served there on special occasions creighton and higham p 170 17th 20th centuries town walls became less important for defence in 17th century although in 1633 a footpath was built around inside of wall to help watch and other law officers better pursue vagrants and criminals creighton and higham p 223 walls fared better than southampton castle which was sold off to property speculators in 1618 but they played no part in english civil war emery p 292 msh23 southampton her accessed 20 january 2011 some of masonry from castle was reused to strengthen town walls in 1650 during third english civil war in 18th century onwards town walls were often adapted for new uses or simply demolished as early as 1641 chapel above east gate had been leased out to private tenants msh39 southampton her accessed 14 october 2011 by 1707 part of god s house tower was being used as a prison from 1786 it became official town gaol as century progressed east gate was demolished in 1774 south gate was mostly demolished in 1803 and biddles gate shortly afterwards along with large

awkward facility containing around a dozen prisoners in damp conditions and where it was hard to separate male and female prisoners in an appropriate fashion committee of society for improvement of prison discipline pp 95 95 in 1855 its role as a gaol was concluded and building fell into disuse thumb left south gate tower in other areas civic improvements were attempted in 1853 forty steps were

october 2011 urban growth of southampton as in many english walled towns and cities put considerable pressure on older fortifications in 1898 to 1899 for example parts of wall west of biddles gate including a square tower were demolished to create western esplanade road southampton her accessed 14 october 2011 by second half of century bargate and surrounding walls were creating serious traffic congestion various options were considered to relieve this including demolition but it was not until 1930s that decision was made to retain gatehouse but to destroy walls on either side creighton and higham p 237 some parts of southampton walls were used to mount searchlights and machineguns on during second world war walls escaped damage unlike many other areas of medieval city creighton and

north wales that could be isolated from rest of walls by removing small wooden bridges turner p 166 in general town walls at southampton were poorly built in a somewhat chaotic fashion over several years by contrast surviving gatehouses are sophisticated and well designed probably as a result of their civic importance creighton and higham p 37 archaeologists oliver creighton and robert higham describe surviving walls as extremely well preserved and containing unique survivals in a british context creighton and higham p 257 in south east corner of walls is god s house tower this is
