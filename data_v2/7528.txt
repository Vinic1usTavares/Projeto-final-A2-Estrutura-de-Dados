28 cm sk l schnelladekanone quick loading cannon l lange in length in caliber was a german naval gun that was used in world war i and world war ii as main armament of and pre dreadnoughts naval guns thumb left profile drawing of 28 cm sk l 40 gun in naval mounting 28 cm sk l 40 gun weighed had an overall length of and a bore length of although designated as its actual caliber was it used krupp s horizontal sliding block or wedge as it is sometimes referred to breech design rather than interrupted screw commonly used in heavy guns of other nations this required that propellant charge be loaded in a metal case usually brass which provides or sealing of breech to prevent escape of expanding propellant gas 28 cm sk l 40 was last large german naval gun to load all its propellant in a single case later guns required a fore charge in addition to main charge in cartridge case drh l c 01 turret was used by braunschweig and deutschland class battleships one twin gun turret at each end its guns could depress 4deg and elevate 30deg and could traverse about 150deg on either side of centerline it could fire a l 2 6 armor piercing shell to a maximum range of at maximum elevation these ships stowed 85 rounds per gun rate of fire for both types of turrets was about 2 rounds per minute treaty of versailles allowed germans to retain four pre dreadnoughts although only two and were rearmed with their original 28 cm sk l 40 guns former fired first shots of world war ii when she began bombarding polish defenses on westerplatte on 1 september 1939 while latter also participated in polish campaign however both ships were relegated to training duties shortly afterwards gardiner and gray pp 141 42 coast defense guns thumb 200px left a sk l 40 gun on a coastal defense mount in belgium alt thumb 200px left side view of a bruno and its crew in 1918 some of 28 cm sk l 40 guns were transferred to german army from navy kaiserliche marine when pre dreadnoughts began to be disarmed and relegated to training duties in 1916 after battle of jutland had proved that they were not suitable for contemporary naval combat one obvious change made for land service was placement of a large counterweight just forward of trunnions to counteract preponderance of weight towards breech this although heavy was simpler than adding to perform same function it was fitted with a hydro pneumatic system to absorb recoil from firing and to return gun to its firing position ready for next round first four guns were placed in bettungsschiessgerust firing platform bsg mountings in 1917 for coast defense duties as part of batterie graf spee on island of wangerooge these were a semi portable mount that could be emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare position it rotated on a pivot at front of mount and rear was supported by rollers resting on a semicircular rail and was sometimes equipped with a gun shield francois p 38 gun s rate of fire in these mounts was about one round per five minutes gander and chamberlain p 269 during world war ii only seven guns were used as coast defense duties on bsg mountings four guns of batterie graf spee had survived world war i and were transferred to brest france in 1940 rolf 1998 p 2004 p 446 railway guns approximately twenty other guns from battleships were put on railroad mountings as 28 cm sk l 40 bruno and used as railway guns a number were kept by kaiserliche marine and used on coastal defense duties but others were used by heer in more traditional roles as long range heavy artillery surviving weapons were used by germans in world war ii as coast defense duties francois pp 62 68 ammunition before and during world war i gun used about of rp c 12 rohr pulver tube powder propellant that was a mix of nitrocellulose nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2975 kelvins in world war ii it was replaced by rp c 38 that substituted diethylene glycol for which had a calorific value of 810 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2495 k this had virtue of being harder to ignite lessening risk of a catastrophic fire or explosion and reduced erosive effects of gaseous propellant on gun s bore campbell p 221 sources differ on amount of rp c 38 used by gun during world war ii campbell says campbell p 233 but hogg says hogg p 239
