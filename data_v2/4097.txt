in new york city blackout liner notes lewis had wanted to work with her for a long time and was motivated to produce something for her that was going to help her project become a great project to come back with smith stated that team tried to create a record for britney spears that we know and love and that it did not touch on anything that was really dealing with all stuff that she was dealing with both commented that although spears arrived late to recording sessions she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism with lewis adding it was absolutely nuts and she took directions very well i don t know what i was expecting because we went in to cut that record day after she filed divorce from kevin federline heaven on earth was written by nicole morier nick huntington and michael latter two known as freescha although morier had been writing songs with greg kurstin and other artists she felt she hadn t really found her niche until she wrote heaven on earth which she described as a very honest song after she played song to her publisher they met with spears and her a r teresa labarbera whites who both loved it morier described heaven on earth as song that transformed her career t pain who co wrote hot as ice was in studio with spears in february 2007 and stated that one of three songs they recorded was finished in only an hour he said that he thought she was going to be sitting on couch eating doritos or nachos or something but she came in shook my hand gave me a hug and went right in booth she got in there and put it down christian karlsson and pontus winnberg known as bloodshy avant co wrote and co produced radar freakshow and toy soldier in late 2006 when album was considered to be finished they were persuaded by labarbera whites to work on a new track winnberg commented that it had always been an unwritten rule to not write songs about spears personal life since sweet dreams my la ex an answer song to justin timberlake s cry me a river was rejected by her record label however duo wrote piece of me with klas ahlund anyway as an answer to spears critics and sent it to singer who loved it winnberg stated we knew that song broke all rules we had when she came to studio she was extremely psyched had learned lyrics by heart in car and recorded song on half an hour before album s release labarbera whites told mtv news that album shows a lot of growth as a performer she was very involved in songs and how they turned out it s her magic that turns these songs into what they are among producers who worked on blackout but didn t make album were scott storch dr luke and ne yo music and lyrics danja stated that spears objective was to make a fun danceable album with uptempo high energy music saying she wanted to stay away from being personal it s fun it s basic and there s nothing wrong with that it s about feeling good celebrating womanhood blackout is a primarily dance pop and electropop album album opens with first single gimme more a dance pop and electropop song song opens with a spoken intro in which spears says line it s britney bitch while lyrics appear to be about dance and sex they are actually about media s fascination with her private life as noted in lines cameras are while we re dirty dancin they keep watchin keep watchin next song and second single piece of me runs through a down tempo dance beat and consists of over top vocal distortions causing a split sound effect and making it difficult to discern which voice is spears it talks about fame and is written like a biography retelling her mishaps while she sings in a nearly spoken manner third track of album radar is an electropop and euro disco song which features distorted synthesizers emulating sonar pulses that received comparisons to those of soft cell s tainted love 1981 in lyrics spears lets subject know he is on her radar while she lists qualities man has fourth song and third single break ice opens with spears singing lines it s been a while i know i shouldn t have kept you waiting but i m here now song features a choir and keri hilson singing background vocals sounding almost like a duet hilson explained song is about two people a girl and a guy and girl is saying you re a little cold let me warm things up and break ice after chorus bridge begins with spears saying i like this part mimicking janet jackson in nasty 1986 album s fifth track heaven on earth is a euro disco love song with new wave influences it is inspired by donna summer s i feel love 1977 with three vocal lines taking place over beat nicole morier commented that song was written from a very dark place saying i was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that i have all these imperfections i think what s touching about it is that it s from perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good spears named song her favorite from blackout sixth track get naked i got a plan is an uptempo song about sex it is a duet between spears and danja who sings chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan spears contributes a series of gasps sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted seventh track freakshow is built around effect of dubstep spears sings about dancing and being in spotlight in lyrics such as make them other chicks so mad i m bout to shake my ass snatch that boy so fast during bridge her vocals are pitched down low making her sound masculine nearly a decade after release of blackout spears stated freakshow is one of her favorite tracks that weren t released as singles describing it as sassy toy soldier is an upbeat dance pop song reminiscent of destiny s child s song lose my breath 2004 that showcases a military drumroll and features spears singing about needing a new lover in hot as ice she sings in a higher register i m just a girl with ability to drive a man crazy make him call me mama make him my new baby blackouts tenth track ooh ooh baby contains a flamenco guitar and blends beat from gary glitter s rock and roll 1972 and melody of turtles happy together 1967 in lyrics she sings to a lover touch me and i come alive i can feel you on my lips i can feel you deep inside kara dioguardi said she was inspired by relationship between spears and her first son in studio saying i would look at two of them way they looked at each other and way she would hold baby it kind of struck me as interesting at times it d be about a kid at times about a lover perfect lover has a propulsive belly dance beat in which spears sings lyrics such as tick tock tick tock come and get me while i m hot twelfth track is why should i be sad a midtempo song directed to her ex husband kevin federline bonus track exclusive to target outta this world is a mid tempo electro song with spears singing romantic lyrics to a lover i keep singing universes about you there ll always be verses about you everybody samples

sacrament mccaffrey added all we see is how troubled this girl is now especially with her family losing her kids with her career on a downward slide and now she s put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it gil kaufman of mtv said that images were reminiscent of madonna s music video for like a prayer 1989 booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and

trouble gimme more began and camera panned out to reveal spears wearing a black jewel encrusted bikini and black boots she was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around audience performance was universally panned by critics jeff leeds of new york times said that no one was prepared for sunday night s fiasco in which a listless ms spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip synch her new single vinay menon of toronto star commented spears looked hopelessly dazed she was wearing expression of somebody who had been deposited at palms casino resort by a tornado one that promptly twisted away taking her clothing and sense of purpose she was lumbering in slow motion as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots david willis of bbc stated her performance would go down in history books as being one of worst to grace mtv awards unlike spears previous albums blackout was not heavily promoted through magazine interviews talk show appearances or televised performances besides performance at video music awards and was not accompanied by a

ice was released instead and radar was chosen as fourth single however release was pushed back when spears began recording new material for her sixth studio album circus it was later released as fourth single and a bonus track from that album critical reception blackout received generally favorable reviews from music critics on music review aggregator metacritic album holds a score of 61 out of 100 indicating generally positive reviews based on 24 reviews retrospective reviews however have praised album and cited it as a strong influence over music of late 2000s and early 2010s stephen thomas erlewine senior editor of allmusic described album as state of art dance pop a testament to skills of producers and perhaps even britney being somehow cognizant enough to realize she should hire best even if she s not at her best dennis lim of blender deemed it as her most consistent album a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright brash electropop margeaux watson of entertainment weekly commented that while album is not poetry there is something delightfully escapist about blackout a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant in kind of bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits a reviewer for nme said that heavily treated vocals make spears sound robotic adding that it could really do with a few more human touches pitchfork s tom ewing called get naked i got a plan centerpiece of album and added that like most of blackout is superb modern pop which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car crash copy and her record can fit into that if you want it to ewing also compared relationship between spears and blackout with american television series twin peaks saying that what made show so great wasn t central good girl gone bad story it was strangeness that story liberated and britney s off disc life is both distraction from and enabler for this extraordinary album mike schiller of popmatters said that right down to its utterly garish cover blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable melissa maerz from rolling stone explained that blackout is first time in her career that she s voiced any real thoughts about her life and that she s gonna crank best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits rob sheffield of same magazine described blackout as one of most influential albums in modern pop slant magazine writer sal cinquemani compared album unfavorably to in zone saying that although blackout scores well and its hotness quotient is remarkably high it isn t much of a step forward for britney following 2003 s surprisingly strong in zone for which she received a writing credit on a majority of songs as opposed to a scant three here andy battaglia of a v club said blackout counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn t be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill timed in which every song counts as markedly progressive and strange alexis petridis from guardian called it a bold exciting album question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over deafening roar of tittle tattle he elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall an artist has two options making music that harks back to your golden pre tailspin days to e your complete normality or to throw caution to wind given your waning fortunes what s harm in taking a few musical risks petridis commented that spears opted for latter and results were largely fantastic kelefa sanneh of new york times said electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as ms spears s voice is thin and as album title suggests general mood is bracingly unapologetic sanneh added that said spears became a spectral presence in her own album explaining that when compared to her previous records she cuts a startlingly low profile on blackout even when she was being marketed as a clean cut ex mouseketeer and even when she was touring country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop something about her was intense peter robinson of observer stated that spears delivered best album of her career raising bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of timbaland s shock value and her own back catalogue phoenixs dean said album may be more a tribute to skills of a list producers who guided her through disc than to any of her own talents but at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance in his consumer guide for msn music critic robert christgau gave album a b and said that from gimme more s it s britney bitch to piece of me s single of year sonics from ooh ooh baby s feel you deep inside to perfect lover s touch me there this album is pure juicy plastic get naked

000 copies during its first day of availability in united states jessica letkemann of billboard compared sales favorably to those of number one album of previous week carrie underwood s carnival ride which sold 49 000 copies letkemann also estimated that blackout would possibly debut atop billboard 200 on november 6 2007 billboard announced that even though eagles s first week sales of long road out of eden had handily surpassed spears they would not debut atop chart because of rules forbidding albums exclusively sold at one retail outlet walmart in this case from entering billboard 200 magazine s senior analyst and director of charts geoff mayfield explained he was frustrated by situation saying i can believe eagles sold more but i m not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that during afternoon of same day walmart issued a press release announcing that long road out of eden had sold 711 000 copies at night it was announced through an article on billboard biz that after an agreement with nielsen soundscan billboard would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on charts effective that same week hence long road out of eden would top billboard 200 while blackout would debut at number two with sales of 290 000 copies it

federation of phonographic industry ifpi album was thirty second best selling album of 2007 by end of 2008 blackout had sold 3 1 million copies worldwide legacy when blackout was released spears behavior in public began to clash with her image stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic stated that spears was an artist that always relied on her carefully sculpted sexpot next door persona but for blackout those images we re replaced by images of britney beating cars up with umbrellas wiping her greasy fingers on designer dresses and nodding off on stage each new disaster stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image erlewine added that album served as a soundtrack for britney s hazy drunken days reflecting excess that s splashed all over tabloids while noting that album had a coherence that public spears lacked when she dropped blackout in 2007 music industry scoffed but then proceeded to spend next few years imitating it to death to point where everything on pop radio sounded like blackout said rob sheffield of rolling stone https www rollingstone com music music album reviews review britney spears glory is another fantastic comeback tom ewing of pitchfork noted that after freakshow leaked online a dubstep forum thread on song hit seven pages in twenty four hours generating mixed reactions and exemplifying that it still seems that when mainstream borrows underground music it brings it into wider pop vocabulary he also attributed quality of every track of blackout to economic reasons since one of main causes album sales began to suffer during digital era is due to of albums in online stores making it easier for consumers to buy some tracks rather than entire album ewing explained that revolver blueprint for pop albums every track good every track a potential hit makes more sense than ever especially if a star can keep sonically up to date in a fast moving market reviewers noted use of auto tune in spears voice ewing said that blackout serves as a reminder of how instantly recognizable spears vocals are saying that treated or untreated her thin southern is one of defining sounds of 00s pop he noted that album is a masterclass in autotune and vocal treatment as a studio instrument disrupting and jamming songs as much as it helps them while reviewing spears demo of telephone rob sheffield of rolling stone compared it to piece of me proving yet again how much impact britney has had on sonics of current pop people love to make fun of britney and why not but if telephone proves anything it s that blackout may be most influential
