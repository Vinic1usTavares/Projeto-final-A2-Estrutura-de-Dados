saadanius is a genus of fossil primate dating to oligocene that is closely related to common ancestor of old world monkeys and apes collectively known as catarrhines it is represented by a single species saadanius hijazensis which is known only from a single partial skull tentatively dated between 29 and 28 mya million years ago it was discovered in 2009 in western saudi arabia near mecca and was first described in 2010 after a comparison with both living and fossil catarrhines saadanius had a longer face than living catarrhines and lacked advanced frontal sinus airspaces in facial bones found in living catarrhines however it had a bony ear tube ectotympanic and teeth comparable to those of living catarrhines discovery of saadanius may help answer questions about evolution and appearance of last common ancestors of old world monkeys and apes discovery thumb left specimen was found with palate and teeth facing upward saadanius is known from a single specimen holotype named sgs um 2009 002 stored in jeddah saudi arabia at paleontology unit of saudi geological survey sgs its type locality or place it was discovered was on top of an oolitic ironstone fossil bed of middle formation located in southwest corner of al in western saudi arabia close to mecca specimen was discovered in february 2009 by paleontologist iyad zalmout who had traveled to region to search for ancient whale and dinosaur fossils while looking for dinosaur fossils in an area that according to maps he was working from contained rock layers that dated to cretaceous 145 66 mya zalmout found jawbone of a hippo like creature called an a close relative of whales and hippos which dated to eocene or oligocene this indicated that rock layers were much younger than what was dated on maps following day he noticed fossil teeth which he immediately recognized as those of a primate zalmout emailed a photo of teeth to paleontologist philip d gingerich with whom he was working as a postdoctoral fellow gingerich an expert on ancient primates and whales confirmed that it was indeed a primate due to a tight schedule zalmout had to leave exposed fossil embedded in rock for next few days because collecting it would require days of work fossil was soon recovered by a joint expedition involving sgs and university of michigan fossil was not formally described until 2010 when its discovery was announced in journal nature fossil was dated to about 28 or 29 million years ago based on comparisons of fossils of and members of group that includes elephants and hyraxes found nearby with fossils from similarly aged african deposits however date has yet to be confirmed by other dating techniques genus name saadanius comes from arabic word which is collective term for apes and monkeys species name hijazensis is a reference to al hijaz region in which it was discovered type specimen thumb upright 1 65 left front and side view of saadanius hijazensis saadanius had a longer face than living catarrhines more closely resembling new world monkeys in appearance although it was larger possibly size of a gibbon its enlarged deep rooted canine teeth diastema space between its canine teeth and second incisors and its sagittal crest ridge of bone running lengthwise down top of skull suggest that specimen was a male these features are shared among male old world monkeys saadanius lacks advanced frontal sinus found in living catarrhines but it does possess an ectotympanic or bony ear tube found in living catarrhines propliopithecoids oldest stem group of catarrhines which date back 35 to 30 mya lacked a fully developed ectotympanic specimen had serious puncture wounds on front of skull indicating that it had been preyed upon by a large carnivore one puncture wound was on right side of braincase and may have been fatal blow there was also a bite mark on frontal like other catarrhine primates saadanius was probably a tree dweller arboreal during time it would have lived red sea had not yet formed and new plant and animal species would have been arriving from nearby eurasia as it converged with afro arabian landmass phylogeny and significance comparative anatomy and cladistic analysis indicate that saadanius is more closely related to last common ancestor of crown catarrhines than any other known fossil catarrhines placing common ancestry of catarrhini in arabia and africa other stem catarrhines include propliopithecoids such as and such as closer similarities between saadanius and crown catarrhines particularly its ectotympanic suggest saadanius of all known fossil primates most closely resembled last common ancestor of living catarrhines its discovery has provided new details about human evolution particularly split between old world monkeys and ape lineage that eventually led to humans thumb left alt rotating skull of saadanius animated 3d view of skull discovery of saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about facial appearance of ancestral crown catarrhines or common ancestor one reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase similar to that of a gibbon another reconstruction based on morphology of early miocene apes and basal cercopithecoid victoriapithecus predicts that last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face like that of living baboons and oldest fossil apes and old world monkeys conservative features of saadanius similar to those of older stem catarrhines support latter hypothesis according to zalmout et al however one palaeontologist eric delson has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted shape of skull according to zalmout et al saadanius may also help resolve age of cercopithecoid split work has typically placed divergence between 25 and 23 mya but genetic based estimates have placed it in early oligocene approximately 33 mya despite predictions from genetic tests little fossil evidence has been found for a last common ancestor between 30 and 23 mya favoring a later split only isolated teeth of hinted at existence of potential basal in late oligocene between 24 and 27 5 mya while oldest fossil old world monkey victoriapithecus dates to 19 mya with discovery of saadanius zalmout et al suggested a later split than genetic data dating between 29 28 and 24 mya however pozzi et al later argued that although saadanius is a significant discovery because it is a stem catarrhine it could not be used to date divergence of crown group presence of stem taxa in fossil record does not indicate that crown groups have evolved and stem taxa may survive for millions of years after crown taxa appear for this reason fossil record can only suggest a hard minimum boundary for divergence dates which corresponds to first appearance of a crown taxon furthermore pozzi et al pointed out that supplementary material published by zalmout et al demonstrated that were more closely related to living catarrhines than saadanius fossil find has also been seen by sgs as an important find for saudi arabia because it enriches fossil record for region as a result of find both sgs and
