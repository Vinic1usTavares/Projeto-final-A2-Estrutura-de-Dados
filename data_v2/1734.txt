failed to attract studios feldman re wrote it as a spec script which ultimately led to making of film extraterrestrial aspect of sil s character was created by h r giger who also responsible for beings from alien franchise effects combined practical models designed by giger collaborator steve johnson and xfx with computer generated imagery done by richard edlund s boss film studios giger felt that film and character were too similar to alien so he pushed for script changes most of principal photography was done in los angeles california where film is set several scenes were filmed in utah and at arecibo observatory in puerto rico film was met with mixed reviews from critics but nevertheless turned out to be a box office success partly due to hype surrounding henstridge s topless scenes

press lennox alfred molina as dr stephen arden forest whitaker as dan smithson marg helgenberger as dr laura baker whip hubley as john carey anthony guidera as robbie matthew ashford as man in club influence and themes since sil grows rapidly and kills humans with ease at a certain point film character dr laura baker speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic weed feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in script as it discussed mankind s place in universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity considering that maybe humans are not a potential threat maybe a competitor maybe a resource he also declared that more could be said about sil s existentialist doubts as she does not know her origin or purpose and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate species writing for journal of popular film television susan george authored a paper that dealt with portrayal of procreation in species gattaca and mimic george compares character of fitch to an updated dr frankenstein and explores development of sil s maternal aspirations which convert character into an archaic mother figure similar to xenomorph creature in alien series both of which are she claims portrayed negatively george further states that a recurring theme in science fiction films is a response to this kind of powerful female sexuality and alien ness in that feminine monster must die as sil does at end of species feldman himself considered that an underlying theme regarded a female arriving and seeking to find a superior mate a five year investigation into accounts of chupacabra a well known revealed that original sighting report of creature in puerto rico by madeline tolentino may have been inspired by character sil this was detailed in paranormal investigator and skeptic benjamin radford s book tracking chupacabra according to virginia of memorial university of newfoundland writing for journal of folklore research radford found a link between original eyewitness report and design of sil in her alien form and hypothesized that species which tolentino did see before her sighting influenced what she believes she saw of chupacabra production thumb right natasha henstridge made her theatrical debut playing sil writing and development dennis feldman had idea for species in 1987 as he worked on another film about an alien invasion real men having read an article by arthur c clarke about insurmountable odds against an extraterrestrial craft ever locating and visiting earth given that stellar distances are great and faster than light travel is unlikely feldman started to think that it was unsophisticated for any alien culture to come here in what he d describe as a big tin can thus in turn he considered that possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information making of species origin species definitive edition dvd disk 2 then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across void to build something that would talk to men instead of a mechanical device feldman imagined visitor would adapt to earth s environment through dna belonging to earth s organisms mankind has sent to space transmissions giving out directions such as arecibo message which feldman considered unwary as they relay information to potential predators from outer space he pointed out that in nature one species would not want a predator to know where it hides therefrom emerged a film treatment called message original script had more of a police procedural approach with alien being created by a bathtub geneticist who had just had his project aborted by government and a biologist who had worked on project getting along with a police officer to search for creature eventually feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues and instead changed protagonists to a government team after coining name sil feldman initially thought of forming an acronym but in end chose only three letter name after learning about codons of genetic code which can be represented in groups of three letters sil would originally emerge from a dna sequence manipulating human dna and constantly mutate as she used human junk dna to access all defenses of entire animal kingdom that humans evolved through including ones that had never developed plus ones earth s scientists don t know about that have become extinct among research feldman did for script included going to sessions of ucla s center for study of evolution and origin of life talking to seti scientists and visiting salk institute for biological studies to talk with researchers working on human genome project message was offered to several studios but was passed up in 1993 feldman reworked his ideas into a spec script this was sent to producer frank mancuso jr who had hired feldman to adapt sidney kirkpatrick s a cast of killers producer got attracted to creative as film offered challenge of walking that fine line between believability and pushing something as far as it can go metro goldwyn mayer got interested on project and while feldman had some initial disagreements on budget after considering other studios he signed with mgm in turn now retitled species attracted director roger donaldson who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller script underwent eight different drafts written over an eight month period before donaldson was content that flaws in story s logic had been corrected at one point another writer larry gross tried his hand with script but ultimately all work was done by feldman feldman would remain as a co producer while initial species script suggested a love triangle between sil and two government team members dissatisfaction of crew eventually led to changes to ending which ended up featuring sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous when donaldson was announced as director in 1994 mancuso stated that most of 35 million budget would be spent on effects as it s not a movie that calls for stars we re going to try and put as much money as we can below line and allow effects and creature to be highlights of film lesser emphasis on actors included a newcomer as human version of creature sil former model natasha henstridge design thumb h r giger with a sil sculpture sil was designed by swiss artist h r giger who also created creatures in alien films donaldson thought giger was best man for film after reading his compendium necronomicon and eventually he and mancuso flew to switzerland to meet artist what attracted giger was opportunity to design a monster in another way an aesthetic warrior also sensual and deadly like women look in his paintings while giger opted to stay in switzerland to take care of his dying mother instead of flying to los angeles to accompany production he built some puppets in his own studio and later faxed sketches and airbrush paintings as production went through practical models were made by steve johnson and his company xfx which had already worked with giger s designs in poltergeist ii other side giger had envisioned more stages of sil s transformation but film only employed last one where she is transparent outside and black inside like a glass body but with carbon inside with xfx doing translucent skin based on what they had done for aliens of abyss sil s alien form had both full body animatronics with replaceable arms heads and torsos and a body suit richard edlund s boss film studios was hired for over 50 shots of computer generated imagery which included one of earliest forms of motion capture effects using a two foot high 60 cm electric puppet that had sensors translating its movements to a digital sil boss films managed to achieve in one day what would have once taken as much as three weeks with practical effects giger was unhappy with some elements he found to bear similarity with other movies particularly alien franchise at one point he sent a fax to mancuso finding five similarities a chestburster as sil giving birth echoed infant alien breaking out of its host s chest creature having a punching tongue giger at first wanted sil s tongue to be composed of barbed hooks a cocoon use of flame throwers and having giger as creature designer a great point of contention was ending which giger considered derivative from climaxes from both alien 3 and terminator 2 judgment day designer felt that horror films frequently held some final confrontation with fire which he considered old fashioned and linked to medieval witch trials he sent some ideas for climax to producers with them accepting to have sil s ultimate death occurring by headshot filming filming happened mostly in los angeles including location shooting at sunset strip silver lake pacific palisades hollywood hills and biltmore hotel id club nightclub featured in film was built within hollywood s theater while hills above dodger stadium near elysian park were used for car chase and crash where sil fakes her death for opening scenes in utah tooele army depot dubbed as outside of research facility interiors were shot at rockwell international corporation laboratory in california and a victorian era train station in brigham city was part of sil s escape other locations included santa monica pier and arecibo telescope in puerto rico most complex sets involved sewer complex and a tar filled granite cavern where ending occurs donaldson wanted a maze quality for sewers which had traces of realism such as tree roots breaking through from ceiling and artistic licenses production designer john muto intentionally designed sewers wider and taller than real ones as well as with walkways but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere tunnels were built out of structural steel metal rod plaster and concrete to endure fire effects and had its design based on la brea tar pits with muto describing them as just sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home release and reception species received a wide theatrical release on july 7 1995 its opening

and special effects also commenting that alfred molina sport s a haircut that s scarier than creature variety s review of film described it as a gripping if not overly original account of an
