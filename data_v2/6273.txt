retrieval induced forgetting rif is a memory phenomenon where remembering causes forgetting of other information in memory phenomenon was first demonstrated in 1994 although concept of rif has been previously discussed in context of retrieval inhibition rif is demonstrated through a three phase experiment consisting of study practice of some studied material and a final test of all studied material such experiments have also used multiple kinds of final tests including recall using only category cues recall using category and word stems and recognition tests effect has been produced using many different kinds of materials can be produced in group settings and is reduced in special clinical populations although rif occurs as a consequence of conscious remembering through explicit retrieval actual forgetting is thought to occur implicitly below level of awareness cognitive psychologists continue to debate why rif occurs and how it relates to larger picture of memory and general cognition in particular researchers are divided on idea of whether forgetting is caused by a process that actively inhibits information or due to interference from other information in memory inhibition associated with rif has been looked at as similar to forms of physical inhibition rif has also been tied to memory retrieval strategies with disrupting such strategies affecting phenomenon

in an earlier review by robert a bjork in terms of suppressing memories that become active but are not relevant for a given situation bjork described a study by neely and who found that participants were slower at recognizing words when they were shown a related word immediately beforehand researchers hypothesized that participants were actually trying to suppress related words during recognition as it was irrelevant and unhelpful information in completing recognition task rif is similar to some other memory phenomena it is comparable to part set cuing in that both show lowered memory performance given some previously studied information in one example of part set cuing people asked to recall as many as u s states as they could remembered more states than those asked to after being shown names of some states beforehand having been cued with a portion of to be recalled information recall performance worsened rif is also related to forgetting attributable to changes in one s context where forgetting is automatic and without awareness output interference is a related phenomenon where generation of words from a category such as fruits can make other words from category harder to remember or cause where participants repeat already remembered words retrieval practice paradigm rif has been shown in retrieval practice paradigm experiments with exact instructions and procedures varying slightly from experiment to experiment in original version of experiment booklets were used to present stimuli and to complete testing since then this procedure has often been done using computer software such as microsoft powerpoint or e prime experiments typically consist of study retrieval practice and test phases study phase in study phase participants are asked to study word pairs that consist of a category name and a word that belongs to that category an example being fruit orange typically multiple word pairs across a number of categories say 48 items divided equally into 8 categories are used among several others participants might study word pairs such as following metal iron tree birch metal silver tree elm retrieval practice phase a subset of items are tested using a fill in blank test for a given item participant is shown category name and first two letters of a studied word from that category e g metal ir participants are instructed to fill in blank with an appropriate studied word from that category participants will typically practice remembering items multiple times retrieval practice phase splits items into three different types that are of interest during final test and are often denoted using following notation 350px thumb right diagram describing dependent variables and hypothetical average recall at final test in retrieval practice paradigm for different item types these items are different based on 1 whether they were practiced or unpracticed and 2 what their relationship is to practiced items practiced items rp items are studied words that participants attempt to remember during retrieval practice unpracticed related items rp items are studied words that are not practiced but related by category to words that were practiced unpracticed unrelated items nrp items are studied words in categories that are never practiced these categories are typically unrelated to practiced categories these items also serve as a baseline to compare to unpracticed related items test phase after retrieval practice participants are given a final test where they are asked to remember all studied items goal of test phase is to assess whether prior retrieval practice affects how well unpracticed related words are remembered compared to unpracticed unrelated words rif is ultimately measured as difference between proportion of items recalled between these two types in a category cued test one studied category is shown at a time and participants are asked to remember all studied items from that category although a set amount of time is given for each category exact amount of time varies across studies for instance anderson and co researchers in 1994 gave participants 30 seconds for each category cue and given that there were 6 words in each category this meant that participants had 5 seconds on average to remember each item other studies have used longer durations category plus stem cued tests add a word stem to category cue typically for each category participants are given a specific number of letters corresponding to a unique studied word from category because these cues are specific to a particular word participants are given relatively less time to respond to each cue compared to category cued tests response times for each cue vary from study to study although many experiments have used an interval of 10 seconds though some studies have reported using response times as few as 3 seconds typically category plus stem cued tests include only first initial letter from word but some have included multiple letters recognition tests do not require participants to produce a word from memory instead participants are literally shown a word and are asked to report whether it was a word that appeared during study phase recognition tests typically show all of studied words and a number of non studied words lures researchers measure how often participants correctly recognize studied items and how often they incorrectly recognize lures difference between these two proportions is a statistic measuring one s ability to discriminate between studied and non studied items and has been used to represent rif reaction time is also used to represent rif where slower reaction times are thought to represent more rif due to difficulty in recognizing studied item general findings rif studies have generally yielded results where on average unpracticed related words are remembered less well than baseline of unpracticed unrelated words generality of rif rif studies have generally used words from basic and easily recognized categories but effects have been shown with a wide variety of stimuli retrieving a non dominant meaning of a word can cause forgetting of its dominant meaning words based on their lexical properties words categorized by having same initial letters have shown rif on basis of this shared property spatial information when stimuli are categorized by basis of its location rif has been shown given practice of a subset of items in a given location propositional information remembering a set of studied propositional statements can produce rif for other propositional statements that have shared relations even if subject of sentence differs details of a mock crime scene remembering information about one type of item previously viewed in a mock crime scene produces rif for similar items in same crime scene personality traits of others remembering some personality traits for a given person has caused rif for other traits of that same person modifications to retrieval practice phase although typical paradigm includes retrieval practice of previously studied words some studies have shown rif even when participants were asked to retrieve something else for instance rif has occurred even when participants generated new unstudied items from previously studied categories in what is called extra list retrieval practice or semantic generation in a method called impossible retrieval practice rif has also been observed when participants were asked to generate a word for a category even though one did not actually exist rif is still observed at final test in cases where successful retrieval is not possible such as one where having studied a number of fruits a participant is asked to generate a word given a cue resembling fruit wu some studies have also examined effect on rif when participants instead of being asked to perform retrieval practice are given additional study trials making them restudy material instead of remembering prior information in these cases participants have failed to show any rif effects rif studies in special populations because rif is an effect related to accessibility of information researchers have studied whether it persists in populations that have certain disorders related to memory in one study of students diagnosed with adhd degree of rif observed compared to a control group depended on kind of final test used when using a category cued test there were no differences in rif compared to a control group however when a category plus stem cued test was used participants with adhd on average showed less rif than controls patients with depression show no rif compared to controls when using a category plus stem cued test patients with schizophrenia show comparable rif effects to control groups under a category cued test but reduced rif using a recognition test socially shared rif effects of studying or remembering information in groups has also been examined when groups of individuals experience an event together and then jointly remember event conditions are created for retrieval induced forgetting to occur selective remembering in conversation induces both speakers and listeners in conversation to forget unmentioned but related to mentioned memories rp to a larger degree than unmentioned but unrelated to mentioned memories nrp this effect is called socially shared rif and can even occur with memories which are memories of circumstances in which one learned about consequential events one example of this phenomenon is when americans influence each other s memories of september 11th attacks by communicating with one another about these memories more specifically remembering a subset of details about event causes rif for other related critical information about event importantly simply listening to somebody remembering her september 11 memories results in induced forgetting in one s own memories of note this particular phenomenon of has been linked to how communities of individuals form collective memories of past by selectively retrieving information in conversational interactions theoretical explanations thumb 300px diagram describing when an inhibitory response would be required according to inhibitory account of rif when prepotent memories are active but inappropriate in response to a cue they are inhibited in order to access a less accessible but contextually appropriate memory interference many instances of forgetting are often accounted to interference from heightened accessibility of other associated information in memory researchers have described how interference may explain rif in a number of ways for instance theory of blocking suggests that because practiced words are more easily remembered at test they may occupy a response channel in memory and effectively prevent unpracticed related words in memory from being remembered unpracticed unrelated words would be less affected by this blocking effect because retrieval of practiced words would not block items from different categories other theories such as resource diffusion and response decrement are similar to blocking these theories describe retrieval processes as a finite set of resources that cannot be distributed adequately enough to unpracticed related items at test other models of interference have been proposed that more precisely define idea of an item s strength in memory through separating strength of item itself in memory and contextual information it is linked to such models may explain why certain strengthening methods predict rif and others do not inhibition thumb left 200px if one were to notice a potted plant falling one might automatically react so as to catch it however upon noticing it was a cactus inhibitory processes would work to withhold that action a similar process could work with memories that are prepotent but inappropriate for a given situation generally speaking inhibition theory assumes existence of a set of processes that allows suppression of memories central to inhibition account of rif is that access to unpracticed related items is actively suppressed by this inhibitory process during retrieval practice for instance when participants perform retrieval practice category cue may activate many associated items degree to which related but inappropriate associates that is unpracticed related words become accessible serves as a source of competition that disrupts retrieval of an appropriate response to resolve this competition an inhibitory process intervenes to suppress accessibility to such items subsequently this suppression facilitates retrieval of an appropriate item and prevents retrieval of contextually inappropriate items items from unrelated categories that is unpracticed unrelated items are less competitive during retrieval practice and thus require less inhibition at final test consequences of suppression persist and previously competitive items that were inhibited become more difficult to remember this reduction in accessibility is consistent with definition of inhibition proposed by robert a bjork that inhibition is an active direct form of suppression that serves to reduce access to one or several responses for some adaptive purpose memory inhibition in reference to rif has sometimes been likened to processes of inhibition associated with motor control such as those responsible for baseball players stopping their swing when they anticipate a ball similarly when a dominant response in memory is inappropriate inhibitory processes must be recruited to temporarily suppress that response so that a more appropriate one can be retrieved other accounts individual strategies in retrieval have been considered as one way rif might occur in that retrieval practice may be inconsistent with way participants remember items studied from those categories if retrieval practice disrupts participants memory strategy it may affect their ability to remember particular items at final test if participants are preparing to remember items during retrieval practice based on some strategy certain presentation orders may disrupt that strategy whereas others may not for instance when participants practice items in same order as presented during study rif is lower compared to when presentation is random during retrieval practice these results are same even when participants are explicitly instructed to remember order in which items are presented during study references category memory category cognitive psychology
