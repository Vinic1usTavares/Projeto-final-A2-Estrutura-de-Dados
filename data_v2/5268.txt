influenza commonly known as flu is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus symptoms can be mild to severe most common symptoms include high fever runny nose sore throat muscle pains headache coughing and feeling tired these symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to virus and most last less than a week cough however may last for more than two weeks in children there may be diarrhea and vomiting but these are not common in adults diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in gastroenteritis which is an unrelated disease and sometimes inaccurately referred to as stomach flu or 24 hour flu complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia secondary bacterial pneumonia sinus infections and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure three of four types of influenza viruses affect humans type a type b and type c type d has not been known to infect humans but is believed to have potential to do so usually virus is spread through air from coughs or sneezes this is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances it can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by virus and then touching mouth or eyes a person may be infectious to others both before and during time they are showing symptoms infection may be confirmed by testing throat sputum or nose for virus a number of rapid tests are available however people may still have infection even if results are negative a type of polymerase chain reaction that detects virus s rna is more accurate frequent hand washing reduces risk of viral spread wearing a surgical mask is also useful yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by world health organization who for those at high risk and by centers for disease control and prevention cdc for those six months of age and older vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza it is usually well tolerated a vaccine made for one year may not be useful in following year since virus evolves rapidly antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir among others have been used to treat influenza benefit of antiviral drugs in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks no benefit has been found in those with other health problems influenza spreads around world in yearly outbreaks resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250 000 to 500 000 deaths about 20 of unvaccinated children and 10 of unvaccinated adults are infected each year in northern and southern parts of world outbreaks occur mainly in winter while around equator outbreaks may occur at any time of year death occurs mostly in young old and those with other health problems larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent in 20th century three influenza pandemics occurred spanish influenza in 1918 40 50million deaths asian influenza in 1957 two million deaths and hong kong influenza in 1968 one million deaths world health organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza a h1n1 to be a pandemic in june 2009 influenza may also affect other animals including pigs horses and birds thumb thumbtime 2

see especially figure 5 which shows that virus shedding tends to peak on day 2 whereas symptoms tend to peak on day 3 symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection usually first symptoms are chills and body aches but fever is also common early in infection with body temperatures ranging from 38 to approximately 100 to many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days with aches and pains throughout their bodies which are worse in their backs and legs symptoms of influenza fever and chills cough nasal congestion runny nose sore

vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain may be severe in children with influenza b it can be difficult to distinguish between common cold and influenza in early stages of these infections influenza symptoms are a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia body ache headache and fatigue diarrhea is not usually a symptom of influenza in adults although it has been seen in some human cases of h5n1 bird flu and can be a symptom in children symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in adjacent table specific combination of fever and cough has been found to be best predictor

including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia transcript of virtual press conference with gregory hartl spokesperson for h1n1 and dr nikki shindo medical officer global influenza programme world health organization 12 november 2009 obvious symptom is trouble breathing in addition if a child or presumably an adult seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia sometimes influenza may have abnormal presentations like confusion in elderly and a sepsis like syndrome in young emergency warning

classification influenza viruses are rna viruses that make up four of seven genera of family orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus a influenzavirus b influenzavirus c influenzavirus d these viruses are only distantly related to human viruses which are rna viruses belonging to paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup but can also cause a disease similar to influenza in adults a fourth family of influenza viruses was identified in 2016 influenza d type species for this family is influenza d virus which was first isolated in 2011 influenzavirus a this genus has one species influenza a virus wild aquatic birds are natural hosts for a large variety of influenza a occasionally viruses are transmitted to other species and may then cause devastating outbreaks in domestic poultry or give rise to human influenza pandemics type a viruses are most virulent human pathogens among four influenza types and cause severest disease influenza a virus can be subdivided into different serotypes based on antibody response to these viruses serotypes that have been confirmed in humans ordered by number of known human pandemic deaths are h1n1 which caused spanish flu in 1918 and swine flu in 2009 h2n2 which caused asian flu in 1957 h3n2 which caused hong kong flu in 1968 h5n1 which caused bird flu in 2004 which has unusual zoonotic potential endemic in humans pigs and birds h9n2 h7n9 rated in 2018 as having greatest pandemic potential among type a subtypes which only infected one person who recovered influenzavirus b thumb influenza virus nomenclature for a fujian flu virus this genus has one species influenza b virus influenza b almost exclusively infects humans and is less common than influenza a only other animals known to be susceptible to influenza b infection are seal and ferret this type of influenza mutates at a rate 2 3 times slower than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza b as a result of this lack of antigenic diversity a degree of immunity to influenza b is usually acquired at an early age however influenza b mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible this reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur influenzavirus c this genus has one species influenza c virus which infects humans dogs and pigs sometimes causing both severe illness and local epidemics however influenza c is less common than other types and usually only causes mild disease in children influenzavirus d this genus has only one species influenza d virus which infects pigs and cattle virus has potential to infect humans although no such cases have been observed yet structure properties and subtype nomenclature a b c and d are very similar in overall structure international committee on taxonomy of viruses descriptions of orthomyxoviridae influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c virus particle also called virion is 80 120 nanometers in diameter such that smallest virions adopt an elliptical shape length of each particle varies considerably owing to fact that influenza is and can be in excess of many tens of micrometers producing filamentous virions however despite these varied shapes viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition these are made of a viral envelope containing two main types of glycoproteins wrapped around a central core central core contains viral rna genome and other viral proteins that package and protect this rna rna tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double unusually for a virus its genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid instead it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented negative sense rna each piece of rna containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product protein for example influenza a genome contains 11 genes on eight pieces of rna encoding for 11 proteins hemagglutinin ha neuraminidase na np m1 matrix 1 protein m2 non structural protein 1 ns2 other name is nep nuclear export protein pa pb1 polymerase basic 1 pb1 f2 and pb2 hemagglutinin ha and neuraminidase na are two large glycoproteins on outside of viral particles ha is a lectin that mediates binding of virus to target cells and entry of viral genome into target cell while na is involved in release of progeny virus from infected cells by cleaving sugars that bind mature viral particles thus these proteins are targets for antiviral drugs furthermore they are antigens to which antibodies can be raised influenza a viruses are classified into subtypes based on antibody responses to ha and na these different types of ha and na form basis of h and n distinctions in for example h5n1 there are 18 h and 11 n subtypes known but only h 1 2 and 3 and n 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans replication thumb host cell invasion and replication by influenza virus steps in this process are discussed in text viruses can replicate only in living cells influenza infection and replication is a multi step process first virus has to bind to and enter cell then deliver its genome to a site where it can produce new copies of viral proteins and rna assemble these components into new viral particles and last exit host cell influenza viruses bind through hemagglutinin onto sialic acid sugars on surfaces of epithelial cells typically in nose throat and lungs of mammals and intestines of birds stage 1 in infection figure after hemagglutinin is cleaved by a protease cell imports virus by endocytosis intracellular details are still being elucidated it is known that virions converge to organizing center interact with acidic endosomes and finally enter target endosomes for genome release liu sl zhang zl tian zhao hs liu h sun ez xiao gf zhang w wang hz pang dw 2011 effectively and efficiently dissecting infection of influenza virus by quantum dot based single particle tracking acs nano once inside cell acidic conditions in endosome cause two events to happen first part of hemagglutinin protein fuses viral envelope with s membrane then m2 ion channel allows protons to move through viral envelope and core of virus which causes core to disassemble and release viral rna and core proteins viral rna vrna molecules accessory proteins and rna dependent rna polymerase are then released into cytoplasm stage 2 m2 ion channel is blocked by amantadine drugs preventing infection these core proteins and vrna form a complex that is transported into cell nucleus where rna dependent rna polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive sense vrna steps 3a and b vrna either is exported into cytoplasm and translated step 4 or remains in nucleus newly synthesized viral proteins are either secreted through golgi apparatus onto cell surface in case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin step 5b or transported back into nucleus to bind vrna and form new viral genome particles step 5a other viral proteins have multiple actions in host cell including degrading cellular mrna and using released nucleotides for vrna synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host cell mrnas negative sense vrnas that form genomes of future viruses rna dependent rna polymerase and other viral proteins are assembled into a virion hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in cell membrane vrna and viral core proteins leave nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion step 6 mature virus buds off from cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat step 7 as before viruses adhere to cell through hemagglutinin mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from host cell after release of new influenza viruses host cell dies because of absence of rna proofreading enzymes rna dependent rna polymerase that copies viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides which is approximate length of influenza vrna hence majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants this causes antigenic drift which is a slow change in antigens on viral surface over time separation of genome into eight separate segments of vrna allows mixing or reassortment of vrnas if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts which are sudden changes from one antigen to another these sudden large changes allow virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity this is important in emergence of pandemics as discussed below in section on epidemiology mechanism transmission when an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by in otherwise healthy adults influenza virus shedding time during which a person might be infectious to another person increases sharply one half to one day after infection peaks on day 2 and persists for an average total duration of 5 days but can persist as long as 9 days in those who develop symptoms from experimental infection only 67 of healthy experimentally infected individuals symptoms and viral shedding show a similar pattern but with viral shedding preceding illness by one day children are much more infectious than adults and shed virus from just before they develop symptoms until two weeks after infection in immunocompromised people viral shedding can continue for longer than two weeks influenza can be spread in three main ways by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into eyes nose or mouth of another person airborne route when someone inhales aerosols produced by an infected person coughing sneezing or spitting and through hand to eye hand to nose or hand to mouth transmission either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a handshake relative importance of these three modes of transmission is unclear and they may all contribute to spread of virus in airborne route droplets that are small enough for people to inhale are 0 5 to in diameter and inhaling just one droplet might be enough to cause an infection although a single sneeze releases up to 40 000 droplets most of these droplets are quite large and will quickly settle out of air how long influenza survives in airborne droplets seems to be influenced by levels of humidity and uv radiation with low humidity and a lack of sunlight in winter aiding its survival as influenza virus can persist outside of body it can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces such as banknotes doorknobs light switches and other household items length of time virus will persist on a surface varies with virus surviving for one to two days on hard non porous surfaces such as plastic or metal for about fifteen minutes on dry paper tissues and only five minutes on skin however if virus is present in mucus this can protect it for longer periods up to on banknotes avian influenza viruses can survive indefinitely when frozen p 7 they are inactivated by heating to for a minimum of 60 minutes as well as by acids at ph 2 pathophysiology thumb upright 1 25 different sites of infection shown in red of seasonal h1n1 versus avian h5n1 this influences their lethality and ability to spread mechanisms by which influenza infection causes symptoms in humans have been studied intensively one of mechanisms is believed to be inhibition of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth resulting in lowered cortisol levels knowing which genes are carried by a particular strain can help predict how well it will infect humans and how severe this infection will be that is predict strain s pathophysiology for instance part of process that allows influenza viruses to invade cells is cleavage of viral hemagglutinin protein by any one of several human proteases in mild and viruses structure of hemagglutinin means that it can only be cleaved by proteases found in throat and lungs so these viruses cannot infect other tissues however in highly virulent strains such as h5n1 hemagglutinin can be cleaved by a wide variety of proteases allowing virus to spread throughout body viral hemagglutinin protein is responsible for determining both which species a strain can infect and where in human respiratory tract a strain of influenza will bind strains that are easily transmitted between people have hemagglutinin proteins that bind to receptors in upper part of respiratory tract such as in nose throat and mouth in contrast highly lethal h5n1 strain binds to receptors that are mostly found deep in lungs this difference in site of infection may be part of reason why h5n1 strain causes severe viral pneumonia in lungs but is not easily transmitted by people coughing and sneezing common symptoms of flu such as fever headaches and fatigue are result of huge amounts of cytokines and chemokines such as interferon or tumor necrosis factor produced from influenza infected cells in contrast to rhinovirus that causes common cold influenza does cause tissue damage so symptoms are not entirely due to inflammatory response this massive immune response might produce a life threatening cytokine storm this effect has been proposed to be cause of unusual lethality of both h5n1 avian influenza and 1918 pandemic strain however another possibility is that these large amounts of cytokines are just a result of massive levels of viral replication produced by these strains and immune response does not itself contribute to disease influenza appear to trigger programmed cell death apoptosis prevention vaccination thumb giving an influenza vaccination influenza vaccine is recommended by world health organization who for high risk groups such as pregnant women children aged 5 years elderly health care workers and people who have chronic illnesses such as hiv aids asthma diabetes heart disease or are immunocompromised among others united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends influenza vaccine for those aged six months or older who do not have contraindications in healthy adults it is modestly effective in decreasing amount of influenza like symptoms in a population in healthy children over age of 2 vaccine reduces chances of getting influenza by around two thirds while it has not been well studied in children under 2 in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vaccination reduces exacerbations it is not clear if it reduces asthma exacerbations evidence supports a lower rate of influenza like illness in many groups who are immunocompromised such as those with hiv aids cancer and post organ transplant in those at high risk immunization may reduce risk of heart disease whether health care workers affects patient outcomes is controversial with some reviews finding insufficient evidence and others finding tentative evidence due to high mutation rate of virus a particular influenza vaccine usually confers protection for no more than a few years each year world health organization predicts which strains of virus are most likely to be circulating in next year see historical annual of influenza vaccine allowing pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines that will provide best immunity against these strains vaccine is reformulated each season for a few specific flu strains but does not include all strains active in world during that season it takes about six months for manufacturers to formulate and produce millions of doses required to deal with seasonal epidemics occasionally a new or overlooked strain becomes prominent during that time it is also possible to get infected just before vaccination and get sick with strain that vaccine is supposed to prevent as vaccine takes about two weeks to become effective vaccines can cause immune system to react as if body were actually being infected and general infection symptoms many cold and flu symptoms are just general infection symptoms can appear though these symptoms are usually not as severe or long lasting as influenza most dangerous adverse effect is a severe allergic reaction to either virus material itself or residues from hen eggs used to grow influenza however these reactions are extremely rare questions answers flu shot cdc publication updated 24 july 2006 retrieved 19 october 2006 a 2018 cochrane review of children in good general health found that live immunization seemed to lower risk of getting influenza for season from 18 to 4 inactivated vaccine seemed to lower risk of getting flu for season from 30 to 11 not enough data was available to draw definite conclusions about serious complications such as pneumonia or hospitalization for healthy adults a 2018 cochrane review showed that vaccines reduced incidence of lab confirmed influenza from 2 3 to 0 9 which constitutes a reduction of risk of approximately 60 however for influenza like illness which is defined as same symptoms of cough fever headache runny nose and bodily aches and pains vaccine reduced risk from 21 5 to 18 1 this constitutes a much more modest reduction of risk of approximately 16 difference is most probably explained by fact that over 200 viruses cause same or similar symptoms as flu virus another review looked at effect of short and long term exercise before vaccine however no benefits or harms were recorded cost effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings it has generally been found to be a cost effective intervention especially in children and elderly however results of economic evaluations of influenza vaccination have often been found to be dependent on key assumptions infection control these are main ways that influenza spreads by direct transmission when an infected person sneezes mucus directly into eyes nose or mouth of another person airborne route when someone inhales aerosols produced by an infected person coughing sneezing or spitting through hand to eye hand to nose or hand to mouth transmission either from contaminated surfaces or from direct personal contact such as a hand shake reasonably effective ways to reduce transmission of influenza include good personal health and hygiene habits such as not touching your eyes nose or mouth centers for disease control and prevention questions answers novel h1n1 flu swine flu and you retrieved 15 december 2009 frequent hand washing with soap and water or with alcohol based hand rubs covering coughs and sneezes avoiding close contact with sick people and staying home yourself if you are sick avoiding spitting is also recommended although face masks might help prevent transmission when caring for sick there is mixed evidence on beneficial effects in community interim guidance for use of masks to control influenza transmission coordinating center for infectious diseases 8 august 2005 smoking raises risk of contracting influenza as well as producing more severe disease symptoms since influenza spreads through both aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses while quaternary ammonium compounds can be used with alcohol so that sanitizing effect lasts for longer in hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds and bleach are used to sanitize rooms or equipment that have been occupied by people with influenza symptoms at home this can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach social distancing strategies used during past pandemics such as closing schools churches and theaters slowed spread of virus but did not have a large effect on overall death rate it is uncertain if reducing public gatherings by for example closing schools and workplaces will reduce transmission since people with influenza may just be moved from one area to another such measures would also be difficult to enforce and might be unpopular when small numbers of people are infected isolating sick might reduce risk of transmission diagnosis thumb 29 yr old with h1n1 confirmed there are a number of rapid tests for flu one is called a rapid molecular assay when an upper respiratory tract specimen mucus is taken using a nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab it should be done within 3 4 days of symptom onset as upper respiratory viral shedding takes a downward spiral after that treatment people with flu are advised to get plenty of rest drink plenty of liquids avoid using alcohol and tobacco and if necessary take medications such as acetaminophen paracetamol to relieve fever and muscle aches associated with flu in contrast there is not enough evidence to support corticosteroids as add on therapy for influenza it is advised to avoid close contact with others to prevent spread of infection children and teenagers with flu symptoms particularly fever should avoid taking aspirin during an influenza infection especially influenza type b because doing so can lead to reye s syndrome a rare but potentially fatal disease of liver since influenza is caused by a virus antibiotics have no effect on infection unless prescribed for secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia antiviral medication may be effective if given early within 48 hours to first symptoms but some strains of influenza can show resistance to standard antiviral drugs and there is concern about quality of research high risk individuals such as young children pregnant women elderly and those with compromised immune systems should visit doctor for antiviral drugs those with emergency warning signs should visit emergency room at once two classes of antiviral drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir zanamivir and and m2 protein inhibitors derivatives neuraminidase inhibitors overall benefits of neuraminidase inhibitors in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than risks there does not appear to be any benefit in those with other health problems in those believed to have flu they decreased length of time symptoms were present by slightly less than a day but did not appear to affect risk of complications such as needing hospitalization or pneumonia increasingly prevalent resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has led to researchers to seek alternative antiviral drugs with different mechanisms of action m2 inhibitors antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine inhibit a viral ion channel m2 protein thus inhibiting replication of influenza a virus these drugs are sometimes effective against influenza a if given early in infection but are ineffective against influenza b viruses which lack m2 drug target measured resistance to amantadine and rimantadine in american isolates of h3n2 has increased to 91 in 2005 this high level of resistance may be due to easy availability of as part of over counter cold remedies in countries such as china and russia and their use to prevent outbreaks of influenza in farmed poultry cdc recommended against using m2 inhibitors during 2005 06 influenza season due to high levels of drug resistance prognosis influenza s effects are much more severe and last longer than those of common cold most people will recover completely in about one to two weeks but others will develop life threatening complications such as pneumonia thus influenza can be deadly especially for weak young and old those with compromised immune systems or chronically ill people with a weak immune system such as people with advanced hiv infection or transplant people whose immune systems are medically suppressed to prevent transplant organ rejection suffer from particularly severe disease pregnant women and young children are also at a high risk for complications flu can worsen chronic health problems people with emphysema chronic bronchitis or asthma may experience shortness of breath while they have flu and influenza may cause worsening of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure smoking is another risk factor associated with more serious disease and increased mortality from influenza according to world health organization every winter tens of millions of people get flu most are only ill and out of work for a week yet elderly are at a higher risk of death from illness we know worldwide death toll exceeds a few hundred thousand people a year but even in developed countries numbers are uncertain because medical authorities don t usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu like illness even healthy people can be affected and serious problems from influenza can happen at any age people over 65 years old pregnant women very young children and people of any age with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get complications from influenza such as pneumonia bronchitis sinus and ear infections in some cases an autoimmune response to an influenza infection may contribute to development of guillain barre syndrome however as many other infections can increase risk of this disease influenza may only be an important cause during epidemics this syndrome has been believed to also be a rare side effect of influenza vaccines one review gives an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations getting infected by influenza itself increases both risk of death up to 1 in 10 000 and increases risk of developing gbs to a much higher level than highest level of suspected vaccine involvement approx 10 times higher by recent estimates according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc children of any age with neurologic conditions are more likely than other children to become very sick if they get flu flu complications may vary and for some children can include pneumonia and even death thumb influenza encephalitis mri neurological conditions can include disorders of brain and spinal cord cerebral palsy epilepsy seizure disorders stroke intellectual disability moderate to severe developmental delay muscular dystrophy spinal cord injury these conditions can impair coughing swallowing clearing airways and in worst cases breathing therefore they worsen flu symptoms epidemiology seasonal variations thumb upright 1 35 seasonal risk areas for influenza november april blue april november red and year round yellow influenza reaches peak prevalence in winter and because northern and southern hemispheres have winter at different times of year there are actually two different flu seasons each year this is why world health organization assisted by national influenza centers makes recommendations for two different vaccine formulations every year one for northern and one for southern hemisphere a long standing puzzle has been why outbreaks of flu occur seasonally rather than uniformly throughout year one possible explanation is that because people are indoors more often during winter they are in close contact more often and this promotes transmission from person to person increased travel due to northern hemisphere winter holiday season may also play a role weather and flu season npr day to day 17 december 2003 retrieved 19 october 2006 another factor is that cold temperatures lead to drier air which may dehydrate mucus particles dry particles are lighter and can thus remain airborne for a longer period virus also survives longer on surfaces at colder temperatures and aerosol transmission of virus is highest in cold environments less than with low relative humidity lower air humidity in winter seems to be main cause of seasonal influenza transmission in temperate regions however seasonal changes in infection rates also occur in tropical regions and in some countries these peaks of infection are seen mainly during rainy season seasonal changes in contact rates from school terms which are a major factor in other childhood diseases such as measles and pertussis may also play a role in flu a combination of these small seasonal effects may be amplified by dynamical resonance with endogenous disease cycles h5n1 exhibits seasonality in both humans and birds an alternative hypothesis to explain seasonality in influenza infections is an effect of vitamin d levels on immunity to virus this idea was first proposed by robert edgar hope simpson in 1965 he proposed that cause of influenza epidemics during winter may be connected to seasonal fluctuations of vitamin d which is produced in skin under influence of solar or artificial uv radiation this could explain why influenza occurs mostly in winter and during tropical rainy season when people stay indoors away from sun and their vitamin d levels fall epidemic and pandemic spread as influenza is caused by a variety of species and strains of viruses in any given year some strains can die out while others create epidemics while yet another strain can cause a pandemic typically in a year s normal two flu seasons one per hemisphere there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and around 500 000 deaths worldwide which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic influenza who fact sheet no 211 revised march 2003 retrieved 22 october 2006 although incidence of influenza can vary widely between years approximately 36 000 deaths and more than 200 000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza every year in united states one method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41 400 average deaths per year in united states between 1979 and 2001 different methods in 2010 by centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported a range from a low of about 3 300 deaths to a high of 49 000 per year roughly three times per century a pandemic occurs which infects a large proportion of world s population and can kill tens of millions of people see pandemics section one study estimated that if a strain with similar virulence to 1918 influenza emerged today it could kill between 50 and 80million people thumb left antigenic shift or reassortment can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza new influenza viruses are constantly evolving by mutation or by reassortment mutations can cause small changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens on surface of virus this is called antigenic drift which slowly creates an increasing variety of strains until one evolves that can infect people who are immune to pre existing strains this new variant then replaces older strains as it rapidly sweeps through human population often causing an epidemic however since strains produced by drift will still be reasonably similar to older strains some people will still be immune to them in contrast when influenza viruses reassort they acquire completely new antigens for example by reassortment between avian strains and human strains this is called antigenic shift if a human influenza virus is produced that has entirely new antigens everybody will be susceptible and novel influenza will spread uncontrollably causing a pandemic in contrast to this model of pandemics based on antigenic drift and shift an alternative approach has been proposed where periodic pandemics are produced by interactions of a fixed set of viral strains with a human population with a constantly changing set of immunities to different viral strains thumb generation time for influenza time from one infection to next is very short only 2 days this explains why influenza epidemics start and finish in a short time scale of only a few months from a public health point of view flu epidemics spread rapidly and are very difficult to control most influenza virus strains are not very infectious and each infected individual will only go on to infect one or two other individuals basic reproduction number for influenza is generally around 1 4 however generation time for influenza is extremely short time from a person becoming infected to when he infects next person is only two days short generation time means that influenza epidemics generally peak at around 2 months and burn out after 3 months decision to intervene in an influenza epidemic therefore has to be taken early and decision is therefore often made on back of incomplete data another problem is that individuals become infectious before they become symptomatic which means that putting people in quarantine after they become ill is not an effective public health intervention for average person viral shedding tends to peak on day two whereas symptoms peak on day three history etymology word influenza comes from italian language meaning influence and refers to cause of disease initially this ascribed illness to unfavorable astrological influences it was introduced into english in mid eighteenth century during a pan european epidemic influenza oxford english dictionary second edition archaic terms for influenza include epidemic catarrh la from french first used by molyneaux in 1694 sweating sickness and

pandemic thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature one of signs of swine flu symptoms of human influenza were clearly described by hippocrates roughly 2 400 years ago although virus seems to have caused epidemics throughout human history historical data on influenza are difficult to interpret because symptoms can be similar to those of other respiratory diseases disease may have spread from europe to americas as early as european colonization of americas since almost entire indigenous population of antilles was killed by an epidemic resembling influenza that broke out in 1493 after arrival of christopher columbus first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was of an outbreak in 1580 which began in russia and spread to europe via africa in rome over 8 000 people were killed and several spanish cities were almost wiped out pandemics continued sporadically throughout 17th and 18th centuries with pandemic of 1830 1833 being particularly widespread it infected approximately a quarter of people exposed most famous and lethal outbreak was 1918 flu pandemic spanish flu pandemic type a influenza h1n1 subtype which lasted from 1918 to 1919 it is not known exactly how many it killed but estimates range from 50 to 100million people this pandemic has been described as greatest medical holocaust in history and may have killed as many people as black death this huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 and extreme severity of symptoms suspected to be caused by cytokine storms symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue cholera or typhoid one observer wrote one of most striking of complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes especially from nose stomach and intestine bleeding from ears and petechial hemorrhages in skin also occurred majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia a secondary infection caused by influenza but virus also killed people directly causing massive hemorrhages and edema in lung 1918 flu pandemic was truly global spreading even to arctic and remote pacific islands unusually severe disease killed between two and twenty percent of those infected as opposed to more usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0 1 another unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults with 99 of pandemic influenza deaths occurring in people under 65 and more than half in young adults 20 to 40 years old this is unusual since influenza is normally most deadly to very young under age 2 and very old over age 70 total mortality of 1918 1919 pandemic is not known but it is estimated that 2 5 to 5 of world s population was killed as many as 25million may have been killed in first 25 weeks in contrast hiv aids has killed 25million in its first 25 years later flu pandemics were not so devastating they included 1957 asian flu type a h2n2 strain and 1968 hong kong flu type a h3n2 strain but even these smaller outbreaks killed millions of people in later pandemics antibiotics were available to control secondary infections and this may have helped reduce mortality compared to spanish flu of 1918 known flu pandemics name of pandemic date

first influenza virus to be isolated was from poultry when in 1901 agent causing a disease called fowl plague was passed through chamberland filters which have pores that are too small for bacteria to pass through etiological cause of influenza virus family orthomyxoviridae was first discovered in pigs by richard in 1931 this discovery was shortly followed by isolation of virus from humans by a group headed by patrick laidlaw at medical research council of united kingdom in 1933 however it was not until wendell stanley first crystallized tobacco mosaic virus in 1935 that non cellular nature of viruses was appreciated thumb upright 1 6 main types of influenza viruses in humans solid squares show appearance of a new strain causing recurring influenza pandemics broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications first significant step towards preventing influenza was development in 1944 of a killed virus vaccine for influenza by thomas francis jr this built on work by australian frank macfarlane burnet who showed that virus lost virulence when it was cultured in fertilized hen s eggs sir frank macfarlane burnet biography nobel foundation retrieved 22 october 2006 application of this observation by francis allowed his group of researchers at university of michigan to develop first influenza vaccine with support from u s army army was deeply involved in this research due to its experience of influenza in world war i when thousands of troops were killed by virus in a matter of months in comparison to vaccines development of anti influenza drugs has been slower with amantadine being licensed in 1966 and almost thirty years later next class of drugs neuraminidase inhibitors being developed society and culture influenza produces direct costs due to lost productivity and associated medical treatment as well as indirect costs of preventative measures in united states seasonal influenza is estimated to result in a total average annual economic cost of over 11 billion with direct medical costs estimated to be over 3billion annually it has been estimated that a future pandemic could cause hundreds of billions of dollars in direct and indirect costs however economic impacts of past pandemics have not been intensively studied and some authors have suggested that spanish influenza actually had a positive long term effect on per capita income growth despite a large reduction in working population and severe short term depressive effects brainerd e and m siegler 2003 economic effects of 1918 influenza epidemic discussion paper no other studies have attempted to predict costs of a pandemic as serious as 1918 spanish flu on u s economy where 30 of all workers became ill and 2 5 were killed a 30 sickness rate and a three week length of illness would decrease gross domestic product by 5 additional costs would come from medical treatment of 18million to 45million people and total economic costs would be approximately preventative costs are also high governments worldwide have spent billions of u s dollars preparing and planning for a potential h5n1 avian influenza pandemic with costs associated with purchasing drugs and vaccines as well as developing disaster drills and strategies for improved border controls on 1 november 2005 united states president george w bush unveiled national strategy to safeguard against danger of pandemic influenza backed by a request to congress for 7 1billion to begin implementing plan bush outlines 7 billion pandemic flu preparedness plan us mission to eu retrieved 12 december 2009 internationally on 18 january 2006 donor nations pledged us 2billion to combat bird flu at two day international pledging conference on avian and human influenza held in china in an assessment of 2009 h1n1 pandemic on selected countries in southern hemisphere data suggest that all countries experienced some time limited and or geographically isolated socio economic effects and a temporary decrease in tourism most likely due to fear of 2009 h1n1 disease it is still too early to determine whether h1n1 pandemic has caused any long term economic impacts research thumb left upright dr terrence examining a laboratory grown reconstruction of 1918 spanish flu virus in a biosafety level 3 environment research on influenza includes studies on molecular virology how virus produces disease pathogenesis host immune responses viral genomics and how virus spreads epidemiology these studies help in developing influenza countermeasures for example a better understanding of body s immune system response helps vaccine development and a detailed picture of how influenza invades cells aids development of antiviral drugs one important basic research program is influenza genome sequencing project which is creating a library of influenza sequences this library should help clarify which factors make one strain more lethal than another which genes most affect immunogenicity and how virus evolves over time influenza a virus genome project at institute of genomic research retrieved 19 october 2006 research into new vaccines is particularly important as vaccines are very slow and expensive to produce and must be reformulated every year sequencing of influenza genome and recombinant dna technology may accelerate generation of new vaccine strains by allowing scientists to substitute new antigens into a previously developed vaccine strain new technologies are also being developed to grow viruses in cell culture which promises higher yields less cost better quality and surge capacity research on a universal influenza a vaccine targeted against external domain of viral m2 protein m2e is being done at university of ghent by walter xavier and their team and has now successfully concluded phase i clinical trials there has been some research success towards a universal flu vaccine that produces antibodies against proteins on viral coat which mutate less rapidly and thus a single shot could potentially provide longer lasting protection a number of biologics therapeutic vaccines and are also being investigated for treatment of infection caused by viruses therapeutic biologics are designed to activate immune response to virus or antigens typically biologics do not target metabolic pathways like anti viral drugs but stimulate immune cells such as lymphocytes macrophages and or antigen presenting cells in an effort to drive an immune response towards a cytotoxic effect against virus influenza models such as murine influenza are convenient models to test effects of prophylactic and therapeutic biologics for example lymphocyte t cell immune modulator inhibits viral growth in murine model of influenza other animals influenza infects many animal species and transfer of viral strains between species can occur birds are thought to be main animal reservoirs of influenza viruses sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and nine forms of neuraminidase have been identified all known subtypes are found in birds but many subtypes are endemic in humans dogs horses and pigs populations of camels ferrets cats seals mink and whales also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to species strain is endemic in or adapted to main variants named using this convention are bird flu human flu swine flu horse flu and dog flu cat flu generally refers to feline viral or feline calicivirus and not infection from an influenza virus in pigs horses and dogs influenza symptoms are similar to humans with cough fever and loss of appetite frequency of animal diseases are not as well studied as human infection but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off new england coast in 1979 1980 however outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza these vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks bird flu flu symptoms in birds are variable and can be unspecific symptoms following infection with low pathogenicity avian influenza may be as mild as ruffled feathers a small reduction in egg production or weight loss combined with minor respiratory disease since these mild symptoms can make diagnosis in field difficult tracking spread of avian influenza requires laboratory testing of samples from infected birds some strains such as asian h9n2 are highly virulent to poultry and may cause more extreme symptoms and significant mortality in its most highly pathogenic form influenza in chickens and turkeys produces a sudden appearance of severe symptoms and almost 100 mortality within two days as virus spreads rapidly in crowded conditions seen in intensive farming of chickens and turkeys these outbreaks can cause large economic losses to poultry farmers an avian adapted highly pathogenic strain of h5n1 called hpai a h5n1 for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type a of subtype h5n1 causes h5n1 flu commonly known as avian influenza or simply bird flu and is endemic in many bird populations especially in southeast asia this asian lineage strain of hpai a h5n1 is spreading globally it is epizootic an epidemic in non humans and a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area killing tens of millions of birds and spurring culling of hundreds of millions of other birds in an attempt to control its spread most references in media to bird flu and most references to h5n1 are about this specific strain hpai a h5n1 is an avian disease and there is no evidence suggesting efficient human to human transmission of hpai a h5n1 in almost all cases those infected have had extensive physical contact with infected birds h5n1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human to human transmission exact changes that are required for this to happen are not well understood due to high lethality and virulence of h5n1 its endemic presence and its large and increasing biological host reservoir h5n1 virus was world s pandemic threat in 2006 07 flu season and billions of dollars are being raised and spent researching h5n1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic thumb upright chinese inspectors on an airplane checking passengers for fevers a common symptom of swine flu in march 2013 chinese government reported three cases of h7n9 influenza infections in humans two of whom had died and third was critically ill although strain of virus is not thought to spread efficiently between humans by mid april at least 82 persons had become ill from h7n9 of which 17 had died these cases include three small family clusters in shanghai and one cluster between a neighboring girl and boy in beijing raising at least possibility of human to human transmission who points out that one cluster did not have two of cases lab confirmed and further points out as a matter of baseline information that some viruses are able to cause limited human to human transmission under conditions of close contact but are not transmissible enough to cause large community outbreaks deadly bird flu spreading in china unclear how abc news katie 18 april 2013 swine flu in pigs swine influenza produces fever lethargy sneezing coughing difficulty breathing and decreased appetite in some cases infection can cause abortion although mortality is usually low virus can produce weight loss and poor growth causing economic loss to farmers infected pigs can lose up to 12 pounds of body weight over a 3 to 4 week period direct transmission of an influenza virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible this is called zoonotic swine flu in all 50 human cases are known to have occurred since virus was identified in mid 20th century which have resulted in six deaths in 2009 a swine origin h1n1 virus strain commonly referred to as swine flu caused 2009 flu pandemic but there is no evidence that it is endemic to pigs i e actually a swine flu or of transmission from pigs to people instead virus is spreading from person to person this strain is a reassortment of several strains of h1n1 that are usually found separately in humans birds and pigs references further reading general influenza viruses
