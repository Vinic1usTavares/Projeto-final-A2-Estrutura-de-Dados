national war memorial is a monument on north edge of city centre of adelaide south australia commemorating those who served in first world war opened in 1931 memorial is located on corner of north terrace and kintore avenue adjacent to grounds of government house memorial services are held at site throughout year with major services on both anzac day 25 april and remembrance day 11 november first proposed in 1919 memorial was funded by parliament of south australia making it first australian state war memorial to be confirmed after war design of memorial was selected through two architectural competitions first competition in 1924 produced 26 designs all of which were lost before judging could be completed after fire destroyed building in which they were housed a second competition in 1926 produced 18 entries out of which design by architectural firm woods bagot jory laybourne smith was selected as winner design effectively a frame for two scenes depicted through rayner hoff s marble reliefs and bronze statues shows prelude and epilogue to war depicting both willingness of youth to answer call of duty and extent of sacrifices which they made in this work is not displaying a material victory but instead a victory of spirit at insistence of w f j mccann president of returned soldiers league bronze tablets were cast to line walls of an inner shrine on which are listed names of all south australians who died during great war history right thumb upright obverse face of national war memorial as viewed from corner of north terrace and kintore avenue almost 35 000 south australians served in first world war this number amounted to 8 5 of south australian population at time or 37 7 of men between ages of 18 and 44 scott 1941 p 874 of those who served over 5 000 south australians died jeffery 2001 p 592 in response to these deaths archibald peake premier of south australia asked state parliament to fund a memorial commemorating victory and sacrifice of those who had fought and fallen motion was presented in march 1919 and it received unanimous support in house of assembly and legislative council inglis 2008 p 278 with passing of this motion south australian government became first in australia to elect to build a memorial to soldiers of first world war richardson 25 april 1998 p 10 it was decided by parliament that new memorial should be referred to as national war memorial even though it was to be a purely south australian monument and in spite of term already being used to describe memorial to south african war of 1899 1902 richardson 1998 p 1 when new memorial was completed in 1931 south african war memorial ceased being referred to as national and is today commonly known as boer war memorial there have been at least two perspectives offered as to why term national was employed first as donald richardson observed name may have been chosen to emphasise government s intention that memorial should commemorate all who served during war not just those who came from south australia richardson 1998 p 1 and second ken inglis argued that name may have reflected perception still held in spite of federation that province is a nation inglis 2008 p 267 term embodies a perception vigorous in nineteenth century and not yet extinguished by federation that province is a nation and that its tribute comes from a whole people 1924 competition national war memorial committee was formed in order to bring proposal to fruition and in february 1924 committee announced an architectural competition to find design of new memorial richardson 1998 p 2 in preamble to conditions of entry it was stated that new memorial was to serve purpose of perpetually commemorating victory achieved in great war 1914 1918 supreme and personal sacrifice of those who participated in that war and national effort involved in such activities national war memorial committee 1 february 1924 p 2 left thumb portrait of dame nellie melba gbe by henry walter barnett she proposed building a carillon of bells as new memorial entry was open to south australians who were british subjects cameron 1997 p 102 national war memorial committee 1 february 1924 p 2 competition is open to architects resident in south australia who in opinion of promoters are british subjects and decision of promoters on this point shall be final and those intending to submit designs were required to file a statement of intent prior to 29 february 1924 competition closed on 30 september 1924 and there was a one guinea entry fee three assessors were nominated to judge entries south australian architect in chief a e simpson local architect herbert louis jackman representing south australian institute of architects and sir william committee specified a budget of ps25 000 previously figures of both ps5 000 and ps100 000 had been discussed carillon as memorial 20 november 1923 p 15 and conditions of entry stated that memorial was to be situated at entrance to government house on corner of king william street and north terrace placing it just behind existing memorial to south african war this location was counter to previous suggestions a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that memorial should be built on montefiore hill cameron 1997 p 101 while in 1923 plans for memorial involved erecting it at rear of government house rather than at front war memorial for adelaide 4 may 1923 committee left open form that memorial would take beyond stating that memorial was not to be utilitarian in character national war memorial committee 1 february 1924 p 2 memorial shall not be of utilitarian character and design may provide for improving entrance to government house grounds and debate over form led to emergence of a number of suggestions many of which were covered in media of day these included dame nellie melba s proposal to build a carillon of bells a suggestion by simpson newland to turn anzac highway into a way of honour by adding triumphal arches to each end richardson 1998 p 3 and walter charles s plan to build a metal and marble monument on top of mount lofty with an electric car to carry people to summit in end a total of 28 architectural firms registered their intent to submit entries to competition a lower number than expected but richardson suggests this may have been due to work on proposals for new adelaide railway station richardson 1998 pp 2 3 out of those 28 a total of 26 firms submitted designs by deadline on 10 november 1924 before judging could be completed richards building in currie street was destroyed by fire taking with it all 26 proposals war memorial designs 12 june 1925 although most of judging had been completed before fire suggestions at time that committee could use what they had learned from entrants to propose a new competition with greater clarity as to requirements led to naught a 1925 letter to then premier john gunn reveals that there was little to be learned from competition as assessors had found that none of designs were suitable richardson 1998 p 4 1926 competition right thumb upright louis laybourne smith architect who along with walter bagot and rayner hoff was largely responsible for winning design little progress had been made on memorial by 1926 while some debate occurred in respect to form that memorial would take inglis 2008 p 279 even debate for and against utility was kept open by a campaign for a better bridge over torrens in king william road focus of discussions concerned location of memorial and this centred on future of government house and role of governor a number of left wing politicians argued that grounds of government house should be turned over to state and used to build memorial while conservatives desired to retain status quo by 1925 national war memorial committee was prepared to accept government house grounds as site of memorial but they delayed making an announcement richardson 1998 pp 4 5 this proved to be fortuitous as legal issues prevented plan from going ahead instead a portion of grounds located at corner of north terrace and kintore avenue was put aside for purpose plan to move governor and to use grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited over 80 years later in 2007 kelton 7 march 2007 in 1926 after pressure from returned soldiers a second competition was announced inglis 2008 p 279 once again budget was set at ps25 000 as per first competition all entrants had to be south australian british subjects and all entries were to be judged anonymously but this time there was to be only one assessor john smith murdoch chief architect for commonwealth of australia in deference to previous competition top five entrants from 1924 were each given ps75 upon submission of a new design and all of designs were insured by government for ps100 each richardson 1998 p 6 with entries restricted to south australians only 18 designs were received a figure that was correspondingly fewer than those received in other states where competitions were open to all australians inglis 2008 p 280 nevertheless in his assessor s report murdoch acknowledged that quality of some of proposals was such that they probably would not have been exceeded had competition been more open murdoch 1926 after examining submissions on 15 january 1927 design by louis laybourne smith one of principals at architectural firm woods bagot jory laybourne smith was selected by murdoch as winner left thumb view of north terrace adelaide looking east from between kintore avenue and king william street adelaide circa 1940 in foreground can be seen national war memorial woods bagot jory laybourne smith had entered 1924 competition with an arch designed by walter bagot but in 1926 bagot was away in europe thus laybourne smith was responsible for drawing and submitting final design although he was clear to highlight role bagot played in architectural conception of monument walkley 1976 pp 17 18 while firm was to be awarded 6 of cost of memorial they refused all but enough to cover their own expenses asking instead that residues approximately ps1000 be placed in a trust fund to pay for upkeep of work war memorial an address by mr laybourne smith 17 february 1928 while this is seen as an altruistic act richardson noted that laybourne smith was both a member of national war committee and sat on sub committee which drafted rules of competition and thus it may have been considered improper to accept money richardson 1998 p 7 when announced to public design was universally hailed as a masterpiece nevertheless in writing his report on result of judging murdoch stated of winning architect that he depends almost entirely on sculptor to tell story of memorial employing in his design no more architecture than that required to successfully frame and set his sculptural subjects and to provide accommodation to extent asked for by conditions this view was echoed by inglis who described architecture as essentially a frame for statuary an approach that he felt was unusual for an architect as a result of this dependency on sculpture some of other contestants expressed concerns arguing that contest was about architectural works rather than sculptural ones even though conditions of competition specifically allowed for sculpture in proposals construction right thumb early stages of construction of national war memorial circa 1928 construction of memorial began in 1928 with cut and placement of marble blocks from macclesfield and angaston conlon 2001 south australian monumental works were chosen to work on construction with alan tillett as principal although no sculptor was named in winning proposal it did make mention of a possible candidate who later proved to be rayner hoff a sydney based sculptor born in england rayner hoff produced designs for sculptures from his sydney studio with bronze castings from hoff s plaster models being produced by south australian firm a w dobbie and company hoff had expressed reservations that a south australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of required size but a test casting of lion s head from memorial was sufficient to overcome his concerns two angel reliefs sculpted from angaston marble were produced by julius henschke in situ from hoff s designs expressed through one third sized plaster models which henschke then scaled to suit significant delays occurred during construction after a strike by stonemasons stonemasons were demanding a 44 hour week and to be paid at outside rates rates of pay for stonemasons were based on whether or not work was to be constructed on site in open air or inside under cover tillett was paying lower inside rates even though most of work was to be conducted on site however tillett had tendered on basis of a 48 hour week at inside rates and paying extra would have caused significant financial problems tillett eventually won after dispute went before courts but strike had caused considerable financial damage to tillett s company which went into receivership in 1930 and stayed in that state until after memorial was completed richardson 1998 p 21 south australian government had dedicated ps25 000 for memorial it was estimated that bulk of expense would be masonry at ps15 300 with sculptural work and landscaping requiring ps8 500 and ps1 200 respectively however final cost of construction pushed this out to approximately ps30 000 left thumb national war memorial circa 1940 showing its location in relation to government house visible to left of memorial opening national war memorial in south australia became fourth state world war i memorial to be opened when it was unveiled in 1931 inglis notes that this is in keeping with size of constituency arguing that t he larger constituency that each of these collective tributes had to represent later it was built inglis 2008 p 267 it was unveiled before a crowd of almost 75 000 on anzac day 25 april 1931 16th anniversary of gallipoli landing by governor sir alexander hore ruthven crowd as huge a crowd as anyone could remember assembling in city inglis 2008 p 281 was unable to fit in front of memorial so many thousands assembled at cross of sacrifice in pennington gardens to await a later ceremony hore ruthven was introduced by acting state premier bill denny mc whose involvement in unveiling according to inglis was unusual for a labor politician inglis 2008 p 282 speaker who invited him to perform ceremony however was unusually a senior labor politician commemorative activities first dawn service to be conducted at memorial was held on anzac day 1935 news 3 april 1935 p 3 and was attended by 200 300 people restoration work in 2001 memorial s 70th anniversary year a three month remedial project was undertaken restoring bronze and stonework details and reinforcing foundations work was completed just days before remembrance day services haran 11 november 2001 p 8 in 2002 architects responsible for restoration bruce harry associates were awarded a heritage merit award for their work on memorial by royal australian institute of architects clarke 20 july 2002 p 19 design right thumb upright spirit of duty appearing before youth of south australia as represented by girl student and farmer rules of competition limited space for memorial to one half acre of land that was excised from grounds of government house woods bagot jory laybourne smith 1927 p 18 design submitted by woods bagot jory laybourne smith easily met this requirement as memorial was designed to fit on an ellipse with a major axis of 18 3 m 60 ft in length and a minor axis of 15 5 m 51 ft standing at a height of over 14 m 46 ft structure was carefully placed back from north terrace to provide space for public gatherings of a ceremonial nature and to allow for proposed widening of street monument has two sides referred to by architects as reverse and obverse of work which they likened to two sides of a coin woods et al 1927 p 3 two aspects resemble obverse and reverse of a coin these two aspects represent prologue and epilogue of war woods et al 1927 p 3 each side features a relief carved from angaston marble and framed by rough hewn arch carved out of marble from macclesfield while granite steps leading up to monument are constructed of harcourt granite as specified in original proposal architects had preferred local west island granite but acknowledged that harcourt granite was best available unless government would agree to reopen quarry on west island woods et al 1927 p 11 harcourt granite is best available grey granite for texture and cost of working and unless government would open west island quarry for this purpose is recommended for use materials were chosen in order to provide continuity with parliament house woods et al 1927 p 11 located a short distance away along north terrace left thumb upright spirit of compassion bearing aloft body of a dead soldier symbolizes and commemorates sacrifice of those who gave their lives in war and loss experienced by those who loved them to represent prologue to war obverse of monument side facing north terrace features a relief of spirit of duty appearing as a vision before youth of south australia represented in work by a sculptural group consisting of a girl a student and a farmer abandoning symbols of their craft woods et al 1927 p 3 group symbolical of youth of community is represented as catching first glimpse of vision which appears above altar of shrine of sacrifice each member of group student farmer and girl affected by impulse instinctively drops emblems of craft and turns to vision as it becomes clearer three are depicted in normal dress as they are not yet soldiers and are currently unprepared for war that is to come woods et al 1927 p 4 and they are facing away from world as they look to vision before them richardson 25 april 1998 p 10 it is significant that they face away from world and towards a representation of an ideal in bagot s original plan submitted for 1924 competition there was to be but a single nude figure kneeling before vision for which bagot posed while in europe but laybourne smith s 1926 submission became grander in its scope in addition bagot s original designs were naturalistic with spirit of duty depicted as a female figure but under hoff s direction figure was changed to male and style of reliefs was changed to art deco a radically new art style for australia at time richardson 1998 pp 17 18 hoff however presented sculptural group in original naturalistic style thus providing a bridge between renaissance style architecture and art deco of reliefs richardson 1998 p 20 on reverse side of monument facing away from traffic is a relief carved into marble representing epilogue of war and depicting spirit of compassion as a winged spirit of womanhood bearing aloft a stricken youth woods et al 1927 p 4 winged spirit which carries it symbolizes crowning attributes of womanhood her tender maternal compassion her sacrifice of son and lover her patient work of succour her power of resistance under strain capitalization is as per original source beneath figure is situated fountain of compassion flow of water representing constant flow of memories while lion s head from which it emerges and which bears imperial crown is representative of british commonwealth of nations designers acknowledged that symbolism especially that of reverse side does not represent victory in traditional sense they stated that arch of triumph which was built in honour of a caesar a napoleon no longer expresses feelings of modern democracy after an international struggle woods et al 1927 p 6 instead memorial represented a spiritual victory in which was displayed a willingness to serve and to sacrifice woods et al 1927 p 7 it is collective personal sacrifice of victory over self which is expressed in two sculpture of two scenes renunciation of all that made life sweet of life itself by men who enlisted toiled fought and dies by women who waited worked and suffered right thumb upright detail of one of bronzes inside memorial upon which is listed names of south australians who died during war within memorial architects added an inner shrine or record room in which could be recorded names of south australians who fell during war while design did not specify exact form that this would take woods et al 1927 p 7 record room would afford space for a parchment folio of names or if desired its walls could be lined with commemorative bronzes in completed memorial these names are inscribed in bronzes that line walls design also allowed for a cenotaph within inner shrine which designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of unknown soldier or as marker to an actual grave woods et al 1927 p 7 within inner shrine may be placed a single slab of marble inscribed to unknown soldier thus marking a grave which may be made a reality or simply serve as a cenotaph although this aspect was never realised monument is designed to honour both war dead and all who served in war one face being inscribed to those who died in war while other is dedicated to all who served inglis 2008 pp 269 270 on obverse side is inscribed words to perpetuate courage loyalty and sacrifice of those who served in great war 1914 1918 while reverse states all honour give to those who nobly striving nobly fell that we might live woods et al 1927 pp 7 8 above two entrances to inner shrine were to be inscribed names of major theaters in which australians served in great war originally it was suggested that this was to be egypt gallipoli and palestine on one side with france on other but in final work belgium was added to list although central square mile of city of adelaide is designed to points of compass monument sits at a 45 degree angle to north terrace richardson 1998 p 10 architects provided two reasons for this first it was observed that monuments suffer materially from monotonous lighting when they face to south woods et al 1927 p 8 and second placing of monument to face a north west direction allows it to be in line with both cross of sacrifice and st peter s cathedral woods et al 1927 p 8 axis so placed is approximately that of women s memorial cross of sacrifice and st peter s cathedral and in view from an elevated position war memorial would form a proper terminal to long vista in addition to these two arguments richardson also notes that diagonal positioning of memorial permits dawn sun to fall on facade adjacent memorials although national war memorial was initially proposed as a memorial to those who served in great war site has since grown to incorporate a number of smaller memorials these include a memorial to battle of lone pine french memorial which commemorates south australians who fought and died in france during first and second world wars unveiled in 1993 an honour roll of those who died in world war ii and australian armed forces memorial encompassing malayan emergency of 1948 1960 korean war indonesia malaysia confrontation in borneo and vietnam war in addition wall which surrounds northern and western sides of site features six crosses of memory a series of simple wooden crosses commemorating siege of tobruk from 1941 10th 27th and 48th battalions of 1916 and 50th battalion of 1918 memorial to 8th division of second australian imperial force unveiled in december 1995 memorial to battle of lone pine tree is a descendant of original lone pine australian armed forces memorial encompassing actions in south east asia and korea honour roll listing south australians who died in second world war jubilee
