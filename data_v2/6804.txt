but then halted work to await first ottoman payment by mid 1901 men had accumulated significant debt and ottoman government had made no effort to return them or pay installments for modernization program even kaiser wilhelm ii became involved in an attempt to press ottoman government to settle debts incurred by sailors instead ottomans demanded that krupp owner of germaniawerft shipyard make an advance of 6 000 lira so that izmir could be prepared for voyage back to constantinople ottomans were at time negotiating for a large armament contract with krupp for army and used this as leverage by late 1901 krupp conceded rather than risk lucrative contract debts in kiel were paid and izmir finally departed for home no work was done to ship over following two years on 18 january 1904 ottoman negotiators began a new round of talks with krupp demanding a reduction in cost of modernization from 282 000 lira to 65 000 lira this amount does not cover preparatory work that had been initially carried out let alone reconstruction in return ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers from germaniawerft with armament contract still under negotiation krupp was forced to concede
