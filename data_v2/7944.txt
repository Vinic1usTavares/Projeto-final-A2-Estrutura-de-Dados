kepler 8b is fifth of first five exoplanets discovered by nasa s kepler spacecraft which aims to discover planets in a region of sky between constellations lyra and cygnus that transit cross in front of their host stars planet is hottest of five kepler 8b was only planet discovered in kepler 8 s orbit and is larger though more diffuse than jupiter it orbits its host star every 3 5 days planet also demonstrates rossiter mclaughlin effect where planet s orbit affects of spectrum of host star kepler 8b was announced to public on january 4 2010 at a conference in washington d c after radial velocity measurements conducted at w m keck observatory confirmed its detection by kepler nomenclature and history kepler 8b planet is named because it was first planet discovered in orbit of kepler 8 star itself and by extension its planet was named after kepler spacecraft a nasa run satellite that searches for terrestrial planets between constellations cygnus and lyra that transit or cross in front of their host stars with respect to earth this crossing slightly dims star at a regular interval which is used to determine if cause of fluctuation in brightness is indeed due to a planetary transit planet was first noted as a potential transit event by kepler telescope and was originally designated as koi 10 01 follow up observations by high resolution echelle spectrometer at hawaii s w m keck observatory yielded additional information about planet including its mass and radius kepler 8b was fifth planet discovered by kepler telescope first three planets in kepler s field of view had already been confirmed and were used to test kepler s accuracy kepler 8b was last of first five planets that kepler discovered its discovery along with planets kepler 4b kepler 5b kepler 6b and kepler 7b were announced to public at 215th meeting of american astronomical society in washington d c this conference took place on january 4 2010 discovery of these first five planets helped confirm kepler s functionality host star kepler 8 is an f type star in lyra constellation that lies approximately 1050 parsecs away from earth with a mass and radius of respectively 1 213 msun and 1 486 rsun star is both more massive and wider than sun with an effective temperature of 6213 k kepler 8 is also hotter than sun although it is approximately three quarters of a billion years younger and is slightly less metal rich characteristics kepler 8b has a mass of 603 mj but a radius of 1 419 rj this means that although kepler is approximately 60 mass of planet jupiter it is more diffuse as it is 41 9 wider based on its size and distance from its star kepler 8b is a hot jupiter planet orbiting kepler 8 from a distance of 0483 au every 3 days to compare planet mercury orbits sun at an average distance of 3871 au every 87 97 days with an equilibrium temperature of 1764 k kepler 8b was hottest of five planets announced during conference stating its discovery kepler 8b has an eccentricity of 0 which means that its orbit is very circular planet also has a density of 261 grams cc approximately 74 less dense than purified water at 4 degc 300px thumb right first five planets discovered by kepler compared by relative size kepler 8b is depicted in orange as kepler 8b orbits its star it demonstrates rossiter mclaughlin effect in which host star s spectrum becomes red and later as a body transits it identification of this effect established kepler 8b as orbiting in a prograde motion as opposed to retrograde motion in which a planet orbits in a direction opposite of its star s rotation see also kepler 4b kepler 5b kepler 6b kepler 7b kepler 9b kepler 10b references further reading external links category exoplanets discovered in 2010 category hot jupiters category giant planets category transiting exoplanets category lyra constellation 8b
