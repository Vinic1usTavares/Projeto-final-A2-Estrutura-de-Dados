night 1960 is a work by elie wiesel about his experience with his father in nazi german concentration camps at auschwitz and buchenwald in 1944 1945 at height of holocaust toward end of second world war in just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative wiesel writes about death of god and his own increasing disgust with humanity reflected in inversion of parent child relationship as his father declines to a helpless state and wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver if only i could get rid of this dead weight immediately i felt ashamed of myself ashamed forever in night everything is inverted every value destroyed here there are no fathers no brothers no friends a kapo tells him everyone lives and dies for himself alone wiesel was 16 when buchenwald was liberated by united states army in april 1945 too late for his father who died after a beating while wiesel lay silently on bunk above for fear of being beaten too he moved to paris after war and in 1954 completed

autobiographical memoir and memoir novel weissman 2004 65 67 ellen fine described it as testimony wiesel called it his deposition literary critic ruth franklin writes that nights impact stems from its minimalist construction 1956 yiddish version at 865 pages was a long and angry historical work in preparation for french edition wiesel s editors pruned without mercy franklin 2011 71 franklin argues that power of narrative was achieved at cost of literal truth and that to insist that work is purely factual is to ignore its literary sophistication franklin 2011 16 holocaust scholar lawrence langer argues similarly that wiesel evokes rather than describes wiesel s account is ballasted with freight of fiction scenic organization characterization through dialogue periodic climaxes elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes and especially an ability to arouse empathy of his readers which is an elusive ideal of writer bound by fidelity to fact franklin writes that night is account of 15 year old eliezer a semi fictional construct told by 25 year old elie wiesel this allows 15 year old to tell his story from post holocaust vantage point of night s readers franklin 2011 82 in a comparative analysis of yiddish and french texts naomi seidman professor of jewish culture concludes that there are two survivors in wiesel s writing a yiddish and french in re writing rather than simply translating un di velt hot geshvign wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards testimony as a refutation of what nazis did to jews with one haunted by death whose primary complaint is directed against god night transformed holocaust into a religious event for an interview with seidman see peter april 2001 revising night elie wiesel and hazards of holocaust theology killing buddha seidman argues that yiddish version was for jewish readers who wanted to hear about revenge but anger was removed for largely christian readership of french translation in yiddish edition for example when buchenwald was liberated early next day jewish boys ran off to weimar to steal clothing and potatoes and to rape german un tsu in 1958 french and 1960 english editions this became on following

knew yes about people i might have known about things that happened yes about things that happened or could have happened but they did not no not all of them did in fact some were invented from almost beginning to almost end rebbe leaned forward as if to measure me up and said with more sorrow than anger that means you are writing lies i did not answer immediately scolded child within me had
