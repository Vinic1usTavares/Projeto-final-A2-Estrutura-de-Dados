nielsen rating share during its initial airing critical reception episode received generally favorable reviews zap2it wrote sure blair s leighton meester been dreaming of her fairytale wedding since she was just a little girl but it s also true that producers of gossip girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well and upper east side drama didn t disappoint in fact it was easy best episode this season steve marsi from tv fanatic gave episode a four stars rating out of five writing in what has come to be sort of a make or break episode gossip girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all passion and loyalty we ve invested over years while there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight especially depending on your couple of choice you can t find fault with pure number of twists especially during last five minutes marsi appreciated references to gossip girls early days promised homages to old days were there in spades and incorporated in ways that actually fit present day story case in point a memorable gossip girl quote i love you always have always will which was spoken to a very different character long ago also cover of young folks at onset was fun huffington posts laura prudom also found episode had honored gossip girls past for first time in recent memory this week s milestone episode of gossip girl finally recaptured confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons she also praised fact georgina is gossip girl which was totally unexpected hollywood reporter wrote in classic gossip girl fashion 100th episode was full of witty one liners many of them from mouth of georgina sparks and one in honor of princess bride paid homage to pilot and featured several head turning moments ology gave episode a 9 10 grade digital spy writer catriona wightman found episode completely absurd but brillantly entertaining morgan glennon of buddytv wrote despite how ridiculous it was seeing character after character after character try to save blair from her own stupid decisions gossip girl really knows how to do big events after 100 episodes show understood that it needed to go big to top off royal wedding storyline so wedding and attendant quest to stop it was as big dramatic and heartfelt as gossip girl at its best glennon also conceded about gossip girl reveal show can still pull out those omg moments glennon found georgina amazing in episode you can t even take your eyes off her because she s so great in every scene however atlantic wire thought writers should have waited until last ever episode to do unveiling of gossip girl and questioned isn t that indicative of show s greater failings over these past four and a half years that constant need of this once promising show to tip its hand too soon and concluded we think time has finally come to remove gossip girl from our bookmarks references external links g g at tv com g g at
