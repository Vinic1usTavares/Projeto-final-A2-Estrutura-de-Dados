socialist government tried to ignore gbagbo s party to please houphouet boigny after a lengthy appeal process gbagbo obtained status as a political refugee in france in 1985 however french government attempted to pressure him into returning to cote d ivoire as houphouet boigny had begun to worry about gbagbo s developing a network of contacts and believed his stirring opponent would be less of a threat in abidjan than in paris in 1988 gbagbo returned from exile to cote d ivoire after houphouet boigny implicitly granted him forgiveness by declaring that tree did not get angry at bird in 1990
