tropical storm chantal was a north atlantic tropical cyclone that moved across caribbean sea in august 2001 chantal developed from a tropical wave on august 14 in tropical atlantic ocean it tracked rapidly westward for much of its duration and after degenerating into a tropical wave it passed through windward islands chantal reached a peak intensity of 70 mph 110 km h twice in caribbean sea and each time it was anticipated to attain hurricane status however wind shear and later land interaction prevented strengthening to hurricane status on august 21 chantal moved ashore near border of mexico and belize before dissipating on next day in windward islands lightning caused two indirect deaths in trinidad chantal dropped light to moderate rainfall across its path most significantly in quintana roo in mexico where it caused widespread mudslides damage in belize totaled 4 million 2001 usd usd due to combined impact of high waves moderate winds and rainfall overall damage was minor meteorological history a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 11 associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through tropical atlantic ocean although by august 13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along wave environmental conditions favored tropical development and system gradually became better organized although convection was initially limited near center on august 14 convection increased northwest of center and became sufficiently well organized for system to be considered a tropical depression at time it was located about 1500 miles 2400 km east of southern windward islands situated to south of a strong subtropical ridge depression tracked rapidly westward with easterly wind shear structure was initially disorganized although system was forecast to attain tropical storm status within 48 hours of developing due to anticipated favorable conditions one computer model predicted depression would reach winds of around 115 miles per hour 185 km h by four days after development banding features increased while satellite presentation continued to improve and at 1200 utc on august 16 depression was upgraded to tropical storm chantal about 370 miles 595 km east of barbados at same time however a quikscat pass suggested system did not contain a low level circulation and in post season analysis national hurricane center estimated system degenerated into a tropical wave rather than attain tropical storm status this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight into system despite lacking a closed circulation overall structure remained well organized and with a favorable upper level environment possibility of regeneration into a tropical cyclone was noted early on august 17 remnants of chantal passed over windward islands with winds of tropical storm force after entering caribbean sea system slowed while its convective pattern expanded and became more symmetric hurricane hunters confirmed that a small circulation developed about 290 miles 265 km south of saint croix and accordingly system developed into a tropical storm forecasters described upper level environment as ideal for a tropical cyclone to intensify with winds of 80 miles per hour 130 km h forecast within a few days cyclone was predicted to maintain a west northwestward track toward northwestern caribbean and gulf of mexico on august 18 winds increased to 65 miles per hour 105 km h although an increase in forward motion caused low level circulation to become separated from deep convection storm again decelerated on august 19 allowing re organization and for chantal to attain peak sustained winds of 70 miles per hour 110 km h about 185 miles 295 km south of kingston jamaica after reaching peak winds tropical storm chantal became disorganized while center became ill defined and situated to west southwest of main area of convection this was due to unfavorable upper level winds although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper level environment by early on august 20 hurricane hunters reported several low level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area later that day wind shear decreased when storm moved into gulf of honduras chantal became much better organized again reaching peak winds of 70 miles per hour 110 km h before making landfall early on august 21 near border of mexico and belize initially storm was forecast to cross yucatan peninsula and bay of campeche and make a second landfall in state of veracruz chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern belize convection decreased markedly late on august 21 and early next day chantal weakened to tropical depression status upper and middle level circulations turned to northeast while low level circulation turned to west southwest further inland weakening continued and late on august 22 chantal dissipated over mexican state of tabasco preparations thumb right tropical storm chantal approaching yucatan peninsula on august 20 national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch for barbados st vincent and saint lucia on august 15 following day watches were changed to warnings since forecasters predicted that system would reach tropical storm status additional watches and warnings were also issued for rest of windward islands late on august 17 government of jamaica issued a hurricane watch for island due to anticipated strengthening next day it was upgraded to a hurricane warning briefly before being amended to a tropical storm warning due to storm s weakening in central caribbean in country officials advised fishermen to return to harbor while some flights into norman manley international airport were canceled a tropical storm warning was also issued for cayman islands where an emergency shelter was opened there tourists were recommended to temporarily leave islands about 50 hours before landfall a tropical storm watch was issued for belize and eastern yucatan peninsula and about 12 hours later it was upgraded to a hurricane watch when lack of significant intensification became apparent a tropical storm warning was added for much of yucatan peninsula and later for a portion of mexican coast along bay of campeche as storm approached nearly 2 500 people in vulnerable areas of eastern mexico evacuated to safer areas about 8 000 people evacuated in belize primarily on offshore islands government of belize opened its emergency operation center and evacuated several hospitals about 250 airline flights were canceled and some cruise ship paths were diverted to safer locations impact thumb left mexico rainfall from chantal as a strong tropical wave chantal passed through windward islands island of martinique reported sustained winds of 39 miles per hour 63 km h with gusts to 56 miles per hour 91 km h on august 16 lightning from system killed two brothers in southern trinidad also on island heavy rainfall caused flooding and road washouts while tracking across eastern caribbean sea outer rainbands of chantal produced light to moderate rainfall across puerto rico and united states virgin islands in puerto rico highest rainfall total was in rio piedras passing to south of jamaica storm produced light rainfall and gusty winds outer rainbands also affected cayman islands in belize tropical storm produced a wind gust of 71 miles per hour 115 km h in caye caulker although stronger winds were possible in a convective band to north moderate rainfall was reported across country peaking at 9 81 inches 249 mm at station along coast high waves damaged seawalls and piers further inland combination of winds and flooding caused agriculture and infrastructure damage overall damage in country totaled 4 million 2001 usd usd tropical storm chantal also produced gusty winds in yucatan peninsula peaking at 62 miles per hour 100 km h in chetumal quintana roo dropping moderate to heavy rainfall along its path a station near chetumal reported a peak total of 20 03 inches 509 mm remnants of chantal also produced rainfall along bay of campeche coast storm resulted in downed trees and power lines as well as damaged buildings heavy rainfall led to mudslides across quintana roo leaving some areas isolated initially there were reports of two missing fishermen off southeastern coast although it was not later confirmed overall damage was minor see also other tropical cyclones named chantal timeline of 2001 atlantic hurricane season hurricane ernesto 2012 hurricane earl 2016 hurricane franklin references
