framed tube structures giving tenants open floor plans unobstructed by columns or walls framed tube design was introduced by bangladeshi american structural engineer fazlur rahman khan in 1960s design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns providing much of structure s strength with gravity load shared with core columns elevator system which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making structural core smaller design and construction of towers involved many other innovative techniques such as wind tunnel experiments and slurry wall for digging foundation yamasaki also incorporated elements of islamic architecture in building s design having previously designed saudi

public rejected first round of designs a second more open competition took place in december 2002 in which a design by daniel libeskind was selected as winner this design underwent many revisions mainly because of disagreements with developer larry silverstein who held lease to world trade center site at that time there was criticism concerning limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan only 82 floors would have been habitable and total office space of rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than in comparison with original complex floor limit was imposed by silverstein who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in event of a future terrorist attack or other incident much of

comparable to original world trade center and open air lattice was removed from plans in 2002 former new york governor george pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get winning architect s design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor ronald lauder a final design for freedom tower was formally unveiled on june 28 2005 to address security issues raised by new york city police department a concrete base was added to design in april of that year design originally included plans to clad base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that building might have looked uninviting and resembled a concrete bunker however prisms were later found to be unworkable as preliminary testing revealed that prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards as a result it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast resistant glass prismatic glass facade for wtc tower scrapped
