thulium is a chemical element with symbol tm and atomic number 69 it is thirteenth and third last element in lanthanide series like other lanthanides most common oxidation state is 3 seen in its oxide halides and other compounds because it occurs so late in series however 2 oxidation state is also stabilized by nearly full 4f shell that results in aqueous solution like compounds of other late lanthanides soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules in 1879 swedish chemist per teodor cleve separated from rare earth oxide erbia another two previously unknown components which he called holmia and thulia these were oxides of holmium and thulium respectively a relatively pure sample of thulium metal was first obtained in 1911 thulium is second least abundant of lanthanides after radioactively unstable promethium which is only found in trace quantities on earth it is an easily workable metal with a bright silvery gray luster it is fairly soft and slowly tarnishes in air despite its high price and rarity thulium is used as radiation source in portable x ray devices and in some solid state lasers it has no significant biological role and is not particularly toxic properties physical properties pure thulium metal has a bright silvery luster which tarnishes on exposure to air metal can be cut with a knife as it has a mohs hardness of 2 to 3 it is malleable and ductile thulium is ferromagnetic below 32k antiferromagnetic between 32 and 56k and paramagnetic above 56k thulium has two major allotropes tetragonal a tm and more stable hexagonal b tm chemical properties thulium tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily at to form thulium iii oxide 4 tm 3 o2 2 tm2o3 thulium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form thulium hydroxide 2 tm s 6 h2o l 2 tm oh 3 aq 3 h2 g thulium reacts with all halogens reactions are slow at room temperature but are vigorous above 2 tm s 3 f2 g 2 s

exist as tm oh2 9 3 complexes 2 tm s 3 h2so4 aq 2 tm3 aq 3 aq 3 h2 g thulium reacts with various metallic and non metallic elements forming a range of binary compounds including tms and in those compounds thulium exhibits valence states 2 and 3 however 3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions thulium exists as a tm3 ion in solution in this state thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water tm3 ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence thulium s only known oxide is tm2o3 this oxide is sometimes called thulia reddish purple thulium ii compounds can be made by reduction of thulium iii compounds examples of thulium ii compounds include halides except fluoride some hydrated thulium compounds such as tmcl3 7h2o and c2o4 3 6h2o are green or greenish white thulium dichloride reacts very vigorously with water this reaction results in hydrogen gas and tm oh 3 exhibiting a fading reddish color combination of thulium and chalcogens results in thulium chalcogenides thulium reacts with hydrogen chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride with nitric acid it yields thulium nitrate or tm no3 3 thulium com retrieved on 2013

169tm are element 68 erbium isotopes and primary products after are element 70 ytterbium isotopes thulium 169 is thulium s only primordial isotope and is only isotope of thulium that is thought to be stable it is predicted to undergo alpha decay to holmium 165 with a very long half life longest lived radioisotopes are thulium 171 which has a half life of 1 92 years and thulium 170 which has a half life of 128 6 days most other isotopes have half lives of a few minutes or less thirty five isotopes and 26 nuclear isomers of thulium have been detected most isotopes of thulium lighter than 169 atomic mass units decay via electron capture or beta plus decay although some exhibit significant alpha decay or proton emission heavier isotopes undergo beta minus decay history thulium was discovered by swedish chemist per teodor cleve in 1879 by looking for impurities in oxides of other rare earth elements this was same method carl gustaf earlier used to discover some other rare earth elements see cleve named thulium on p 480 pour le radical de l place entre l et l qui est par la bande x dans la partie rouge du spectre je propose la nom de thulium derive de thule le plus ancien nom de la for radical of oxide located between oxides of ytterbium and erbium which is characterized by x band in red part of spectrum i propose name of thulium which is derived from thule oldest name of scandinavia cleve started by removing all of known contaminants of erbia upon additional processing he obtained two new substances one brown and one green brown substance was oxide of element holmium and was named holmia by cleve and green substance was oxide of an unknown element cleve named oxide thulia and its element thulium after thule an ancient greek place name associated with scandinavia or iceland thulium s atomic symbol was once tu but this was changed to tm thulium was so rare that none of early workers had enough of it to purify sufficiently to actually see green color they had to be content with spectroscopically observing strengthening of two characteristic absorption bands as erbium was progressively removed first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was charles james a british expatriate working on a large scale at new hampshire college in durham in 1911 he reported his results having used his discovered method of fractional crystallization to do purification he famously needed 15 000 purification operations to establish that material was homogeneous high purity thulium oxide was first offered commercially in late 1950s as a result of adoption of ion exchange separation technology lindsay chemical division of american potash chemical corporation offered it in grades of 99 and 99 9 purity price per kilogram oscillated between us 4 600 and 13 300 in period from 1959 to 1998 for 99 9 purity and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium occurrence thumb thulium is found in mineral monazite element is never found in nature in pure form but it is found in small quantities in minerals with other rare earths thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium in particular thulium occurs in mineral gadolinite however thulium also occurs in minerals monazite xenotime and euxenite thulium has not been found in prevalence over other rare earths in any mineral yet its abundance in earth s crust is 0 5 mg kg by weight and 50 parts per billion by moles thulium makes up approximately 0 5 parts per million of soil although this value can range from 0 4 to 0 8 parts per million thulium makes up 250 parts per quadrillion of seawater in solar system thulium exists in concentrations of 200 parts per trillion by weight and 1 part per trillion by moles thulium ore occurs most commonly in china however australia brazil greenland india tanzania and united states also have large reserves of thulium total reserves of thulium are approximately 100 000 tonnes thulium is least abundant lanthanide on earth except for radioactive promethium production thulium is principally extracted from monazite ores 0 007 thulium found in river sands through ion exchange newer ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques have led to easier separation of rare earths which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production principal sources today are ion adsorption clays of southern china in these where about two thirds of total rare earth content is yttrium thulium is about 0 5 or about tied with lutetium for rarity metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container none of thulium s natural compounds are commercially important approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced in 1996 thulium oxide cost us 20 per gram and in 2005 99 pure thulium metal powder cost us 70 per gram applications thulium has a few applications laser holmium chromium thulium triple doped yttrium aluminum garnet ho cr tm yag or ho

operate at 2010 nm wavelength of thulium based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water this makes thulium lasers attractive for laser based surgery x ray source despite its high cost portable x ray devices use thulium that has been bombarded in a nuclear reactor as a radiation source these radioactive sources have a useful life of about one year as tools in medical and dental diagnosis as well as to detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components such sources do not need extensive radiation protection only a small cup of lead thulium 170 is gaining popularity as an x ray source for cancer treatment via brachytherapy sealed source radiation therapy this isotope has a half life of 128 6

biomedical engineering ben gurion university of negev thulium 170 is one of four most popular radioisotopes for use in industrial radiography others thulium has been used in high temperature superconductors similarly to yttrium thulium potentially has use in ferrites ceramic magnetic materials that are used in microwave equipment thulium is also similar to scandium in that it is used in arc lighting for its unusual spectrum in this case its green emission lines which are not covered by other elements because thulium fluoresces with a blue color when exposed to ultraviolet light thulium is put into euro banknotes as a measure against counterfeiting blue fluorescence of tm doped calcium sulfate has been used in personal dosimeters for visual monitoring of radiation tm doped halides in which tm is in its 2 valence state are promising luminescent materials that can make efficient electricity generating windows based on principle of a luminescent solar concentrator possible biological role and precautions soluble thulium salts are mildly toxic but insoluble thulium salts are completely nontoxic when injected thulium can cause degeneration of liver and spleen and can also cause hemoglobin concentration to fluctuate liver damage from thulium is more prevalent in male mice than female mice despite this thulium has a low level of toxicity in humans thulium occurs in highest amounts in liver kidneys and bones humans typically consume several micrograms of thulium per year roots of plants do not take up thulium and dry weight of vegetables usually contains one part
