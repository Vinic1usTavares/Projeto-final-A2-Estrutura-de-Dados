rickon s captivity by presenting shaggydog s head sansa tells ramsay that he will die next day and rides off ramsay gloats that he has been starving his hounds in anticipation of feeding them jon and his advisors after jon discusses battle plan with tormund and davos sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that ramsay will defeat them jon insists that their army

insists that his hounds will not turn on him but sansa reminds him that they have been purposefully starved and having correctly predicted they would turn on him walks away smiling as they devour him alive production writing thumb alt series creators d b weiss and david benioff episode was written by series co creators david benioff and d b weiss battle of bastards was written by series creators david benioff and d b weiss elements of episode are based on sixth novel in a song of ice and fire series winds of winter which author george r r martin hoped to complete before sixth season aired in an inside episode segment published by hbo shortly after episode aired benioff and weiss said that final battle was primarily inspired by battle of cannae and american civil war according to weiss we went back to roman fight against carthaginians in battle of cannae where romans got caught in an encirclement by hannibal and just slaughtered to man we used that as our model benioff said battle of bastards becomes incredibly compact all these men all these combatants crammed into this incredibly tight space on battlefield you read accounts of battles in civil war where bodies were piled so thick it was actually an obstruction on battlefield episode director miguel sapochnik said in an interview that battle of agincourt was original inspiration but concept was adapted to fit budgetary constraints weiss said that they wanted to depict a full fledged battle from beginning we knew that one thing we d never had on show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all forces they can into play in some battlefield that s somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and other one loses this is a staple of human history and we started to look through film samples of it there really wasn t one that both made you feel what it was like to be there on ground and gave you a sense of geography of battle according to benioff they also wanted to demonstrate role luck plays in battle just to feel kind of randomness of it where there s arrows falling from everywhere people are getting killed people are getting trampled by horses and so much of it is just luck jon snow is a very skilled combatant but part of reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky in inside episode featurette benioff said about daenerys targaryen s transformation during series i think dany s been becoming a targaryen ever since beginning of season 1 according to weiss she s not her father and she s not insane and she s not a sadist but there s a targaryen ruthlessness that comes with even good targaryens benioff concluded if you re one of lords of westeros or one of her potential opponents in wars to come and you get word of what happened here in meereen you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat you ve got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a dothraki horde a legion of unsullied she s got mercenary army of second sons and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown so if she can make it all way across narrow sea and get to westeros who s going to stand in her way casting battle of bastards was final episode for actor iwan rheon who had played ramsay bolton since game of thrones third season his first appearance was in dark wings dark words as a then unnamed boy who helps a captured theon greyjoy before he was cast as ramsay rheon auditioned for role of jon snow in an interview he described learning about his character s fate i had received half scripts five episodes then i got call they joked isn t it great ramsay ends up on iron throne as soon as they said that i said he s dead isn t he it s cool i ve had four lovely seasons here it s been great to be involved with such an amazing show i think it s kind of right he goes down because what else is he going to do after this he s done so many things it s justified and it s right thing to do it s right path he s reached his peak it s nice for audience that he goes out on this high if you will in that interview kit harington talked about rheon i love iwan s work he s an incredibly detailed actor who s created a character who s remarkable and despicable battle of bastards was also last episode for recurring character rickon stark art parkinson who had appeared since series premiere episode winter is coming in an ign interview parkinson said that he was tipped off about his character s death whenever i was told that i was coming back for season 6 before they sent me through scripts and stuff they sent me through a ring just to say listen so that you don t get a shock whenever you read scripts just know that you die this season he continued whenever i came back i was excited to come back and scenes all seemed pretty amazing i was so happy to re embrace character according to parkinson he was sorry that rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation it was a cool death and it was always going to be a good death so at same time i was pretty happy another character departure was smalljon umber played by dean s jagger in an interview jagger talked about his casting i prayed for it when i heard i got part my knees buckled it was a life changing moment before becoming a professional actor jagger dug trenches and worked at a mattress factory to pay his way through acting school and was a professional ian whyte also made his last appearance in battle of bastards as giant wun wun he had played gregor clegane during show s second season special effects supervisor joe bauer said about whyte s casting as wun wun we wanted a large performer because somebody who would be 14 15 feet tall would have more weight and mass to move around and a person who s a normal size would have a very difficult time pulling that off filming battle of winterfell right thumb upright alt director of episode miguel sapochnik miguel sapochnik directed episode his third of series battle of bastards was directed by miguel sapochnik who had directed fifth season episodes gift and hardhome in an entertainment weekly interview before episode aired sapochnik said he was brought on board by benioff and weiss after his previous season success hardhome won several awards including primetime creative arts emmy awards about how episode should be shot he said every battle on thrones is unique i think that s why benioff and weiss keep doing them in case of battle of bastards or bob as we affectionately called it in production david and dan wanted to do a thing of spectacle a strategic battle they hadn t had resources to do back in season 1 or 2 i was particularly interested in depicting both horror of war and role of luck in battle benioff called sapochnik s work on episode some of best in series history it took 25 days to film requiring 500 extras 600 crew members and 70 horses benioff described difficulty of coordinating horses in battle scenes which is why they are rarely used except in big budget war films weiss added miguel s really outdone himself fully fleshed out medieval battles require a tremendous amount of resources and choreography to get them right it feels like we re doing something fresh that you don t see on tv and movies very often four camera crews were used for battle scene 500 extras were largely snow and bolton armies as wildlings archers swordsmen and spearmen each army was trained separately to create off screen rivalry between two groups and visual effects were used to expand army to thousands kristofer hivju who plays tormund giantsbane said about intensity of filming scenes it was pretty intense actually when you have 20 people running around getting squeezed together and you re trying to chop at another bearded guy with a sword you are not out of danger you re laying down in mud and one wrong step you won t have a face anymore it was very intense and miguel insisted on making it that muddy and messy war is not beautiful sometimes you see action sequences where battles seem organized i know that from how vikings fought it s not beautiful it s hard it s hard work we had to shoot moment to moment chronologically we would shoot one sequence 80 times per day left thumb alt hannibal barca at battle of cannae battle of cannae in second punic war was an inspiration for battle of bastards in an interview after episode aired sapochnik detailed process of filming battle and called akira kurosawa s ran an inspiration in shooting scenes i watched every pitch field battle i could find footage of real ones too looking for patterns for what works what doesn t what takes you out of moment what keeps you locked in interestingly one of things i noticed is that staging of these battles through years has changed dramatically back in day you d see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences first it was all real no cgi or digital replication and second often when horses would go down you can kind of tell they got really hurt nowadays you d never get away with that and nor would you want to asked about greatest challenge in filming battle sapochnik said every time we charge horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all fake snow on field and rub out horseshoe prints so how many times can we afford to charge horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that s 10 times longer than actual shot another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8 000 when you are shooting in a field where there s just nowhere to hide your shortfall it becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation and finally how do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days 10 hours a day without them just telling you to piss off in an interview he said that single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was having 3 000 horses running at each other especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other it s illegal it s a very valid rule about protecting horses so very thing we were trying to do was not allowed and we only had 70 horses solution was you would have one guy run into frame and then horse rider would pull horse which means make horse fall and lie down on its side later we would digitally superimpose another c g i horse and make it seem like it had impacted live one according to director scene was filmed on privately owned land in saintfield northern ireland and they had only 12 days to shoot after reading script sapochnik came up with a 48 day shooting schedule which was whittled down to 25 days cgi of ghost jon snow s direwolf in episode presented difficulties he was in there in spades originally but it s also an incredibly time consuming and expensive character to bring to life ultimately we had to choose between wun wun and direwolf so dog bit dust sapochnik said that a crucial scene was filmed off script after three days of rain unable to finish filming as scripted he suggested a scene in which jon snow was trampled and nearly buried alive by bodies director described character pushing his way out as rebirthing right thumb alt rebirthing scene and concluding scene with daenerys targaryen in third season kit harington compared rebirthing scene to conclusion of third season episode mhysa with daenerys targaryen in an interview about rebirthing scene kit harington said that it intended to mirror daenerys targaryen scene at end of third season episode mhysa when daenerys is held up by freed yunkai slaves in battle of bastards jon snow emerges from crushing crowd of battle when crush starts happening he slows down and there s that thing of peace where he thinks i could just stay here and let it all end and then something drives him to fight up and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath he is reborn again which i found weirdly reflective of scene where dany is held aloft at end of season three battle of bastards was first episode in which kit harington and iwan rheon filmed scenes together and met on screen rheon said that he had always wanted to film scenes with jon snow anyone who has asked me who would you like ramsay to meet my answer has always been jon snow he s antithesis of ramsay they re almost a yin and a yang they both come from such a similar place yet they re so different and even though they re enemies they ve both risen so far as bastards which is almost incomprehensible and now they re both here facing each other they couldn t be any more different yet more similar in an interview harington talked about fight scene with rheon i actually did punch iwan in face twice by accident which he took really well he was really nice about it according to rheon way i see it if you don t get hit a couple of times doing that you re not doing it properly a notable goof occurred during scene where jon snow mounts his horse in an attempt to rescue rickon before ramsay s arrows can reach him as he s climbing into saddle snow s valyrian sword and its scabbard can be seen bending wildly betraying its status as a rubber stand in battle of meereen for daenerys scene at beginning of episode where three dragons burn part of masters fleet sapochnik credited vfx supervisor joe bauer and producer steve kullback for post production work for this sequence david and dan said that what they wanted to see was a demonstration of what s to come so i tried to approach it in most elegant epic big movie way i could director tried to design shots with relative realism inspired by footage of world war ii supermarine spitfires in action he based dragon shots on wildlife footage allowing them to break frame these things should be so big and fast it s hard to keep up with them to insert emilia clarke as daenerys targaryen into scene she rode a multi directional computer controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like upper shoulders of dragon clarke was filmed separately in belfast northern ireland battle of bastards featured first meeting of daenerys targaryen and yara and theon greyjoy and yara s first meeting with tyrion lannister gemma whelan who plays yara talked about filming scene oh my goodness i was so excited when i saw that i had a scene with those two daenerys and tyrion about dynamic between two women whelan said it s clear as scene plays out that yara quite likes dany we share a lot of little looks and there s some playful language in how we talk to one another dany asks if iron islands ever had a queen and yara says no more than westeros they recognize girl power undertow between two of them reception ratings battle of bastards was watched by 7 66 million american households in its initial telecast on hbo slightly more than previous week s rating 7 60 million viewers for no one episode competed with game seven of 2016 nba finals it had a 3 9 rating in 18 49 demographic highest rated show on cable television that night in united kingdom episode was seen by 2 450 million viewers on sky atlantic channel s highest rated broadcast that week and had 0 118 million timeshift viewers critical reception battle of bastards received immense critical acclaim with many calling it one of best television episodes of all time matt fowler of ign calling it a masterpiece critics cited size and scope of battle in north and daenerys s scene with her dragons at beginning of episode it has a 98 rating on review aggregator website rotten tomatoes from 50 reviews with an average score of 9 2 out of 10 according to site consensus battle of bastards delivered one of greatest battle sequences in show s history and some savagely satisfying vengeance as well ign s matt fowler wrote in his review at this point it seems like pattern when it comes to ninth episode of a given season of game of thrones is tragic death amazing battle tragic death amazing battle and so on and this being season 6 it was time to land on a phenomenal clash of swords and shields and battle of bastards certainly delivered he continued game of thrones did not disappoint when it came to this season s great northern battle as jon and sansa s differences were spectacularly highlighted in a savagely strong war chapter that saw house stark overcome huge odds to reclaim their home plus daenerys got to soar as her dragons quickly stopped a violent siege with fury and fire fowler gave episode a top score of 10 jeremy egner of new york times also praised episode as directed by miguel sapochnik who also oversaw last season s terrific hardhome episode lengthy sequence was terrifying gripping and exhilarating sometimes all at once a sweeping display of all different ways one can die on battlefield egner called ramsay s death an episode highlight ramsay bolton s demise was arguably most eagerly anticipated death ever on game of thrones and show handled it with flair dispatching him in a poetic canine fueled fashion that was no less satisfying for being telegraphed early on and concluded about daenerys s scene daenerys had a few words for slave masters who launched their attack last week those words included surrender or die and thanks for ships as we saw another thrilling action sequence that i believe reunited dragon triplets for first time since they were quite young myles mcnutt of a v club wrote in his review this battle works as a climactic moment for game of thrones as a cultural event selling us on scale and ambition of producers and their production teams all who should be commended for accomplishments from a technical perspective according to james of entertainment weekly was this show s best episode it s hard to immediately process that question maybe probably it s almost certainly most exciting hour and had most jaw dropping battle sequence we ve seen yet on tv ed power of daily telegraph discussed episode s refreshing strong women theme game of thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly wobbly window dressing and though has been dialed back this season it s still very much a calling card however there are reasons for suspecting that series is attempting to make amends by arguing that westeros would be far better off with women in charge even as sansa was turning tide at winterfell in meereen daenerys and yara greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance and seemingly rock solid alliance for ages laura prudom of variety agreed after seasons of criticism over show s misogyny sometimes earned sometimes not it s thrilling to see an episode like battle of bastards where women like dany sansa and yara and emasculated men either figuratively or literally like tyrion and theon break gears of war and familiar patterns of violence by attempting to leave world better than we found it despite examples set by evil men who came before them according to sarah larson of new yorker sansa watches calmly then smiles you ve come a long way baby or she s become a monster and so have i women of westeros are on warpath accolades episode received a record six primetime emmy awards including awards for writing and direction battle of
