hurricane danielle was first of several cape verde hurricanes to form during 2004 atlantic hurricane season danielle was fourth named storm and third hurricane of season danielle formed on august 13 2004 in far eastern atlantic ocean and remained over central atlantic peaking as a strong category 2 hurricane on august 16 reaching cooler waters danielle began to weaken becoming a remnant low on august 21 and dissipating on august 24 danielle never approached land although it briefly threatened azores as it made a northerly turn as a result there was no impact caused by storm meteorological history hurricane danielle began as a vigorous tropical wave over africa as wave emerged into atlantic it quickly became more organized due to favorable conditions including low wind shear circulation consolidated and spawned tropical depression four on morning of august 13 south southeast of cape verde islands system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79 degf 26 degc however low shear environment allowed depression to continue to organize late that evening system strengthened into tropical storm danielle as danielle tracked westward into open atlantic early on august 14 storm encountered warmer water southwest of cape verde and began to gradually intensify becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50 mph 85 km h winds that morning at that point a bout of rapid intensification began to take place and storm was upgraded to hurricane danielle that evening as an eye began to form over a 24 hour period ending in morning of august 15 pressure fell from 1004 to 978 mbar and winds increased to 90 mph 145 km h making it a high end category 1 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale danielle levelled off somewhat in intensity after that round of rapid intensification only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural changes in storm related to small wind field relative to size of eye nonetheless danielle became a category 2 hurricane on afternoon of august 15 as it approached subtropical ridge which blocked continued westward movement beginning late on august 15 at about 35degw danielle began to recurve to northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen early on august 16 recurvature became more pronounced and danielle turned abruptly northward in central atlantic ocean as an upper level trough opened up a large break in ridge that movement took it along eastern side of subtropical ridge preventing danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to north america or caribbean while moving northwest danielle strengthened a bit more reaching its peak intensity of 110 mph 175 km h just under category 3 intensity on afternoon of august 16 right thumb hurricane danielle weakening on august 17 northward movement also sent danielle into somewhat increased shear which allowed it to begin to weaken however weakening was gradual at first as waters remained fairly warm abrupt northerly turn meant that for a while on august 17 azores were threatened by danielle in long range forecast as a weakened tropical storm or extratropical cyclone danielle weakened to a category 1 hurricane on evening of august 17 as shear continued to increase danielle began to turn to northeast early on august 18 and at that point weakening trend accelerated some of deep convection was being removed from system due to wind shear and that morning danielle weakened to a tropical storm rapid weakening trend continued that afternoon and danielle weakened to a low end tropical storm with 45 mph 75 km h winds late that evening however intensity levelled off early on august 19 and danielle remained a tropical storm for next couple days over moderately warm water of around 78 degf just under 26 degc while south southwest of azores intermittent deep convection continued to fire up keeping storm afloat for next day and turning it away from azores danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to northwest away from azores due to very weak steering currents after holding on as a minimal tropical storm danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on afternoon of august 20 depression turned once again to north and continued to lose organization over cooler water it degenerated into a remnant low on afternoon of august 21 as convection was completely sheared away from center of danielle remnant low remained in open ocean remaining devoid of any deep convection until august 24 when it dissipated west southwest of azores impact naming and records hurricane danielle did not have any impact on land and no damage or fatalities were reported no ships were reported to have come into contact with danielle when danielle became a tropical storm at 24 8degw it was farthest east that a storm had received a name since hurricane alberto in 2000 atlantic hurricane season see also other storms of same
