to transfer to michigan from california state normal school when 21 year old schulz joined team there were suggestions that he was yost s newest ringer suspicions were exacerbated by reports that schulz was a factory worker in an indiana steel mill who had played for a half dozen professional teams before enrolling at michigan until time of his death reports of his having been a ringer angered schulz while he did work in a steel mill schulz insisted that he did not come out of steel mill to play football instead schulz said he went into mill to harden himself up for football season when asked years later how he got to michigan schulz recalled that in summer of 1904 he was working in mill and had received several offers to play football one day his father called to say that fielding yost of michigan was in his office schulz ran down street and rushed into his father s office where he was introduced to yost his father promptly told him adolph this is mr yost you are to play

kept asking yost when he was going to be allowed to register yost told schulz that he had taken care of it according to schulz he was registered two weeks before he ever saw campus yost s account differed dramatically from that of schulz sensitive to allegations that he was recruiting ringers yost denied having recruited schulz and claimed that schulz was just another student who tried out for team according to yost first time he ever saw schulz was in fall of 1904 when schulz was waiting tables at a fraternity house in ann arbor and told yost he would like to play football yost went so far as to say that he initially thought young waiter looked too awkward to be a football player but did not want to discourage anybody freshman year michigan s undefeated season schulz was only freshman to play on michigan s 1904 football team team featured school s all time scoring leader willie heston finished with a record of 10 0 and outscored opponents 567 22 schulz started all ten games for 1904 team schulz began his playing career at michigan as a guard starting five games at that position however midway through season yost moved schulz to center where he started remaining five games schulz s play at center was reported to have been gilt edged and his accuracy in snapping ball was praised by team s quarterback fred norcross six games into season schulz s hometown newspaper reported on schulz s accomplishments under headline makes good at michigan article noted schulz went to ann arbor practically green at game but by hard and consistent work he has succeeded in winning a place on greatest team in america and is only freshman out of fifty who was able to do so schulz was one of larger football players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during michigan s 1904 game against oberlin college he recalled we were playing oberlin in 1904 their regular center was hurt and a little 155 pound fellow came in i hit him as hard as i could imagine my surprise when he looked up and said please sir if you are determined to be fierce let me know and i ll get out of way i was no good rest of afternoon every time i looked at little fellow i had to break out laughing 1905 season stardom right thumb 200px amos alonzo stagg before 1905 season got underway schulz contracted malaria in spring newspapers reported it was a serious attack and that he has been quite ill but he was able to recuperate before 1905 football season in october 1905 coach yost said in looking over whole bunch i do not see anyone who has improved more than schulz he is bigger and stronger than ever and i do not know a man in world that has it least bit over him in center position i would not trade him for any other center rush in country today he looks good to me for all america team right now though he was not selected for all america team in 1905 schulz did receive all western honors innovations spiral snap and roving center schulz is widely credited with two important innovations in development of modern game of american football first he is credited with having invented spiral snap before schulz centers passed ball to one of backs in an end over end manner second schulz is credited with being first center to step back from line while playing defense prior to schulz s innovation centers played in line on defense in 1905 schulz began dropping back from line enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across field of play at time innovation was referred to as a roving center but it was effectively birth of linebacker position in american football asked how he developed roving center idea schulz noted that backs started from five yards behind line and concluded no back living could move five yards while i was moving four he described his thinking to coach yost this way it s all very simple yost ball carrier travels five yards while i travel only four yard to meet him i know of no back who can beat me in a five yard race after giving me a one yard handicap in 1954 sports columnist dave lewis explored history of linebacker position and concluded that schulz was first of breed lewis wrote schulz revolutionized defensive line play being first to back up line schulz recalled that first time he stepped back from line on defense coach yost was horrified yost said dutchman what are you trying to do stop em replied schulz but you re supposed to play in line yost insisted they ll run over us listen yost schulz claims to have said my way is best if any of em gets by me i ll move back into line and stay there yost eventually saw wisdom in schulz s technique and soon nearly all centers were backing up line on defense ineligibility for 1906 season schulz s promising football career took a detour in 1906 some sources indicate that schulz missed 1906 season for financial reasons schulz s official biography at college football hall of fame states he missed 1906 season he had dropped out of school because of a lack of funds he worked in a steel mill in fort wayne indiana and earned money to return to college in fact schulz s father was a successful doctor and contemporary reports indicate that schulz was ineligible to play in 1906 for academic reasons in february 1906 one paper reported that schulz had been dropped from rolls on account of poor work during semester another report in march 1906 indicated that schulz had left university by desire of faculty after he fell behind in his studies in september 1906 washington post reported that schulz s academic problems continued to render him ineligible to play all american in 1907 thumb right schulz depicted on a football card c 1955 when schulz returned to team in 1907 he was talk of campus one newspaper reported that ann arbor had 5 000 students continually gossiping about him as schulz s return was seen as a gigantic stride in direction of michigan s winning back her former football prestige coach yost noted we need him not only as a player but also as a leader in energy ability to stand hard knocks and courage he is a model for rest of team to strive after with schulz in lineup michigan won its first five games by a combined score of 107 0 in michigan s game against ohio state schulz was reported to have been a brick wall of defense and hard as nails after starting season 5 0 michigan closed 1907 season playing university of pennsylvania for first time one of eastern schools had agreed to play a game at ferry field in ann arbor in buildup to game press focused on schulz as key to michigan s chances one writer noted there is one man in michigan eleven that pennsylvania fears and will endeavor to stop if possible when two great teams meet in ann arbor november 16 1907 that man is germany schulz yost s great center penn even announced that they were moving their star tackle draper to center in an effort to stop schulz in end penn beat michigan 6 0 marking first time wolverines had ever lost a game at ferry field despite loss press reports after game credited schulz with a great effort one account noted pennsy is said to have delegated three players to watch him heavyweight center played a star game throughout he broke through line repeatedly and stopped plays then again he would dash out to end and tackle man attempting to circle wing he was down under punts and in open play showed as much speed as any player on field and he weighs 234 pounds at end of season there was a consensus that giant center of michigan practically stands in a class by himself at pivot position university of chicago star walter eckersall said schulz of michigan easily outshone his opponents in every game he is finely built runs fast snaps accurately tackles hard and is all over field in every play one writer referred to schulz in 1907 as a human catapult and said schulz of michigan is a very heavy man weighing over 200 pounds yet he is strikingly fast on his feet and is unusual on that account he propels his massive frame at a rate of speed that terrifies opponents acknowledged prowess of schulz makes him an especial object of unfair attack in scrimmages by opponents who hope by disabling him to weaken michigan team coach yost added schultz is without doubt best center in country in fact schulz is best man in middle of line i have ever seen in all my football experience in naming schulz to his all america team walter camp said he is well over six feet in height yet a fast powerful man who gets well over field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team in addition he is an accurate passer and feeds ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs controversy over eligibility for 1908 as 1907 season ended a controversy was sparked when michigan players unanimously voted schulz as captain for 1908 season michigan had been suspended by western conference after 1906 season and if it was to seek readmission in 1908 it was required to comply with western conference eligibility rules under those rules a player was limited to three years of play though michigan s rule allowed a player four years of eligibility michigan officials contended that schulz should not be governed by rule because he had begun play before conference s rule was enacted schulz found himself in middle of football s first eligibility controversy at same time david starr jordan president of stanford university made a speech referring to modern college football as unethical unchristian unsportsmanlike and a monstrosity starr noted that practically all major universities employ questionable methods in securing athletes jordan heaped particular scorn on michigan where he claimed alumni and cheap gamblers of town brought in men who were professionals and paid them salaries to play on michigan athlete teams new york times ran a front page story repeating jordan s charges western conference s eligibility rules had been at center of michigan s dispute with conference for more than a year unlike western conference eastern schools had looser eligibility standards and it was generally conceded that playing under western conference s strict eligibility rules michigan is at a big disadvantage in games with eastern colleges where to say least lines are not so clearly drawn schulz complained amid controversy about inaccurate reporting of his age as a rule my age is generally given as twenty five when in fact i am but twenty three schulz would have been 24 at time of his comments michigan presented its case for schulz to a meeting of big nine in chicago one account noted michigan case will be discussed at meeting and it is very likely that a vote requesting ann arbor institution to withdraw from body will be passed michigan s open violation of conference rules during last year has aroused a strong hostile spirit and it is known that a majority of schools favor dropping wolverines from association manager charles baird was given task of arguing schulz s case to conference at its january meeting student newspaper michigan daily urged school not to abandon schulz it wrote germany schulz is now recognized as captain of michigan s next football team and while michigan students are not averse to going back into active alliance with western schools any attempt to debar schulz from his fairly won honor is sure to cause an uproar which may upset all of feeling of compromise which is now evident ultimately western conference forced michigan to choose between schulz or conference michigan chose schulz and big nine remained big eight for 1908 season 1908 season and further academic eligibility problems after a strong show of support from university schulz ran into further academic problems in february 1908 university announced that schulz was ineligible for track team schulz competed in shot put and discus due to his performance on a semester exam in hydraulics while he would be allowed to get his work straightened out before it came time to compete in football news accounts noted that outlook is rather gloomy at present by time football season arrived schulz s academic problems had worsened contemporary reports indicated that it is not physical conditions which are keeping giant player from game as was announced but educational ones in early october 1908 schulz had three conditions in engineering course more than a player can carry and continue his athletic relations though every effort had been made for two weeks to have conditions removed those efforts had failed a meeting of eligibility board was held and they concluded that schulz could not play until he removed at least two of conditions while it was possible for schulz to remove conditions by end of october by burning midnight oil it was reported that this is an optimistic view of situation shared by few schulz ultimately had his eligibility restored in late october and was greeted with cheers from bleachers when he appeared in his first practice on october 22 1908 it appears that schulz s academic problems continued as a 1910 article concerning post college success of football players reported that schulz didn t finish his course at michigan 1908 penn game in 1908 michigan went into its rivalry game against penn undefeated michigan hoped to avenge two straight defeats to quakers and its hopes were based to a large extent on schulz penn announced before game that it would bring four available centers so there might be a fresh antagonist facing michigan captain throughout game special trains from all over michigan poured large crowds into ann arbor and crowd was said to be largest attendance which has been on ferry field though michigan was beaten that day 29 0 schulz s courageous performance and pummeling he took from penn team was recounted many times in following decades not all of these accounts are consistent with each other but story of penn game has become an integral part of germany schulz hagiography in one of few contemporaneous accounts toledo blade wrote that penn players knowing that schulz was power in michigan game focused their energy on wearing him down there were two penn players who did nothing but look after schultz and they did more than look in every scrimmage he was bumped as hard as rules allowed and maybe a little harder when nobody was looking every time schultz started anywhere he would find a couple of penn men digging headfirst into his stomach they would elbow him jam him with straight arm and if he went to ground in a scrimmage there generally would be a knee grinding him in wind pretty soon schultz began to show it he limped along pitifully he couldn t run his strength was almost gone when he did tackle his groan of pain could almost be heard in stands but fans continued to urge schulz with yells of g r r r r rah schultz schulz buckled down and continued to play and pummeling continued at half time trainers found on schulz a mass of black and blue spots his face was distorted with bumps and there were welts on his back and groin as second half started schulz insisted he felt better and went back into game but attack continued another scrimmage and two more penn men were after him again he went into play and for an instant his strength came back but it couldn t last and it didn t yost finally sent in a substitute and schulz limped to sideline and walked slowly away with head bowed and hands to his stomach and when rubbers removed his and examined him they marveled that he was able to walk in end schulz didn t say a word big tears rolled down as he lay there schultz was thoroughly beaten but it took entire pennsylvania eleven to do it penn s captain bill hollenback said this fellow schulz is a monster in size and a perfect athlete he is both wonderfully agile and fast for a man of his size in our game with michigan we had two men instructed to play against schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him for some time he handed out as much as we passed to him in roughing end of game he was here there and everywhere he did most of tackling he broke up innumerable plays he was star of contest until continued battering of our men injured him to such an extent that he had to retire rest was easy coach yost said of schulz s performance he gave greatest one man exhibition of courage i ever saw on a football field from 1920s through 1950s story was told re told and likely embellished in columns by grantland rice art carlson frank blair and dave lewis more than one of them writing that they had seen game in person in carlson s 1925 account giant center had been rendered practically useless from penn attack but refused to leave game carlson recalled schulz s removal from game this way it was a scene i shall never forget giant schulz towering above rest of combatants literally dragged off field tears streaming down his mud spattered cheeks as he frantically protested his removal from game in 1942 grantland rice wrote that schulz held penn team in check for 50 minutes and that score was 0 0 when schulz left field a battered wreck in fact contemporaneous accounts show score was 6 0 at halftime in frank blair s 1951 telling schulz played with strength of samson and penn put five men center both guards and both tackles on wolverine giant according to blair who claimed to have attended game as a high school student schulz played like a madman making nearly all tackles for 50 minutes and penn was held scoreless until schulz was carried from field in a 1954 article sports writer dave lewis wrote that penn assigned five players to task of mowing down schulz lewis quoted schulz as having said i can still see those five pairs of eyes staring at me every time we lined up ready to tear me apart according to lewis all five men piled on schulz every play and schulz held penn scoreless for 50 minutes before they finally knocked him out lewis concluded never before or since has there been such a one man show of defensive football as schulz displayed against penn a few months before his death schulz told detroit news sports writer h g that he had only one regret i wish i could have lasted 10 minutes longer that was one game i wanted to finish awards and accolades in january 1910 walter camp published his all time all american list in century magazine selecting best player at each position over 20 years he had been watching college football he selected schulz as his center first of many such all time all american selections for schulz at time camp said big strong and fast he combined all defensive and offensive qualities of best line men with speed sure tackling and intuition as to what to do on instant that are winning qualities of defensive back in addition his passing was excellent as he had plenty of speed for his kicker steadiness for his quarter and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays in 1949 grantland rice chose him as center for his all time all american team at time rice said schulz was 6 feet 4 and he weighed 245 pounds he was as fast as a good halfback i have never seen a center who was his equal at backing up a line and then protecting both flanks he was a terrific tackler in 1951 college football foundation commissioned associated press to conduct a poll of more than 100 sports editors to choose an all time all american team those chosen would be initial inductees into new college football hall of fame schulz won great majority of votes at center and thus became one of initial inductees into college football hall of fame in announcing selection associated press said schulz was a giant of a man six feet five and 285 pounds with tremendous ham like hands that worked to his advantage in that era of mass formations when ground was gained on brute strength alone on being told of his selection schulz who died ten days later said he was honored and noted i haven t missed one of those teams yet he was inducted into michigan sports
