background in 1994 a rolling stone magazine interviewer asked silence of lambs director jonathan demme about a possible sequel demme responded that thomas harris author of silence of lambs had been working on follow up for seven or eight years demme had an idea even at that time that it would not be a straight follow up harris had told demme i imagine doctor lecter going somewhere in europe strolling round streets of florence or munich gazing in windows of watchmakers demme stated his intention to be involved in film adaptation of hannibal in 1998 less than a year before novel was published hannibal dvd making of feature dino de laurentiis produced michael mann s film manhunter in 1986 based on harris s 1981 novel red dragon featuring first appearance of hannibal lecter played by brian cox de laurentiis did not like mann s film manhunter was no good it was not red dragon he said de laurentiis and his wife martha also his co producer had no direct involvement in silence of lambs a decision de laurentiis came to regret they did however own rights to lecter character and reportedly allowed orion pictures which produced silence of lambs to use character of lecter for free not wishing to be greedy when silence of lambs became a commercial and critical success in 1991 winning five academy awards both dino and martha de laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow up novel they could adapt after a lengthy wait de laurentiis finally received a call from harris telling him he had finished sequel to silence of lambs and de laurentiis purchased rights for a record 10 million in april 1999 los angeles times reported that budget for an adaptation of hannibal could cost as much as 100 million it speculated that both jodie foster and anthony hopkins would receive 15 million each to reprise their roles and 5 million to 19 million for director jonathan demme newspaper further reported although silence of lambs cost only 22 million this would not deter studio from going ahead with hannibal mort harris s agent at time told los angeles times that foster hopkins and demme would soon receive manuscripts of novel claiming it would make an unbelievable film novel sold out of its initial 1 6 million print run in summer of 1999 hannibal went on to sell millions of copies following its release demme informed producers of hannibal that he would pass on directing film it has been claimed demme turned down project because he found material lurid and was averse to novel s gore de laurentiis said of demme s decision to decline when pope dies we create a new pope good luck to jonathan demme good bye he has since added that demme felt he could not make a sequel as good as silence of lambs ridley scott de laurentiis visited ridley scott on set of gladiator and suggested to ridley he read novel he had bought rights to scott was in third week before principal photography was due to finish on gladiator gladiator became a commercial and critical success earning 12 academy award nominations de laurentiis asked scott if he would like to direct film version of hannibal scott misunderstood which hannibal he meant thinking de laurentiis was speaking of general and historical figure from carthage who nearly brought down roman empire back around 200 b c so he replied basically dino i m doing a roman epic right now i don t wanna do elephants coming over alps next old boy scott read manuscript in four sittings within a week believing it to be a symphony and expressed his desire to do it scott further explains how he got involved i was shooting gladiator in malta and one day for hell of it i went for a walk for half a mile down road to malta film studio to see my old buddy dino i had not seen him since i d worked on a version of dune this was pre blade runner dino had pursued me to direct dune and another film he s always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when i did both blade runner and alien but i couldn t do films anyway we had an espresso together and a few days later he called me to ask if he could visit gladiator set he arrived with a manuscript of hannibal about a month before it was published in book form he said let s make this one i haven t read anything so fast since godfather it was so rich in all kind of ways although scott had accepted job demme had rejected he said my first question was what about jonathan and they said original team said it s too violent i said okay i ll do it scott did himself have some uncertainty with source material in particular he had difficulties with ending of novel in which lecter and starling become lovers i couldn t take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of starling certainly on behalf of hannibal i m sure that s been in back of his mind for a number of years but for starling no i think one of attractions about starling to hannibal is what a straight arrow she is he also didn t buy book from opera scene onwards which became like a vampire movie he asked harris if he was married to his ending harris said he was not so scott changed it script development ted tally screenwriter for silence of lambs was another key member of original team to decline involvement in hannibal he won an academy award for his silence adaptation tally like demme had problems with novel s excesses steven zaillian writer of schindler s list was offered chance to write adaptation after tally passed but he also declined he explained that i was busy and i wasn t sure i was interested you can almost never win when you do a sequel david mamet was first screenwriter to produce a draft which according to ridley scott and producers needed major revisions stacey snider co chairman of universal pictures a co production deal was struck between universal and mgm said on rejection of mamet s screenplay there s no way david was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available to work on script day to day mamet was preparing to direct his own film zaillian who had already passed reconsidered and became involved in project saying it s hard to say no to dino once and it s almost impossible to say no to him twice a script review at com describes mamet draft as stunningly bad but found zaillian s rewrite to be gripping entertainment this question regarding script development was put to ridley scott by total film magazine there were lots of rewrites on hannibal what was main problem with original material scott replied that s inaccurate because there were very few rewrites once i brought in steve zaillian if you were to ask who were best three screenwriters in business steve zaillian would be one of them we discussed hannibal endlessly asked if he had read mamet s draft he said yes he is very fast very efficient but he was off doing a film hannibal was green lit and his first draft only took about a month but i was scared that he would not be able to give me enough attention because that draft needed a lot of work so i moved on basically scott has said there were writing and structural problems as to what they would do with parts of film one of zaillian s key objectives was to revise script by david mamet until it pleased all parties meaning love story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by assault scott worked through script with zaillian for 28 days making him sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of way with him after 25 days scott suddenly realized that zaillian was exorcising 600 pages of book he was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do frankly i could have just made it casting it was unclear if jodie foster clarice starling and anthony hopkins hannibal lecter would reprise their respective roles for which they won academy awards in silence of lambs best actress actor it became apparent that producers and studio could do without one of original stars and would go on to find a replacement withdrawal of both foster and hopkins could possibly have been terminal for project however de laurentiis confirmed this after film s release first and foremost i knew we had no movie without anthony hopkins involvement of jodie foster regarding her involvement in a sequel to silence of lambs foster confirmed to larry king in 1997 that she would definitely be part of it she told entertainment weekly magazine in 1997 that anthony hopkins always talks about it i mean everybody wants to do it every time i see him it s like when is it going to happen when is it going to happen de laurentiis thought foster would decline once she read book even believing final film was better for it hopkins also had doubts foster would be involved saying he had a hunch she would not be foster did turn it down confirming this in late december 1999 this would cause problems for studio universal and partner mgm studio is just back from holiday and is regrouping based on news and has no cohesive game plan at moment said kevin misher universal s president of production misher added that it was one of those moments when you sit down and think can clarice be looked upon as james bond for instance a character who is replaceable or was jodie foster clarice starling and audience will not accept anyone else foster said in december 1999 that characterization of starling in hannibal had negative attributes and betrayed original character foster s spokeswoman said actress declined because claire danes had become available for foster s own project flora plum salary demands may also have played a part in foster s non participation de laurentiis said i call agent of judy sic foster he say to me i have instruction she no want to read script if you no give her an offer of 20m and 15 of gross and i say give my love to judy sic foster goodbye entertainment weekly described project as becoming a bloody mess hemorrhaging talent and money despite hopkins being on board foster talked about hannibal in an interview with total film in late 2005 she said official reason i didn t do hannibal is i was doing another movie flora plum so i get to say in a nice dignified way that i wasn t available when that movie was being shot clarice meant so much to jonathan and i she really did and i know it sounds kind of strange to say but there was no way that either of us could really trample on her julianne moore as clarice starling when it became clear that foster would skip hannibal production team considered several different actresses including cate blanchett angelina jolie gillian anderson hilary swank ashley judd helen hunt and julianne moore hopkins asked his agent if he had any power over casting he informed de laurentiis that he knew moore with whom he had worked on surviving picasso and thought her a terrific actress although hopkins agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting scott thought it correct to discuss who would be hopkins leading lady scott said he was really surprised to find that he had five of top actresses in hollywood wanting it moore would eventually secure part scott said his decision was swayed in favor of moore because she is a true chameleon she can be a lunatic in magnolia a vamp in an ideal husband a porn star in boogie nights and a romantic in end of affair julianne moore once jodie decided to pass was always top of my list said scott on his female lead hannibal dvd ridley scott commentary moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress new clarice would be very different of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of jodie foster s but this film is going to be very different anthony hopkins as hannibal lecter thumb upright hannibal lecter t shirt worn by hopkins in hannibal on display at london film museum hopkins was generally expected to reprise his academy award winning role hopkins did say in june 1999 that he would only be interested if script was really good hopkins says on making of feature on dvd that he could not make up his mind to commit i was kind of surprised by this book hannibal i thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre so i couldn t make up my mind about it all some of it i found intriguing some i was a little doubtful about when producers confirmed that they were going to film harris novel hopkins told them yes but added it needs some condensing hollywood reporter would confirm that hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late december 1999 saying he had approved latest draft of script by steven zaillian hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into lecter s mind i just learned lines and showed up and walked around as hannibal lecter i thought do i repeat that same performance or do i vary it ten years had passed so i changed a bit in book lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient this was left out of film because scott and hopkins agreed to leave face alone hopkins explains why it s as if he s making a statement catch me if you can with his big hat he s so obvious that nobody thinks he s hannibal lecter i ve always thought he s a very elegant man a renaissance man in film lecter is first seen in florence as classical lecter lecturing and being smooth according to hopkins when film moves to u s hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short to make him like a mercenary that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got in his way gary oldman as mason verger part of mason verger one of lecter s two surviving victims was originally offered to christopher reeve based on his work as a wheelchair bound police officer in above suspicion 1995 not having read novel reeve showed initial interest in role but ultimately declined upon realizing that verger was a quadriplegic facially disfigured child rapist johnson malcolm a heroic persona hartford courant 12 october 2004 retrieved 22 july 2012 part was later accepted by secondary choice gary oldman co producer martha de laurentiis claimed they had a funny situation with oldman wanting a prominent credit she said now how can you have a prominent credit with hannibal characters are hannibal and clarice starling so we really couldn t work something out at first oldman was apparently out of film for a while but then came back in asking to go unbilled oldman would become transformed and unrecognizable as himself to play part of verger he would have no lips cheeks or eyelids make up artist greg cannom said it s really disgusting i ve been showing people pictures of oldman as verger and they all just say oh my god and walk away which makes me very happy oldman said that having his name completely removed from billing and credits allowed him to do it anonymously under heavy make up ign com interview with gary oldman in home release versions of film oldman s name is included in closing credits further casting other stars subsequently cast included ray liotta as u s justice department official paul krendler character had appeared in silence of lambs but original actor ron had died in interim and italian actor giancarlo giannini as detective rinaldo pazzi francesca neri played pazzi s wife allegra frankie faison reprised his role as orderly barney matthews key production crew scott recruited key production crew whom he had worked with previously production designer norris spencer had worked on thelma louise black rain and 1492 conquest of paradise cinematographer john mathieson editor pietro scalia and composer hans zimmer had all worked on scott s previous film gladiator official hannibal production notes production and post production background hannibal was filmed in 83 working days over 16 weeks official hannibal journal film began production on 8 may 2000 in florence film visited key locations in florence and various locations around united states martha de laurentiis said film has almost a hundred locations and that it was a constant pain of moving and dressing sets but locations were beautiful who could complain about being allowed to shoot in palazzo vecchio in florence or president james madison s farm in montpelier or amazing biltmore estate in asheville eighty million dollars and a year and a half in production were spent before scott got his first look at hannibal in editing room filming locations whole second act of hannibal takes place in florence ridley scott had never filmed there before but described it as quite an experience it was kind of organized chaos we were there at height of tourist season within florence production would visit various locations such as palazzo as dr fell s workplace ponte vecchio palazzo vecchio pharmacy of santa maria novella and cathedral after leaving italy on 5 june 2000 production moved to washington d c filming took place over six days at union station unusual sight of a carousel would appear in transportation hub and shopping plaza at ridley scott s request filming would last for seven weeks in richmond virginia for shootout in a crowded fish market shot at richmond farmer s market early in film julianne moore underwent federal bureau of investigation training at bureau s headquarters before filming a barn in orange virginia situated on estate of president james madison was used to house 15 performing hogs 15 russian boars used in shoot were from a selection of around 6 000 that animal wranglers observed biltmore estate in asheville north carolina biggest privately owned estate in u s was chosen to signify huge personal wealth of mason verger special make up effects make up artist greg cannom was pleased to be involved in hannibal as it offered him chance to produce incredible and original make ups for mason verger make up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect vision scott had of character scott wanted verger to look real with hideous scarring and not something from house of wax scott himself would actually call up help of expert doctors in an effort to get look of character as realistic as possible scott showed make up team pictures of foetal things which he thought touching he wanted to make mason verger more touching than monstrous as he thought of verger as being someone who hadn t lost his sense of humour almost sympathetic oldman would spend six hours a day in make up to prepare for role for one of film s final and infamous scenes an exact duplicate was created of character paul krendler played by ray liotta a scene which blended make up puppet work and cgi in a way which scott called seamless title sequence main titles were designed by nick livesey a graduate of royal college of art who worked for one of scott s production companies in london sequence shot in florence by livesey himself was intended as film s second promotional trailer studio thought it not quite right but it remained on scott s mind and would eventually end up as main title sequence livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in florence early one morning which in final cut would morph into face of hannibal lecter scott believed it a good idea as it fundamentally asked question where is hannibal lecter scott explains and of course this story tells it with pigeons in cobblestones of somewhere where you wonder where that is and there he is his face appears titles are said to have been influenced by film seven music ridley scott worked very closely with composer hans zimmer during post production on hannibal scott believes music to a film is as important as dialogue it is final adjustment to screenplay being able to also adjust performance of actors in fact zimmer and scott sat in during editing process with editor pietro scalia to discuss scenes in film and not music zimmer used a symphony orchestra for opera sequence but would mostly use what he described as a very odd orchestra only cellos and basses all playing at extreme ends of their range this was done to emphasise character of hannibal lecter he explains anthony s character is for me somebody at extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow zimmer also did not want score to sound like a modern day orchestra character mason verger had his own theme which become more perverted as film progressed according to zimmer dante s sonnet was put to music by zimmer and patrick cassidy titled vide cor meum for opera scene in florence tracksounds com wrote positively of zimmer s score zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans full attention classical elements and yes even monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience in a poll by british classic fm listeners to find greatest film soundtrack of all time hannibal ranked at 59 strauss s blue danube is also played at several points in film themes romance scott has said he believes underlying emotion of hannibal is affection in some instances you might even wonder or certainly from one direction is it more than affection it is dark because story is of course essentially dark but it s kind of romantic at same time scott openly admits to a romantic thematic running through film he told cnn that hannibal was quite a different target essentially a study between two individuals funny enough it s rather romantic and also quite humorous but also there s some quite bad behaviour as well during opera scene in florence lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of dante s sonnets and meets with detective pazzi and his wife allegra she asks lecter do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter lecter replies yes i believe he could but would she see through bars of his plight and ache for him this scene in film is one which scott claims most people missed meaning of it was in reference to starling to their encounter in silence of lambs new york times in its review of film said hannibal toys with idea of love that dare not speak its name composer hans zimmer believes there to be many messages and subtext in each scene of film he said i can score this movie truly as a freudian archetypal beauty and beast fairy tale as a horror movie as most elegant piece on corruption in american police force as loneliest woman on earth beauty in renaissance zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story centering on two people who should never be together a modern day romeo and juliet during film s post production scott zimmer and editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant where a tear slides down starling s cheek during a confrontation with lecter they could not agree if it was a tear of anguish loneliness or disgust scott told new york post that affair of heart between lecter and starling is metaphorical rolling stone magazine even said in their review scott offers a sly parody of relationships think when hannibal met sally retribution and punishment ridley scott has said that he believes lecter in his own way to be pure one of key motivating factors for character is search for retribution and punishment there is something very moral about lecter in this film said scott in his audio commentary behaviour of hannibal is never insane i didn t want to use that excuse is he insane no i think he s as sane as you or i he just likes it scott did say however in our normal terms he s truly evil scott also brings up notion of absolution in reference to lecter towards film s end verger has one overriding objective in life to capture lecter and subject him to a slow painful death corruption part of story involves character rinaldo pazzi giancarlo giannini a florentine policeman who learns dr fell s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich his escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate death of a gypsy pickpocket egged on by desire to have best for his much younger wife there is a moment in film when pazzi becomes corrupted despite being what scott describes as very thoughtful distribution promotion first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via official website in early may 2000 over nine months before film s release as film had only just begun production footage was used from silence of lambs a second trailer which featured footage from new film was released in late november 2000 in marketing film hopkins portrayal of hannibal lecter was chosen as unique selling point of hannibal mr hopkins is draw here said elvis mitchell in a 2001 new york times article a poster released in uk to promote hannibal featuring lecter with a skin mask covering right side of his face was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed too shocking and disturbing for public upon its release hannibal was met with significant media attention with film s stars and director making several appearances on television in newspapers and in magazines in an article for cbs news jill serjeant stated

august 2001 critical response reviews for hannibal were mixed time magazine wrote a banquet of creepy gory or grotesque incidents is on display in hannibal but this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart empire magazine gave it two out of five stars calling it laughable to just plain boring hannibal is toothless to end david thomson writing in british film institute magazine sight sound praised film it works it s smart good looking sexy fun dirty naughty and knowing thomson does make clear however he is a great fan of director ridley scott s work he adds it is literally that hannibal lecter has become such a household joke that he can t be dreadful again it seems clear that anthony hopkins and scott saw that and planned accordingly that s how movie was saved variety magazine in its review said hannibal is not as good as lambs ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing engrossing and occasionally startling a negative review in guardian claimed that what was wrong with film was carried over from book result is an inflated good looking bore of a movie silence of lambs was a marvelous thing this by contrast is barely okey dokey roger ebert gave film a thumbs down rating on television program at movies with ebert roeper and gave film a 2 5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review which he began with following ridley scott s hannibal is a carnival geek show we must give it credit for courage of its depravity if it proves nothing else it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn t get nc 17 rating for violence nothing ever will hannibal has an overall metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a rotten tomatoes rating of 39 with an average rating of 5 1 10 from 171 reviews latter s website s critical consensus reads while superbly acted and stylishly filmed hannibal lacks character interaction between two leads which made first movie so engrossing differences from novel according to variety magazine script for hannibal was quite faithful to harris blueprint fans of tome may regret perhaps necessary excision of some characters most notably mason verger s muscle bound macho sister margot as well as considerable fascinating academic detail but will basically feel book has been respected yes even climactic dinner party is served up almost intact with only surprise twists saved for its wake time out noted weight watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that s enjoyably spicy but low on substance so much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time s left for analysis or characterization producer dino de laurentiis was asked why some characters notably jack crawford were left out of film i think if you get a book which is 600 pages you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages in two hours of film you cannot possibly include all characters we set ourselves a limit and cut characters which weren t so vital in book mason verger runs an orphanage from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to molest them he also has a sister margot whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian when she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family their father disowned her as she is sterile due to steroid abuse verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover who could then inherit verger fortune at book s end margot and starling both help lecter escape during a shootout between starling and verger s guards margot at lecter s advice stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod and then kills him by ramming his pet moray eel down his throat book s controversial ending has lecter presenting starling with exhumed bones of her father which he brings to life by hypnotizing starling allowing her to say goodbye this forges an odd alliance between starling and lecter culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to argentina at novel s end barney sees them at teatro colon of buenos aires also gone from film are flashbacks to lecter s childhood in which he sees his younger sister mischa eaten by german deserters in 1944 these flashbacks formed basis for 2007 film hannibal rising written concurrently with 2006 novel of same name which portrays lecter as a young man hopkins was asked in an interview on subject of whether or not he believed idea of starling and lecter heading off into sunset as lovers as happens in book yes i did other people found that preposterous i suppose there s a moral issue there i think it would have been a very interesting thing though i think it would have been very interesting had she gone off because i suspected that there was that romance attachment there that obsession with her i guessed that a long time ago at last phone call to clarice at end of she said dr lecter dr lecter in popular culture in 2013 there was a news story from italy where a gangster fed his rival alive to pigs many media stories compared this to a similar scene in hannibal prequels film was followed by two
