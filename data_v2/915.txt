traditional survival horror controls and gameplay seen in previous series installments however unlike pre rendered backgrounds of previous games code veronica utilizes real time 3d environments and

experimentation while chris manages to defeat alexia and escape with his sister before antarctic facility self destructs development thumb right upright 0 8 claire was designed to be tougher than in resident evil 2 as is evident by these moments from john woo inspired opening cinematic with success of resident evil 2 in 1998 capcom began more resident evil projects across multiple consoles code veronica originated from an unsuccessful attempt to port resident evil 2 to sega saturn after producer shinji mikami and his team learned they would be unable to port game without making a large sacrifice to quality mikami was asked by his leadership to create something else for sega fans and so development began on an original game when mikami asked for more time to develop game he was told it would need to have a better technical quality making sega s upcoming dreamcast more appealing around same time a side story game for playstation starring jill valentine in events leading up to resident evil 2 was being developed this title was originally intended to be a spin off with dreamcast title to be true sequel according to ign sony bartered for limited exclusivity on resident evil 3 title and thus side story was branded as resident evil 3 and true sequel was labeled a spin off and later titled code veronica this notion is conflicted by interviews at time as producer shinji mikami and flagship president yoshiki okamoto told journalists they wanted to keep numbered chronology on playstation systems and give subtitles to resident evil games on all other systems regardless game content remained essentially unchanged code veronica s story setting and artistic design strayed away from series standard while previous games are set in united states and have a corresponding american feel to them code veronica is set in southern ocean and antarctica and carries a european gothic horror inspired design this is made clear in environments which feature gothic architecture and art in addition to central european carvings and german style weaponry in addition gothic feel is emphasized through story horror in code veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and fate of his noble bloodline story is told partly through a lullaby and this method of storytelling is intended to bring out european operatic undertones this contrasts to previous games in series which were driven by panic elements from american horror films such as monsters and zombies with regards to managing art staff mikami split them up depending on their interests those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research during in game cutscenes polygon count is increased to nearly 2 500 polygons especially on character faces capcom added detail to zombie enemies unprecedented in series such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch claire was given a tougher appearance in code veronica than in resident evil 2 reason being her experiences in resident evil 2 built her toughness and confidence to handle any situation this characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub machine guns and also by opening cinematic which features her in a john woo inspired action scene mikami described code veronica as 50 60 of his perfect vision for resident evil in february 2001 and he cited that future resident evil projects may make up other half by time resident evil 3 was released development on code veronica was nearing completion much of code veronica s 70 person development staff was outsourced because capcom resources had been tied up working on resident evil 3 shinji mikami and yoshiki okamoto s team at flagship oversaw game s scenario and direction while xax entertainment assisted with environments and nextech handled much of technical development capcom production studio 4 still handled art direction and character design by september 1999 sega was sending some of its own developers to help add final touches to game sega assisted capcom with game s programming to help keep a good framerate release code veronica was confirmed to be in development as early as august 1998 despite not being a numbered title they still promoted it as true sequel to resident evil 2 it was officially revealed on october 6 1998 by capcom r d chief yoshiki okamoto capcom of japan stated that they were hoping to sell game to roughly one third of all dreamcast users which they estimated would total to around one million copies in july 1999 capcom of japan announced their shipment expectations for japanese dreamcast version were at 400 000 copies journalists were skeptical if this was only initial shipment or evidence that capcom overestimated sales of dreamcast given their initial sales estimate was one million capcom initially planned to have code veronica released around same time as resident evil 3 and more importantly dreamcast launch in north america in september 9 1999 however delays pushed project back to early 2000 to make up for game s absence capcom announced they would release a port of resident evil 2 for dreamcast that december this release called biohazard 2 value plus included a demo for code veronica thumb right low sales of dreamcast negatively impacted sales of code veronica code veronica was released in february 2000

a s t a r s logo this bundle was limited to 200 copies expecting high demand capcom set up a contest for fans to enter to win an opportunity to purchase systems a soundtrack was released in february 2000 as well code veronica x because dreamcast had a much smaller user base than playstation platforms capcom knew series could not survive on platform this led to bringing an extended cut titled code veronica x in west and code veronica kanzenban in japan to dreamcast and playstation 2 in 2001 extended cut was announced in november 2000 it has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about wesker s involvement with umbrella rest of game remains mostly unchanged although capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements capcom printed special dvds of wesker s

at heart and therefore inherited good and bad qualities of previous games controls were a negative point of criticism between some reviews reviews for playstation 2 release of code veronica x were mostly positive critics shared similar opinions to dreamcast reviews but some complaints were drawn from it being a mostly unmodified port of an 18 month old dreamcast game gamespot s joe fielder pointed out that sony s extermination 2001 and capcom s own onimusha warlords 2001 had been released during this gap with better controls gamecube version garnered average reviews due to its unaltered
