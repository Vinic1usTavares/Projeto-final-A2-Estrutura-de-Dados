sponge signals its bitter taste to predators animal coloration is general appearance of an animal resulting from reflection or emission of light from its surfaces some animals are brightly colored while others are hard to see in some species such as peafowl male has strong patterns conspicuous colors and is iridescent while female is far less visible there are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colors camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view animals use color to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species to signal their sexual status to other members of same species and in mimicry taking advantage of warning coloration of another species some animals use flashes of color to divert attacks by startling predators zebras may possibly use motion dazzle confusing a predator s attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly some animals are colored for physical protection with pigments in skin to protect against sunburn while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation finally animals can be colored incidentally for example blood is red because heme pigment needed to carry oxygen is red animals colored in these ways can have striking natural patterns animals produce color in both direct and indirect ways direct production occurs through presence of visible colored cells known as pigment which are particles of colored material such as freckles indirect production occurs by virtue of cells known as chromatophores which are pigment containing cells such as hair follicles distribution of pigment particles in chromatophores can change under hormonal or neuronal control for fishes it has been demonstrated that chromatophores may respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light uv radiation temperature ph chemicals etc color change helps individuals in becoming more or less visible and is important in agonistic displays and in camouflage some animals including many butterflies and birds have microscopic structures in scales bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colors other animals including squid and some deep sea fish can produce light sometimes of different colors animals often use two or more of these mechanisms together to produce colors and effects they need history thumb upright robert hooke s micrographia animal coloration has been a topic of interest and research in biology for centuries in classical era aristotle recorded that octopus was able to change its coloration to match its background and when it was alarmed aristotle c 350 bc

butterflies he discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter tasting species to reduce its chance of being

bagnall poulton s colours of animals 1890 edward bagnall poulton s strongly darwinian 1890 book colours of animals their meaning and use especially considered in case of insects argued case for three aspects of animal coloration that are broadly accepted today but were controversial or wholly new at time it strongly supported darwin s theory of sexual selection arguing that obvious differences between male and female birds such as argus pheasant were selected by females pointing out that bright male plumage was found only in species which court by day book introduced concept of frequency dependent selection as when edible mimics are less frequent than distasteful models whose colors and patterns they copy in book poulton also coined term aposematism for warning coloration which he identified in widely differing animal groups including mammals such as skunk bees and wasps beetles and butterflies frank evers beddard s 1892 book animal coloration acknowledged that natural selection existed but examined its application to camouflage mimicry and sexual selection very critically beddard frank evers 1892 animal coloration an account of principal facts and theories relating to colours and markings of animals swan sonnenschein london book was in turn roundly criticised by poulton thumb in roseate spoonbills 1905 1909 abbott handerson thayer tried to show that even bright pink of these conspicuous birds had a cryptic function abbott handerson thayer s 1909 book concealing coloration in animal kingdom completed by his son gerald h thayer argued correctly for widespread use of crypsis among animals and in particular described and explained countershading for first time however thayers spoilt their case by arguing that camouflage was sole purpose of animal coloration which led them to claim that even brilliant pink plumage of flamingo or roseate spoonbill was cryptic against momentarily pink sky at dawn or dusk as a result book was mocked by critics including theodore roosevelt as having pushed doctrine of concealing coloration to such a fantastic extreme and to include such wild absurdities as to call for application of common sense thereto thayer abbott

are covered in turn below thumb left a camouflaged orange oak leaf butterfly kallima inachus centre displays protective resemblance protective resemblance is used by prey to avoid predation it includes special protective resemblance now called mimesis where whole animal looks like some other object for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping in general protective resemblance now called crypsis animal s texture blends with background for example when a moth s color and pattern blend in with tree bark thumb right a flower mantis hymenopus coronatus displays special aggressive resemblance aggressive resemblance is used by predators or parasites in special aggressive resemblance animal looks like something else luring prey or host to approach for example when a flower mantis resembles a particular kind of flower such as an orchid in general aggressive resemblance predator or parasite blends in with background for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass for adventitious protection an animal uses materials such as twigs sand or pieces of shell to conceal its outline for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case or when a decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed sponges and stones in variable protective resemblance an animal such as a chameleon flatfish squid or octopus changes its skin pattern and color using special chromatophore cells to resemble whatever background it is currently resting on as well as for signalling main mechanisms to create resemblances described by poulton whether in nature or in military applications are crypsis blending into background so as to become hard to see this covers both special and general resemblance disruptive patterning using color and pattern to break up animal s outline which relates mainly to general resemblance mimesis resembling other objects of no special interest to observer which relates to special resemblance countershading using graded color to create illusion of flatness which relates mainly to general resemblance and counterillumination producing light to match background notably in some species of squid countershading was first described by american artist abbott handerson thayer a pioneer in theory of animal coloration thayer observed that whereas a painter takes a flat canvas and uses colored paint to create illusion of solidity by painting in shadows animals such as deer are often darkest on their backs becoming lighter towards belly creating as zoologist hugh cott observed illusion of flatness cott h b 1940 and against a matching background of invisibility thayer s observation animals are painted by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by sky s light and vice versa is called thayer s law forbes 2009 pp 72 3 signalling color is widely used for signalling in animals as diverse as birds and shrimps signalling encompasses at least three purposes advertising to signal a capability or service to other animals whether within a species or not sexual selection where members of one sex choose to mate with suitably colored members of other sex thus driving development of such colors warning to signal that an animal is harmful for example can sting is poisonous or is bitter tasting warning signals may be mimicked truthfully or untruthfully advertising services thumb cleaner wrasse signals its cleaning services to a big eye advertising coloration can signal services an animal offers to other animals these may be of same species as in sexual selection or of different species as in cleaning symbiosis signals which often combine color and movement may be understood by many different species for example cleaning stations of banded coral shrimp stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles sexual selection upright 0 8 left thumb male goldie s bird of paradise displays to a female darwin observed that males of some species such as birds of paradise were very different from females darwin explained such male female differences in his theory of sexual selection in his book descent of man darwin charles 1874 descent of man heinemann london once females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic such as a long tail or a colored crest that characteristic is emphasized more and more in males eventually all males will have characteristics that females are sexually selecting for as only those males can reproduce this mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to males in other ways for example some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight while their brilliant colors may make males more vulnerable to predators in extreme sexual selection may drive species to extinction as has been argued for enormous horns of male irish elk which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed miller g f 2000 mating mind how sexual choice shaped evolution of human nature heinemann london different forms of sexual selection are possible including rivalry among males and selection of females by males warning right thumb a venomous coral snake uses bright colors to warn off potential predators warning coloration aposematism is effectively opposite of camouflage and a special case of advertising its function is to make animal for example a wasp or a coral snake highly conspicuous to potential predators so that it is noticed remembered and then avoided as peter forbes observes human warning signs employ same colours red yellow black and white that nature uses to advertise dangerous creatures forbes 2009 p 52 and plate 24 warning colors work by being associated by potential predators with something that makes warning colored animal unpleasant or dangerous cott 1940 p 250 this can be achieved in several ways by being any combination of left thumb upright 0 8 black and

resembles predatory shikra giving cuckoo time to lay egg in songbird s nest unnoticed mimicry means that one species of animal resembles another species closely enough to deceive predators to evolve mimicked species must have warning coloration because appearing to be bitter tasting or dangerous gives natural selection something to work on once a species has a slight chance resemblance to a warning colored species natural selection can drive its colors and patterns towards more perfect mimicry there are numerous possible mechanisms of which by far best known are batesian mimicry where an edible species resembles a distasteful or dangerous species this is most common in insects such as butterflies a familiar example is resemblance of harmless hoverflies which have no sting to bees mullerian mimicry where two or more distasteful or dangerous animal species resemble each other this is most common among insects such as wasps and bees hymenoptera batesian mimicry was first described by pioneering naturalist henry w bates when an edible prey animal comes to resemble even slightly a distasteful animal natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble distasteful species this is because even a small degree of protection reduces predation and increases chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce for example many species of hoverfly are colored black and yellow like bees and are in consequence avoided by birds and people mullerian mimicry was first described by pioneering naturalist fritz muller when a distasteful animal comes to resemble a more common distasteful animal natural selection favours individuals that even very slightly better resemble target for example many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly colored black and yellow muller s explanation of mechanism for this was one of first uses of mathematics in biology he argued that a predator such as a young bird must attack at least one insect say a wasp to learn that black and yellow colors mean a stinging insect if bees were differently colored young bird would have to attack one of them also but when bees and wasps resemble each other young bird need only attack one from whole group to learn to avoid all of them so fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps same applies to wasps that mimic bees result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection forbes 2009 pp 39 42 distraction thumb a praying mantis in deimatic or threat pose displays conspicuous patches of color to startle potential predators this is not warning coloration as insect is palatable startle some animals such as many moths mantises and grasshoppers have a repertory of threatening or startling behaviour such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colors so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator this gives prey animal an opportunity to escape behaviour is deimatic startling rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators so warning colors are a bluff not an honest signal motion dazzle some prey animals such as zebra are marked with high contrast patterns which possibly help to confuse their predators such as lions during a chase bold stripes of a herd of running zebra have been claimed make it difficult for predators to estimate prey s speed and direction accurately or to identify individual animals giving prey an improved chance of escape since dazzle patterns such as zebra s stripes make animals harder to catch when moving but easier to detect when stationary there is an evolutionary trade off between dazzle and camouflage another theory is that zebra s stripes could provide some protection from flies and biting insects retrieved 30

this frog changes its skin color to control its temperature some frogs such as alvarengai which basks in sunlight lighten their skin color when hot and darkens when cold making their skin reflect more heat and so avoid overheating incidental coloration left thumb upright 1 3 olm s blood makes it appear pink some animals are colored purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments for example amphibians like olm that live in caves may be largely colorless as color has no function in that environment but they show some red because of pigment in their red blood cells needed to carry oxygen they also have a little orange colored riboflavin in their skin human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar color for same reason mechanisms of color production in animals thumb upright 0 7 side of zebrafish shows how chromatophores dark spots respond to 24 hours in dark above or light below animal coloration may be result of any combination of pigments chromatophores structural coloration and bioluminescence coloration by pigments thumb left red pigment in a flamingo s plumage comes from its diet of shrimps which get it from microscopic algae pigments are colored chemicals such as melanin in animal tissues for example arctic fox has a white coat in winter containing little pigment and a brown coat in summer containing more pigment an example of seasonal camouflage a polyphenism many animals including mammals birds and amphibians are unable to synthesize most of pigments that color their fur or feathers other than brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones for example bright yellow of an american goldfinch startling orange of a juvenile red spotted newt deep red of a cardinal and pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants in case of flamingo bird eats pink shrimps which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids shrimps derive their body color from microscopic red algae which like most plants are able to create their own pigments including both carotenoids and green chlorophyll animals that eat green plants do not become green however as chlorophyll does not survive digestion variable coloration by chromatophores thumb fish and frog melanophores are cells that can change color by dispersing or aggregating pigment containing bodies chromatophores are special pigment containing cells that may change their size but more often retain their original size but allow pigment within them to become redistributed thus varying color and pattern of animal chromatophores may respond to hormonal and or control mechanisms but direst responses to stimulation by visible light uv radiation temperature ph changes chemicals etc have also been documented voluntary control of chromatophores is known as for example cuttlefish and chameleons can rapidly change their appearance both for camouflage and for signalling as aristotle first noted over 2000

university press left thumb squid chromatophores appear as black brown reddish and pink areas in this micrograph when cephalopod molluscs like squid and cuttlefish find themselves against a light background they contract many of their chromatophores concentrating pigment into a smaller area resulting in a pattern of tiny dense but widely spaced dots appearing light when they enter a darker

structural coloration thumb left brilliant iridescent colors of peacock s tail feathers are created by structural coloration thumb upright butterfly wing at different magnifications reveals chitin acting as diffraction grating while many animals are unable to synthesize carotenoid pigments to create red and yellow surfaces green and blue colors of bird feathers and insect carapaces are usually not produced by pigments at all but by structural coloration structural coloration means production of color by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light sometimes in combination with pigments for example peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown but their structure makes them appear blue turquoise and green structural coloration can produce most brilliant colors often iridescent for example blue green gloss on plumage of birds such as ducks and purple blue green red colors of many beetles and butterflies are created by structural coloration

comb jelly is bioluminescent bioluminescence is production of light such as by photophores of marine animals and tails of glow worms and fireflies bioluminescence like other forms of metabolism releases energy derived from chemical energy of food a pigment is catalysed by enzyme luciferase to react with oxygen releasing light comb jellies such as euplokamis are bioluminescent creating blue and green light especially when stressed when disturbed they secrete an ink which in same colors since comb jellies are not very sensitive to light their bioluminescence is unlikely to be used to signal to other members of same species e g to attract mates or repel rivals more likely light helps to distract predators or parasites some species of squid have light producing organs photophores scattered all over their undersides that create a sparkling glow this provides counter illumination camouflage preventing animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below some anglerfish of
