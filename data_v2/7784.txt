severe tropical cyclone waka fiji meteorological service designation 03f joint typhoon warning center designation 07p was one of most destructive tropical cyclones ever to affect south pacific kingdom of tonga waka originated within near equatorial trough in mid december 2001 although system remained disorganized for more than a week storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on december 29 subsequently waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone australian tropical cyclone intensity scale on december 31 with winds of 185 km h 115 mph shortly thereafter it passed directly over vava u tonga resulting in widespread damage by january 1 2002 cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition remnants of waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near southern ocean on january 6 although storm affected several countries along its path waka left most significant losses in tonga where it killed one person and wrought 104 2 million pa anga 51 3 million usd in damage hundreds of structures including 200 in island s largest city and much of nation s agriculture were destroyed winds in excess of 185 km h 115 mph battered vava u defoliating nearly every tree on island in addition to infrastructural and public losses environment was also severely affected a native species of bat lost roughly 80 of its population due to lack of fruit following storm tonga requested international aid to cope with scale of damage due to severity of damage name waka was later retired and replaced with wiki according to a study by janet franklin et al storms similar in intensity to waka on average strike tonga once every 33 years meteorological history in mid december 2001 at end of a madden julian oscillation pulse twin equatorial monsoonal troughs developed in northern and southern hemispheres although warm sea surface temperatures of in region favored development of a tropical cyclone southern trough developed substantially slower than northern one on december 19 southern component was classified as tropical depression 03f by regional specialized meteorological center in nadi fiji fiji meteorological service at this time depression was situated just east of solomon islands northern component eventually developed into typhoon faxai an extremely powerful category 5 equivalent cyclone unlike faxai precursor to cyclone waka developed slowly mainly because of moderate wind shear in region moving southeastward system gradually became more organized on two occasions joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert however agency later canceled them both times by december 27 depression had entered a region of lesser shear favoring significant development of system following day jtwc classified system as tropical depression 07p when storm was situated roughly northwest of pago pago american samoa tracking towards southwest in response to a mid level ridge to southeast depression quickly intensified attaining gale force winds on december 29 upon doing so it was upgraded to a tropical cyclone and given name waka shortly thereafter storm underwent rapid intensification roughly 24 hours after being named waka attained sustained winds of 120 km h 75 mph during december 30 center of storm brushed wallis island before turning towards southeast and accelerating due to an approaching trough from northwest continuing to intensify waka passed directly over niuafo ou on december 31 with winds of 150 km h 90 mph later that day cyclone attained its peak intensity as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with ten minute sustained winds of 185 km h 115 km h and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar hpa 27 46 inhg jtwc assessed storm to have attained similar one minute sustained winds upon peaking however this was due to discrepancies between two warning centers at this time waka displayed a well defined circular eye roughly in diameter shortly after attaining its peak intensity center of waka passed over vava u continuing into new year waka gradually weakened on january 1 2002 as it entered a less favorable region for tropical cyclones as a result wind shear displaced convection from center and its eyewall broke apart moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures waka began to undergo an extratropical transition which it completed on january 2 tracking southeastward remnant cyclone briefly slowed over open waters before again accelerating over following few days system gradually weakened with sustained winds decreasing below gale force by january 5 storm was last noted on january 6 near southern ocean about north northwest of antarctica at which time it had a pressure of 972 mbar hpa 28 7 inhg preparations and impact tonga on december 30 just a day before waka passed through tonga warnings were issued for numerous islands including parts of fiji and samoa forecasts showed storm passing directly over low lying tongan capital of nuku alofa as a category 3 cyclone owing to warnings from local media all new year s eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes all airports in region were shut down and ferry service was suspended many residents on small island of niuafo ou about 35 km2 13 5 mi2 in size evacuated to other islands prior to waka s arrival thumb left infrared satellite image of cyclone waka passing directly over vava u on december 31 when storm was moving through islands of tonga at peak strength a few islands recorded hurricane force winds city of neiafu measured strongest winds peaking at 185 km h 115 mph in southern islands wind gusts up to 250 km h 155 mph affected isolated areas in ha apai islands sustained winds reached 100 km h 65 mph and gusted to 140 km h 85 mph heavy rains also fell during waka s passage amounting to over in ha apai initial reports from nuku alofa on december 31 indicated severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses following passage of waka communication with niuas and vava u were lost according to local reports high winds sandblasted neiafu and downed nearly every tree surveys by red cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs vava u lost roughly 90 of its crops including essential food crops such as taro yams and bananas in ha apai one person died from cardiac arrest brought on by storm fallen trees blocked numerous roads power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents severe damage also took place on where coastal homes were impacted by waka s storm surge and several structures lost their roofs in one instance a yacht was brought onshore by surge and crashed into a restaurant destroying both according to damage surveys 13 of country s islands sustained damage 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged damage throughout tonga amounted to 104 2 million pa anga 51 3 million usd in addition to infrastructural and public damage environment sustained catastrophic losses on tonga insular flying fox pteropus a native species of bat suffered great losses from waka compared to pre cyclone population levels 79 8 9 9 of species was killed across six islands this was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source which decreased by 85 11 8 following waka trees across vava u were completely defoliated although only 6 6 were killed leaving no food for bats greatest decline in bats was on aina island at 95 7 a a island sustained a complete loss of food bearing plants six months after storm bat population in vava u was still only 20 of pre storm level elsewhere during cyclone s formative stages it brought significant winds and swells to tokelau resulting in localized flooding and crop damage american samoa also experienced heavy rains amounting to and gusts up to winds downed a few trees and caused minor crop damage with losses amounting to us 120 000 large swells affected island for roughly a week as storm developed and moved away from region cyclone waka also affected wallis and futuna prompting tropical cyclone watches and warnings from december 28 to 31 and later impacted niue prompting warnings there from december 30 to january 1 on wallis island one home was destroyed and 50 of banana crop was lost a maximum of of rain fell in during passage of waka a wind gust of and swells up to were recorded in wallis niue received more significant damage experiencing a storm surge of up to and sea spray up to inland numerous fallen trees and power lines blocked roads and left southern areas of island without power for roughly six hours damage in niue amounted to us 10 000 after moving through tongan islands remnants of waka brought large swells estimated up to to north island of new zealand thousands of residents and tourists were in region following new year s holiday meteorologists warned that oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into water every lifeguard in as well as former lifeguards were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8 000 people out of water although most people stayed within a designated swimming area several rescues had to be made rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in mount maunganui main beach all were quickly rescued by lifeguards aftermath thumb right 250px enlarged track of cyclone waka between december 29 and january 1 depicting storm s path in relation to several south pacific islands within a day of cyclone waka s passage in tonga government of new zealand deployed an aircraft to survey scale of damage and reestablish contact with tongan islands this aircraft was sent in accordance with franz agreement enacted in 1992 which states that assets from one country would be used in relief operations on january 2 head of tonga s disaster office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from storm due to substantial damage to agriculture food shortages were expected to impact region over following months by january 7 red cross began sending supplies to tonga hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an australian ac 130 to help with recovery process on january 12 a new zealand lockheed c 130 hercules carrying us 700 000 worth of supplies flew to area to deliver aid an additional us 700 000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by storm of this us 500 000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and remaining us 200 000 would be used for emergency lighting cooking and food supply recovery further funds came from united states agency for international development which offered us 25 000 by mid january french polynesian assembly in tahiti also provided us 770 000 worth of relief supplies and aid main industry of tonga tourism was devastated by storm as no tourists were allowed to travel to region for at least two weeks after waka s passage government of tonga requested a total of us 39 2 million in international aid most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by world health organization in early march a relief fund based on donations was set up by united methodist committee on relief to provide us 210 000 for 30 families impacted by storm about 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by church world service later that month as food shortages became severe in april emergency supplies were sent to outlying niuas islands of tonga in may us 5 85 million was approved for emergency funds by world bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation international monetary
