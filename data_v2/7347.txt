olympic marmot marmota olympus is a rodent in squirrel family sciuridae it occurs only in u s state of washington on middle elevations of olympic peninsula closest relatives of this species are hoary marmot and vancouver island marmot in 2009 it was declared official endemic mammal of washington this marmot is about size of a domestic cat typically weighing about in summer species shows greatest sexual dimorphism found in marmots with adult males weighing on average 23 more than females it can be identified by a wide head small eyes and ears stubby legs and a long bushy tail its sharp rounded claws aid in digging burrows coat color changes with season and with age but an adult marmot s coat is brown all over with small whiter areas for most of year species has a diet consisting mainly of a variety of meadow flora including dry grasses which it also uses as bedding in burrows it is preyed on by various terrestrial mammals and avian raptors but its main predator today is coyote olympic marmot is rated a species of least concern on iucn red list it is protected by law in olympic national park which contains most of its habitat burrows of this marmot are made in colonies which are found in various mountain locations and differ in size a colony may contain as few as one marmot family or multiple families with up to 40 marmots olympic marmots are very sociable animals which often engage in play fighting and vocalize four different whistles to communicate during hibernation beginning in september they are in a deep sleep and do not eat causing them to lose half their body mass adults emerge in may and their young in june female marmots reach sexual maturity at three years of age and produce litters of 1 6 every other mating season taxonomy thumb left upright clinton hart merriam first to describe olympic marmot american zoologist and ethnographer clinton hart merriam first formally described olympic marmot in 1898 as arctomys olympus from a specimen he and vernon orlando bailey collected on sol duc river genus arctomys is from greek for bear mouse species name olympus olympic in greek was given because this species is native to olympic peninsula species now is classified with all other marmots in genus marmota zoologist r l rausch classified olympic marmot as subspecies olympus of marmota marmota he included all north american marmots in this species which now only includes eurasian alpine marmot in 1953 but it has usually been treated as a distinct species a classification supported by taxonomic reviews starting with that of zoologist robert s hoffmann and colleagues in 1979 within marmota olympic marmot is grouped with species such as hoary marmot m caligata in subgenus petromarmota among this grouping mitochondrial dna analyses suggest that olympic marmot could be most basal species olympic marmot is thought to have originated during last glacial period as an isolated relict population of hoary marmot in pleistocene ice free refugia olympic marmot deviates from typical petromarmota marmots in shape and large size of its mandible jawbone in differences of dorsal back region and having 40 chromosomes instead of 42 all of which are characteristics that resemble subgenus marmota some of differences of olympic marmot s jawbone from typical are also evident in vancouver island marmot m which evolved separately but also occurs in a restricted range with a small population description thumb lighter fur patches characteristic of olympic marmot in summertime olympic marmot s head is wide with small eyes and ears body is stocky with stubby legs and sharp rounded claws that facilitate digging tail is bushy and ranges from long olympic marmot is about size of a domestic cat adults typically weigh from and are from in length with average being this species may have most pronounced sexual dimorphism found in marmots with adult males weighing on average post emergence in spring and at peak weights in autumn respectively and adult females weighing at same times going on published weights olympic marmot is largest of six marmot species found in north america averaging slight heavier in mean body mass than hoary marmot and vancouver marmot mean linear dimensions suggest olympic species is about 7 larger on average than these other two large north america species braun j k eaton jr t s mares m a 2011 marmota caligata

infant marmots fur is dark gray in color this changes in yearling period to grayish brown with lighter patches adult coat is brown on body with some smaller white or pale brown patches for most of year becoming darker overall as year progresses first molt of year occurs in june commencing with two black patches of fur forming on back of shoulders this black coloration then spreads to rest of body and by fall coat is almost black a second molt is thought to occur during hibernation and upon emergence from hibernation in spring olympic marmots may be tan or yellowish olympic marmot s muzzle is almost always white with a white band in front of eyes this species can be readily distinguished from hoary marmot with which it shares almost every other physical trait by lack of contrasting black feet and a black spot on head vancouver island marmot has a similar coat color chocolate brown with white patches distribution and habitat thumb left typical olympic marmot habitat a slope on hurricane ridge in olympic national park olympic marmots are native to olympic mountains in olympic peninsula of washington state about 90 of olympic marmots total habitat is located in olympic national park where they are often sighted especially on hurricane ridge marmots are in decline in some areas of park due to encroachment of trees into meadows as well as predation by coyotes and they are seldom seen in wetter southwestern part within park olympic marmots inhabit lush sub alpine and alpine meadows fields and montane scree slopes they live in colonies spread out in various locations in mountains and containing burrows of differing numbers of marmot families some meadows can contain as few animals as one marmot family and some can have multiple families adding up to 40 marmots in total there is a higher risk of inbreeding and death from random events in meadows with fewer marmots making migration essential to survival of species burrows can be found at various elevations ranging from to they are most often found in range of to burrows are more frequently located on south facing slopes which generally receive more precipitation per year mostly snow and thus have more available flora home range of a family of marmots usually covers from half an acre to five acres 0 2 2 hectares olympic marmot is well adapted to its generally cold natural habitat where there is snowfall almost every month of year on mountain slopes and barren grasslands ecology feeding thumb alt photograph lupine a major part of olympic marmot s diet near hurricane ridge olympic marmots eat meadow flora such as avalanche and glacier lilies heather blossoms subalpine lupine mountain buckwheat harebells sedges and mosses they prefer green tender flowering plants over other sources of food but roots are a large part of their diets in early spring when other plants have not yet appeared during may and june they may resort to gnawing on trees for food they also occasionally eat fruits and insects their water requirements are met from juice in vegetation they eat and dew on plants surfaces when snowfall covers vegetation marmots have a more carnivorous diet consuming carrion encountered while digging for roots and possibly killing late hibernating chipmunks at this time they also obtain water from melted snow hibernating olympic marmots do not keep food in their burrows instead they gain fat before hibernating and can double their body weight to survive eight months without eating predation thumb left upright coyote is olympic marmot s main predator olympic marmot s predators are mostly terrestrial mammals such as coyotes cougars and bobcats however it is also preyed on by avian raptors such as golden eagles black bears probably rarely prey on marmots as evidenced by fact that their presence close to colonies generally does not generate alarm calls unless bear advances to within of colony coyote is primary predator and studies have shown that marmots make up approximately 20 of coyotes diet during summer months during a study in olympic mountains 36 coyote droppings were collected and two of them contained marmot hairs in common with all other marmots olympic marmots use trill as an alarm call to alert other marmots to predators continuing alarm calls indicate that a predator is close and thus increase vigilance in marmots a single alarm call results in marmots curiously looking around for predator sightings of land predators coyotes in particular receive more alarm calls than aerial predators fishers are viewed as predators by olympic marmots eliciting alarm calls when just passing by a colony it has also been observed that these trills can be used as a mechanism to trick and frustrate predators an additional behavior that takes place when a marmot becomes nervous or bothered by a predator is that it retracts its top lip to show its upper incisors it is almost like a greeting for predators it was reported during a study by david p barash that when hunting olympic marmots as prey coyotes and cougars approach marmot within about advance to an alpine fir close to victim and then chase marmot downhill to its colony if marmot is able to flee into a burrow and sound an alarm call other marmots will scurry to their burrows for safety but predator does not stop here it is usually persistent and will scratch outside entrance to try to dig out its prey minutes later when a marmot from a nearby burrow peers out to see if predator has gone it will sometimes sound another alarm call which summons predator to its burrow it dives back underground and predator usually remains frustrated as these alarm calls continue and force it to run around from burrow to burrow getting tired and aggravated and finally giving up as humans in olympic national park do not hunt marmot but simply observe them they do not pose a threat when researchers intrude on colonies to observe behavior families living in burrows there initially vocalize ascending calls showing surprise but later adjust to presence of humans allowing studies to proceed parasites of olympic marmot include cestode and fleas of genus behavior colonies thumb alt photograph 280px olympic marmot sunbathing at hurricane ridge olympic marmots are gregarious burrowing animals living in colonies typically containing multiple burrows activity varies with weather time of day and time of year owing to rainfall and fog cover during june july and august marmots spend most of day inside their burrows and forage for food mostly in morning and evening in between these times olympic marmots can sometimes be found lying on rocks where they sun themselves for warmth grooming each other playing chirping and feeding together burrows are multi purpose structures used for hibernation protection from bad weather and predators and to raise newborn pups a typical colony of marmots consists of a male two to three females and their young sometimes living in groups of more than a dozen animals young marmots stay with their family for at least two years so a burrow is often home to a newly born litter and a litter of two year olds marmots seldom move to other colonies with exception of sub adults of two to three years old which may leave home colony to start a new family elsewhere females move only a few hundred meters though males often move several kilometers away from their birth burrow a colony may have a subordinate or satellite male smaller and younger than colony male who may take over as dominant male if incumbent dies satellite male lives in a separate burrow away from rest of colony after emergence from hibernation if satellite male and colony male are both still living in same colony dominant colony male may chase satellite around multiple times per day satellite male s feeding area is limited to areas far from rest of marmots in colony and he must stay away from other marmots burrows as long as colony male is near while satellite male does not approach other marmots in colony they sometimes make trips over to satellite male s burrow often about two times an hour after more time has passed since hibernation males will become less hostile towards each other and less avoidance and chasing will occur male male competition ends around same time that reproductive season does diminution of hostile behavior is only temporary as satellite male becomes assigned to its subordinate status again following spring after emergence from hibernation and ritual begins again communication when greeting each other these very sociable animals will usually touch noses or nose to cheek in courtship rituals they may inter lock teeth and nibble each other s ears and necks they may also engage in play fighting in which two marmots on their hind legs push each other with their paws this play fighting is more aggressive between older marmots in fights that have been observed during a study only about 10 of fights had distinct outcomes when communicating vocally they have four different types of whistles differing in this from their close relatives hoary marmot and vancouver island marmot olympic marmot s whistles include flat calls ascending calls descending calls and trills all of these are in a small frequency range of about 2 700 hz flat ascending and descending calls are most often voiced singly ascending call has a duration of about half a second starting with a yell on one note and ending with a chip on a higher note it is often used as a distress or warning call for unfamiliar smells and noises these same are heard when olympic marmots are play fighting along with low growls and chattering of teeth descending call ends on a lower note than one on which it started trill which sounds like multiple ascending calls put together as one longer sound consists of multiple ranging notes and is voiced as an alarm call to communicate to other marmots in area that danger may be approaching and they should return to their burrows females with young have responsibility to watch out for their young and other relatives near burrow and therefore voice trill more often than other olympic marmots if marmots are not accustomed to human contact in a certain area they may also sound a trill when seeing a person in order to alert other marmots at places like hurricane ridge where seeing humans is a frequent occurrence most marmots will not acknowledge human presence at all they also communicate through sense of smell a gland located in their cheek exudes chemicals which they rub on scenting points such as shrubs and rocks which can be smelled by other marmots in area hibernation olympic marmots start to enter hibernation in early september before hibernating marmots bring dry grasses into burrow for bedding or food sometimes in early september marmots will stay in their burrows for a few consecutive days with only brief outings that allow for a little foraging during this period they do not play fight or socialize with other marmots they limit themselves to peeking out and casually sitting outside their burrows females those who have not given birth yet and adult males become inactive first because they do not need to store as much fat beforehand parous females yearlings and young of year become inactive a few weeks later because they have to gain more weight marmots of a colony hibernate in a single burrow space which they keep closed with dirt adults emerge in may and young in june marmots do not eat during hibernation so they have to store fat before becoming inactive these marmots are deep they cannot easily be awoken their body temperature drops to below and heart rate can slow to three beats per minute marmots warm their bodies about every ten days olympic marmots lose 50 of their body mass over seven to eight months of winter hibernation hibernation is most dangerous time for them as in years of light snowfall as many as 50 of young born that year will die from cold because of lack of insulation that is provided by good snow cover when they emerge in early may thick snow cover is still present from preceding winter so they are not very active at this time sometimes they are so disoriented after awaking from hibernation that they have to relearn colony s landmarks which are now covered in snow which obscures them even more they wander around aimlessly until they find their burrows life cycle this species along with hoary marmot has lowest reproductive rate of any rodent a female olympic marmot has a litter of from one to six young 3 3 on average in alternate years in a given year a third of females will have a litter half of pups die before following spring those pups that survive following spring can live into their teens both males and females mature sexually at three years but females generally do not reproduce until they are four and a half years old marmot comes out from hibernation at beginning of may and estrus heat occurs about two weeks later after hibernation ends both male and female olympic marmots attempt to entice opposite sex with courtship rituals females who have never produced a litter before tend to be more aggressive and will chase or instigate fights with males females which have already produced young tend to greet male with nasal to nasal or nasal to genital contact with copulation following shortly afterwards this approach is more successful than aggressive manner of non parous female with mating taking place within 11 to 20 days after hibernation relationship between a sexually mature male and female olympic marmot is polygynous males tend to breed with three or four females in each mating season approximately four weeks after mating female gives birth to her young in a grass lined burrow underground newborn pups cannot see have no fur and are pink in color at first young exhibit no sexual dimorphism it is about a month before young olympic marmots first leave burrow around same time they begin to be weaned even after they are allowed to emerge young initially stay within immediate vicinity of burrow where they can be found chasing each other and wrestling playfully within a few weeks after first emerging from burrow young are fully weaned and can feed themselves olympic marmots are not completely independent from their mothers until they reach two years of age breeding age female marmots are extremely important to marmot populations if a female of breeding age dies it can take years to replace her marmots are usually limited to six pups in a litter maturation period is long and many marmots die before reaching maturity interaction with humans thumb alt photograph 270px relief map of olympic national park where olympic marmot is protected olympic marmot is second rarest north american marmot behind critically endangered vancouver island marmot marmots were first sighted in olympic peninsula in 1880s in 1960s david p barash conducted a three year study of olympic marmots after which he reported that there was an abundance of marmots in mountains in 1989 total olympic marmot population was calculated to be only about 2 000 but this low number was due to poor data collection other than this population census little further research was done on olympic marmot until late 1990s when concerns arose about population status rangers and frequent visitors to olympic national park had noticed that some populations of olympic marmots had disappeared from their usual habitats in response to this university of michigan began a population study in 2002 in which marmot population continued to decline by about 10 a year until 2006 predation by coyotes that had not been present in area before 20th century was found to be main cause of death of females inhibiting population re growth by 2006 numbers had dropped to 1 000 individuals this figure increased to around 4 000 from 2007 to 2010 when colonies stabilized and survival rates rose in 2010 volunteers started to collect and store data about marmot populations in park through a monitoring program olympic marmot has been considered a species of least concern on iucn red list since first being included in 1996 its range is small but 90 of its total habitat is protected due to being in olympic national park park which holds multiple other endemic species has been designated a unesco biosphere reserve and a world heritage site state law declares that olympic marmot is a protected wildlife species and cannot be hunted species is susceptible to climate change because of their sensitivity to changed habitats when meadows in olympic national park dried out marmots there died or moved in long term meadows may be superseded by forests climate change will alter timing composition and quality of marmots food olympic marmots can become more vulnerable to predators when daytime temperatures rise too high for foraging causing them to forage in cooler evenings when predators are more difficult to notice in warm winters there is heavier predation by coyotes marmots become more accessible to coyotes as lower banks of snow allow coyotes to move up higher on mountains where marmots dwell into areas which they could not usually reach during an average cold winter climate change could also have positive effects a warmer climate would result in a longer growing season in which marmots could mature more quickly and thus breed more often in 2009 this marmot was designated a state symbol of washington official endemic mammal governor chris gregoire s signing of senate bill was result of a two year effort by fourth and fifth graders of wedgwood elementary school in seattle students researched marmot s habits and answered legislators
