1993 north indian ocean cyclone season was quietest on record in basin with only four tropical disturbances there are two main seas in north indian ocean bay of bengal to east of indian subcontinent and arabian sea to west india meteorological department imd issued advisories for systems in its official capacity as local regional specialized meteorological center while joint typhoon warning center also issued advisories for two of storms on an unofficial basis of five disturbances tracked by imd two intensified into cyclonic storms there were no storms before june and during that month a deep depression formed off east coast of india it brought flooding rains as it moved through bangladesh and dissipated over northeastern india depression struck in midst of ongoing floods which were responsible for 200 deaths in country in june 1993 next depression only to originate over arabian sea in season formed on november 8 and moved toward southern india system killed 35 people before weakening and turning to northwest it re intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm but weakened just off coast of pakistan due to wind shear storm killed 609 people in country due to flooding final two depressions had their origins from western pacific basin in late november a convective system crossed malay peninsula and developed into an intense tropical cyclone reaching estimated peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph on december 4 while at peak intensity cyclone moved ashore southern india near karaikal causing widespread damage estimated at us 216 million 1993 usd storm killed 70 people and displaced at least 68 000 people final depression was reformation of typhoon manny it dissipated near southern india on december 20 bringing heavy rainfall to country toc season summary india meteorological department imd in new delhi official regional specialized meteorological center for northern indian ocean as recognized by world meteorological organization issued warnings for tropical cyclones developing in region using satellite imagery and surface data to assess and predict storms agency also utilized a tropical cyclone forecast model that used climatology and persistence forecasting to predict future storm movement warnings and advisories were broadcast throughout india by telegraph and news media basin s activity is sub divided between arabian sea and bay of bengal on opposite coasts of india and is generally split before and after monsoon season storms were also tracked on an unofficial basis by american based joint typhoon warning center jtwc during year imd tracked five tropical disturbances one of which reformed into a very severe cyclonic storm significantly lower than average of 15 disturbances per year this made 1993 season quietest on record with two fewer disturbances than seven that developed in 1984 season inactivity followed record active 1992 season jtwc tracked two tropical cyclones in basin fewest since also tracking two in 1980 season there were no tropical disturbances before onset of monsoon season in may only eighth time since 1891 for such an occurrence for first time since 1891 there was only one system that developed during monsoon season there were 14 non developing low pressure areas around india that contributed to normal amounts of rainfall for country one storm in year formed in arabian sea in 1993 final two depressions of season had their origins from western pacific ocean systems deep depression bob 01 first depression of season originated early on june 17 off east coast of india about 150 km 95 mi southwest of kolkata structure was akin to a monsoon depression as circulation was broad and strongest winds were away from center moving northeastward depression made landfall near border of india and bangladesh around 09 00 utc on june 17 as it progressed into bangladesh system intensified further into a deep depression with maximum sustained winds estimated at 55 km h 35 mph by imd in southeastern bangladesh a station in chittagong recorded slightly higher sustained winds of 65 km h 40 mph deep depression weakened as it reached northern bangladesh dissipating over assam in eastern india on june 19 in bangladesh depression struck in midst of ongoing floods that began earlier in june this resulted in additional rainfall floods and landslides around 103 000 houses were damaged or destroyed leaving 50 000 people homeless floods also washed away bridges and railroad tracks and damaged of roads transport links connecting flooded areas to capital city dhaka were restored within a few days rivers exceeded their banks isolating tens of thousands of people in northeastern bangladesh storm flooding killed 200 people in country throughout june in response to flooding bangladesh government worked in tandem with non government organizations to provide food medicine and financial assistance to storm victims system enhanced monsoon in eastern india resulting in heavy rainfall and floods river a tributary of brahmaputra river in assam reached above dangerous water levels very severe cyclonic storm arb 01 02 on november 5 jtwc first monitored an area of convection southwest of india associated with intertropical convergence zone on november 8 imd classified storm as a depression giving it identifier arb 01 depression moved northeastward toward southern india moving ashore near thoothukudi on november 9 and soon degenerated into a remnant low pressure area remnant low of storm turned back to northwest and re emerged into arabian sea on november 12 it re intensified into a depression after convection increased over center and imd gave storm a new identifier arb 02 later that day jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 01a as storm turned to north and northeast it intensified further based on observations from two ships imd upgraded it to a very severe cyclonic storm on november 14 estimating peak winds of 120 km h 75 mph jtwc estimated higher wind speeds of 150 km h 90 mph wind shear from westerlies displaced convection which continued ahead of circulation center of storm slowed and turned to southeast as winds quickly diminished by november 16 system weakened into a remnant low pressure area off coast of gujarat and sindh in southern india depression killed 35 people cyclone dropped heavy rainfall in western india reaching in bhuj gujarat officials issued storm warnings for karachi pakistan in anticipation that cyclone would continue on its trajectory and move inland cyclone brought rainfall to widespread areas in southern sindh province along with gusty winds causing power outages and flooding in low lying areas of karachi metropolis high seas flooded port of bandar forcing residents to seek higher grounds a fishing boat capsized off southeast coast of pakistan ten of crew were rescued but two fishermen drowned in thatta and badin districts storm flooding killed 609 people and displaced around 200 000 others extremely severe cyclonic storm bob 02 on november 27 jtwc first mentioned an area of convection south of vietnam as an area of possible tropical cyclone development a ridge to north steered convective system westward across malay peninsula system entered eastern bay of bengal on november 29 and convection increased further in conjunction with a weak circulation jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 02b on november 30 and imd designated it as a depression a day later storm gradually intensified while moving west northwestward toward southeastern india developing an eye in center of convection on december 4 between 04 00 05 00 utc cyclone made landfall near city of karaikal which recorded gusts of 198 km h 123 mph during storm s passage imd estimated peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph higher than jtwc wind estimate of 140 km h 85 mph storm rapidly weakened over land to depression intensity and imd stopped tracking system late on december 4 jtwc tracked system into arabian sea on december 5 where circulation dissipated shortly thereafter along northwest coast of sri lanka cyclone s flow produced a storm surge imd issued hourly warnings for southern india in advance of cyclone through electronic and print media around 40 000 people evacuated their houses near coast across southern india cyclone killed 70 people and left us 216 million in damage 1993 usd heavy rainfall reached over in southern andhra pradesh causing landslides and flooding dam exceeded its capacity forcing hundreds of people to leave their homes in pondicherry a storm surge flooded 60 coastal villages and waters reached inland around 12 000 people had to be rescued from inaccessible areas after cyclone struck train service was halted in and out of chennai roadways across tamil nadu were damaged or blocked by fallen trees after high winds uprooted hundreds of trees and snapped power lines hundreds of thousands of people in southern india were left without power or water service cyclone also damaged over 44 000 houses of which 20 000 were in pondicherry alone where about 68 000 people were displaced knee deep waters ruined of crop fields after storm local governments worked to restore power lines and damaged roads while also providing food and fuel to affected residents deep depression bob 03 typhoon manny a long tracked storm in western pacific ocean dissipated as a tropical cyclone over malay peninsula on december 15 system emerged into andaman sea on next day and continued westward across bay of bengal it evolved into a low pressure area on december 18 and intensified into final depression of season on next day moving northwestward system passed northeast of sri lanka while moving northwestward it weakened while approaching southern india dissipating near coast of tamil nadu depression brought locally heavy rainfall to tamil nadu and puducherry season effects bob 01 bgcolor bgcolor bgcolor india bangladesh heavy 200 arb 01 02 bgcolor bgcolor
