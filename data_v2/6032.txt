pike pawnee village site or hill farm site designated by archaeologists is a site near village of guide rock in webster county in south central portion of state of nebraska in great plains region of united states it was location of a village of kitkehahki band of pawnee people in a region of republican river valley that they occupied intermittently from 1770s to 1820s in 1806 village was visited by a spanish expedition led by lieutenant facundo melgares and soon after by an american expedition led by lieutenant zebulon pike at village pike persuaded pawnee leaders to haul down a spanish flag that they had received from melgares and to raise flag of united states in its stead location of village visited by pike was not known for many years in early 20th century two sites were proposed this one in nebraska and one in republic county in northern kansas a dispute between historical societies of two states ensued titled war between nebraska and kansas dispute was eventually resolved in favor of nebraska site investigations conducted at site by william duncan strong waldo wedel and a t hill were instrumental in development of great plains archaeology and of pawnee archaeology in particular site is a national historic landmark and is listed in national register of historic places description thumb alt hill covered with shrubs and trees rising from flat land with canal at base pa hur in 2010 site lies on a terrace on republican river s south side near village of guide rock at terrace s north edge is a near vertical bank floodplain of river extends about one fourth mile about one half kilometer from bank s base to present channel remains of over 100 earth lodges lie on terrace between bank and hills to south which rise above site on hills are five cemeteries village complex also includes a council site and two open courts where a hoop game was played village extended for at least from east to west on its east and west sides were creeks now dry that ran northward into republican at time of village s occupation springs in western creek flowed year round these would have provided a more convenient source of water than river since access to latter was hampered by steep bank springs ceased to flow at some time after land came under cultivation in 1870s not far downstream from site is a hill known to pawnees as pa hur or hill that points way in traditional pawnee religion this was one of five lodges of spirit animals with supernatural healing powers history 1770 1806 southern pawnees move north ancestors of modern pawnee people were not a single unified tribe at middle of 18th century they consisted of two major groups skidis or wolf pawnees had migrated northward with and had probably been in nebraska since 1600 or earlier by beginning of 18th century they were established on loup river which flows through central nebraska into platte river from north thumb alt painting of man in powdered wig with medals alejandro o reilly second major division of ancestral pawnees was southern or black pawnees their migration history is not well documented but by 1750 they with related and allied wichitas had established what seemed to be a secure territory on arkansas river security of southern bands depended on french trade in arms and this was disrupted by french and indian war 1754 63 in 1763 france surrendered louisiana territory under terms of treaty of fontainebleau great britain obtained portion of territory east of mississippi river spain received territory west of mississippi including new orleans although they did not make their claim to that city effective until governor alejandro o reilly suppressed rebellion of 1768 once in control of new orleans spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up mississippi cutting off supply of arms to southern pawnees and wichitas neighboring osages were not so affected as they had access to arms smuggled by french traders from british territory in present day illinois with superior weaponry they drove between southern pawnees and wichitas pushing latter group southward to red river pawnees moved northward into nebraska possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on platte dates of moves are not known exactly wichita move from arkansas to red occurred at some time between 1768 and 1772 osages occupied former pawnee wichita hunting grounds on arkansas in 1774 indicating that pawnees had left by then in 1777 a spanish report indicated that they were in nebraska southern pawnees were divided into three bands chauis or grand pawnees pitahawiratas or pawnees and kitkehahkis or republican pawnees chauis were regarded as nominal leaders and in traditional account they led migration to nebraska followed by pitahawiratas however kitkehahkis declined to follow chaui chiefs to their new settlements on platte instead they established themselves on republican river near what is now nebraska kansas border occupation history there is much debate among historians and archaeologists concerning dates of occupation of webster county village four kitkehahki village sites on republican are known two of them quite large this one and pawnee indian village site near republic kansas downstream band inhabited republican valley intermittently from 1770s to 1820s unfortunately there is little information on which villages were occupied at what times although there is a strong consensus that this village is one visited by pike in 1806 following account therefore can only describe what is known about kitkehahki occupation and abandonment of republican valley and not history of this particular village thumb left pawnee earth lodge in nebraska 1873 pawnees did not live in their villages year round in spring they planted and hoed crops near their villages in mid june they left on their summer buffalo hunt in september they returned to harvest crops and to hold their harvest festival they then cached a portion of their food in their villages and left on winter buffalo hunt from which they did not return until planting time in spring thus villages were deserted for at least eight months of year kitkehahkis also moved both in small groups and en masse between republican and platte pitahawiratas and chauis seem to have lived together amicably from time of their arrival in nebraska however kitkehahkis were divided between those who wanted to live independently on republican and those who wanted to live near chauis on platte three bands frequently moved together on summer and winter buffalo hunts so there was regular contact between them it was common for people to move from one household to another especially upon returning from a buffalo hunt this would have facilitated moves from village to village at times entire kitkehahki band abandoned republican and moved to platte generally this took place in times of war when bands sought protection in numbers movement between republican and platte probably occurred continually until about 1825 war with skidis when southern pawnees arrived in nebraska skidis were not pleased to see them on lands that they regarded as their own nevertheless they were willing to accept them as neighbors so long as they kept to south side of platte however chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as heads of entire pawnee people above skidi chiefs they defied skidis by sending a large hunting party to prairie creek on north side of platte within sight of skidi villages on loup skidis responded by attacking chaui hunters and driving them back across platte chauis and pitahawiratas resolved on war and summoned kitkehahki fighters to join them against skidis kitkehahkis unwilling to leave their people unprotected against skidi raids left republican and moved to platte near other bands conflict with skidis probably took place sometime between 1770 and 1775 it concluded with defeat of skidis who although nominally conquered remained on loup and continued to hunt separately from other three bands by 1777 kitkehahkis had moved back to republican at some time between 1777 and 1785 kitkehahkis again abandoned and then re occupied republican valley a spanish account of 1785 describes a village on south side of platte in butler county not far from modern town of linwood nebraska this village was occupied by kitkehahkis until about 1785 when they returned to republican war with omahas war came to kitkehahkis on republican in 1798 omahas under leadership of chief blackbird had become perhaps most powerful group in nebraska they were located at junction of french trade route up missouri river and an overland route across northern iowa whereby sac and fox brought british arms and goods westward this allowed them to levy tribute and exercise control over trade on missouri during height of their power in late 1790s bands of omaha warriors frequently visited kitkehahkis to perform calumet ceremony this traditional peacemaking ritual had degenerated into what omahas called smoking for horses kitkehahkis were obliged to give feasts and presents of horses to their uninvited guests in 1798 a group of omahas under little grizzly bear went for this purpose to republican kitkehahkis feeling imposed upon by frequency of these visits stripped and beat omahas and drove them out of village when blackbird learned of this he ordered an attack on kitkehahkis omahas descended upon band s village burned and plundered many of lodges and killed about one hundred pawnees at cost of about fifteen of their own men remaining kitkehahkis had withdrawn into four lodges occupying a position too strong for omahas to reach them and massacre them without unacceptable losses whether republican valley was abandoned after omaha attack is not recorded invading omahas had camped on platte undisturbed by chauis on their way to kitkehahkis this might indicate that two pawnee bands were on bad terms at time power of omahas was broken soon thereafter in about 1801 a smallpox epidemic spread from skidis to omahas killing half of tribe blackbird among them when lewis and clark expedition reached platte in 1804 they found kitkehahkis whom they mistakenly called living there they were told that band had returned to republican about ten years before that is before conflict with omahas but had recently moved to platte under pressure from kanzas by 1806 however kitkehahkis were at peace with kanzas and were once again living on republican 1806 melgares and pike under 1800 treaty of san ildefonso spain returned louisiana territory to france in connection with this transfer france agreed not to sell territory to a third party french foreign minister talleyrand had indicated that a strong french louisiana would halt expansion of britain and united states in new world thumb left zebulon pike napoleon quickly reneged on this agreement in 1803 louisiana purchase france sold territory to united states this led to conflict between latter nation and spain spanish contended that sale of louisiana to united states was invalid and that territory had reverted to them although they were unable to prevent american occupation of new orleans they sought to check american activity west of mississippi river spain and united states both sought allies among native americans of disputed territory in june 1806 lieutenant facundo melgares and 600 men were dispatched from spanish provincial capital of santa fe down red river and then northward into present day nebraska although no spanish records of melgares expedition are known to exist it is believed that its purpose was to find and arrest lewis and clark party and to establish alliances with native americans of region including pawnees about a month later lieutenant zebulon pike left st louis with an american party of 23 men and orders to negotiate peace between kanzas and osages to contact comanches of high plains and to explore headwaters of red and arkansas rivers for guides and interpreters to comanches pike turned to pawnees his osage and pawnee guides led him northwest through present day kansas toward kitkehahki village on republican melgares was first to arrive at village his journey north had not been easy mutiny had broken out and been suppressed among his new mexican militia and many of his horses had gone lame or had been stolen by pawnee raiders he had left 240 of his men on arkansas in southern kansas before turning northward with other half of his force in republican village he met with kitkehahki and chaui leaders to whom he presented gifts including spanish flags pawnees agreed to expel americans from their territory but also opposed melgares expedition s continuing to missouri river in face of this opposition and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off country melgares returned to arkansas and thence to santa fe pike at village pike s party reached kitkehahki village on september 25 1806 shortly after melgares s departure upon his arrival he was greeted by ranking chief sharitarish who invited him to eat in his lodge and told him of melgares s recent visit pawnees presented eight horses to osages accompanying pike and members of two tribes smoked pipes together pike s party established a camp fortified with rifle pits on a hill on north bank of republican opposite village on following day a delegation of 12 kanzas arrived at village on september 28 they held a council with osages pipes were smoked in token of peace between tribes on september 29 pike held a grand council with pawnees at this council one of melgares s spanish flags was displayed at chief s lodge pike urged pawnees to haul it down and replace it with that of united states when pawnee chiefs demurred i again reiterated demand for flag adding that it was impossible for nation to have two fathers that they must either be children of spaniards or acknowledge their american father after a silence of some time an old man rose went to door took down spanish flag brought it and laid it at my feet he then received american flag and elevated it on staff which had lately borne standard of his catholic majesty this was favorably received by osages and kanzas but apparently caused distress to pawnees perceiving this pike returned spanish flag to them asking only that they not fly it during his party s stay in village at this there was a general shout of applause pike had planned for pawnees to guide him to comanches however upon his arrival at village he was informed that two tribes were at war when pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward headwaters of arkansas sharitarish urged him to turn back he had prevented spanish from going further into american territory and would likewise resist an american movement toward spanish land pike refused to be intimidated he told chief that young warriors of his great american father were not women to be turned back by words that i should therefore proceed and if he thought proper to stop me he could attempt it but that we were men well armed and would sell our lives at a dear rate to his nation that we knew our great father would send his young warriors there to gather our bones and revenge our deaths on his people pawnees relented though unwillingly and with much dissent pike obtained horses from them and set out on october 7 he ordered his party to stay in a compact body with guns and bayonets and sabers at ready he estimated that it would have cost them at least 100 men to have exterminated us with no guides to comanches he was forced to abandon that part of mission instead he returned south into kansas where he attempted to follow melgares s trail toward arkansas 1806 1833 sharitarish was a chaui who at some time before 1805 had been involved in a struggle over leadership of that band in course of this struggle he had brought his clan to kitkehahki village on republican where he had deposed hereditary chief of kitkehahki although exact situation is not known it is thought that sharitarish was trying to bring kitkehahkis back to platte to support his faction in chaui village after 1806 spanish continued their efforts to win friendship of pawnees messages were dispatched to pawnee chiefs urging them to come to santa fe and most of these messages went to sharitarish fact that he received them while long hair chaui head chief was ignored fed his self importance in 1809 in an ill judged attempt to impress pawnees he led kitkehahki to war with kanzas by 1811 he had been defeated and kitkehahkis had been forced to abandon republican and move to platte there is no firm documentary evidence of occupation of webster county village after 1809 however analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that site was re occupied during second decade of 19th century and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that kitkehahki were living on republican by 1833 however village had been abandoned and band was living on loup river in that year four pawnee bands treated as a single tribe by u s government signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of platte rediscovering village thumb alt square granite obelisk 10 12 feet high 1901 monument at republic county site monument was damaged by a tornado in 2004 and has been restored though not to its original size and appearance webster county was opened to homesteaders in 1870 in 1872 village site was homesteaded and placed under cultivation in 1875 elizabeth johnson discovered remains of a pawnee village in republic county kansas she thought that it might be site of pike s flag incident but hearing of another village in webster county nebraska she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site because surface had been altered by cultivation they found little evidence of habitation and johnson was persuaded that republic county site was pike s village she prevented its being plowed on several occasions and eventually purchased land johnson s claim was supported by elliott coues who had edited pike s journal with his endorsement it was accepted by kansas state historical society in 1901 johnson donated land to state of kansas which built a granite monument commemorating pike s symbolic triumph over spain at dedication of monument several of speakers drew parallels between pike episode and recent american victory in spanish american war in 1906 a four day festival was held to celebrate centennial of flag incident a t hill one of those attending 1906 ceremonies at kansas monument was a t hill a resident of logan kansas hill had no formal training as an archaeologist indeed his formal education had ended in fourth grade however he had developed a strong interest in history and archaeology of great plains upon reading pike s journal hill became convinced that kansas site could not be correct one to him local topography did not appear to match that described by pike and when he attempted to retrace pike s route he concluded that actual village site must be some distance northwest of kansas monument in 1912 hill moved to hastings nebraska where he went to work for an automobile dealership in his job he traveled throughout central nebraska in course of this he spoke with many collectors and investigated possible pike sites when he reached a managerial position at dealership he recruited his salesmen to bring him reports on archaeological sites and collections in 1923 hill learned of remains of a spanish saddle obtained from george dewitt farm in webster county he visited farm and learned from dewitt son of original homesteader that when land was first plowed it was covered with native american relics hill opened a grave and found a spanish bridle bit and spur across river on land that had never been plowed he found traces of a camp including rifle pits topography of site closely matched pike s description and when hill attempted to follow pike s route from site to arkansas river he recognized a number of landmarks from pike s account hill called attention of nebraska state historical society nshs to site and in 1924 joined representatives of society in conducting further excavations showing that a village of considerable size had existed there in 1925 to ensure archaeological access to site and to protect it from relic hunting he bought two farms on whose land it lay between 1924 and 1930 he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves nebraska versus kansas by 1927 hill and nshs were persuaded that webster county site was scene of pike flag incident in that year they challenged kansas s claim a full issue of society s journal nebraska history was devoted to matter issue provocatively titled war between nebraska and kansas included articles by representatives of nebraska society and of kansas historical society each claiming pike site for his own state more than historical accuracy was at stake in a 1901 address delivered at republic county site katherine s lewis of kansas daughters of american revolution had declared that we have been seeking out antiquity for kansas we felt that our state was too new to be interesting in 1927 kansans still regarded their pike site as a focus of state pride and were unwilling to give it up in nebraska history issue george morehouse of khs wrote it is now very strange that our nebraska friends should become so enthusiastic in trying to take from our pike s pawnee republic village its halo of glory in their articles champions of each state argued that pike s account of his route supported their site and entirely ruled out other both sides also argued that pike s description of local topography matched their site and differed significantly from other proponents of nebraska site cited artifacts that had been recovered from their village these included a spanish peace medal dated 1797 and bearing image of charles iv an american peace medal of type issued after 1801 and soldier s buttons and brass medallions bearing 15 stars one of which bore number 1 that of pike s infantry regiment thumb alt low circular stone building with low pitched conical roof square granite obelisk in foreground pawnee indian museum and restored 1901 monument at republic county site kansans had no such artifacts to show however they argued that nebraska village postdated pike episode kansas village they stated had been one visited by pike and was occupied by pawnees until they were driven north by delawares in early 1830s fleeing pawnees had then established village on republican where they had been devastated by smallpox in this account epidemic and not long habitation explained number of graves found by hill medals had not been buried with their original owners but had been treasured by band for decades until time that pestilence was blamed on evil gifts from whites and they were cast away further work at both sites strengthened case for nebraska kansas supporters gave ground reluctantly a major celebration was held at republic county site in 1933 and as late as 1947 an article in kansas historical quarterly spoke of issue as debatable ground today however webster county site is generally acknowledged as true one an exhibit at republic county site states as much and a kansas historical marker near 1901 monument states that village was long believed to be that visited by zebulon m pike although elizabeth johnson was mistaken about pike village site her mistake is held to be a fortunate one webster county site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting republic county site was not entirely pristine due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation but it was far better preserved today kansas historical society operates a museum on site built in 1967 over one of excavated earth lodges investigation history hill continued work at site through 1930 in that year he was joined by william duncan strong who previous year had been named a professor of anthropology at university of nebraska and by strong s research assistant waldo wedel collaboration of these three was crucial to new science of central plains archaeology and to pawnee studies in particular up to this time conventional wisdom among anthropologists was that there was no useful archaeological work to be done on plains in 1936 wedel published his 1930 master s thesis as seminal an introduction to pawnee archaeology in summer of 1941 a wpa crew excavated a number of lodges cache pits and graves at site some testing and surface collecting were conducted in 1943 more recently a magnetic survey was conducted over a portion of village in 1982 and some testing was carried out in 1987 hill plotted remains of 102 lodges pike reported finding 44 lodges at village difference is probably due to abandonment or destruction of lodges and building of new ones on different sites at least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists an estimated 75 100 additional graves are thought to have been opened by relic hunters preservation in 1964 site was listed as a national historic landmark in 1966 it was added to national register of historic places boundaries of historic site were expanded to nearly at some time in 1977 or later site is owned and preserved by nebraska state historical society
