sturgeon is common name for 27 species of fish belonging to family acipenseridae their evolution dates back to triassic period some 245 to 208 million years ago family is grouped into four genera acipenser huso scaphirhynchus and pseudoscaphirhynchus four species may now be extinct two closely related species polyodon spathula american paddlefish and psephurus gladius chinese paddlefish possibly extinct are of same order acipenseriformes but are in family polyodontidae and are not considered to be true sturgeons both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as primitive fishes because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since earliest fossil record sturgeons are native to subtropical temperate and sub arctic rivers lakes and coastlines of eurasia and north america sturgeons are long lived late maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to those of sharks and an elongated spindle like body that is smooth skinned scaleless and armored with five lateral rows of bony plates called scutes several species can grow quite large typically ranging in length largest sturgeon on record was a beluga female captured in volga estuary in 1827 weighing and long most sturgeons are anadromous bottom feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas and are known to venture into open ocean several species of sturgeon are harvested for their roe which is processed into luxury food caviar this has led to serious overexploitation which combined with other conservation threats has brought most of species to critically endangered status at edge of extinction physical characteristics thumb upright 1 25 sturgeon skull a rostrum b nasal capsule c eye socket d foramina for spinal nerves e notochord g quadrate

unique among bony fishes because their skeletons are almost entirely cartilaginous notably however skeleton is not a primitive character but a derived one sturgeon ancestors had bony skeletons they also lack vertebral centra and are partially covered with five lateral rows of scutes rather than scales they also have four barbels sensory organs that precede their wide toothless mouths they navigate their riverine habitats traveling just off bottom with their barbels dragging along gravel or murky substrate sturgeon are recognizable for their elongated bodies flattened rostra distinctive

freshwater fishes of u s s r and adjacent countries volume 1 4th edition israel program for scientific translations ltd jerusalem russian version published 1948 combination of slow growth and reproductive rates and extremely high value placed on mature egg bearing females make sturgeon particularly vulnerable to overfishing sturgeons are polyploid some species have four eight or 16 sets of chromosomes life cycle sturgeons are long lived late maturing fishes their average lifespan is 50 to 60 years and their first spawn does not occur until they are around 15 to 20 years old sturgeons are broadcast spawners and do not spawn every year because they require specific conditions those requirements may or may not be met every year due to varying environmental conditions such as proper photoperiod in spring clear water with shallow rock or gravel substrate where eggs can adhere and proper water temperature and flow for oxygenation of eggs a single female may release 100 000 to 3 million eggs but not all will be fertilized fertilized eggs become sticky and adhere to bottom substrate upon contact eight to 15 days are needed for embryos to mature into larval fish during that time they are dependent on their yolk sacs for nourishment river currents carry larvae downstream into backwater areas such as oxbows and sloughs where free swimming fry spend their first year feeding on insect larvae and crustacea during their first year of growth they reach in length and migrate back into swift flowing currents in main stem river range and habitat sturgeon range from subtropical to subarctic waters in north america and eurasia in north america they range along atlantic coast from gulf of mexico to newfoundland including great lakes and st lawrence missouri and mississippi rivers as well as along west coast in major rivers from california and idaho to british columbia they occur along european atlantic coast including mediterranean basin especially in adriatic sea and

exceptionally both huso species white sturgeon and pallid sturgeon feed primarily on other fish as adults they feed by extending their syphon like mouths to suck food from benthos having no teeth they are unable to seize prey though larger individuals and more predatory species can swallow very large prey items including whole salmon sergei f and nina f 2007 injuries of salmon in amur river and its estuary as an index of adult fish mortality in period of sea migrations technical report no 4 sturgeons feed non visually they are believed to use a combination of sensors including olfactory tactile and cues detected by four barbels and electroreception using their ampullae of lorenzini sturgeons electroreceptors are located on head and are sensitive to weak electric fields generated by other animals or sources electroreceptors are thought to be used in various behaviors such as feeding mating and migration many sturgeons leap completely out of water usually making a loud splash which can be heard half a mile away on surface and probably further under water why they do this is not known but suggested functions include group communication to maintain group cohesion catching airborne prey courtship display or to help shed eggs during spawning other plausible explanations include escape from predators shedding parasites or to gulp or expel air another explanation is that it simply feels good there have been some incidents of leaping sturgeon landing in boats and causing injuries to humans in 2015 a 5 year old girl was fatally injured after a sturgeon leapt from suwannee river

explained in part by long generation interval tolerance for wide ranges of temperature and salinity lack of predators due to size and bony plated armor or scutes and abundance of prey items in benthic

characteristics such as heterocercal tail reduced more fin rays than supporting bony elements and unique jaw suspension phylogeny and taxonomy despite existence of a fossil record full classification and phylogeny of sturgeon species has been difficult to determine in part due to high individual and variation including geographical clines in certain features such as rostrum shape number of scutes and body length a further confounding factor is peculiar ability of sturgeons to produce reproductively viable hybrids even between species assigned to different genera while ray finned fishes actinopterygii have a long evolutionary history culminating in our most familiar fishes past adaptive evolutionary radiations have left only a few survivors such as sturgeons and gars wide range of

species of sturgeon are harvested for their roe which is processed into caviar a luxury food and reason why caviar producing sturgeons are among most valuable and endangered of all wildlife resources during 19th century us was global leader in caviar production having cornered 90 of world s caviar trade atlantic sturgeon once thrived along east coast from canada down to florida they were in such abundance in hudson river they were called albany beef and sturgeon eggs were given away at local bars as an accompaniment to 5c beer white sturgeon populations along us west coast declined simultaneously under pressure of commercial fishing and human encroachment within course of a century once abundant sturgeon fisheries in us and canada had drastically declined and in some areas had been extirpated under pressure of commercial overharvesting pollution human encroachment habitat loss and damming of rivers that blocked their ancestral migration to spawning grounds by turn of century commercial production of sturgeon caviar in us and canada had come to an end regulatory protections and conservation efforts were put in place by state and federal resource agencies in us and canada such as 1998 us federal moratorium that closed all commercial fishing for atlantic sturgeon it was during 20th century that russia grew to become global leader as largest producer and exporter of caviar as with decline in sturgeon populations in us and canada same occurred with sturgeon populations in caspian sea beginning with 1979 us embargo on iran poaching and smuggling sturgeon caviar was big business but an illegal and dangerous one officers with washington department of fish and wildlife wdfw busted a poaching ring that was based in vancouver poachers had harvested 1 65 tons of caviar from nearly 2 000 white sturgeon that were poached from columbia river caviar was estimated to be worth around 2 million wdfw busted another ring in 2003 and conducted an undercover sting operation in 2006 2007 that resulted in 17 successful attempts out of a total of 19 in response to concerns over future of sturgeons and associated commercial products international trade for all species of sturgeons has been regulated under cites since 1998 conservation sturgeons are long lived late maturing fishes with reproductive cycles that include long migrations and require specific environmental conditions they are an ancient species that have survived for millions of years but their future is threatened due in part to their inherent ancestral characteristics and reproductive specificities negative impacts of overfishing poaching habitat destruction and construction of dams that have altered or blocked their annual migration to ancestral spawning grounds have taken a serious toll clover charles 2004 end of line how overfishing is changing world and what we eat ebury press london some species of sturgeon are extinct several are on verge of extinction including chinese sturgeon highly prized beluga sturgeon and alabama sturgeon many species are classified as threatened or endangered with noticeable declines in sturgeon populations as demand for caviar increases iucn data indicates that over 85 of sturgeon species are at risk of extinction making them more critically endangered than any other group of animal species in addition to global restocking efforts monitoring of populations and habitat and various other conservation efforts by national and state resource agencies as applicable to their respective countries several conservation organizations have been formed to assist in preservation of sturgeons around world on a global scale one such organization is world sturgeon conservation society wscs whose primary objectives include fostering conservation of sturgeon species and restoration of sturgeon stocks world wide and supporting information exchange among all persons interested in sturgeons north american sturgeon and paddlefish society and gesellschaft zur des e v are wscs affiliates wscs has been instrumental in organizing global conferences where scientists and researchers can exchange information and address various conservation challenges that threaten future of sturgeons conservation efforts at grass roots level are also instrumental in helping to preserve sturgeon populations such as sturgeon for
