defendants became increasingly reliant on barristers to prevent their conviction braby 2010 p 47 his first case was actually as a prosecutor on 14 january 1784 barely two months after he was called to bar he prosecuted john henry aikles for obtaining a bill of exchange under false pretences braby 2010 p 48 it was alleged that aikles had promised to pay samuel edwards ps100 and a small commission for a ps100 bill of exchange and when he took bill failed to hand over money despite aikles s counsel claiming according to edward foss that this was no felony and being represented by two of most prestigious criminal barristers of day garrow convinced both judge and jury that aikles was guilty braby 2010 p 49 garrow later defended aikles in september 1785 securing his release due to ill health braby 2010 p 50 during his early years as a practising barrister garrow was particularly noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross examination when james wingrove was charged with theft and violence in course of a highway robbery in 1784 garrow s cross examination of william grove who acted as a witness and person charging wingrove got him to admit that he was himself in an attempt to get a reward and that wingrove had not robbed two injured parties braby 2010 p 51 garrow showed a dislike of most thief takers of which grove was one although he did not treat bow street runners and other professionals with contempt his dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft they were charged with assaulting john troughton putting him in fear of his life and stealing his hat issue was whether assault put him in fear of his life or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward which could not be claimed for simple theft braby 2010 p 54 garrow established that troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat despite his attempts to claim that defendants knocked it off him and after four witnesses gave character evidence defendants were found not guilty braby 2010 p 55 garrow made much use of jury nullification to limit punishment for his convicted clients in a time when many crimes carried death penalty so called bloody code in 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings meaning a conviction would result in death penalty garrow convinced jury to convict women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans therefore changing sentence to twelve months of hard labour braby 2010 p 60 prosecution right thumb thomas erskine whom garrow faced in treason trials of late 18th century alt a portrait of a young

working criminal trials at old bailey and outside london as both defence counsel and prosecutor by 1799 a book recorded that number of cases he had at court of king s bench is exceeded by none but mr thomas erskine s and that he has long monopolized chief business on home circuit no man is heard with more attention by court no man gains more upon a jury or better pleases a common auditor braby 2010 p 79 in february 1793 he was appointed a king s counsel to help prosecute those accused of treason and sedition less than ten years after his call to bar richards 1832 p 254 and his appointment was met with a mixed response from media briton described garrow and other five appointments as best talent of age while morning chronicle was bitter due to garrow s previous status as a friend of official opposition whigs as opposed to tory government braby 2010 p 80 as french revolution and its perceived threat to united kingdom gained momentum so did garrow s career he prosecuted in most of state trials and as he increased in experience was left to manage many of them himself coming up against leading barristers such as thomas erskine james and james scarlett in may 1794 government suspended habeas corpus in 1795 outlawed all public meetings in 1797 outlawed secret organisations and in 1799 outlawed all societies interested in reforming way united kingdom was run government planned a series of 800 arrests with 300 execution warrants for high treason made out and signed making a particular effort to prosecute thomas hardy and john horne tooke braby 2010 p 81 hardy was first to be tried with prosecution arguing that he sought a revolution in england similar to that in france with garrow prosecuting and erskine defending trial lasted eight days instead of normal one and foreman of jury was so tense that he delivered verdict of not guilty in a whisper and then immediately fainted braby 2010 p 82 tooke was then prosecuted again jury found him not guilty with result that other 800 trials were abandoned braby 2010 p 83 during period when garrow worked as a barrister sugar planters of west indies held large amounts of power in parliament allowing them to maintain a monopoly on marketing of sugar in england that brought great profits this industry was largely profitable due to use of slave labour to which garrow had long been opposed when sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business he replied that if your committee would give me their whole incomes and all their estates i would not be seen as advocate of practices which i abhor and a system which i detest braby 2010 p 85 in 1806 thomas picton governor of trinidad was charged with a single count of causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted on a young free mulatto girl he was brought before court of king s bench under lord ellenborough court records run to 367 pages and garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel indeed his opening speech on 24 february 1806 is considered by braby to be one of his best case centred on whether or not spanish law which allowed torture was still in effect at time of incident jury eventually decided that it was not and ellenborough found picton guilty picton s counsel requested a retrial which was granted jury in second trial eventually decided that picton was innocent braby 2010 p 90 thanks to garrow s political connections he was made first solicitor general and then attorney general for prince of wales in 1806 and 1807 he was recommended by erskine who said in a letter to prince that he knows more of real justice and policy of everything connected with criminal law than any man i am acquainted with in 1812 he prosecuted leigh hunt for seditious libel against prince regent thanks to his work hunt was found guilty reversing judgment of an 1811 trial in which he had been acquitted braby 2010 p 113 political career 160px thumb left sir samuel romilly garrow s frequent opponent in parliament alt an older gentleman with short greying hair although his eyebrows remain black he is wearing a black jacket with a small white cravat and is sat in front of some dark red paper or cloth since 1789 press had been speculating that garrow a whig would enter parliament however he was first elected in 1805 for gatton this was a rotten borough with garrow appointed to serve interests of his patron after his entry into politics garrow at first paid little attention not making his maiden speech until 22 april 1806 when he opposed a charge for impeachment of marquess wellesley he spoke again on 18 june 1806 on a legal technicality and after that did not intervene for another six years braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in parliament and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business braby 2010 p 94 in june 1812 he was appointed solicitor general for england and wales receiving customary knighthood richards 1832 p 255 and in may 1813 he was appointed attorney general attorney general was senior crown prosecutor during a time when prince regent feared liberal changes to criminal law and parliamentary structure garrow as a mere creature of regent could be trusted to oppose this rather than progressive defensive work undertaken in his early career this period was one of conservative aggression against reformers braby 2010 p 95 garrow ran particularly foul of sir samuel romilly who was one of those looking to reform a penal code many claimed was not working on 5 april 1813 romilly s bill on attainder of treason and felony came before parliament its intent was to remove corruption of blood from cases involving treason and felony garrow then solicitor general declared that bill would remove one of safeguards of british constitution bill eventually failed and corruption of blood was not removed from english law until forfeiture act 1870 braby 2010 p 100 he also served as chief justice of chester from 1814 to 1817 garrow also

as a member of parliament in 1817 when he was appointed one of barons of exchequer braby 2010 p 110 judicial career garrow s first judicial appointment came in 1814 when he was made chief justice of chester this was opposed by sir samuel romilly who argued that positions of chief justice and attorney general were incompatible saying to appoint a gentleman holding a lucrative office at sole pleasure of crown to a high judicial situation was extremely inconsistent with that independence of judicial character which it was so important to preserve inviolate braby 2010 p 101 on 6 may 1817 garrow was made a baron of exchequer and serjeant at law succeeding richard richards foss 1865 p 82 and resigning his seat in parliament and his position as attorney general he was not a particularly distinguished judge in exchequer mainly due to a lack of knowledge of finer points of law braby 2010 p 125 practising on assize circuits however was a different matter dealing with his more familiar criminal law rather than commercial law of exchequer garrow performed far better braby indicates that he regularly amazed both barristers and defendants with his knowledge of intricacies of crime braby 2010 p 135 garrow retired on 22 february 1832 replaced by john gurney foss 1865 p 86 and was made a privy councillor on retirement as a measure of government s respect for him gentleman s

garrow was born on 18 june 1784 garrow and dore finally married on 17 march 1793 braby 2010 p 152 dore was noted as particularly elegant and was actively involved in local matters in ramsgate where

parish church braby hostettler 2010 pp 23 207 218 edward foss described him as one of most successful advocates of his day foss 1870 p 289 something linked more to his extraordinary talent at cross examination than his knowledge of law may 2003 p 41 garrow once told a witness before a case that you know a particular fact and wish to conceal it i ll get it out of you polson 1840 p 180 lord brougham who regularly opposed him in court wrote that no description can give reader an adequate idea of this eminent practitioner s powers in thus dealing with a witness may 2003 p 42 lemmings notes garrow as not only a formidable advocate but also first lawyer to establish a reputation as a defence barrister lemmings 2004 p 723 garrow was largely forgotten although robert louis stevenson and his wife discovered his work a generation later when reading transcripts of old bailey cases there was little academic work on him until late 20th century in 1991 john beattie published garrow for defence in history today followed by scales of justice defence counsel and english criminal law in eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in law and history review allyson may who did her doctoral study under beattie further extended analysis of garrow s work with bar and old bailey 1750 1850 published in 2003 braby 2010 p ix garrow s work was cited in court as recently as 1982 when supreme court of canada quoted a passage from trial of william davidson and richard for high treason where garrow instructed jury as to how to interpret testimony in v queen in 1982 in 2006 he was again quoted when irish court of criminal appeal used same work in their review of 1982 conviction of brian meehan for murder of veronica guerin braby 2010 p 136 in 2009 bbc one broadcast garrow s law a four part fictionalised drama of garrow s beginnings at old bailey starring andrew buchan as garrow a second series again of four parts was aired in late 2010 and third and final four part series was broadcast in november and december 2011 impact adversarial system it is indisputable that garrow massively affected modern adversarial court system used in several western nations and rules of evidence although he was barely aware of it prior to garrow s time defendants in felony cases were not allowed to have defence counsel as a result every defendant for arson rape robbery murder and most forms of theft was forced to defend themselves braby 2010 p 28 first step away from this was with treason act 1695 for regulating trials in cases of treason which allowed treason defendants right to a counsel garrow s practice was a further step forward with his aggressive and forthright style of cross examination he promoted a more committed defence of clients and indirectly reformed process of advocacy in 18th century braby 2010 p 36 his area of advocacy he was counsel for defence in 83 of his cases and style is considered key by beattie in establishing new school of advocacy beattie 1991 p 238 his aggressive style in defence set a new style for advocates to follow that assisted in counteracting a legal system biased against defendant while he was not sole cause of this reform his position at head of bar meant that he served as a highly visible example for new barristers to take after beattie 1991 p 239 in some ways garrow was far ahead of his time he coined phrase innocent until proven guilty in 1791 moore 1997 p 37 although jury refused to accept this principle and it was not confirmed by courts until much later hostettler 2008 p 227 evidence garrow also influenced rules of evidence which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career his insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to best evidence rule hostettler 2008 pp 116 2010 p 32 he was crucial in insisting on autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence in one case openly arguing with trial judge to insist that advocates have independence in submitting it langbein 1996 p 1200 during this period use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic while medical experts were regularly called at old bailey landsman 1998 p 448 use of partisan experts was resisted and at beginning experts were given limited authority landsman 1998 p 449 while this increased towards end of 17th century in line with judges increasing desire for certainty and facts landsman 1998 p 447 garrow is noted as an excellent example of attitude lawyers took when cross examining such witnesses when defending robert clark accused of killing john delew by kicking him in stomach garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross examination and medical knowledge to get prosecution s medical expert to admit that he could not prove how delew had died landsman 1998 p 478 garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively interrogate such witnesses strengthening their own arguments when it was their expert or demolishing those of others when it was an expert
