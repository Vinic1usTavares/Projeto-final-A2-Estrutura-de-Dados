negros fruit dove ptilinopus arcanus is a species of bird in pigeon and dove family columbidae it is endemic to island of negros in philippines this fruit dove is known from a single female specimen collected from slopes of mount kanlaon in northern part of island while it was found at a high elevation it is suspected that species originally lived in lowland dipterocarp forests and was driven to higher elevations by habitat destruction while some have suggested that specimen is either a runt or a hybrid instead of a valid species this is not widely accepted female negros fruit dove was a small fruit dove with vivid dark green plumage and an ashy grey forehead it had a distinctive ring of bare yellow skin around its eye and yellow fringes to some of its feathers gave it appearance of having a yellow wingbar when perched throat was white while undertail and vent were yellow original specimen was shot along with a bird suspected to be its mate from a fruiting tree nothing else is known about its behavior species has not been definitively reported since its original discovery in 1953 and as several searches of mount kanlaon and surrounding forests have not discovered any sign of bird many believe that it may be extinct however a local hunter from southern negros claimed to have shot it nineties and discovery of many species formerly thought endemic to negros on nearby island of panay have given some hope that species may persist as such it is currently listed as critically endangered by iucn any surviving population would be very small likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals and would be threatened by habitat destruction and hunting taxonomy negros fruit dove was described in 1955 as ptilinopus arcanus by sidney dillon ripley and rabor on basis of a single female specimen collected by rabor on may 1 1953 this specimen collected near pula on slopes of mount kanlaon in philippines was shot along with a second bird presumed to be its mate which was lost in undergrowth holotype is preserved as a skin by yale university s peabody museum of natural history generic name ptilinopus comes from ancient greek words ptilon feather and pous foot specific name arcanus comes from latin word arcanus secret some authors have suggested that specimen was either a runt of either yellow breasted fruit dove or a treron pigeon or a hybrid instead of a unique species however these views are generally considered invalid due in part to distinctiveness of specimen particularly in bare skin around eye and no proper evidence has suggested that negros fruit dove is an invalid species it is uncertain where dove should be placed within genus ptilinopus as male s plumage a key feature used in organizing ptilinopus doves is unknown it has been suggested that negros fruit dove is either most closely related to black naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of philippines by genus that has left no surviving close relatives it has no known subspecies and is also known as ripley s fruit dove description negros fruit dove is a small short tailed fruit dove only appearance of adult female is known as presumed male specimen was lost in undergrowth female is a vivid dark green overall with an ash grey forehead above an extensive ring of bare yellow skin that surrounds eye greater coverts and tertial feathers have broad yellow fringes that create a narrow if conspicuous wingbar when wing is folded throat is white while vent and undertail coverts are yellow bill was black and feet were a dull purplish red fruit dove is long distribution and habitat negros fruit dove is believed to be endemic to island of negros in central part of philippines however some hope exists that bird may persist undetected on a nearby island only known birds were collected from a forest at edge of a clearing on mount kanlaon at an elevation of about forest was noted as being halfway between genuine lowland dipterocarp forest type and real mid mountain forest type it is suspected that species preferred habitat at a lower altitude and that collected pair may have been driven to higher elevations by deforestation in lowlands ecology and behavior sole sighting of negros fruit dove involved a pair of birds seen eating at a fruiting tree no other information is known about its behavior status thumb left alt a volcano rises in distance beyond a field mount kanlaon species has not been recorded since original pair of negros fruit doves were shot in may 1953 at mt kanlaon however a local hunter in southern negros claimed to have shot it in nineties which has given hope that species may still exist and as such iucn lists negros fruit dove as critically endangered as any surviving population is likely to number fewer than 50 birds if species still exists it is likely that habitat destruction for agriculture timber and charcoal burning and hunting a common problem for all other pigeons on negros are major threats as numerous collectors had visited negros prior to 1953 and did not record species it is likely that it was already very rare by time of its discovery it is suspected that negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species but destruction of forests in northern negros forced dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction today no forest exists in northern negros at an elevation lower than and several searches in 1990s of mount kanlaon and surrounding area failed to discover any sign of species continued existence ornithological fieldwork has discovered that nearby island of panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to negros including negros bleeding heart this discovery and presence of unexplored lowland forests on panay give hope that negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island other than depiction of bird on a philippine environmental education poster in 1990s no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population
