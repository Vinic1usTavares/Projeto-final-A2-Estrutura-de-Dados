in 665 670 and ultimately first governor of iraq and virtual viceroy of eastern caliphate between 670 and his death ziyad s parentage is obscure but he was raised among banu thaqif in ta if and arrived with his adoptive tribesmen in basra upon its foundation in 636 as muslim arabs springboard for conquest of sasanian empire he was initially employed by city s first governor utba ibn ghazwan al mazini and was kept on as a scribe or secretary by his successors caliph ali appointed ziyad to fars to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to ali s caliphate after latter s assassination in 661 and subsequent rule of ali s enemy mu awiya i latter ultimately overcame ziyad s opposition formally recognized him as his own paternal half brother and appointed him governor of basra ziyad s inaugural speech in which he announced his carrot and stick policies to city s turbulent population is celebrated in arab history for its eloquence after death of kufa s governor ziyad s mentor al mughira ibn shu ba mu awiya made ziyad first governor of a unified iraqi province he administratively reorganized garrison cities and minted sasanian style silver dirhams in his own name he firmly established arab power and recommenced conquests in caliphate s easternmost province of khurasan by relocating there 50 000 arab soldiers and their families from iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against tukharistan balkh and quhistan though mass resettlement improved iraq s economic and political conditions by siphoning off arab tribal soldiers from overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils move had major ramifications for caliphate as descendants of these khurasani arab troops formed army that toppled umayyads in 750 ziyad died near kufa in 673 but his sons ubayd allah abd al rahman salm abbad and yazid went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of iraq khurasan and sijistan ziyad was subject of early arabic biographies and is remembered in arab history as one of four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator his administration in iraq served as a model for his successors origins ziyad was likely born in ta if in 622 or 623 24 his precise parentage is obscure hence his frequent name in sources as ziyad ibn abihi ziyad son of his father he was illegitimate son of a certain sumayya his father being unknown origins of sumayya are also obscure 9th century historians al baladhuri and awana ibn al hakam both relate that she had been a slave living in though former asserts she belonged to a member of banu a branch of arab tribe of banu bakr and latter states she belonged to a persian dehqan landowning magnate in narrative of al baladhuri sumayya s owner embarked on hajj pilgrimage to mecca seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in ta if by al harith ibn kalada a physician from thaqif clan resident in city as a reward for his services ibn kalada was gifted sumayya in awana s narrative sumayya was given to ibn kalada by persian dehqan after he treated him in any case she was ultimately given to ubayd a greek or syrian slave belonging to ibn kalada s wife though ziyad alludes to his persian origin in a poem his family claimed that sumayya was not a slave but daughter of a certain al a war from zayd clan of arab tribe of banu tamim early career in basra thumb upright 1 3 a creek in basra in early 20th century ziyad began his career in basra in 636 and served as its governor between 665 and his death in 673 during reign of caliph abu bakr ziyad embraced islam which opened world to him according to historian julius wellhausen he later became one of first settlers of arab garrison town of basra before city s founding in 638 muslim troops fighting on iraqi front used as their military camp ruined persian village on site ziyad arrived there with sons of ibn kalada nafi and abu bakra nufay latter s family gained preeminence in city having acquired large landholdings there abu bakra s brother in law utba ibn ghazwan al mazini had established initial camp at basra in 635 and was founder and first governor of city administrative skills of ziyad became apparent from time of his adolescence and utba charged him with minor tasks in basran diwan bureaucracy during reign of caliph umar in 635 utba tasked him with distributing to arab troops war spoils from capture of al a town immediately east of basra according to modern historian isaac hasson ziyad distinguished himself as an intelligent and open minded secretary who was devoted to his master and to public service he showed an unusual aptitude for accounting and had an excellent command of epistolary art his skills and his assignment by basra s military governor abu musa al ash ari as his acting replacement while he was on a military campaign gained attention of caliph umar he brought ziyad to medina center of nascent muslim state where he further tested his skills ziyad s performance earned him a reward of 1 000 silver dirhams by umar which he used to purchase freedom of his mother or his stepfather ubayd soon after his return to basra ziyad was made utba s katib scribe or secretary after utba s death ziyad continued his service as katib under his successors abu musa al ash ari and al mughira ibn shu ba a member of thaqif who became ziyad s mentor when al mughira was recalled by umar to medina in 638 due to charges of adultery by three accusers including abu bakra nufay and a certain ibn ma bad al both of whom were ziyad s maternal half brothers ziyad was also recalled to give his own testimony his statement was partial toward al mughira and as a result charges were dismissed and accusers were flogged during reign of caliph uthman ziyad served caliph s appointee to basra abd allah ibn amir uthman s successor ali appointed abd allah ibn abbas governor of basra and entrusted ziyad with collection of province s kharaj land tax and supervision of treasury according to hasson ali s appreciation of ziyad s talents were so great that he mandated ibn abbas heed ziyad s counsel when ibn abbas left basra in 657 to accompany ali at battle of siffin against governor of syria mu awiya ibn abi sufyan he left ziyad as his acting governor during this period he stamped out an uprising by banu tamim a major military tribal faction in city with critical assistance from another basran faction azd after ali returned from siffin his appointee to district of fars sahl ibn was ousted by its inhabitants after which he dispatched ziyad people of fars were satisfied with ziyad s leadership and he was able to collect district s kharaj he remained in fars through remainder of ali s rule which ended with caliph s assassination in 661 and foundation of umayyad caliphate under mu awiya afterward he remained headquartered in a fortress in vicinity of istakhr of ali s appointees he held out longest from recognizing mu awiya s caliphate mu awiya s agent ibn abi pressured ziyad by capturing and threatening to kill three of his sons in basra ziyad s half brother abu bakra interceded with mu awiya and ziyad s sons were released he finally surrendered to mu awiya s rule in 662 63 after intercession of al mughira who mu awiya had appointed governor of kufa other main arab garrison town of iraq in deal reached revenues from fars owed to caliphal treasury were split between ziyad and al mughira which mu awiya ignored ziyad moved to kufa and maintained intimate ties with al mughira and his family governor of basra thumb upright 1 3 map of medieval basra showing ziyad s divisions of city into fifths along arab tribal factional lines abd al qays tamim ahl al aliya bakr and azd mu awiya formally recognized ziyad as a son of his father abu sufyan motion was initiated when ziyad sought clarification from caliph about rumors of abu sufyan s biological paternity according to wellhausen mu awiya summoned ziyad to damascus and recognized him as his paternal half brother so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family decision was seen as scandalous by umayyad ruling family mu awiya s son yazid and members from other branches of clan namely extended family of marwan ibn al hakam in medina and abd allah ibn amir governor of basra protested or threatened action against decision ibn amir and were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes yazid s relations with ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about event were spread by marwan s brother abd al rahman muslim scholars generally viewed episode as one of mu awiya s most disreputable actions realizing that ziyad had both abilities and all important local connections to be his right hand man in basra mu awiya appointed him governor of province according to historian hugh n kennedy he entered office in june or july 665 issuing an inaugural carrot and stick speech to basra s restless population according to hasson it was considered a masterpiece of eloquence wellhausen describes it as celebrated and one which was called a speech without a preface because it skipped traditional introductions praising god and blessing islamic prophet muhammad speech is translated as follows ye are putting relationship before religion ye are excusing and sheltering your criminals and tearing down protecting laws sanctified by islam beware of prowling by night i will kill every one who is found at night in streets beware of arbitrary summons of relationship i will cut out tongue of every one who raises cry whoever pushes anyone into water whoever sets fire to another s house whoever breaks into a house whoever opens a grave him will i punish for it i make every family responsible for those belonging to it hatred towards myself i do not punish but only crime many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of my presence and many who are building their hopes upon it will be i rule you with authority of god and care for your maintenance out of wealth of god from you i demand obedience and ye can demand from me justice in whatsoever i fall short three things there are in which i shall not be lacking at any time i shall be ready to listen to anyone i shall pay you your pension at proper time and i shall not send you to war too far away or keep you in field overlong do not let yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me it would go ill with you if ye did many heads do i see tottering let each man see to it that his own remains on his shoulders a number of punitive measures along lines of those cited in his speech were taken by ziyad at start of his term and largely gained for him basrans respect he established unprecedented levels of security in city its iranian dependencies to east i e fars and kerman and arabian desert to south kharijites of basra many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics submitted to his authority under ziyad basra began to take shape as a proper islamic city his rule saw crude mud bricks of city s homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a congregational mosque and residential palace in words of historian charles ziyad to a certain degree may be considered as artisan of town s prosperity his effective rule cemented mu awiya s confidence in him in same year that ziyad was appointed to basra province of bahrayn eastern arabia and its dependency yamama central arabia were attached to ziyad s governorship viceroy of iraq and east after death of al mughira in 670 kufa and its dependencies were attached to ziyad s governorship making him practical viceroy over iraq and eastern half of caliphate he was first to serve as dual governor of kufa and basra and divided his residence between two towns in winter he stayed in basra and left amr ibn as his deputy in kufa while he resided in kufa in summer leaving samura ibn as his deputy in basra his strong grip in kufa marked a shift from al mughira s hands off approach a source of disturbance for him in kufa was agitation of alids partisans of caliph ali led by hujr ibn adi al kindi who disapproved of umayyad rule and led first open calls for caliphate to be held by ali s progeny though al mughira tolerated hujr ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent he succeeded in turning most of hujr s supporters among kufan troops against him in 671 he had hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to damascus for punishment where six including hujr were executed in for their refusal to renounce support for alids one of men abd al rahman ibn hassan al who was spared by mu awiya later insulted caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn ali and was sent back to ziyad who had him buried alive as punishment to end chaos in amsar garrisons of basra and kufa ziyad administratively reformed two towns from reign of caliph umar their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for distribution of military stipends there were seven such tribal groups in kufa and basra and at head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to government gradually this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent there was no control on arab immigration into amsar resulting in overpopulation and in turn increased competition over fewer resources ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader which resulted in kufa s reorganization into quarters and basra into fifths this measure enabled easier control of two towns inhabitants ziyad undertook further reforms in kufa and basra including timely payment of stipends embarking on agricultural development schemes including canal digging and minting sasanian style dirhams that bore his name as ziyad ibn abi sufyan consolidation of khurasan thumb upright 1 5 map of early medieval central asia with khurasan where ziyad settled 50 000 arab troops and their families and balkh and tukharistan where ziyad s general led expeditions ziyad s authority extended to khurasan and sijistan far eastern regions of caliphate which were considered dependencies of basra garrison arab conquests of these areas in 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish caliphate s power moreover political instability of final years of uthman s caliphate and first muslim civil war saw local revolts which further weakened arab authority in 655 sasanian prince peroz iii backed by army of tukharistan attempted to reassert persian power under previous caliphs vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under leadership of arab tribal chiefs governance was largely left to local princes fearing a persian resurgence which a fragmentary division of khurasan could afford ziyad centralized administration of province in small arab garrison at merv to relieve basra s fiscal pressures ziyad recommenced muslim conquests in central asia he organized arab military presence in khurasan in 667 he dispatched an army to region under his lieutenant general al hakam ibn amr al latter conquered lower tukharistan and and temporarily crossed oxus river into transoxiana forcing peroz to withdraw into tang china meanwhile ziyad s removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off payrolls he dispatched 50 000 arab soldiers and their families from basra and kufa to permanently settle in merv oasis of khurasan resettlement of these troops may have been a means to defuse possibly dangerous developments relating to arab tribal influx in two garrison towns according to historian gerald hawting as a result merv oasis became home to largest concentration of muslims outside of fertile crescent al hakam s successor ghalib ibn abd allah al laythi was less successful in subduing tukharistan and ziyad sent another of his lieutenants rabi ibn ziyad al to stamp out revolts in conquered areas in 670 71 rabi proceeded to secure capitulation of balkh whose inhabitants had revolted against arab rule in a treaty and then destroyed army of hepthalite princes in quhistan in 673 rabi s son abd allah extended arab rule to western banks of oxus and established tributary agreements with fortress towns of amul and zamm to solidify territorial gains and supply manpower for further conquests ziyad intended for arab troops initially concentrated in merv oasis to colonize other parts of khurasan they were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under ziyad s successors legacy and assessment ziyad died in village of al near kufa on 23 august 673 a year after his death mu awiya appointed ziyad s son ubayd allah as governor of khurasan and then basra under mu awiya s son and successor caliph yazid i governorship of kufa was also handed to ubayd allah ziyad s sons abd al rahman and salm served successively as governors of khurasan in 678 680 and 680 683 84 and two other sons abbad and yazid served successively as governors of sijistan in 673 680 81 and 680 81 thaqif which had maintained close ties with umayyads since pre islamic era and played an integral role in muslim conquest of iraq provided umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in iraq including al mughira ziyad ubayd allah and al hajjaj ibn yusuf and muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than caliphs on whose behalf they ruled along with his mentor al mughira ziyad and his family were part of what some must have seen as a thaqafi mafia controlling iraq and east according to kennedy among most gifted governors of umayyad era ziyad had a good understanding of his task as governor and had a great influence on his successors concerning conception of duties of rulers according to hasson according to kennedy ziyad s settlement of iraqi arab troops in khurasan had extremely important consequences for islamic history as descendants of those settlers who were known as ahl khurasan ultimately destroyed umayyad caliphate in 750 execution of hujr and his six partisans all of whom had been prominent men in their own right also led to deep seated resentment among their kufan kinsmen incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro alid risings death of hujr represented first political execution in islamic history and he and his companions are viewed as martyrs by shia muslims ziyad was alleged to have ordered cruel acts against some alid partisans including crucifixions interest in ziyad s biography emerged early on among traditional muslim historians with works written about him by abu d 774 hisham ibn al kalbi d 819 and abd al aziz ibn yahya al d 943 he is considered a highly skilled orator among arabs with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in islamic literature and arabic rhetoric polemics and histories he is counted alongside mu awiya al mughira and amr ibn al as conqueror and governor of egypt as one of four i e among arab statesmen of his era according to medieval syrian historian ibn asakir d 1176 ziyad had expert knowledge of qur an its tenets and islamic jurisprudence a medieval basran historian muhammad ibn imran al abdi related that ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to hadiths about umar and proclaimed about them this is truth we hear this is sunna ziyad is credited by a number of sources for transmitting sayings by islamic prophet muhammad through umar as original
