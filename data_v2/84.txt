yellow tailed black cockatoo calyptorhynchus funereus is a large cockatoo native to south east of australia measuring in length it has a short crest on top of its head its plumage is mostly brownish black and it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band body feathers are edged with yellow giving a scalloped appearance adult male has a black beak and pinkish red eye rings and female has a bone coloured beak and grey eye rings in flight yellow tailed black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly with a peculiar heavy fluid motion their loud wailing calls carry for long distances yellow tailed black cockatoo is found in forested regions from south and central eastern queensland to southeastern south australia including a very small population persisting in eyre peninsula two subspecies are recognised although tasmanian and southern mainland populations of southern subspecies xanthanotus may be distinct enough from each other to bring total to three birds of subspecies funereus queensland to eastern victoria have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall while those of xanthanotus western victoria south australia and tasmania have more prominent scalloping unlike other cockatoos a large proportion of yellow tailed black cockatoo s diet is made up of wood boring grubs they also eat seeds they nest in hollows high in trees with fairly large diameters generally eucalyptus although they remain common throughout much of their range fragmentation of habitat and loss of large trees suitable for nesting has caused population decline in victoria and south australia in some places yellow tailed black cockatoos appear to have partially adapted to recent human alteration of landscape and they can often be seen in parts of urban canberra sydney adelaide and melbourne species is not commonly seen in aviculture especially outside australia like most parrots it is protected by cites an international agreement that makes trade export and import of listed wild caught species illegal taxonomy and naming right thumb a pair flying in victoria australia yellow tailed black cockatoo was first described in 1794 by english naturalist george shaw as psittacus funereus its specific name funereus relating to its dark and sombre plumage as if dressed for a funeral higgins p 66 french zoologist anselme gaetan desmarest reclassified it in new genus calyptorhynchus in 1826 genus name is derived from greek words hidden and rugkhos rhynchos beak ornithologist john gould knew bird as funereal cockatoo yellow tailed black cockatoo has been designated official name by international ornithologists union ioc other common names used include yellow eared black cockatoo and wy la was an aboriginal term from hunter region of new south wales while dharawal name from illawarra region is scientist and cockatoo authority matt cameron has proposed dropping black and shortening name to yellow tailed cockatoo explaining that shorter names are more widely accepted cameron p 7 within genus yellow tailed and two western australian white tailed species short billed and long billed black cockatoos form subgenus zanda red tailed and glossy black cockatoos form other subgenus calyptorhynchus two groups are distinguished by their juvenile food begging calls and degree of sexual dimorphism males and females of latter group have markedly different plumage whereas those of former have similar plumage three species of subgenus zanda have been variously considered as two then as a single species for many years in a 1979 paper australian ornithologist denis saunders highlighted similarity between short billed and southern race xanthanotus of yellow tailed and treated them as a single species with long billed as a distinct species he proposed that western australia had been colonised on two separate occasions once by a common ancestor of all three forms which became long billed black cockatoo and later by what has become short billed black cockatoo however an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed two western australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to yellow tailed and consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species within species two subspecies are recognised c f funereus nominate form is known as eastern yellow tailed black cockatoo it is found from berserker range in central queensland south through new south wales and into eastern victoria it is distinguished by its overall larger size longer tail and wings and larger bill and claws c f xanthanotus known as southern yellow tailed black cockatoo is found in western victoria southeastern south australia islands of bass strait and tasmania gould described it in 1838 and later changed his spelling to however first name was recognised as taking precedence under iczn naming rules and its spelling preserved saunders reported in 1979 that male birds from tasmania had wider bills than their mainland relatives and that tasmanian female birds were larger than males however this observation has yet to be replicated and most authorities only recognise two subspecies if a third subspecies is recognised southern mainland subspecies would be named having been named so by gregory mathews in 1912 and name xanthanotus originally applied to a tasmanian specimen would be restricted to tasmanian population higgins p 76 description thumb upright right a male stripping bark from a tree in swifts creek victoria australia alt a large black cockatoo partly hidden behind a small tree

than xanthanotus male funereus birds weigh on average around and females weigh about birds of xanthanotus race on mainland average heavier than tasmanian birds males on mainland weigh on average around 630 g and females while those on tasmania average 583 and respectively both mainland and tasmanian birds of xanthanotus race average about in tail length plumage is a more solid brown black in eastern subspecies while southern race has more pronounced yellow scalloping on underparts male yellow tailed black cockatoo has a black bill a dull yellow patch behind each eye and pinkish or reddish eye rings female has grey eye rings a horn coloured bill and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek patches immature birds have duller plumage overall a horn coloured bill and grey eye rings

elongated bill has a pointed maxilla upper beak suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks cameron p 65 records of timing of eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age higgins p 75 australian farmer and amateur ornithologist john courtney proposed that similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds he also observed eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males moulting appears to take place in stages over course of a year and is poorly understood yellow tailed black cockatoo is distinguished from other dark plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings and its contact call parts of its range overlap with ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding red tailed cockatoo and glossy black cockatoo crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance however crows have shorter tails a quicker wing beat and different calls an all yellow bird lacking black pigment was recorded in wauchope new south wales in december 1996 and it remained part of local group of cockatoos for four years birds with part

gympie in south and central eastern queensland south through new south wales where it occurs along great dividing range and to coast and into and across most of victoria bar northern and northwestern corner to coorong and mount lofty ranges in southeastern south australia a tiny population numbering 30 to 40 birds inhabits eyre peninsula there they are found in sugar gum eucalyptus woodland in lower peninsula and migrate to mallee areas in northern peninsula after breeding cameron p 19 there is evidence that birds on new south wales south coast move from elevated areas to lower lying areas towards coast in winter they are generally common or locally very common in a wide range of habits although they tend to be locally rare at limits of their range their breeding range is restricted to areas with large old trees birds may be found in a variety of habitats including grassy woodland riparian forest heathland subalpine areas pine plantations and occasionally in urban areas as long as there is a plentiful food supply cameron p 76 they have also spread to parts of suburban sydney particularly on or near golf courses pine plantations and parks higgins p 68 such as centennial park in eastern suburbs it is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere in urban melbourne they have been recorded at yarra bend park black saturday bushfires of 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat for them to have been sighted in other parts of urban areas of melbourne as well ecology and behaviour upright right thumb a family flying overhead in tasmania alt three black coloured birds flying high overhead they have long square tipped tails yellow tailed black cockatoos are diurnal raucous and noisy and are often heard before being seen they make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs or trios comprising a pair and their young or small groups forshaw 2002 p 63 outside of breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained they are generally wary birds although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas they generally keep to trees only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or banksia cones or to drink flight is fluid and has been described as lazy with deep slow wingbeats tall eucalypts that are emergent over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites it is here that cockatoos rest for night and also rest to shelter from heat of day they often socialise before dusk engaging in preening feeding young and flying acrobatically flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather usual call is a high pitched wailing contact call kee ow kee ow kee ow made while flying or roosting higgins p 72 and can be heard from afar birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call they also make a soft

tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up his crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage softly growling he approaches female and bows to her three or four times his eye ring may also flush a deeper pink nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees generally eucalypts which may be living or dead isolated trees are generally chosen so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered same tree may be used for many years a 1994 study of nesting sites in eucalyptus regnans forest in strzelecki ranges in eastern victoria found average age of trees used for hollows by yellow tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years authors noted that proposed 80 150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on numbers of suitable trees hollows can be deep and wide with a base of woodchips a chance felling of a eucalypt known to have been used as a nesting tree near scottsdale in northeastern tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made yielding a hollow measuring high by wide at mouth and at least deep in a tree which measured in diameter below hollow both male and female prepare hollow for breeding which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from inside hollow to prepare bedding for eggs gum leaves are occasionally added as well clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have occasional lime nodule first egg averages around 47 or 48 mm long and 37 mm in diameter 2 x 1 4 in second egg is around 2 mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later female incubates eggs alone and begins after completion of laying she enters hollow feet first and is visited by male who brings food two to four times a day later both parents help to raise chicks second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy lendon p 59 information on breeding of birds in wild is lacking however incubation period in captivity is 28 31 days cameron p 140 newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by time of fledging higgins p 74 chicks fledge from nest three months after hatching and remain in company of their parents until next breeding season like other cockatoos this species is long lived a pair of yellow tailed black cockatoos at rotterdam zoo stopped breeding when they were 41 and 37 years of age but still showed signs of close bonding birds appear to reach sexual maturity between four and six years of age this is age range of breeding recorded in captivity higgins p 71 feeding right thumb female eating banksia integrifolia diet of yellow tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat cameron p 74 much of diet comprises seeds of native trees particularly she oaks allocasuarina and casuarina including a torulosa and a but also eucalyptus including e maculata flowers and e nitida seeds acacia including gum exudate and galls banksia including green seed pods and seeds of b serrata b integrifolia and b marginata and hakea species including h h rugosa h nodosa h sericea h and h dactyloides they are also partial to pine cones in plantations of introduced pinus radiata and to other introduced trees including cupressus torulosa betula pendula and buds of elm ulmus species higgins p 70 in eyre peninsula yellow

australia alt a black cockatoo perching on a branch high in a pine tree it is standing on its right leg and holding a pine cone in its left food near its beak to eat pine nuts in cone yellow tailed black cockatoo is very fond of larvae of tree boring beetles such as longhorn beetle and cossid moth xyleutes boisduvali birds seek them all year but especially in june and july when moth caterpillars are largest and they are accompanied by their just fledged young they search out holes and make exploratory bites looking for larvae if successful they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate larvae which have deeply tunneled into heartwood a yellow tailed black cockatoo was observed stripping pieces of bark off trunk of a dead leptospermum tree in acacia melanoxylon swamp near in northwestern tasmania it then scraped a layer of white material about 0 5 mm thick from inner surface with its beak this white layer turned out to be fungi and slime mould that grew in cambium of bark yellow tailed black cockatoos have been reported flocking to banksia cones ten days after bushfire as follicles open with pine trees they prefer green cones nipping them off at stem and holding in one foot then systematically lifting each segment and extracting seed a cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone they drink at various places from stock troughs to puddles and do so in early morning or late in afternoon insect larvae and fabaceae seeds are among food reported to have been fed to young parasites in 2004 a captive yellow tailed black cockatoo and two free living tawny podargus strigoides suffering neurological symptoms were shown to be hosting rat nematode they were first non mammalian hosts discovered for

australia alt closeup of face of a large black cockatoo with yellow cheek patch with its pale grey foot in foreground it is peering between bars of what appears to be part of a cage or aviary yellow tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood to extract moth larvae in places with these gum plantations population of larva of cossid moth xyleutes boisduvali grows which then leads to increased predation and hence tree damage by cockatoos furthermore plantations generally lack undergrowth which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees yellow tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of new south wales until 1940s for this reason yellow tailed black cockatoo is promoted by shoalhaven city council local government on nsw south coast as region s bird within jervis bay area birds can be seen feasting on many casuarina trees native to area although it is classified as least concern on iucn red list of threatened species and not listed nationally as threatened yellow tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in victoria and south australia this is due to habitat fragmentation and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows although birds have become more plentiful in vicinity of pine plantations higgins p 67 it is listed as vulnerable in south australia due to its decline in adelaide and mount lofty ranges and particularly perilous status of small isolated population on eyre peninsula which has declined sharply since european settlement probably from loss of suitable habitat a recovery program was commenced in 1998 efforts to increase population include fencing off remnants of native bushland planting food plants such as hakea rugosa monitoring breeding and raising chicks in captivity as a result population has increased from a low of 19 21 individuals in 1998 this species was seldom seen in captivity before late 1950s after which time a large number of wild caught birds entered australian market since then it has become more common but is still rarely seen outside australia captive yellow tailed black cockatoos require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health forshaw 2002 p 67 there is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos and low protein has been linked with production of eggs in captivity females in particular enjoy mealworms they can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots but do not handle disturbance while breeding forshaw 2002 p 68 as with other black cockatoos yellow tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in european zoos since australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959 but birds seized by government agencies in germany netherlands and united kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of european association of zoos and aquaria in 2000 there were pairs of yellow tailed black cockatoos in puerto de la cruz s loro parque zoo in spain and in rotterdam like most species of parrot yellow tailed black cockatoo is protected by convention on international trade in endangered species of wild
