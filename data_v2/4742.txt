voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution according to u s attorney s manual of individuals who come to secret service s

years of world war i and decisions handed down by courts in these early cases reflected intolerance for any words demonstrating even a vague spirit of disloyalty there was a relative moratorium on prosecutions under this statute until world war ii era number increased during turbulent vietnam war era they have tended to fall when country has not been directly embroiled in a national crisis situation number of reported threats rose from 2 400 in 1965 to 12 800 in 1969 according to ronald kessler president george w bush received about 3 000 threats a year while his successor barack obama received about four times that amount this figure has been disputed by secret service director mark sullivan who says that obama received about as many threats as previous two presidents according to u s attorneys manual media attention given to certain kinds of criminal activity seems to generate further criminal activity this is especially true concerning presidential threats which is well documented by data previously supplied by united states secret service for example in six month period following march 30 1981 attempt on life of president reagan average number of threats against protectees of secret service increased by over 150 percent from a similar period during prior year for this reason agency recommends considering use of sealed affidavits to keep news of threats from leaking to press incidents convictions under 18 u s c ss 871 have been sustained for declaring that president wilson ought to be killed it is a wonder some one has not done it already if i had an

king 25 edw iii c 2 1351 statute prohibiting threats against president was enacted by congress in 1917 maximum fine it allowed was 1 000 law was amended in 1994 to increase maximum fine to 250 000 among justifications that have been given for statute include arguments that threats against president have a tendency to stimulate opposition to national policies however wise even in most critical times to incite hostile and evil minded to take president s life to add to expense of president s safeguarding to be an affront to all loyal and right thinking persons to inflame their minds to provoke resentment disorder and violence and to disrupt presidential activity and movement rogers v united states justice marshall concurring plainly threats may be costly and dangerous to society in a variety of ways even when their authors have no intention whatever of carrying them out like a threat to blow up a building a serious threat on president s life is enormously disruptive and involves substantial cost to government a threat made with no present intention of carrying it out may still restrict president s movements and require a reaction from those charged with protecting president it has also been argued that such threats are akin to treason and can be rightly denounced as a crime against people as sovereign power congressman edwin y webb noted that is one reason why we want this statute in order to decrease possibility of actual assault by punishing threats to commit an assault a bad man can make a public threat and put somebody else up to committing a crime against chief executive and that is where harm comes man who makes threat is not himself very dangerous but he is liable to put devilment in mind of some poor fellow who does try to harm him 53 cong rec 78 1916 prisoners are sometimes charged for threatening president though they lack ability to personally carry out such a threat courts have upheld such convictions reasoning that actual ability to carry out threat is not an element of offense prisoners are able to make true threats as they could carry out threat by directing people on outside to harm president sometimes prisoners make such threats to manipulate system e g a case arose in which an inmate claiming to be institutionalized threatened president in order to stay in prison there was a case in which a state prisoner threatened president because he wanted to go to a federal institution penalties threatening president of united states is a felony under united states code title 18 section 871 offense is punishable by up to 5 years in prison a 250 000 maximum fine a 100 special assessment and 3 years of supervised release internet restrictions such as a prohibition on access to email have been imposed on offenders who made their threats by computer u s sentencing guidelines set a base offense level of 12 for sending threatening communication but when a threat to president is involved a 6 level official victim enhancement applies moreover an upward departure may be warranted due to potential disruption of governmental function further enhancements can apply if offender evidenced an intent to carry out threat 6 level enhancement made more than two threats 2 level enhancement caused substantial disruption of public governmental or business functions or services 4 level enhancement or created a substantial risk of inciting others to harm federal officials 2 level enhancement since each 6 level increase approximately doubles guidelines sentencing range it is not particularly rare for an offender who threatens president to receive a sentence at or near maximum especially if he she has a criminal history and or does not qualify for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility there is a 4 level decrease available for a threat involving a single instance evidencing little or no deliberation which would usually apply to spur of moment verbal threats maximum penalty for threatening a united states judge or a federal law enforcement officer is 10 years imprisonment double maximum penalty for threatening president interpretation there has been some controversy among federal appellate courts as to how term willfully should be interpreted traditional legal interpretations of term are reflected by black s law dictionarys definition which includes descriptions such as malicious done with evil intent or with a bad motive or purpose in u s v patillo u s court of appeals for fourth circuit held that a threat to president could lead to a verdict of guilty only if made with present intention to do injury to president specifically court opined that word willfully often denotes an act which is intentional or knowing or voluntary as distinguished from accidental but when used in a criminal statute it generally means an act done with a bad purpose we believe that a bad purpose assumes even more than its usual importance in a criminal prosecution based upon bare utterance of words most of other circuits have held that it is not necessary that threat be intended to be communicated to president or that it have tendency to influence his action legislative history which contains debate over a rejected amendment that would have eliminated words knowingly and willfully from statute reflects that word willfully was included in order to avoid criminalizing behavior carried out with innocent intent e g mailing to a friend for informational purposes a newspaper article containing a threat to president u s court of appeals for seventh circuit held that a threat was knowingly made if maker comprehended meaning of words uttered by him it was willingly made if in addition to comprehending meaning of his words maker voluntarily and intentionally uttered them as a declaration of apparent determination to carry them into execution watts v united states in case of watts v united states 394 u s 705 1969 united states supreme court ruled that mere political hyperbole must be distinguished from true threats at a dubois club public rally on washington monument grounds a member of assembled group suggested that young people present should get more education before expressing their views defendant an 18 year old replied they always holler at us to get an education and now i have already received my draft classification as 1 a and i have got to report for my physical this monday coming i am not going if they ever make me carry a rifle first man i want to get in my sights is l b j according to court testimony defendant in speaking made a gesture of sighting down barrel of a rifle audience responded with laughter and applause which court of appeals would later view as potentially ominous i t has not been unknown for laughter and applause to have sinister implications for safety of others history records that applause and laughter frequently greeted hitler s predictions of future of german jews even earlier roman holidays celebrated in colosseum often were punctuated by cheers and laughter when emperor gestured thumbs down on a fallen gladiator boy was arrested and found to be in possession of cannabis but a court of general sessions judge suppressed cannabis because he found that there had been no probable cause for secret service agents to believe defendant s words constituted a threat to president this did not prevent a federal court from convicting him for threatening president united states court of appeals for district of columbia circuit affirmed his conviction but supreme court reversed stating we agree with petitioner that his only offense here was a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to president taken in context and regarding expressly conditional nature of statement and reaction of listeners we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise in a concurring opinion william o douglas noted alien and sedition laws constituted one of our chapters and i had thought we had done with them forever suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old old device outlawed by our constitution other cases courts have held that a person is guilty of offense if certain criteria are met specifically person must intentionally make a threat in a context and under such circumstances that a reasonable person would foresee that statement would be interpreted by persons hearing or reading it as a serious expression of an intention to harm president statement must also not be result of mistake duress or coercion a true threat is a serious threat and not words uttered as a mere political argument idle talk or jest standard definition of a true threat does not require actual subjective intent to carry out threat a defendant s statement that if they got chance they would harm president is a threat merely because a threat has been conditional upon ability of defendant to carry it out does not render it any less of a threat it has been ruled that taken together envelopes containing ambiguous messages white powder and cigarette butts that were mailed to president after 9 11 anthrax outbreaks conveyed a threatening message sending of non toxic white powder alone to president has been deemed to be a threat a broad statement that president must see truth and uphold constitution or else letter writer will put a bullet in his head count as not expressly conditional as it does not indicate what events or circumstances will prevent threat from being carried out however statement if i got hold of president wilson i would shoot him was not an indictable offense because conditional threat was ambiguous as to whether it was an expression of present or past intent posting of a paper in a public place with a statement that it would be an acceptable sacrifice to god to kill an unjust president was ruled not to be in violation of statute statute does not penalize imagining wishing or hoping that act of killing president will be committed by someone else conversely mailing of letters containing words kill reagan and depicting president s bleeding head impaled on a stake was considered a serious threat an oral threat against president unheard by anyone does not constitute a threat denounced by statute since other statutes make it a crime to assault or to attempt to kill president some question has arisen as to whether it is necessary to have a statute banning threats as georgetown law journal notes it can be argued that punishment of an attempt against life of president is not sufficient by time all elements of an attempt have come into existence risk to president becomes too great on other hand punishment of conduct short of an attempt runs risk of violating established principle that intent alone is not punishable while ordinarily mere preparation to commit an offense is not punishable an exception may perhaps be justified by seriousness of consequences of an executed threat on president s life comment threatening president protected dissenter or potential assassin 57 geo l j 553 1969 psychiatric matters according to u s attorney s manual of individuals who come to secret service s attention as creating a possible danger to one of their protectees approximately 75 percent are mentally ill secret service notes these are probably secret service s most serious cases because it must be determined whether person making threat really wants to hurt secret service protectees or whether they may have some medical problems of their own for which they need help it is not uncommon for judges to order psychological evaluations of defendants charged under this statute in accordance with united states federal laws governing offenders with mental diseases or defects psychiatrists divide people who threaten president into three classes class 1 includes persons who have expressed overt threatening statements but have made no overt action class 2 comprises individuals who have a history of assaultive behaviors toward authority figures and class 3 includes person who are considered dangerous and typically have been prosecuted under section 871 dilemmas related to patient confidentiality sometimes arise when a mentally ill subject makes a threat against president termination of nurse linda portnoy was upheld after she reported such a statement to secret service court noted that patient was restrained and unable to act on his threats so he wasn t an immediate safety risk it also considered patient s psychiatrist not portnoy appropriate person to assess gravity of his threats in a study found that in those who threaten president primary differentiating variable related to lethality was opportunity and happenstance conversely a defendant s writings in his anger management workbook threatening to kill president upon defendant s release from penitentiary were ruled to have fallen within dangerous patient exception to psychotherapist patient privilege federal law provides that director of facility in which a person is hospitalized due to being found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty only by reason of insanity of a section 871 violation shall prepare annual or semiannual reports concerning mental condition of person and containing recommendations about need for his continued hospitalization a copy of reports shall be submitted to director of united states secret service to assist it in carrying out its protective duties ninth circuit ruled that it is constitutional to hold a presidential beyond section 871 s prescribed five year statutory maximum if he is found to be dangerous and mentally ill it is
