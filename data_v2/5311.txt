basiliscus d 476 477 was eastern roman emperor from 475 to 476 a member of house of leo he came to power when emperor zeno was forced out of constantinople by a revolt basiliscus was brother of empress aelia verina who was wife of emperor leo i 457 474 his relationship with emperor allowed him to pursue a military career that after minor initial successes ended in 468 when he led disastrous roman invasion of vandal africa in one of largest military operations of late antiquity basiliscus succeeded in seizing power in 475 exploiting unpopularity of emperor zeno barbarian successor to leo and a plot organised by verina that had caused zeno to flee constantinople however during his short rule basiliscus alienated fundamental support of church and people of constantinople promoting miaphysite christological position in opposition to chalcedonian faith also his policy of securing his power through appointment of loyal men to key roles antagonised many important figures in imperial court including his sister verina so when zeno tried to regain his empire he found virtually no opposition triumphantly entering constantinople and capturing and killing basiliscus and his family struggle between basiliscus and zeno impeded eastern roman empire s ability to intervene in fall of western roman empire which happened in early september 476 when chieftain of heruli odoacer deposed western emperor romulus augustus sending imperial regalia to constantinople zeno had just regained his throne and was in no position to take any action but appoint odoacer dux of italy thereby ending western roman empire origins and early career thumb 300px tremissis issued in name of aelia verina wife and later widow of emperor leo i as sister of basiliscus verina helped him in both his military and political career even if unwillingly supporting his bid for purple likely of balkan origin elton basiliscus was brother of aelia verina wife of leo i it has been argued that basiliscus was uncle to chieftain of heruli odoacer this link is based on interpretation of a fragment by john of antioch 209 1 which states that odoacer and armatus basiliscus nephew were brothers however not all scholars accept this interpretation since sources do not say anything about foreign origin of basiliscus it is known that basiliscus had a wife zenonis and at least one son marcus basiliscus military career started under leo i emperor conferred upon his brother in law dignities of dux or commander in chief in thrace smith in this country basiliscus led a successful military campaign against bulgars in 463 he succeeded as magister militum per 464 and had several successes against goths and huns 466 or 467 martindale basiliscus s value rose in leo s consideration verina s intercession in favour of her brother helped basiliscus military and political career with conferral of consulship in 465 and possibly of rank of patricius martindale it is also possible that he attained rank of patricius in 471 472 for helping leo to get rid of germanic influence in his court but there is a reference to basiliscus as patricius earlier in 468 however his rise was soon to meet a serious reversal disastrous expedition against vandals thumb 200px cap bon in modern tunisia is place where roman fleet led by basiliscus landed to launch an attack upon vandal capital of carthage in 468 leo chose basiliscus as leader of famous military expedition against carthage all accounts agree that invasion of kingdom of vandals was one of largest military undertakings recorded although estimates of its exact size vary according to priscus and nicephorus gregoras 100 000 ships were assembled modern scholars consider cedrenus s figure of 1 113 vessels each carrying 100 men more likely priscus fragment 42 translated by colin d gordon age of attila fifth century byzantium and barbarians ann arbor university of michigan 1966 p see gordon s note 11 on emendation georgius cedrenus through smith peter heather estimates a strength of 30 000 soldiers for expedition and 50 000 total when including sailors and additional forces of marcellinus and heraclius of edessa most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64 000 pounds of gold a sum that exceeded a whole year s revenue boardman purpose of operation was to punish vandal king geiseric for sacking of rome in 455 in which former capital of western roman empire was overwhelmed and empress eudoxia widow of emperor valentinian iii and her daughters were taken as hostages plan was concerted between eastern emperor leo western emperor anthemius and general marcellinus who enjoyed independence in illyricum basiliscus was ordered to sail directly to carthage while marcellinus attacked and took sardinia and a third army commanded by heraclius landed on libyan coast east of carthage making rapid progress it appears that combined forces met in sicily whence three fleets moved at different periods sardinia and libya were already conquered by marcellinus and heraclius when basiliscus cast anchor off now cap bon opposite sicily about forty miles from carthage geiseric requested basiliscus to allow him five days to draw up conditions of a peace procopius suggests that geiseric supported his request for a truce with a bribe during negotiations geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked roman fleet vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials during night these fire ships were propelled against unguarded and unsuspecting roman fleet roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction but these manoeuvres were blocked by attack of other vandal vessels basiliscus fled in heat of battle basiliscus lieutenant joannes when overpowered by vandals refused pardon that was promised him by genso son of gaiseric and leaped overboard in heavy armor and drowned himself in sea his last words were that he could not bear to surrender to those impious dogs of vandals vandals in fact were arians procopius one half of roman fleet was burned sunk or captured and other half followed fugitive basiliscus whole expedition had failed heraclius effected his retreat through desert into tripolitania holding position for two years until recalled marcellinus retired to sicily where he was reached by basiliscus general was however assassinated perhaps at instigation of ricimer by one of his own captains and king of vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction that romans themselves would remove from world his most formidable antagonists after returning to constantinople basiliscus hid in church of hagia sophia to escape wrath of people and revenge of emperor by mediation of verina basiliscus obtained imperial pardon and was punished merely with banishment to heraclea in thrace bury rise to power in 471 and 472 basiliscus helped leo i get rid of germanic influence in his court helping in murder of alan magister militum aspar death of aspar caused a revolt in thrace led by thracian ostrogoth theodoric strabo and basiliscus was dispatched to suppress revolt something he successfully did with aid of his nephew armatus in 474 he received rank of caput senatus first among senators at death of leo zeno who was a barbarian of isaurian stock but at same time son in law of leo became sole emperor after a short co reign with his own son leo ii 474 barbarian origins of emperor caused antipathy towards zeno among people of constantinople furthermore strong germanic portion of military led by theodoric strabo disliked isaurian officers that leo i brought to reduce his dependency on ostrogoths finally zeno alienated his fellow isaurian general illus who was bribed by basiliscus in middle of conspiracy was verina who fomented a popular revolt against emperor uprising supported by theodoric strabo illus and armatus was successful and verina convinced emperor to leave city zeno fled to his native lands bringing with him some of isaurians living in constantinople and imperial treasury basiliscus was then acclaimed as augustus on 9 january exists a horoscope made on day of basiliscus coronation 12 january 475 at 9 a m probably by a supporter of zeno horoscope preserved with horoscopes of other two usurpers of zeno through arab sources correctly predicts end of basiliscus rule in two years see at hebdomon palace by palace ministers and senate tradition allowed senate to recognise a usurper thus basiliscus was new lawful ruler albeit julius nepos who technically had become senior emperor refused to accept basiliscus as his colleague however it was first military based succession in last one hundred years friell mob of constantinople got its revenge against zeno killing almost all of isaurians left in city friell in beginning everything seemed to go well for new emperor who even tried to set up a new dynasty by conferring title of augusta upon his wife aelia zenonis and naming his son marcus caesar and later augustus basiliscus also issued coins celebrating joint rule with his son marcus also gold and bronze coins were minted in honour of aelia zenonis augusta coins bear legend with three g referring to three augusti see however due to his mismanagement as emperor basiliscus quickly lost most of his supporters rule corruption and fire of constantinople most urgent problem facing new emperor was scarcity of resources left in imperial treasury basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes and to revert to practice of auctioning offices obviously causing a diffuse discontent in population he also extorted money from church with help of prefect verina s long time favourite early in his reign constantinople suffered a massive fire which destroyed houses churches and completely incinerated huge library built by emperor julian this library which was housed within a basilica next to underground cisterna built by justinian i contained 120 000 volumes including famous parchment long upon which were inscribed homer s iliad and odyssey in golden letters fire was seen as a bad omen for rule of basiliscus tensions with his collaborators basiliscus had relied on support of some major figures of court in his bid for power however he quickly lost most of them first basiliscus alienated his own sister verina executing magister officiorum patricius patricius was lover of verina and empress had planned to raise him to imperial rank and to marry him very revolt against zeno was organised to make patricius emperor basiliscus however had out witted his sister and after flight of zeno had ministers and senate choose him and not patricius as emperor basiliscus ordered death of patricius as officer was a natural candidate to overthrow new emperor as a consequence verina later intrigued against basiliscus bury according to candidus after death of patricius verina intrigued in favour of zeno but her plan was discovered by basiliscus and only intercession of armatus spared her life also theodoric strabo whose hatred of isaurian zeno had compelled him to support basiliscus revolt left new emperor s side basiliscus had in fact raised his own nephew armatus who was rumoured to be also lover of basiliscus wife to rank of magister militum same that strabo held finally support of illus was most likely wavering given massacre of isaurians allowed by basiliscus religious controversies in that time christian faith was shaken by conflict between miaphysites and chalcedonians representing two opposing christological positions chalcedonians claimed that christ had both human and divine natures while miaphysites claimed he had only one nature council of chalcedon convoked by emperor marcian in 451 had ruled out with support of pope in west and many bishops in east however miaphysite position was still strong two miaphysite patriarchs timothy aelurus of alexandria and peter fuller of antioch were deposed pope st simplicius catholic encyclopedia from beginning of his rule basiliscus showed his support for miaphysites zacharias scholasticus reports how a group of egyptian miaphysite monks having heard of emperor leo s death had traveled from alexandria to constantinople to petition zeno in favour of timothy but on their arrival in capital they found newly elected basiliscus instead magister officiorum theoctistus former physician of basiliscus was brother of one of monks so delegation obtained an audience with basiliscus and with support of theoctistus and of empress they convinced basiliscus to recall from exile banished miaphysite patriarchs zacharias scholasticus basiliscus re instated timothy aelurus and peter fuller to their sees samuel and persuaded by former issued a circular letter on 9 april 475 to bishops calling them to accept as valid only first three ecumenical synods and reject council of chalcedon all bishops were to sign edict while most of eastern bishops accepted letter patriarch acacius of constantinople refused with support of population of city clearly showing his disdain towards basiliscus by draping icons in hagia sophia in black evagrius scholasticus fall and death thumb 300px tremissis issued by emperor zeno soon after his elevation basiliscus had despatched illus and his brother against zeno who now in his native fortresses had resumed life of an isaurian chieftain basiliscus however failed to fulfill promises he made to two generals furthermore they received letters from some of leading ministers at court urging them to secure return of zeno for city now preferred a restored isaurian to a miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with fiscal rapacity of his ministers during his operations in isauria illus took zeno s brother longinus prisoner and kept him in an isaurian fortress because he thought he would have great influence over a restored zeno he changed sides and marched with zeno towards constantinople in summer of 476 when basiliscus received news of this danger he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate patriarch and people but it was too late armatus as magister militum was sent with all available forces in asia minor to oppose advancing army of isaurians but secret messages from zeno who promised to give him title of magister militum for life and to confer rank of caesar on his son induced him to betray his master according to procopius armatus surrendered his army to zeno on condition that zeno would appoint armatus son basiliscus as caesar and recognise him as successor to throne upon his death after zeno had regained empire he carried out his pledge to armatus by appointing his son named basiliscus caesar but not long afterwards he both stripped him of office and put armatus to death armatus avoided road by which zeno was advancing and marched into isauria by another way this betrayal decided fate of basiliscus in august 476 zeno besieged constantinople leader of pannonian goths theodoric amal later known as theodoric great had allied to zeno theodoric would have attacked basiliscus and his thracian goth foederati led by theodoric strabo receiving in exchange title of magister militum held by strabo and payments previously given to thracian goths it has been suggested that constantinople was defenseless during zeno s siege because magister militum strabo had moved north to counter this menace see senate opened gates of city to isaurian allowing deposed emperor to resume throne basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church but he was betrayed by acacius and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from zeno not to shed their blood basiliscus his wife aelia zenonis and his son marcus were sent to a fortress in cappadocia elton refers that name of stronghold was while smith has cucusus and evagrius scholasticus reports where zeno had them enclosed in a dry cistern to die from exposure procopius basiliscus had ruled for twenty months he is described by sources as a successful general but slow of understanding and easy to deceive see also flavia gens list of byzantine emperors references sources primary sources
