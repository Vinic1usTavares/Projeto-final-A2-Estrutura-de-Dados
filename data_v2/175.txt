jefferson davis appointed him as attorney general benjamin had little to do in that position but davis was impressed by his competence and appointed him as secretary of war benjamin firmly supported davis and president reciprocated loyalty by promoting him to secretary of state in march 1862 while benjamin was being criticized for rebel defeat at battle of roanoke island as secretary of state benjamin attempted to gain official recognition for confederacy by france and united kingdom but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful to preserve confederacy as military defeats made its situation increasingly desperate he advocated freeing and arming slaves late in war but his proposals were only partially accepted in closing month of war when davis fled confederate capital of richmond in early 1865 benjamin went with him he left presidential party and was successful in escaping from mainland united states but davis was captured by union troops benjamin sailed to great britain where he

regarded school where his intelligence was recognized in charleston his father was among founders of first reform congregation in united states it developed practices that included shorter services conducted in english rather than in hebrew benjamin was ultimately expelled from that community as he did not keep sabbath extent of judah s religious education is uncertain boy s intelligence was noted by others in charleston one of whom offered to finance his education at age of 14 in 1825 benjamin entered yale college an institution popular among white southerners vice president john c calhoun a south carolinian was among its alumni although benjamin was successful as a student at yale he left abruptly in 1827 without completing his course of study reasons for this are uncertain in 1861 when louisiana left union and benjamin resigned as a u s senator an abolitionist newspaper alleged that he had been caught as a thief at yale he considered bringing suit for libel but litigation was impractical in 1901 his sole surviving classmate wrote that benjamin had been expelled for gambling one of his biographers robert meade considered evidence of wrongdoing by benjamin to be too strong to be ignored but noted that at time benjamin left yale he was only 16 years old after a brief return to charleston benjamin moved to new orleans louisiana according to rabbi bertram w korn s volume on that city s jews he arrived in new orleans in 1828 with no visible assets other than wit charm omnivorous mind and boundless energy with which he would find his place in sun after working in a mercantile business he became a clerk for a law firm where he began to read law studying as an apprentice knowledge of french was important in practicing law in louisiana as state s code was and is still based on french and spanish law to earn money he tutored french creoles in english he taught language to natalie de st martin on condition that she teach him french in late 1832 at age 21 he was admitted to bar early following year benjamin married natalie who was catholic and from a wealthy french creole family as part of her dowry she brought with her 3 000 and two female slaves aged 11 and 16 together worth about 1 000 even before marriage natalie st martin had scandalized new orleans society by her conduct william de ville in his journal article on benjamin marriage contract suggests that st martin family was not terribly distraught to be rid of their young daughter and that benjamin was virtually suborned to marry natalie and did so without hesitation in order to further his ambitions marriage was not a success by 1840s natalie benjamin was living in paris with couple s only child ninette whom she raised as a catholic benjamin would visit them annually while a senator in late 1850s he persuaded natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in washington for all three to live in natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for france benjamin publicly humiliated by his failure to keep natalie consigned household goods to auction there were rumors never substantiated that benjamin was impotent and that natalie was unfaithful benjamin s troubled married life has led to speculation that he was gay daniel brook in a 2012 article about benjamin suggests that early biographies read as though historians are presenting him as an almost stereotypical gay man and yet wear such impervious heteronormative blinders that they themselves know not what they write these conjectures were not given scholarly weight until 2001 when in an introduction to a reprinting of meade s biography of benjamin civil war historian william c davis acknowledged cloaked suggestions that he benjamin was a homosexual louisiana lawyer within months of his admission to bar benjamin argued his first case before supreme court of louisiana and won still clients were slow to come in his first years in practice he had enough free time to compile and publish with thomas slidell digest of reported decisions of superior court of late territory of orleans and supreme court of state of louisiana in 1834 which required analysis of 6 000 cases book was an immediate success and helped launch benjamin s career when slidell published a revised edition in 1840 he did so alone as benjamin was too busy litigating cases to participate benjamin became a specialist in commercial law of which there was a great deal in new orleans busy river port a center of international commerce and domestic slave trade by 1840 city had become fourth largest in united states and among wealthiest many of best lawyers in country practiced commercial law there and benjamin successfully competed with them in one case he successfully represented seller of a slave against allegations that seller knew slave had incurable tuberculosis although benjamin tried some jury cases he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals in 1842 benjamin had a group of cases with international implications he represented insurance companies being sued for value of slaves who had revolted aboard ship creole in 1841 as they were being transported in coastwise slave trade from virginia to new orleans rebels had sailed ship to nassau in bahamas british territory where most were freed as britain had abolished slavery in 1834 owners of slaves brought suit for 150 000 against their insurers who declined to pay benjamin made several arguments most prominent of which was that slaveowners had brought revolt on themselves by packing slaves in overcrowded conditions benjamin said in his brief to court court ruled for benjamin s clients although on other grounds benjamin s brief was widely reprinted including by abolitionist groups historian eli evans benjamin s biographer does not believe that argument in creole case represented benjamin s personal view rather he was an advocate for his clients in an era when it was usual to write dramatically to distract attention from weaker points of a case evans finds it remarkable and a testament to benjamin that he could be elected to office in antebellum louisiana a slave society after writing such words electoral career state politician benjamin was a supporter of whig party from time of its formation in early 1830s he became increasingly involved in party and in 1841 ran unsuccessfully for new orleans board of aldermen following year he was nominated for louisiana house of representatives he was elected though democrats alleged fraud whig supporters to obtain vote at a time when state had a restrictive property qualification for suffrage acquired licenses for carriages a voter did not have to demonstrate that carriage existed but his license had to be accepted as evidence of ownership by election officials democratic press blamed benjamin as strategist behind this maneuver in 1844 legislature voted to hold a constitutional convention and benjamin was chosen as a delegate from new orleans at convention benjamin successfully opposed counting a slave as three fifths of a human being for purposes of representation in state elections as was done in federal elections his position prevailed and slaves were not counted at all for electoral purposes in louisiana state elections according to evans his tact courtesy and ability to find compromises impressed political elders in all corners of state rabbi myron berman in his history of jews in richmond describes attitude of antebellum white southerners toward jews by early 1840s benjamin was wealthy from his law practice and with a partner bought a sugar cane plantation bellechasse this purchase and subsequent construction of a grand house there advanced benjamin s ambitions planter class controlled louisiana politics and would trust only a man who also owned substantial land and slaves benjamin marriage was by then failing and he hoped in vain that his wife would be content at plantation benjamin threw his energy into improving bellechasse importing new varieties of sugar cane and adopting up to date methods and equipment to extract and process sugar he purchased 140 slaves to work plantation and had a reputation as a humane slaveowner benjamin scaled back his involvement in politics in late 1840s distracted by his plantation and law practice his mother rebecca whom he had brought to new orleans died in 1847 during a yellow fever epidemic in 1848 benjamin was a whig member of electoral college he voted for fellow louisiana planter general zachary taylor who was elected u s president he and other louisianans accompanied president elect taylor to washington for his inauguration and benjamin attended a state dinner given by outgoing president james k polk in 1850 millard fillmore who succeeded taylor after his death earlier that year appointed benjamin as judge of united states district court for northern district of california he was confirmed by senate but he declined appointment as salary of 3 500 was too small following year benjamin assisted united states attorney in new orleans in prosecuting american adventurers who had tried to spark a rebellion against spanish rule in cuba but two trials both ended in hung juries mexican railroad benjamin became interested in strengthening trade connections between new orleans and california and promoted an infrastructure project to build a railroad across mexican isthmus near oaxaca this would speed passenger traffic and cargo shipments according to new york times in an 1852 speech to a railroad builders convention benjamin said this trade route belongs to new orleans its commerce makes empires of countries to which it flows benjamin lobbied fellow lawmakers about project gained funds from private new york bankers and even helped organize construction crews in private correspondence he warned backers of problems project workers suffered yellow fever shipments of construction materials hit rough seas and actions or inaction by both u s and mexican officials caused delays and increases in construction costs backers had invested several hundred thousand dollars by time project died after outbreak of american civil war in 1861 election to senate upright thumb right benjamin 1856 benjamin spent summer of 1851 abroad including a visit to paris to see natalie and ninette he was still away in october 1851 when whigs nominated him for state senate despite his absence he was easily elected when new legislature met in january 1852 benjamin emerged as one of leading whig candidates for election to u s senate seat that would become vacant on march 4 1853 as louisiana legislature responsible for electing state s senators met once in two years under 1845 constitution it was not scheduled to meet again before seat became vacant some whig newspapers thought benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty despite his undoubted talent but whig legislative caucus selected him on second ballot and he was elected by two houses over democrat solomon w downs outgoing president fillmore offered to nominate benjamin a fellow whig to fill a supreme court vacancy after senate democrats had defeated fillmore s other nominees for post new york times reported on february 15 1853 that if president nominates benjamin democrats are determined to confirm him new president franklin pierce a democrat also offered benjamin a place on supreme court pierce butler a future supreme court justice suggested in his 1908 biography of benjamin that newly elected senator likely declined these offers not only because he preferred active politics but because he could maintain his law practice and substantial income as a senator but could not as a justice as an advocate before u s supreme court benjamin won 13 of his first 18 cases judah benjamin was sworn in as senator from louisiana on march 4 1853 at a brief meeting called just prior to president pierce s inauguration these new colleagues included stephen a douglas of illinois robert m t hunter of virginia and sam houston of texas slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of country wished to accept compromise of 1850 as a final settlement when senate was not in session benjamin remained in washington d c conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before supreme court then conveniently located in a room of capitol his law partners in new orleans took care of his firm s affairs there about this time benjamin sold his interest in bellechasse lacking time to deal with plantation business spokesman for slavery benjamin s view that slavery should continue was based in his belief that citizens had a right to their property as guaranteed by constitution as butler put it he could no more see that it was right for northern people to rob him of his slave than it would be for him to at horse stealing he avoided arguments of some that slaves were inferior beings and that their position was ordained by god evans ascribes this to benjamin not being raised as a slaveowner but coming to it later in life benjamin joined in a widespread view of white southerners that african american would not be ready for emancipation for many years if ever they feared that freeing slaves would ruin many and lead to murders and rapes by newly liberated of their former masters and mistresses such a massacre had been feared by southerners since haitian revolution violent revolt known as santo domingo in south in which slaves of what became haiti killed many whites and mulattoes in 1804 while gaining independence from french control when anti slavery book uncle tom s cabin was published in 1852 benjamin spoke out against harriet beecher stowe s portrayal he said that slaves were for most part well treated and plantation punishments such as whipping or branding were more merciful than sentences of imprisonment that a white man might receive in north for similar conduct in early 1854 senator douglas introduced his kansas nebraska bill calling for popular sovereignty to determine whether kansas and nebraska territories should enter union as slave or free states depending on outcome of such elections slavery might spread to territories closed to it under missouri compromise of 1820 in debate over bill benjamin defended this change as returning to traditions of fathers that federal government not legislate on subject of slavery he said that south merely wished to be left alone bill passed but its passage had drastic political effects as differences between north and south that had been settled by both 1820 and 1850 compromises were reopened whig party was torn apart north from south with many northern whigs joining new republican party a group pledged to oppose spread of slavery benjamin continued to caucus with remains of whig party through 1854 and 1855 but as a member of a legislative minority he had little influence on legislation and received no important committee assignments in may 1856 benjamin joined democrats stating they had principles of old time whig party he indicated in a letter to constituents that as northern whigs had failed to vote to uphold rights granted to southern states in constitution whigs as a national party were no more at a state dinner given by pierce benjamin first met secretary of war jefferson davis whose wife varina described louisiana senator as having rather air of a witty bon vivant than of a great senator two men both ambitious for leadership in south and nation formed a relationship that evans describes as respectful but wary two had occasional differences when in 1858 davis by then a mississippi senator was irritated by benjamin s questioning him on a military bill and suggested that benjamin was acting as a paid attorney louisianan challenged him to a duel davis apologized benjamin in his speeches in senate took position that union was a compact by states from which any of them could secede nevertheless he understood that any dissolution would not be peaceful stating in 1856 that dreadful will be internecine war that must ensue in 1859 benjamin was elected to a second term but allegations of involvement in land scandals and fact that upstate legislators objected to both of louisiana s senators being from new orleans stretched contest to 42 ballots before he prevailed secession crisis upright thumb right benjamin 1860 1865 benjamin worked to deny douglas 1860 democratic presidential nomination feeling he had turned against south douglas contended that although supreme court in dred scott v sandford had stated congress could not restrict slavery in territories people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it this position was anathema to south benjamin praised douglas s opponent in his re election bid former congressman abraham lincoln for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of expansion of slavery whereas senator considered douglas to be a hypocrite benjamin was joined in his opposition to douglas by senator davis two were so successful that 1860 convention was not able to nominate anyone and split into northern and southern factions northerners backed douglas while southern delegates chose vice president john c breckinridge of kentucky despite their agreement in opposing douglas benjamin and davis differed on some race issues in may benjamin voted for a bill to aid africans liberated by u s naval vessels from illegal slave ships in order to return them to their native continent from key west davis and many other southerners opposed bill between june and december 1860 benjamin was almost entirely absorbed in case of united states v castillero that was tried in san francisco during latter part of that period case concerned a land grant by former mexican government of california castillero had leased part of his land to british mining companies and when american authorities ruled grant invalid they hired benjamin he spent four months in san francisco working on case trial began in october and benjamin gave an address lasting six days local correspondent for new york times wrote that benjamin a distinguished stranger drew largest crowds to courtroom and senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting benjamin sailed for new york once case was submitted for decision in early november court s ruling rendered in january 1861 was substantially for company but not satisfied it appealed it lost case entirely to an adverse decision by u s supreme court three justices dissenting following year benjamin was by then a confederate cabinet officer and could not argue case his co counsel filed his brief with court by time benjamin returned to east coast republican candidate lincoln had been elected president and there was talk in louisiana and elsewhere of secession from union new orleans picayune reported that benjamin favored secession only in last resort on december 23 1860 another louisiana periodical delta printed a letter from benjamin dated eighth stating that as people of north were of unalterable hostility to their southern brethren latter should depart from government common to them he also signed a joint letter from southern congressmen to their constituents urging formation of a confederation of seceding states according to a letter reportedly written by benjamin during crisis he saw secession as a means of obtaining more favorable terms in a reformed union with southern opinion turning in favor of secession benjamin made a farewell speech in senate on december 31 1860 to a packed gallery desirous of hearing one of south s most eloquent voices they were not disappointed evans writes that historians consider benjamin s farewell one of great speeches in american history benjamin foresaw that south s departure would lead to civil war according to geoffrey d cunningham in his article on benjamin s role in secession swept up in popular cries for independence benjamin willingly went out with southern tide he and his louisiana colleague john slidell resigned from u s senate on february 4 1861 nine days after their state voted to secede from union confederate statesman attorney general thumb left original confederate cabinet 1861 l r judah p benjamin stephen mallory christopher memminger alexander stephens leroy pope walker jefferson davis john h reagan and robert toombs fearful of arrest as a rebel once he left senate benjamin quickly departed washington for new orleans on day of benjamin s resignation provisional confederate states congress gathered in montgomery alabama and soon chose davis as president davis was sworn in as provisional confederate states president on february 18 1861 at home in new orleans for it would prove last time benjamin addressed a rally on washington s birthday february 22 1861 on february 25 davis appointed benjamin still in new orleans as attorney general louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by provisional congress davis thus became first chief executive in north america to appoint a jew to his cabinet davis in his memoirs remarked that he chose benjamin because he had a very high reputation as a lawyer and my acquaintance with him in senate had impressed me with lucidity of his intellect his systematic habits and capacity for labor meade suggested that davis wanted to have a louisianan in his cabinet but that a smarter course of action would have been to send benjamin abroad to win over european governments butler called benjamin s appointment a waste of good material historian william c davis in his volume on formation of confederate government notes for some there was next to nothing to do none more so than benjamin role of attorney general in a confederacy that did not yet have federal courts or marshals was so minimal that initial layouts for building housing government in montgomery allotted no space to justice department meade found time that benjamin spent as attorney general to be fruitful as it allowed him opportunity to judge davis s character and to ingratiate himself with president benjamin served as a host entertaining dignitaries and others davis had no time to see at first cabinet meeting benjamin counseled davis to have government buy 150 000 bales of cotton for shipment to united kingdom with proceeds used to buy arms and for future needs his advice was not taken as cabinet believed war would be short and successful benjamin was called upon from time to time to render legal opinions writing on april 1 to assure treasury secretary christopher memminger that lemons and oranges could enter confederacy duty free but walnuts could not once virginia joined confederacy capital was moved to richmond though against benjamin s advice he believed that city was too close to north nevertheless he traveled there with his brother in law jules st martin two lived in same house throughout war and benjamin probably procured young man s job at war department although alabama s leroy walker was secretary of war davis a war hero and former u s war secretary considered himself more qualified and gave many orders himself when confederates were unable to follow up their victory at first battle of manassas by threatening washington walker was criticized in press in september walker resigned to join army as a brigadier general and davis appointed benjamin in his place butler wrote that davis had found cheerfully competent benjamin a most useful member of official family and thought him suited for almost any post in it in addition to his appointment as war secretary benjamin continued to act as attorney general until november 15 1861 secretary of war as war secretary benjamin was responsible for a territory stretching from virginia to texas it was his job with davis looking over his shoulder to supervise confederate army and to feed supply and arm it in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers accordingly benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs as confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops davis had chosen a defensive war strategy confederacy would await invasion by north then seek to defeat its armies until lincoln tired of sending them davis and benjamin worked together closely and as davis came to realize that his subordinate was loyal both to confederacy and to davis personally he returned complete trust in benjamin varina davis wrote it was to me a curious spectacle steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of president and his war minister it was a very gradual rapprochement but all more solid for that reason in his months as war secretary benjamin sent thousands of communications according to evans benjamin initially turn ed prejudice to his favor and play ed on southerner s instinctive respect for jewish mind with a brilliant performance nevertheless benjamin faced difficulties that he could do little about confederacy lacked sufficient soldiers trained officers to command them naval and civilian ships manufacturing capacity to make ships and many weapons and powder for guns and cannon union had these things and moved to block south s access to european supplies both by blockade and by buying up supplies south might have secured other problems included drunkenness among men and their officers and uncertainty as to when and where expected northern invasion would begin further benjamin had no experience of military or of executive branch of government placing him in a poor position to contradict president davis an insurgency against confederacy developed in staunchly pro union east tennessee in late 1861 and at davis s order benjamin sent troops to crush it once it was put down benjamin and davis were in a quandary about what to do about its leader william parson brownlow who had been captured and eventually allowed him to cross to union controlled territory in hope that it would cause lincoln to release confederate prisoners while brownlow was in southern custody he stated that he expected no more mercy from benjamin than was shown by his illustrious predecessors towards jesus christ benjamin had difficulty in managing confederacy s generals he quarreled with general p g t beauregard a war hero since his victory at first manassas beauregard sought to add a rocket battery to his command an action benjamin stated was not authorized by law he was most likely relaying davis s views and when challenged by beauregard president backed benjamin advising general to dismiss this small matter from your mind in hostile masses before you you have a subject more worthy of your contemplation in january 1862 thomas j stonewall jackson s forces had advanced in western virginia leaving troops under william w loring at small town of romney distant from jackson s other forces and ill supplied loring and other officers petitioned war department to be recalled and benjamin after consulting davis so ordered using pretext of rumored union troop movements in area jackson complied but in a letter to benjamin asked to be removed from front or to resign high ranking confederates soothed jackson into withdrawing his request power of state governments was another flaw in confederacy and a problem for benjamin georgia governor joseph e brown repeatedly demanded arms and return of georgian troops to defend their state north carolina s governor henry t clark also wanted troops returned to him to defend his coastline after cape hatteras on north carolina s coast was captured confederate forces fell back to roanoke island if that fell a number of ports in that area of coast would be at risk and norfolk virginia might be threatened by land general henry a wise commanding roanoke also demanded troops and supplies he received little from benjamin s war department that had no arms to send as union blockade was preventing supplies from being imported that confederate armories were empty was a fact not publicly known at time benjamin and davis hoped island s defenses could hold off union forces but an overwhelming number of troops were landed in february 1862 at an undefended point and confederates were quickly defeated combined with union general ulysses s grant s capture of fort henry and fort donelson in tennessee this was most severe military blow yet to confederacy and there was a public outcry against benjamin led by general wise it was revealed a quarter century after war that benjamin and davis had agreed for secretary to act as scapegoat rather than reveal shortage of arms not knowing this richmond examiner accused benjamin of stupid complacency diarist mary chestnut recorded mob calls him mr davis s pet jew wise family never forgave benjamin to detriment of his memory in southern eyes general s son captain jennings wise fell at roanoke island and henry s grandson john wise interviewed in 1936 told meade that fat jew sitting at his desk was to blame another of general s sons also named john wise wrote a highly popular book about south in civil war end of an era 1899 in which he said that benjamin had more brains and less heart than any other civic leader in south confederacy and its collapse were no more to judah p benjamin than last year s birds nest confederate congress established a special committee to investigate military losses benjamin testified before it secretary of state virginia s robert m t hunter had quarreled with davis and resigned and in march 1862 benjamin was appointed as his replacement varina davis noted that some in congress had sought benjamin s ouster because of reverses which no one could have averted so president promoted him to state department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done to man who had now become his friend and right hand richmond diarist sallie ann brock putnam wrote mr benjamin was not forgiven this act on part of president in promoting benjamin in defiance of public opinion was considered as unwise arbitrary and a reckless risking of his reputation and popularity benjamin was ever afterwards unpopular in confederacy and particularly in virginia despite promotion committee reported that any blame for defeat at roanoke island should attach to wise s superior major general benjamin huger and late secretary of war j p benjamin confederate secretary of state throughout his time as secretary of state benjamin tried to induce britain and france to recognize confederacy no other nation was likely to do so unless these powerful states led way protection this would bring to confederacy and its foreign trade was hoped to be enough to save it basis of confederate foreign policy thumb 250px benjamin on 1864 confederate 2 banknote by 1850s cheap southern cotton fueled industries of europe mills of britain developed during first half of 19th century by 1860 used more cotton than rest of industrialized world combined cotton imports to britain came almost entirely from american south according to an article in economist in 1853 let any great social or physical convulsion visit united states and england would feel shock from land s end to john o groat s lives of nearly two million of our countrymen hang upon a thread in 1855 an ohioan david christy published cotton is king or slavery in light of political economy christy argued that flow of cotton was so important to industrialized world that cutting it off would be devastating not least to northern united states as cotton was by far largest u s export this became known as king cotton theory to which davis was an enthusiastic subscriber benjamin also spoke in favor of theory though butler suspected he may have known better based on his firsthand knowledge of europe when war came davis against benjamin s advice imposed an embargo on exports of cotton to nations that had not recognized confederate government hoping to force such relations especially with britain and france as union was attempting to prevent cotton from being exported from confederate ports by a blockade and other means this played to a certain extent into hands of lincoln and his secretary of state william h seward additionally when war began britain had a large surplus of cotton in warehouses enough to keep mills running at least part time for a year or so although many prominent britons believed south would prevail there was a reluctance to recognize richmond until it had gained military victories to put its foe at bay much of this was due to hatred of slavery though part of it stemmed from a desire to remain on good terms with u s government due to a drought in 1862 britain was forced to import large quantities of wheat and flour from united states also britain feared expansionist americans might invade vulnerable canadian colonies as seward hinted they might appointment davis appointed benjamin as secretary of state on march 17 1862 he was promptly confirmed by confederate senate a motion to reconsider confirmation was lost 13 8 according to butler appointment of benjamin brought davis little political support as average white southerner did not understand benjamin and somewhat disliked him as there was not much open opposition to davis in south at time benjamin s appointment was not criticized but was not given much praise either meade noted silence of many influential newspapers was ominous benjamin s promotion in face of such bitter criticism of his conduct in war office caused first serious lack of confidence in davis government meade wrote that since secretary of state would have to work closely with jefferson davis benjamin was likely person best suited to position in addition to his relationship with president benjamin was very close to confederate first lady varina davis with whom he exchanged confidences regarding war events and president s health together and by turns they could help him over most difficult days for recreation benjamin frequented richmond s gambling dens playing poker and faro he was incensed when british correspondent william howard russell publicized his gambling feeling that it was an invasion of his private affairs he was also displeased that russell depicted him as a losing gambler when his reputation was opposite early days 1862 1863 trent affair had taken place before benjamin took office as secretary of state a u s warship had in october 1861 removed confederate diplomats james mason and james slidell benjamin s former louisiana colleague in u s senate and their private secretaries from a british flagged vessel crisis brought u s and britain near war and was resolved by their release by time of benjamin s appointment mason and slidell were at their posts in london and paris as putative ministers from confederacy seeking recognition by governments of britain and france with difficult communications between south and europe dispatches were often lost or intercepted benjamin was initially reluctant to change instructions given agents by secretary hunter communications improved by 1863 with benjamin ordering that dispatches be sent to bermuda or bahamas from where they reached confederacy by blockade runner as a practical matter benjamin s chances of gaining european recognition rose and fell with military fortunes of confederacy when at end of june 1862 confederate general robert e lee turned back union general george b mcclellan s peninsula campaign in seven days battles ending immediate threat to richmond emperor napoleon iii of france favorably received proposals from benjamin through slidell for french to intervene on confederacy s behalf in exchange for trade concessions nevertheless emperor proved unwilling to act without britain in august 1862 mason angered by refusal of british government ministers to meet with him threatened to resign his post benjamin soothed him stating that while mason should not submit to insulting treatment resignation should not take place without discussion bloody standoff at antietam in september 1862 that ended lee s first major incursion into north gave lincoln confidence in union arms he needed to announce emancipation proclamation british newspapers mocked lincoln for hypocrisy in freeing slaves only in confederate held areas where he could exercise no authority british officials had been shocked by outcome of antietam they had expected lee to deliver another brilliant victory and now considered an additional reason for intervening in conflict antietam bloodiest day of war had been a stalemate they read this as presaging an overall deadlock in war with north and south at each other s throats for years as britain s mills sat empty and its people starved france agreed with this assessment final few months of 1862 saw a high water mark for benjamin s diplomacy in october british chancellor of exchequer william gladstone expressed confidence in confederate victory stating in newcastle there is no doubt that jefferson davis and other leaders of south have made an army they are making it appears a navy and they have made what is more than either they have made a nation later that month napoleon proposed to british and russians a u s ally that they combine to require a six months armistice for mediation and an end to blockade if they did so it would likely lead to southern independence proposal divided british cabinet in mid november at urgings of palmerston and war secretary george cornewall lewis members decided to continue to wait for south to defeat lincoln s forces before recognizing it although proponents of intervention were prepared to await another opportunity growing realization among british public that emancipation proclamation meant that union victory would be slavery s end made south politically infeasible benjamin had not been allowed to offer inducement for intervention that might have succeeded abolition of slavery in confederacy and because of that meade deemed his diplomacy seriously perhaps fatally handicapped secretary of state blamed napoleon for failure believing emperor had betrayed confederacy to get ruler french had installed in mexico maximilian accepted by united states in paris slidell had been approached by banking firm erlanger et cie company offered to float a loan to benefit confederacy proposed terms provided a large commission to erlanger and would entitle to cotton at a discounted price once south won war baron frederic emile d erlanger head of firm journeyed to richmond in early 1863 and negotiated with benjamin although transaction properly fell within jurisdiction of treasury secretary memminger banker softened terms somewhat though they were still lucrative for his firm benjamin felt deal was worth it as it would provide confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in europe increasing desperation 1863 1865 twin rebel defeats at gettysburg and vicksburg in early july 1863 made it unlikely that britain or any other nation would recognize a slaveholding confederacy staggering towards oblivion accordingly in august benjamin wrote to mason telling him that as davis believed british unwilling to recognize south he was free to leave country in october with davis absent on a trip to tennessee benjamin heard that british consul in savannah had forbidden british subjects in confederate army from being used against united states secretary of state convened a cabinet meeting that expelled remaining british consuls in confederate controlled territory then notified davis by letter evans suggests that benjamin s actions made him confederacy s acting president first jewish president benjamin supervised confederate secret service responsible for covert operations in north and financed former federal interior secretary jacob thompson to work behind scenes financing operations that might undermine lincoln politically although efforts were made to boost peace democrats most prominent actions proved to be st albans raid an attack on a vermont town from canada and an unsuccessful attempt to burn new york city in aftermath of war these activities led to accusations that benjamin and davis were involved in assassination of abraham lincoln as one confederate courier john h surratt who had received money from benjamin was tried for involvement in conspiracy though surratt was acquitted as confederacy s military fortunes flagged there was increasing consideration of what would have been unthinkable in 1861 enlisting male slaves in army and emancipating them for their service in august 1863 b h micou a relative of a former law partner wrote to benjamin proposing use of black soldiers benjamin responded that this was not feasible principally for legal and financial reasons and that slaves were performing valuable services for confederacy where they were according to meade benjamin did not offer any objections to micou s plan except on practical grounds he was not repelled by radical nature of proposal a british financial agent for confederacy james spence also urged emancipation as a means of gaining british recognition benjamin allowed spence to remain in his position for almost a year despite differences with confederate policy before finally dismissing him in late 1863 despite official neutrality tens of thousands from british ruled ireland were enlisting in union cause benjamin sent an agent to ireland hoping to impede those efforts and dudley mann to rome to urge pope pius ix to forbid catholic irish from enlisting pope did not do so though he responded sympathetically in january 1864 confederate general patrick cleburne of army of tennessee proposed emancipating and arming slaves davis when he heard of it turned it down and ordered it kept secret evans notes that benjamin had been thinking in similar terms for much longer and perhaps recommendation of so respected an officer was just impetus he needed year 1864 was a disastrous one for confederacy with lee forced within siege lines at petersburg and union general william t sherman sacking atlanta and devastating georgia on his march to sea benjamin urged davis to send secretary s fellow louisianan duncan kenner to paris and london with an offer of emancipation in exchange for recognition davis was only willing to offer gradual emancipation and both napoleon and palmerston rejected proposal benjamin continued to press matter addressing a mass meeting in richmond in february 1865 in support of arming slaves and emancipating them a bill eventually emerged from confederate congress in march but it had many restrictions and it was too late to affect outcome of war in january 1865 lincoln who had been re elected previous november sent francis blair as an emissary to richmond hoping to secure reunion without further bloodshed both sides agreed to a meeting at fort monroe virginia benjamin drafted vague instructions for southern delegation led by vice president alexander stephens but davis insisted on modifying them to refer to north and south as two nations this was point that scuttled hampton roads conference lincoln would not consider south a separate entity insisting on union and emancipation escape by march 1865 confederate military situation was desperate most major population centers had fallen and general lee s defense of richmond was faltering against massive union forces nevertheless benjamin retained his usual good humor on evening of april 1 with evacuation likely he was at state department offices singing a silly ballad of his own composition exit from hill a graveyard district located in richmond on april 2 lee sent word that he could only keep union troops away from line of richmond and danville railroad for a short time those who did not leave richmond would be trapped at 11 00 pm that night confederate president and cabinet left aboard a danville bound train navy secretary stephen r mallory recorded that benjamin s hope and good humor was inexhaustible with a never give up ship sort of air referred to other great national causes which had been redeemed from far reverses than ours in danville benjamin shared a room with another refugee in home of a banker for a week danville served as capital of confederacy until word came of lee s surrender at appomattox court house with no army to shield confederate government it would be captured by union forces within days so davis and his cabinet including benjamin fled south to greensboro north carolina five minutes after train passed over haw river union cavalry raiders burned bridge trapping trains that followed davis s greensboro fearing wrathful reprisal from union gave fugitives little hospitality forcing benjamin and other cabinet members to bunk in a railroad boxcar davis hoped to reach texas where rumor had it large confederate forces remained active cabinet met in greensboro and generals beauregard and joseph e johnston sketched bleak military situation davis backed as usual by benjamin was determined to continue to fight refugee government moved south on april 15 with train tracks cut most cabinet members rode on horseback but heavyset benjamin declared he would not ride on one until he had to and shared an ambulance with jules st martin and others for entertainment of his companions benjamin recited tennyson s ode on death of duke of wellington in charlotte benjamin stayed in home of a jewish merchant as surrender negotiations dragged here benjamin abandoned davis s plan to fight on telling him and cabinet that cause was hopeless when negotiations failed benjamin was part of shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with davis party reached abbeville south carolina on may 2 and benjamin told davis that he wanted to separate from presidential party temporarily and go to bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining davis in texas according to historian william c davis pragmatic secretary of state almost certainly never had any intention of returning to south once gone when he bade john reagan goodbye postmaster general asked where benjamin was going to farthest place from united states if it takes me to middle of china with one companion benjamin travelled south in a poor carriage pretending to be a frenchman who spoke no english he had some gold with him and left much of it for support of relatives he was traveling in same general direction as davis party but evaded capture whereas davis was taken by union troops benjamin reached monticello florida on may 13 to learn union troops were in nearby madison benjamin decided to continue alone on horseback east and south along florida s gulf coast pretending to be a south carolina farmer john t lesley james mckay and c j munnerlyn assisted in hiding benjamin in a swamp before eventually transporting him to gamble mansion in ellenton on southwest coast of florida from there assisted by blockade runner captain archibald mcneill he reached bimini in bahamas his escape from florida to england was not without hardship at one point he pretended to be a jewish cook on mcneill s vessel to deceive american soldiers who inspected it one of whom stated it was first time he had seen a jew do menial labor small sponge carrying vessel on which he left bimini bound for nassau exploded on way and he and three black crewmen eventually managed to return to bimini mcneill s ship was still there and he chartered it to take him to nassau from there he took a ship for havana and on august 6 1865 left there for britain he was not yet done with disaster his ship caught fire after departing st thomas and crew put out flames only with difficulty on august 30 1865 judah benjamin arrived at southampton in britain exile benjamin spent a week in london assisting mason in winding up confederate affairs he then went to paris to visit his wife and daughter for first time since before war friends in paris urged him to join a mercantile firm there but benjamin felt that such a career would be subject to interference by seward and united states accordingly benjamin sought to shape his old course in a new country resuming his legal career as an english barrister most of benjamin s property had been destroyed or confiscated and he needed to make a living for himself and his relatives he had money in united kingdom as he had during war purchased cotton for transport to liverpool by blockade runner on january 13 1866 benjamin enrolled at lincoln s inn and soon thereafter was admitted to read law under charles pollock son of chief baron charles edward pollock who took him as a pupil at his father s direction benjamin despite his age of 54 was initially required like his thirty years younger peers to attend for twelve terms that is three years according to benjamin s obituary in times though secretary of confederacy was dispensed from regular three years of unprofitable dining and called to bar on june 6 1866 once qualified as a barrister benjamin chose to join northern circuit as it included liverpool where his connections in new orleans and knowledge of mercantile affairs would do him most good in an early case he defended two former confederate agents against a suit by united states to gain assets said to belong to that nation although he lost that case united states v wagner on appeal he was successful against his former enemies in united states v mcrae 1869 he had need of rapid success as most of his remaining assets were lost in collapse of firm of gurney and company he was reduced to penning columns on international affairs for daily telegraph according to justice ruth bader ginsburg repeating his louisiana progress benjamin made his reputation among his new peers by publication in an early representation he wrote a complex governing document for an insurance firm that other counsel had declined despite substantial fee due to early deadline after brief study benjamin wrote out document never making a correction or erasure in 1868 benjamin published a treatise on law of sale of personal property with reference to american decisions to french code and civil law this work known for short as benjamin on sales became a classic in both britain and america and launched his career as a barrister it went through three editions prior to benjamin s death in 1884 an eighth edition was published in 2010 today benjamin s sale of goods forms part of common law library of key practitioner texts on english civil law in 1867 benjamin had been indicted in richmond along with davis lee and others for waging war against united states indictment was soon quashed davis visited london in 1868 free on bail and benjamin advised him not to take legal action against author of a book that had angered davis as it would only give book publicity benjamin corresponded with davis and met with him on former rebel president s visits to europe during benjamin s lifetime though two were never as close as they had been during war benjamin was created a palatine silk entitled to precedence of a queen s counsel within lancashire in july 1869 there was a large creation of queen s counsel in early 1872 but benjamin was not included it was stated in his times obituary that he had put his name forward later that year he argued case of potter v rankin before house of lords and so impressed lord hatherley that a patent of precedence was soon made out giving benjamin privileges of a queen s counsel as he became prominent as a barrister he discontinued practice before juries at which he was less successful in favor of trials or appeals before judges in his last years in practice he demanded an additional fee of 100 guineas ps105 to appear in any court besides house of lords and privy council in 1875 he was made a bencher of lincoln s inn in 1881 benjamin represented arthur orton tichborne claimant before house of lords orton a butcher from wagga wagga new south wales had claimed to be sir roger tichborne a baronet who had vanished some years previously and orton had perjured himself in course of defending his claim benjamin sought to overturn sentence of 14 years passed on orton but was not successful thumb benjamin s grave at pere lachaise cemetery in paris in his final years benjamin suffered from health issues in 1880 he was badly injured in a fall from a tram in paris he also developed diabetes he suffered a heart attack in paris at end of 1882 and his doctor ordered him to retire his health improved enough to allow him to travel to london in june 1883 for a dinner in his honor attended by english bench and bar he returned to paris and suffered a relapse of his heart trouble in early 1884 natalie benjamin had last rites of catholic church administered to her jewish husband before his death in paris on may 6 1884 and funeral services were held in a church prior to judah benjamin s interment at pere lachaise cemetery in st martin family crypt his grave did not bear his name until 1938 when a plaque was placed by paris chapter of united daughters of confederacy appraisal benjamin was first u s senator to profess jewish faith in 1845 david yulee born david levy had been sworn in for florida but he renounced judaism and eventually formally converted to christianity as an adult benjamin was a jew who was not a member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs he rarely spoke of his religion publicly but was not ashamed of it some of stories told of benjamin that touch on his faith come from rabbi isaac mayer wise who related that benjamin delivered an address in a san francisco synagogue on yom kippur in 1860 though whether this occurred is open to question as wise was not there and it was not reported in city s jewish newspaper one quote from senate debate that remains part of benjamin legend according to evans followed an allusion to moses as a freer of slaves by a northern senator hinting that benjamin was an israelite in egyptian clothing benjamin is supposed to have replied it is true that i am a jew and when my ancestors were receiving their ten commandments from immediate hand of deity amidst and lightnings of mount sinai ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in forests of great britain edgar m kahn in his journal article on 1860 california sojourn wrote benjamin s life is an example of a man s determination to overcome almost insurmountable barriers by industry perseverance and intelligent use of a remarkable brain this brilliance was recognized by contemporaries salomon de rothschild in 1861 deemed benjamin greatest mind in north america nevertheless according to meade he was given to quixotic enthusiasms and was sometimes too cocksure of his knowledge ginsburg said of benjamin he rose to top of legal profession twice in one lifetime on two continents beginning his first ascent as a raw youth and his second as a fugitive minister of a vanquished power davis after benjamin s death deemed him most able member of his cabinet and said that lawyer s postwar career had fully vindicated his confidence in him left thumb memorial plaque to benjamin gamble plantation historic state park ellenton florida according to brook in every age a heroic sage struggles to rescue benjamin from obscurity and invariably fails benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers by which task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious after his death benjamin was rarely written about in contrast to davis and other confederate leaders part of this was due to benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material but even davis in his two volume war memoir mentions him only twice evans suggests that as davis wrote books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history it would not have been characteristic of him to give much credit to benjamin davis in midst of postwar business struggles may have resented benjamin s success as a barrister or may have feared that allegations of involvement in lincoln s assassination would again be made against two men brook concurs that benjamin s postwar success that began as davis lay in prison and other confederates struggled for survival may have soured southerners towards former secretary but that anti semitism was also likely a factor for guardians of confederate memory after reconstruction benjamin became a kind of pet jew generally ignored but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend segregated south against charges of bigotry those writing on jewish history were reluctant to glorify a slaveowner and reacted to benjamin s story with embarrassed dismay this was especially so in two generations following 1865 when question of civil war remained an active issue in american politics it was not until 1930s that benjamin began to be mentioned as a significant figure in history of united states and in chronicle of jews there nevertheless tom mountain in his 2009 article on benjamin points out that benjamin was respected in south as a leader of rebel cause for a century after civil war and that southern schoolchildren who could not name current secretary of state in washington knew about benjamin reform rabbi daniel polish noted in 1988 that benjamin represent ed a significant dilemma in my years growing up as a jew both proud of his people and with an intense commitment to ideals of liberalism and human solidarity that i found embodied in civil rights movement berman recounts a story that during civil war benjamin was called to torah at beth synagogue in richmond however there is no proof of this nor does benjamin s name appear in any surviving record of jews of that city but whether or not benjamin practiced judaism overtly or contributed to jewish causes to jews of south he was a symbol of a who was a man among men according to evans benjamin survives as he willed it a shadowy figure in civil war history kahn noted that benjamin is epitomized as a foremost orator lawyer and statesman without a peer at bars of two of world s greatest nations meade questioned whether benjamin s character can ever be fully understood see also oscar straus politician first jewish member of united states cabinet list of united states senators born
