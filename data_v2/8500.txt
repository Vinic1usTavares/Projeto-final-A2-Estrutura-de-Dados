1992 cape mendocino earthquakes or 1992 petrolia earthquakes occurred along lost coast of northern california on april 25 and 26 three largest events were m7 2 thrust mainshock that struck near unincorporated community of petrolia midday on april 25 and two primary strike slip aftershocks measuring 6 5 and 6 6 that followed early next morning sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that was associated with mendocino triple junction a complex system of three major faults including cascadia subduction zone san andreas fault and mendocino fracture zone that converge near cape mendocino total number of aftershocks that followed events exceeded 2 000 three shocks damaged and destroyed homes and businesses in humboldt county and injured up to 356 people but single largest loss was due to a post earthquake fire that consumed a business center in scotia accelerometers that had been in place in cape mendocino area since late 1970s recorded event and readings were moderate to strong with exception of instruments closest to epicenter which went off scale a few seconds into recording no surface ruptures were present in epicentral area but landslides closed roads and railroad tracks for at least a week while cleanup took place also discovered was about of coastal uplift near cape mendocino and punta gorda as largest earthquake in california since 1989 loma prieta event several years earlier mainshock caused a non destructive tsunami that quickly reached coast and eventually alaska and hawaii several hours later tsunami was significant not because of its run up but because of speed with which it reached coast and for how long waves persisted other strong earthquakes have affected same area with some that were clearly associated with interplate mendocino fracture zone and others like two shocks on april 26 were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within gorda plate but events that are unequivocally associated with cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent tectonic setting northernmost coastal area is one of california s most seismically active regions and in a 50 year period area including mendocino fracture zone at southern flank of gorda plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in state mendocino triple junction strike slip strike slip trench formed 29 30 mya at 31deg n west of present day baja california when pacific farallon spreading center initially approached subduction zone off coast of western north america simultaneously rivera triple junction shifted to southeast to its current position at 23deg n once pacific plate and north american plate connected boundary became that of a transform fault san andreas due to northwestward motion of pacific plate relative to north american plate san andreas fault continues to lengthen to northwest and southeast as two triple junctions continue their transient motion north of mendocino triple junction gorda plate is subducting beneath north american plate at cascadia subduction zone with a convergence rate of per year but comparisons with other subduction zones have led to a belief that convergence may be taking place distinct lack of interplate events there has generated contention regarding zone s seismic hazard though there are strong indications that substantial historic events have occurred in pacific northwest submerged wetlands and raised marine terraces both illustrate presence of past events and radiocarbon dating of rock layers has revealed that three seismic events took place in last 2 000 years with most recent event being 1700 cascadia earthquake gorda plate is undergoing a process of intraplate deformation and experiences large intraplate earthquakes that may be result of north south compression of oceanic crust along mendocino fracture zone earthquakes region near triple junction experiences high seismicity with more than 60 earthquakes of intensity vi strong or greater or magnitudes 5 5 since 1853 mainshock in sequence 11 06 a m pacific daylight time occurred onshore west of petrolia at a depth of 10 5 kilometers and was among an infrequent number of earthquakes with fault plane solutions that conveyed evidence of slip at cascadia subduction zone while focal mechanism indicated slip on a thrust fault striking n with a shallow dip of 13deg to east northeast rupture most likely propagated to west based on mainshock location at southeastern boundary of aftershock zone investigation of more than 1 200 surveys from north coast area led to assignment of an intensity rating of ix violent on modified mercalli scale for region near petrolia in opposition to mainshock that was located onshore two large strike slip aftershocks occurred following morning 12 41 a m and 4 18 a m pdt and were located offshore to west of main shock within gorda plate both shocks m6 5 and 6 6 were of intensity viii severe occurred at a depth of and exhibited right lateral motion of several thousand aftershocks in sequence none were found to have occurred on mendocino fracture zone but numerous events were located on eastward projection of that fault mainshock s rupture duration was described as a smooth nine seconds while two aftershocks had more complex and slightly longer ruptures of 14 15 seconds that two strike slip events followed a thrust event indicated a strong coupling of stresses at north american and gorda plate boundaries and underscored convoluted nature of interconnected faults in that area damage thumb left cars crushed by a fallen brick facade in ferndale california initial event caused a number of wood framed homes in scotia to come off their foundations while porches of some other homes became detached 25 mw cogeneration plant there that used wood waste products to power both lumber company and town suffered damage and both lumber mills were shut down for several weeks in rio dell across eel river from scotia glass store fronts along main street were shattered and numerous buildings slipped into a culvert along monument road in petrolia small community closest to epicenter general store combined with a post office and gas station was destroyed by fire and in fortuna damage totaled 4 million a six figure portion of that figure was due to losses at high school s gymnasium two aftershocks following morning were separated by less than four hours and both caused at least as much damage as mainshock a large fire was triggered following first aftershock at a shopping center in scotia that destroyed four businesses with resulting damage at that site alone estimated at 15 million and was largest individual financial misfortune of sequence of earthquakes water supply in rio dell was terminated when water main was severed at abutment to eel river bridge and power outages were widespread throughout humboldt county some were mere seconds while others lasted for hours but hydroelectric plant s performance at ruth reservoir was deemed acceptable and power that was not generated locally was unaffected thumb alford nielson house fell off its foundation in quake o brien 1993 p 81 damage estimates were as high as 75 million one third of which was due to bridges and roads and remainder of costs were structure related american red cross compiled damage statistics in county and totals included 906 damaged homes and apartments almost half of those were severely damaged and an additional 200 homes were destroyed in petrolia post office three businesses and 44 homes were destroyed and another 68 residences were damaged in ferndale 29 homes were destroyed and 126 were damaged along with 51 businesses in rio dell 127 buildings were damaged or destroyed with 98 homes and 41 businesses experiencing some form of damage city of fortuna experienced losses totaling 3 8 million eureka and arcata north of eel river valley saw light damage and no injuries while unincorporated communities of and carlotta reported damage of less than 2 million combined strong motion as largest earthquake in california since october 1989 event in santa cruz mountains mainshock near petrolia produced some of highest ground motions ever recorded at that time by california strong motion instrumentation program csmip fourteen existing csmip stations comprising 84 strong motion sensors recorded event ten of which were ground response stations remaining four were located on structures including a highway 101 overpass in rio dell a dam a one story supermarket in fortuna and a 5 story residential building in eureka supermarket residential building and dam were 28 50 and 75 kilometers distant from epicenter respectively and recorded peak accelerations of 46g and 15g an at painter street overpass a concrete bridge from epicenter recorded a free field acceleration of and an instrument on structure saw an amplified peak of 1 during mainshock csmip cape mendocino station was installed in 1978 and was located just from epicenter on slope of a ridge in coast ranges instruments there had been mounted on a concrete platform adjacent to a roadway and remained firmly secured to rock platform following shocks a landslide came within of device and left debris on road but a lack of large rocks close to instrument and no cracking of rocks near platform left geologists with no clear explanation for extraordinarily high vertical component reading of 1 tri axial analog accelerometer that was in use was physically limited to that value and all three traces had uniformly significant values at three seconds into recording a post earthquake lab test of seismometer and an inspection of photographically enlarged accelerogram revealed that limit was hit twice with a maximum deflection of 31 mm as needle bounced off unit s mass an extrapolation of vertical record led to a maximum acceleration estimate of 2 2g for that site and unit was eventually replaced with a higher capacity digital device ground effects thumb left a landslide west of ferndale sequence of earthquakes caused widespread landslides from coast to east of scotia and from northern extent of eel river basin near thompson hill to south of petrolia most of these were existing landslides that had been re initiated and largest of slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along coastal bluffs several slump failures between guthrie creek and oil creek stretched from bluffs out towards shore for a distance of leaving some of slide to be eroded by surf road between ferndale and petrolia was closed for more than a week where about six mostly minor landslides blocked passage with roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of road fill in a few instances one of largest slides occurred along railroad tracks at scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place that slide also took about a week to clear during a survey following earthquake evidence of coastal uplift was detected when dead and decomposing intertidal organisms were discovered along beaches in epicentral region further investigation revealed that a portion of shoreline between cape mendocino and near punta gorda had been uplifted by as much as near middle portion and decreasing amounts near outer portions of affected area evidence of previous events has been found in form of sequential marine terraces along coast with periodic events creating shelves at 300 1 700 3 000 and 5 000 years before present no surface ruptures were found during aerial surveillance but lateral spreading features were observed on a channel near mouth of eel river tsunami mainshock generated a small tsunami that was recorded by national oceanic and atmospheric administration s sea level gauge stations on coasts of northern california oregon and hawaii series of waves first came ashore at north spit station in eureka after a 26 minute travel time but largest surges were seen just to north at crescent city and arrived close to low tide a condition that would have lowered risk had surges had a destructive capacity first packet of energy reached that location in 47 minutes and had a maximum wave height of and a second larger packet arrived later with a maximum amplitude of waves were also detected to south in interior of san francisco bay at alameda but with a considerable delay 135 minutes after mainshock due to shallow waters of bay and shelf surrounding bay s entrance speed a tsunami travels is directly related to depth of water in which it is traversing tsunami was detected farther to south in monterey for example after just a 64 minute travel time due to deeper offshore waters and those in monterey bay at distant tsunami was perceptible on hawaiian island of maui at kahului location of islands lay on a great circle route that is also perpendicular to region of presumed uplifted land at coast near cape mendocino and any energy distributed would be strongest in that direction no tsunami was detected at johnston atoll from cape mendocino in north pacific ocean but bottom pressure recorders registered a maximum amplitude of in of water in gulf of alaska with 3 75 hours of travel time while waves generated by earthquake were limited event demonstrated rapid onset of tsunami hazards giving little time for coastal residents to prepare and in this case strongest waves came ashore in crescent city three to four hours after initial surge but it is possible to be just opposite where first waves could be strongest also detailed from this event was that wave hazard can be of long duration with wave action lingering for more than eight hours other events mendocino fault is seismically active with mostly small and moderate earthquakes but largest event that was unequivocally associated with fault was m6 9 earthquake on september 1 1994 at 125 8 w longitude aftershocks of that event with corresponding dextral strike slip focal mechanisms occurred farther to east and close to mendocino triple junction another large event 7 3 7 6 occurred on january 31 1922 with an aftershock of m7 next day but sources of these shocks could not be determined with any precision as first seismographs did not arrive in area until 1932 due to their offshore epicenters all of these events caused little damage though were felt across a broad area previous gorda plate events include july 13 and august 17 1991 shocks of 6 8 and 7 1 and m7 3 event on november 10 1980 west of arcata references sources external links doom and gloom understanding potential geologic
