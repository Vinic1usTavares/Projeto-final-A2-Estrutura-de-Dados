long accustomed to stadiums sunday s show was most intimate performance most fans would see from ubiquitous superstar he highlighted how she split difference between hushed torch singer and stadium belter and favored her ability to display both stamina and vigor which make for a stadium perfect show newman concluded medley combined quick blasts of a las vegas revue with emotional candor of a singer songwriter performing to a near empty room it was an odd yet effective juxtaposition a global superstar who could effortlessly shuffle between slick bombastic r b and awkwardly honest confessions of a tumultuous career by end of set though humility as one expects from a singer with 16 grammy awards and more than 75 million records sold worldwide turned to sly confidence jon caramanica of new york times was impressed by show complimenting beyonce s performances of underdog tracks such as party and love on top he wrote in her performance it s always clear that a finely tuned engine is at work but what was refreshing here was that it was in service of a surprisingly casual manner she made funny exaggerated faces twirled her hair when it was not floating and spoke to crowd like a knowing buddy she was working off a teleprompter for her between song patter but improvising frequently and for better beyonce persevere s with a voice that skips up octaves and still gains power with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward with legs that treat stage floor like an enemy in need of a thorough stomping even in moments of uncertainty these are her constants they survive her missteps erika ramirez of billboard magazine wrote there aren t many artists in world that can pull off a 90 minute set in stuart weitzman heels and leave a beyond packed
