illustration by sidney paget of sherlock holmes from man with twisted lip adventures of sherlock holmes were well received upon their serialisation in strand magazine following publication of a scandal in bohemia in july 1891 hull daily mail described story as being worthy of inventive genius of doyle just over a year later when doyle took a break from publishing short stories upon completion of adventures of sherlock holmes a piece in belfast news letter reviewed a story by another author in strand magazine saying that it might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago but that unique power of doyle s writing was evident in gulf in quality between stories leeds mercury particularly praised characterisation of holmes with all his little foibles while in contrast cheltenham looker on described holmes as rather a bore sometimes noting that descriptions of his foibles grows wearisome correspondent for hampshire telegraph lamented fact that doyle s more thoughtful writing such as micah clarke was not so popular as holmes stories concluding that an author who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want adaptations sherlock holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays and character has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films a number of film and television series have borne title adventures of sherlock holmes but some of these are either original stories combinations of a number of doyle s stories or in one case an adaptation of sign of four irene adler who is in first short story a scandal in bohemia is prominent in many modern adaptations despite only appearing in one story often in modern adaptations she is portrayed as a love interest for holmes as in robert doherty s elementary and bbc s sherlock even though in story itself narration claims it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler in his sherlock holmes handbook christopher redmond notes canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a holmes adler connection many of stories from collection were included as episodes in granada television series sherlock holmes which ran from 1984 until 1994 adventures of sherlock holmes were dramatised for bbc radio 4 in 1990 1991 starring clive as holmes and michael williams as watson bert was head writer
