chevrolet cobalt ss comprises three sport compact versions of chevrolet cobalt that were built on general motors delta platform at lordstown assembly in ohio united states three versions included two forced induction inline four ecotec engines and a third naturally aspirated engine that was later called cobalt sport ss is an abbreviation of super sport a historic moniker used by chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades that meet certain criteria cobalt ss was gm s first foray into tuner market launching with a supercharged 2 0 l engine in late 2004 as a 2005 model paired only with f35 manual transmission of opel following year a naturally aspirated 1ss model equipped with gm s new 2 4 l engine was added it had both automatic and manual transmission options production of supercharged version continued until 2007 after a brief hiatus ss relaunched in second quarter of 2008 with a more economical and powerful turbocharged 2 0 l engine producing before all cobalt production ended in 2010 see timeline cobalt ss received generally positive reviews particularly turbocharged version in a 2013 review journalist patrick george called it best compact car ever made by general motors and a potential future classic at first release in 2004 supercharged version was praised for its performance but drew criticism for its interior quality and exterior styling both described as too reminiscent of its predecessor cavalier reports surfaced in may 2009 that general motors planned to eliminate cobalt ss as early as december 2009 but they proved to be untrue production continued but ordering options for late 2010 models were limited and production of all cobalts ended in june 2010 car was replaced by cruze but a high performance version comparable to cobalt ss was never announced and cruze ended production for north american market in 2019 model details overview general motors used five different inline four engines in cobalt over course of production and designated three as ss models first was launched in 2004 as a 2005 model with a new powertrain that had debuted one year earlier on saturn ion red line it was available as a supercharged coupe only naturally aspirated 2 4 l le5 engine was next ss to launch in late 2005 as a 2006 model available as both a coupe and sedan for duration of its run however in late 2007 at same time announcement cancelling ss supercharged was made gm also announced that 2 4 l would be renamed cobalt sport rendering chevrolet without a cobalt ss for first half of 2008 model year 2 0 l lnf turbocharged cobalt was last to launch in second quarter of 2008 it was initially available only as a coupe until a sedan option was offered for 2009 model year but again deleted for 2010 after less than 500 were produced all three models of cobalt ss feature four wheel anti lock disc brakes compared to base cobalt ss has lower front and rear fascias for a more aggressive look with integrated fog lights side rocker moldings interior accents and a chrome exhaust tip exclusive to 2 0 l cobalt are a titanium faced sport analogue cluster with a 160 mph 260 km h in canada speedometer an a pillar mounted boost gauge reclining front bucket seats with two tone leather appointed seating surfaces vertical adjusting head restraints and driver side lumbar and height adjusters and a sport tuned fe5 suspension with a 24 mm front stabilizer bar and 22 mm rear stabilizer bar ss supercharged thumb ss supercharged racing available as a coupe only ss supercharged featured 2 0 l lsj ecotec engine with an eaton m62 roots type supercharger and air to liquid intercooler engine makes at 5600 rpm and at 4 400 rpm 18 inch broad spoke wheels with p215 summer pirelli tires were standard optional for lsj was a performance package coded g85 that added bucket seats and a limited slip differential lsd lsd was optional for 2005 models performance package came with lsd and was standard in models from 2007 to 2010 g85 option continued in lnf cobalt but added only lsd car became notable for a high profile spoiler that was standard in 2005 but optional from 2008 when a lower profile spoiler used on all other cobalt coupes became an option gm offered dealer installed performance upgrade packages called stage kits that were covered by factory warranty stage 1 kit consists of new fuel injectors and a reprogram of ecu and yields up to a improvement stage 2 kit consists of new fuel injectors and same reprogram with a smaller serpentine belt and pulley for supercharger producing a improvement and of torque both kits increase engine redline to 7 000 rpm stage 3 kit consists of a smaller supercharger pulley a 2 pass intercooler end plate and a customizable replacement ecu stage 3 ecu allows for use of a 50 shot of nitrous 100 octane fuel and an adjustable redline from 6 750 to 8 000 rpm stage 3 produces using 93 octane fuel up using 100 octane fuel and much higher power with nitrous stage 3 is for track use only and to emphasize this air conditioning is disabled with stage 3 ecu wheel hop wheelspin and a general lack of traction were problems frequently encountered with supercharged cobalt due to its front drive setup and relatively high torque upgraded front and rear trans and motor mounts would help to alleviate these issues gm performance division later tried to rectify these problems in turbocharged car by providing wider tires and stronger axles ss turbocharged thumb ss turbocharged sedan racing lsj engine did not meet emissions requirements for 2008 model year and general motors contract with eaton had expired non supercharged 2 4 l cobalt ss also lost its super sport designation for 2008 model year and was renamed sport leaving no ss in production however in fall 2007 a more powerful cobalt ss was announced for second quarter of 2008 it would be equipped with 2 0 l turbocharged direct injected vvt lnf ecotec engine making at 5300 rpm and at 2 000 rpm remaining mated to f35 5 speed manual transmission engine had been introduced in a rear wheel drive application for 2007 gm kappa platform which includes saturn sky pontiac solstice and opel gt also new for 2008 ss were ss embroidered sport seats with suede like inserts several new exterior colors and wider forged split spoke wheels with p225 continental ag tires styled similarly to those offered for chevrolet corvette c6 car s electronics were also new and along with greater assist in poor traction conditions a no lift shift feature was added which allows driver to maintain turbocharger boost during shifts to a higher gear during a no lift shift driver begins shift normally by depressing clutch but accelerator pedal is held wide open while shift is completed also new was launch control which feathers throttle at roughly 4 800 rpm until engagement of clutch allowing more consistent launches in competitive situations to activate launch control driver presses twice on traction control button which first turns off traction control and then notifies driver through driver s information center that competitive mode is active and launch control is ready for use turbocharged cobalt owners have found that better times can be achieved while racing when car is manually launched these features help propel car from 0 to in 5 5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 13 9 seconds at new for 2009 was aforementioned four door sedan option as well as an optional reconfigurable performance display rpd for coupe only 295 option replaced boost gauge in a pillar and allows driver to manipulate traction control stability control shift points and engagement of competition mode as well as information regarding car s engine torque and horsepower g force boost wideband air fuel ratio barometric pressure temperature and battery voltage for 2010 rpd and a power sunroof were standard red ebony and grey ebony interior color options were also dropped as was turbocharged sedan a stage 1 kit which raises power to and was made available in october 2009 after several delays kit can be installed by owner of car but final alteration of vehicle s engine control unit must take place at a gm dealer thumb left a blue granite ss 2 4 l naturally aspirated coupe ss naturally aspirated chevrolet introduced a naturally aspirated cobalt ss in fall of 2005 as a 2006 model available as both a coupe and sedan it featured 2 4 l le5 ecotec engine with variable valve timing making at 5 600 rpm and at 5 000 rpm later upped to at 4 500 rpm le5 engine was paired with a 5 speed manual or optionally 4t45 4 speed automatic for 2006 and was introduced on both fwd delta platform and rwd kappa platform for 2006 and 2007 model years car was called ss or 1ss but was replaced with moniker cobalt sport for 2008 with anticipated introduction of turbocharged ss it is getrag f23 transmission with different ratios from f35 in forced induction cars and is same transmission that chevrolet mated to 2 2 l engine in cobalt ls and lt other changes over supercharged car are notable but not drastic 17 inch broad spoke wheels with narrower p205 50r17 all season pirelli tires were standard as was low profile spoiler 2 4 l and 2 2 l sport package cobalts have a 140 mph 220 km h in canada speedometer with optional white face gauges car rides on fe3 suspension superior and more sport tuned to that of base cobalts but less refined than fe5 on supercharged and turbocharged cars brakes on 2 4 l naturally aspirated and supercharged model are identical but turbocharged model received an upgraded brembo braking system front and rear bumpers are same but front lacks a lip accessory and bottom of rear fascia is slightly different with exception of exterior styling and some interior

supercharged cobalt ss were generally positive while cavalier received very negative reviews supercharged cobalt was seen as an improvement and a worthy first entry for gm into tuner market however general fit and finish was poor and power levels were not up to par with other competitors journalist thom blackett said when compared with more contemporary cars including dodge neon srt 4 and subaru that ss badge seems to lose some of its luster f35 transmission has also been deemed inferior to that in newest of generation of honda s civic si critics also disliked heavy wheels which negatively affected handling as well as spoiler which obstructed rearward visibility speaking of high profile aero wing automotive journalist alexandra straub said deck lid spoiler was directly in my line of sight when looking out of rearview mirror it s almost like it cut everything in half in his review of a later model john neff of autoblog called wing obnoxious some cobalt ss owners have traded spoilers with lower trim owners to obtain a less aggressive look or traded entire with cobalt ls owners for whom a rear spoiler is merely optional naturally aspirated cobalt ss has been seen as an improvement over base models with its slightly more potent 2 4 l engine but notably inferior to supercharged car powertrain of 2008 turbocharged cobalt ss received rave reviews john neff of autoblog said gm performance division completely reworked cobalt ss for 2008 swapping in a more powerful turbocharged engine upgrading rest of and tweaking entire package on world s most demanding race tracks including famed nurburgring in germany result is and we re not kidding here most impressive performance car to wear a bow tie badge on sale today journalists were impressed with performance of car in relation to price neff added that 2009 cobalt ss turbo is freakishly good at going fast and best bang for buck value below 30 000 ron of motor trend said at only 22 995 ss could stand for super steal msrp was raised to 24 095 for 2009 model year nurburgring tuned suspension gives cobalt ss some of best handling characteristics of any general motors front wheel drive vehicle and suspension is stiffer and more refined than supercharged car since interior is hardly changed other than seats those criticisms remain of interior in turbocharged sedan car and driver said it is constructed primarily of plastics cheap enough to be rejected from a chinese toy factory tata nano probably has a fancier parking brake lever new cobalt was winner in its price class under 30 000 of car and
