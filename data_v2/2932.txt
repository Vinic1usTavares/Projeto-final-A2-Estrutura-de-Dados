many sentiments also found in united states bill of rights although he was generally in minority during his early years in colony he served ten years as colonial governor most of them during delicate years of english restoration when king charles ii scrutinized behavior of colonial governments bellingham notably refused a direct order from king to appear in england an action that may have contributed to eventual revocation of colonial charter in 1684 he was twice married survived by his second wife and his only son samuel he died in 1672 leaving an estate in present day chelsea

bellingham immediately assumed a prominent role in colony serving on committee that oversaw affairs of boston a precursor to board of selectmen in this role he participated in division of community lands that included establishment of boston common goss p 263 not long after his arrival he purchased ferry service between boston and winnessimmett present day chelsea from samuel maverick along with tracts of land that encompass much of chelsea in addition to his mansion house in boston he also established a country home near ferry in winnessimmett watts et al pp 294 295 305 a house he built in

chosen to be on first board of overseers of harvard college morison p 189 he also contributed to development of colony s first legal code known as massachusetts body of liberties morison pp 226 229 this work was opposed and repeatedly stalled by winthrop who favored a common law approach to legislation in 1641 bellingham was elected governor for first time running against winthrop body of liberties was formally adopted during his term bremer p 305 however he served for just one year and was replaced by winthrop in 1642 moore pp 336 337 bellingham s defeat may have been caused in part by scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage a friend who was a guest in his house had been courting penelope pelham a young woman of twenty according to winthrop bellingham now 50 and a widower won her heart and without waiting for formalities of banns of marriage officiated at his own wedding when issue came before colonial magistrates bellingham as governor and chief magistrate refused to step down from bench to face charges thus bringing matter to a somewhat awkward end moore p 339 bellingham s term in office was characterized by winthrop as extremely difficult general court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of bellingham s unfriendliness to some other magistrates he set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings which did much to retard business partridge p 7 thumb left depiction of quaker mary dyer one of boston martyrs being led to her execution in 1640s constitutional issues concerning power of assistants arose in a case involving an escaped pig assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow s errant animal she appealed to general court which ruled in her favor assistants then asserted their right to veto general court s decision sparking controversy john winthrop argued that assistants as experienced magistrates must be able to check democratic institution of general court because a democracy is amongst most civil nations accounted meanest and worst of all forms of government morison p 92 bellingham was one of only two assistants other was richard saltonstall who opposed final decision that assistants veto should stand morison p 93 bellingham and saltonstall were often in a minority that opposed more conservative views of winthrop and thomas dudley moore p 340 in 1648 bellingham sat on a committee established to demonstrate that colony s legal codes were not repugnant to laws of england as called for by colonial charter bremer pp 305 376 in 1650 when bellingham was

years as governor and thirteen as deputy governor whitmore pp 16 17 while he was deputy to endecott in 1656 a boat carrying several quakers arrived in boston since endecott was in salem at time bellingham directed government s reaction to their arrival because quakerism was anathema to puritans quakers were confined to ship their belongings were searched and books promoting their religion were destroyed after five weeks of captivity they were sent back to england partridge p 9 during endecott s administration penalties for quakers defying banishment from colony were made progressively harsher until they included imposition of death penalty for repeat offenders under these laws four quakers were put to death for returning to colony after their banishment moore p 357 quaker historians have also been harsh in their assessments of bellingham goss p 264 after massachusetts authorities agreed that death penalty did not work it had long term negative consequences feeding perceptions of massachusetts intransigence law was modified to reduce penalties to branding and whipping palfrey p 2 p 383 english restoration 1640s and 1650s in england were a time of great turmoil english civil war led to establishment of commonwealth of england and eventually protectorate of oliver cromwell moore pp 323 328 in this period massachusetts was generally sympathetic to cromwell and parliamentary cause bremer p 335 with restoration of charles ii to throne in 1660 all of colonies and massachusetts in particular came under his scrutiny in 1661 he issued a mandamus forbidding further persecution of quakers moore p 162 he also requested specific changes to be made to massachusetts laws to increase suffrage and tolerance for other protestant religious practices actions that were resisted or ignored during endecott administration hart p 484 charles finally sent royal commissioners to new england in 1664 to enforce his demands but massachusetts of all new england colonies was most recalcitrant refusing all of substantive demands or enacting changes that only superficially addressed issues hart p 485 thumb left upright 0 5 this portrait was once claimed to be of bellingham its sitter and artist are unknown hayes pp 292 292 reaction by charles to this was to issue an order in 1666 demanding that bellingham since he was then governor and william speaker of general court travel to england to answer for colony s behavior issue of how to answer this demand divided colony with petitions from a cross section of colony s population calling for magistrates to obey king s demand bliss p 158 debate also introduced a long term rift in council of assistants between hardliners wanting to resist king s demands at all costs and moderates who thought king s demands should be accommodated doyle pp 150 151 bellingham sided with hardliners and decision was reached to send king a letter letter questioned whether request actually originated with king protested that colony was loyal to him and claimed magistrates had already explained fully why they were unable to comply with king s demands magistrates further pacified angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift new england was a valuable source of timber for royal navy partridge p 11 distracted by war with dutch and domestic politics charles did not pursue issue further
