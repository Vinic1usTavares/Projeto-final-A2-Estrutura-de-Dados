was disappointed his driver could not take victory if we hadn t had an opportunity to win i d say that finishing sixth and leading laps would be awesome but sitting where we are right now it seems

was unaware leaders had made pit stops nevertheless he said was happy with way his team ran race after retiring from race on lap 221 elliott blamed himself for collision with ragan saying he waited too long to react and was heavily committed to driving down racetrack he was also unable to remove his foot from his brake pedal ragan said he felt he should have passed roush fenway racing teammate

car flying i checked up we actually slowed down car and everything ten car or somebody came right in behind us and just pushed us through whole mess jeff gordon said he was fine after accident and
