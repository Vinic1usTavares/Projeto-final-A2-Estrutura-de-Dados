throgs neck bridge is a suspension bridge in new york city carrying six lanes of interstate 295 i 295 over east river where it meets long island sound bridge connects throggs neck section of bronx with bay terrace section of queens opened on january 11 1961 it is newest bridge across east river and was built to relieve traffic on bronx whitestone bridge to west throgs neck bridge is also easternmost crossing of east river due to this and its proximity to i 95 it is closest route from long island to new jersey via george washington bridge as well as points north throgs neck bridge is owned by government of new york city and operated by triborough bridge and tunnel authority tbta an affiliate agency of metropolitan transportation authority mta description thumb left anchorage left and suspension tower right on queens side of throgs neck bridge throgs neck bridge was designed by structural engineer othmar ammann who also designed george washington bronx whitestone verrazzano narrows and triborough bridges in new york city it connects boroughs of queens to south and bronx to north and is third vehicular bridge to be constructed between queens and bronx after triborough and bronx whitestone bridges bridge is a suspension bridge with six lanes three in each direction each three lane roadway is wide and two directions of traffic are divided by a barrier roadway is paved with asphalt there is no pedestrian or bicyclist access of any kind throgs neck bridge is a toll bridge it originally had tollbooths on bronx side but they were replaced by open road tolling gantries in 2017 design throgs neck bridge was not bound by any maritime constraints and as a result did not need to be as long as other ammann designed bridges in new york city center span is and distance between each suspension tower and anchorage is with an anchorage to anchorage total length of bridge contains two long approach ramps one on either bank because both bronx and queens are located on low elevations throgs neck bridge has a approach ramp in bronx curving over suny maritime college at fort schuyler on throggs neck peninsula as well as a ramp directly east of s point in bay terrace queens including approaches bridge spans more than span is supported by two main cables which suspend deck and are held up by suspension towers each main cable contains 37 strands with each strand made of 296 individual wires for a total of 10 952 wires per main cable main cables weigh each at each end of suspension span are two anchorages that hold main cables both of which are freestanding concrete structures measuring bridge s bronx anchorage is at tip of throggs neck and towers are located in middle of long island sound queens anchorage is located off shore of fort totten in east river suspension towers of throgs neck bridge are of closed box construction with arched struts at top of each tower tops of suspension towers are sharp and blocky atop struts and there are flattened segmental arches on underside of struts both suspension towers are located on artificial concrete islands in east river which are above mean high water each suspension tower rises above islands or above mean high water peregrine falcons have lived high on a suspension tower since at least 1983 when they were first spotted they are thought to have nested there because tops of towers resembled their natural habitat of high cliffs instead of employing a rather streamlined looking plate girder system ammann constructed throgs neck bridge with stiffening transverse trusses under deck these served as counterweights to bridge and allowed any wind to simply blow through instead of against bridge asphalt roadway lies atop a deck which consists of dozens of panels that lie directly above trusses road connections throgs neck bridge was one of few that were not part of plans for belt parkway around queens and brooklyn instead bridge was built along with clearview expressway in queens and eastern part of cross bronx expressway in bronx throgs neck bridge carries interstate 295 i 295 on queens side bridge connects to southbound clearview expressway i 295 and eastbound cross island parkway there is no direct connection to westbound cross island parkway or from cross island parkway service roads in either direction on bronx side there are connections to and from community of throggs neck northbound entrance and exit leads to throgs neck expressway service road while southbound exit and entrance leads from intersection of throgs neck expressway service road and harding avenue immediately afterward highway splits into throgs neck expressway i 695 which connects to northbound i 95 and i 295 which connects to southbound i 95 westbound i 278 and northbound hutchinson river parkway at bruckner interchange traffic restrictions throgs neck bridge has a height limit of for southbound vehicles and for northbound vehicles maximum width of any vehicle is tractor trailers exceeding 53 feet and traveling between long island and bronx are required to use throgs neck bridge a weight limit is imposed on heavy vehicles traveling on bridge mta allows 6 and 7 axle trucks with less than of gross vehicle weight and 5 axle trucks with less than of gross vehicle weight if they have valid divisible load permits trucks carrying less than may also use bridge but all heavy loads are speed restricted to and must use center lane of bridge heavy trucks carrying more than 80 000 lb without permits are prohibited from using throgs neck bridge name name of throgs neck in bridge s name derives from john throckmorton who first settled throggs neck traditionally correct spelling is with two g s robert moses chairman of triborough bridge and tunnel authority tbta which built bridge likely chose variant with one g because it was easier to spell history thumb left aerial view seen from bronx side planning plans for a bridge between throggs neck and queens date to a 1932 study by engineer j franklin perrine however he discarded proposed throggs neck to queens span because it would have required construction of new highways at either end throgs neck bridge s construction was announced in january 1955 by port authority and tbta as part of port authority s joint study of arterial facilities a plan to improve highway access in new york city area equal to billion in plan also included construction of verrazzano narrows bridge addition of a second deck to george washington bridge and completion of connecting highways in and around city throgs neck bridge was to cost span was needed because of increasing congestion on bronx whitestone bridge west which was nearing its traffic capacity by late 1950s traffic loads on triborough and bronx whitestone bridges had more than doubled on both bridges after world war ii city and port authority came to a provisional agreement for highway arterial plan in late march 1955 and plan was officially approved by new york state legislature two weeks later initially bridge approach on queens side was controversial because of number of people who would be displaced and there were proposals to scrap bridge entirely in september 1956 queens borough leaders agreed on location for queens approach of throgs neck bridge from queens anchorage approach would descend to a point east of clearview golf course approximately between 206th and 207th streets and continue south as clearview expressway this routing would displace 421 homes compared to 860 in original plan shortly after arterial plan was approved drivers on triborough and bronx whitestone bridges were surveyed in order to assess demand for throgs neck bridge however by february 1956 funding for throgs neck bridge had not yet been acquired in january 1957 port authority provided 13million in funding for new york city arterial plan and new york state government gave another thumb upright 1 2 view from north tower with funding secured throgs neck bridge was ready for start of construction then at end of march 1957 new york state legislature suddenly changed approach route for throgs neck and narrows bridges without city s knowledge city then decided to defer any decision on either bridge for a year because both bridges approaches would require potentially controversial home relocations one plan had throgs neck bridge approach in queens connect directly to a road paralleling cross island parkway rather than to proposed clearview expressway tbta officials warned that throgs neck bridge could not be approved for construction until an approach route was finalized revised approach routes for both narrows and throgs neck bridges were approved that june which allowed construction on both crossings to begin as a result of revisions to clearview expressway approach cost estimate for throgs neck bridge increased to 126million city approved construction of bridge that july a final obstacle was removed in august when united states senate passed a bill stating that construction of proposed bridge over suny maritime college at fort schuyler was not a breach of a prior land conveyance and authorized united states army to give new york state government some land for bridge s construction suny maritime college would receive of land in exchange for an easement to allow bridge to be constructed over college construction thumb left empire state vi moored to north of bridge tbta chairman moses commissioned othmar ammann for construction of throgs neck bridge this was ammann s first long span bridge project since 1931 which saw dedication of george washington bridge over hudson river a groundbreaking ceremony for throgs neck bridge occurred at suny maritime college on october 22 1957 at time approach roads alone were expected to cost nearly half of total bridge cost it was expected that bridge would be complete by 1961 a month later six construction contracts worth 42 5million were awarded representing nearly half of span s cost contract for suspension towers metal was awarded to bethlehem steel at a cost of 10 2million and contract for towers concrete went to merrit chapman and scott for 7 5million suspension cables would then be built by u s steel for 6 3million work on queens anchorage began in march 1958 steel caissons for throgs neck bridge were shipped up east river that summer steel assembly for first of two suspension towers were installed in april 1959 afterward suspension towers were installed in pieces each piece measured tall by around work on towers proceeded quickly by september 1959 bronx suspension tower was fully completed and queens tower was 60 completed however a steelworkers strike in october 1959 threatened to delay further completion by january 1960 both towers of throgs neck bridge had been completed and first wire between two suspension towers had been installed this cable marked location of future bridge deck but in interim it would be one of six wires that would support temporary catwalks between suspension towers spinning of main cables between tops of each suspension tower began in march wires for cables were spun from reels near base of bridge and then pulled across to opposite side by two wheels one at each bridge tower cables were fully spun by june 1960 and vertical suspender cables connecting main cables with deck were installed steel girder sections that comprised bridge deck were prefabricated at another location and then shipped to site of throgs neck bridge each section measured and weighed sections were installed on bridge at a rate of two per day installation of deck started at each suspension tower and continued outward in either direction extending toward center and approach viaducts on each side afterward concrete was poured atop steel sections steelwork for roadway was completed in summer 1960 and work on constructing throgs neck bridge s approaches progressed simultaneously queens approach viaduct had been completed up to suspension span in september 1960 final work on bridge consisted of sheathing main cables as well as paving roadway with asphalt by december 1960 tollbooths for bridge were being installed and a definite opening date had been set for next month opening and early years thumb view of queens approach from ground level throgs neck bridge opened with a short ceremony on january 11 1961 its total construction cost had been 92million bridge opened along with a segment of clearview expressway southward to 73rd avenue in fresh meadows as well as cross bronx and throgs neck expressways in bronx bridge s opening was attended by robert moses as well as mayor robert f wagner jr lieutenant governor malcolm wilson city council president abe stark and queens borough president john t clancy opening of throgs neck bridge had been accelerated in advance of start of 1964 new york world s fair at nearby flushing meadows corona park immediately after bridge s opening ceremony delegation attended opening of a world s fair attraction at flushing meadows corona park bridge s opening drew protests from homeowners in queens who had been forced to relocate due to construction of clearview expressway several dozen women walked across bridge holding signs and attempting to block first vehicles driving on bridge it was expected that throgs neck bridge s opening would initially cause 15million vehicles annually to be diverted to span from other bridges and by 1981 bridge would carry 37 5million vehicles annually within first twelve hours of bridge s opening 20 000 vehicles had used bridge throgs neck bridge had carried 16 4million vehicles by end of year and bronx whitestone bridge recorded a corresponding 40 decline in traffic in 1961 throgs neck bridge was originally designated as part of i 78 which extended south to hillside avenue ny 25 southern terminus of clearview expressway i 78 was to continue south and west across queens brooklyn and manhattan to holland tunnel ultimately nearly all sections of i 78 between holland tunnel and hillside avenue were canceled by governor nelson rockefeller in 1971 this resulted in renumbering of all of i 78 north of hillside avenue including throgs neck bridge to i 295 on january 1 1970 later years throgs neck bridge s deck was renovated in 1983 that july mta initially signed a contract to use steel imported from japan and south korea around same time that governor mario cuomo signed a buy american law giving preference to american steel contract was controversial because although importing asian steel would have been 3 5million cheaper than buying american steel it would have also disadvantaged american workers subsequently cuomo tried to get mta to reverse its decision in september 1983 cuomo signed an executive order mandating use of american steel and mta narrowly voted to reverse its prior decision construction of throgs neck bridge s queens approaches bisected clearview park renamed little bay park in 1973 which had been established by new york city department of parks and recreation in 1950 park s athletic fields received a 666 000 refurbishment in 1998 and a bicycle path and roller hockey rink were installed in 1999 at a cost of 1 2million after a june 2005 inspection of throgs neck bridge damage was found on approach viaducts damage was found to be more severe away from median barrier as a result heavy trucks carrying over 40 tons were permitted to use bridge only between 11 00 p m and 5 00 a m when traffic was lightest program was canceled in 2007 and overweight vehicles were only allowed to use bridge with a special permit heavy trucks carrying less than as well as selected heavy trucks carrying more than with permits may use throgs neck bridge all other trucks are restricted tolls drivers pay 9 50 per car or 4 00 per motorcycle for tolls by mail e zpass users with transponders issued by new york e zpass customer service center pay 6 12 per car or 2 66 per motorcycle all e zpass users with transponders not issued by new york e zpass csc will be required to pay toll by mail rates originally toll plaza of throgs neck bridge located on bronx side contained 14 toll lanes by 1996 year that e zpass was introduced it had been expanded to 20 lanes initial rollout of e zpass at throgs neck bridge caused large delays as some of toll lanes were dedicated exclusively to e zpass users unlike at other mta crossings that did not have dedicated e zpass lanes in february 1998 mta discontinued sale of toll tokens on throgs neck bridge throggs neck residents stated that they could not easily access e zpass lanes from harding avenue entrance to bridge as e zpass lanes were located toward center of tollbooth while bridge entrance was on far right side open road cashless tolling began on september 30 2017 tollbooths which were at bronx end of bridge have been gradually dismantled and drivers are no longer able to pay cash at bridge instead cameras and e zpass readers are mounted on new overhead gantries near where booths were located a vehicle without e zpass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for toll is mailed
