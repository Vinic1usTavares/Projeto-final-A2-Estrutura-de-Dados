sense of foreboding use of homonym who do is an allusion to hoodoo a louisiana mississippi folk magic belief that events can be influenced by its use however bo diddley uses imagery more common to american southwest combined with exaggerated bravado he explained that first line i got forty seven miles of barbed wire came to him quickly but i couldn t get a rhyme for it i thought of car tires and mule trains and i couldn t get anything to fit then one day i said use a cobra snake and my drummer clifton james added for a necktie these are directed at a female he is trying to woo who do you love me or him lyrics confirm effect arlene took me by my hand she said oo ee daddy i understand who do you love composition and recording musically who do you love is an uptempo song centered on one chord a with guitar flourishes that complement vocals it has a strong rhythm but unlike later interpretations it does not use typical bo diddley beat instead song uses a modified cut shuffle beat or 2

hawkins vocal as low and hard achieving all that rock n roll could do hawks robbie robertson s guitar playing is prominent in recording and has been noted by several music writers critic richie unterberger described it as a good few years ahead of its time in its manic distorted intensity robertson s style has been compared to that of blues guitarist willie johnson who was a key contributor to howlin wolf s early 1950s sound longtime howlin wolf guitarist hubert sumlin s 1961 solo on wang dang doodle has been suggested as inspiring robertson however gillett notes robertson s guitar style
