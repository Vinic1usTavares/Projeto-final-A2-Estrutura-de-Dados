strong wind shear in north atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant development of system as it traveled towards west northwest little convection was associated with disturbance as a result of shear while approaching bahamas on august 22 an upper level trough moved away from system which led to a decrease in wind shear disturbance then entered this environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified on august 23 low had become sufficiently organized to be declared tropical depression four later that day depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given name barry by national hurricane center nhc about 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60 mph 95 km h barry then began a westerly course towards central florida however wind shear began to increase causing system to weaken nhc downgraded storm back to a tropical depression on august 25 barry made landfall near melbourne florida same
