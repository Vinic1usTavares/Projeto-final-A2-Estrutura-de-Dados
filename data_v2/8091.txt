2005 north indian ocean cyclone season was destructive and deadly to southern india despite weak storms basin covers indian ocean north of equator as well as inland areas sub divided by arabian sea and bay of bengal although season began early with two systems in january bulk of activity was confined from september to december official india meteorological department tracked 12 depressions in basin and unofficial joint typhoon warning center jtwc monitored two additional storms three systems intensified into a cyclonic storm which have sustained winds of at least 63 km h 39 mph at which point imd named them first official storm of season was cyclonic storm hibaru which formed southeast of sri lanka in january after nearly five months of inactivity two depressions formed toward end of june on opposite sides of india depression in arabian sea was one of only two in that body of water during year other of which formed in september and killed 13 people other was a depression that formed over land and killed 26 people in madhya pradesh followed by another depression in july that killed one person a series of deadly storms affected southeastern india beginning in september a depression killed six people in madhya pradesh cyclonic storm pyarr killed 80 people an unclassified tropical storm killed 16 people in nearby bangladesh and a deep depression in october killed 100 people in andhra pradesh december was active with cyclonic storms baaz and fanoos hitting southern india resulting in 11 fatalities and a deep depression remaining over waters in middle of month toc season summary during season india meteorological department imd tracked cyclonic disturbances in region as part of them being designated regional specialized meteorological center covering waters north of indian ocean north of equator from 45deg e to 100deg e activity was separated between bay of bengal and arabian sea although there were no cyclonic storms in latter region tropical systems were tracked using satellite imagery and dvorak technique while forecasts were based on cyclone models there were a total of 12 depressions during year three less than normal although highest since 1992 imd named four cyclonic storms a process they initiated in 2004 which was also below normal no systems strengthened beyond cyclonic storm status season was sixth in a row with below normal activity based on seasonal accumulated cyclone energy storms generally develop when monsoon trough is located over tropical waters with a peak from may to june and another peak in november monsoon developed 11 distinct low pressure areas by end of september including five monsoon depressions and monsoon season was more active than usual systems cyclonic storm hibaru an area of convection formed at a low latitude to southeast of sri lanka on january 10 located within a broad trough and in an area of low wind shear over next few days convection consolidated as an elongated circulation became evident on january 13 imd designated system as a depression system organized further and developed rainbands a ridge to north caused depression to move erratically and remain generally stationary imd upgraded system to a deep depression on january 14 same day that jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 02b on next day imd upgraded it further to cyclonic storm hibaru estimating winds of 65 km h 40 mph marking an unusual occasion for such a low latitude storm in january drifting southward circulation gradually became exposed from convection indicative of weakening hibaru degenerated into a remnant low on january 17 land depression 01 early on june 27 a low pressure area formed over extreme northwestern portion of bay of bengal soon after it moved ashore near kolkata and system organized into a depression over west bengal with winds of 45 km h 30 mph for several days system maintained its intensity while moving northwestward stalling on july 1 for three days over madhya pradesh it later turned to northeast and dissipated over uttar pradesh on july 6 depression produced widespread rainfall across eastern india sagar madhya pradesh recorded in 24 hours highest daily total rains helped cut india s rainfall deficit by enhancing monsoon rains first affected odisha where rivers overflowed and inundated adjacent crop fields as storm stalled over madhya pradesh it produced widespread flooding that isolated 129 villages killing 26 people over a four day period nearly of rain fell across parts of katni district floods cut off communications washed away a bridge and damaged many roads cyclonic storm pyarr a tropical depression developed in south china sea on september 12 and moved westward into central vietnam on next day continuing through laos and thailand system emerged into northern andaman sea on september 15 tracked continuously as a depression by thai meteorological department it was classified as a depression by imd on september 17 west of myanmar on next day system intensified into a deep depression and later cyclonic storm whereupon imd named it pyarr it was first cyclonic storm in month in seven years attaining peak winds of 65 km h 40 mph storm took an unusual track to southwest on september 19 pyarr made landfall just northeast of kalingapatnam in andhra pradesh it turned westward and weakened over land deteriorating into a remnant low on september 22 over madhya pradesh as a depression system produced damaging swells along coastal bangladesh forcing 12 000 people to evacuate offshore an estimated 9 000 fishermen in roughly 600 vessels were caught in storm 15 20 of these ships capsized with 85 people collectively aboard at least 16 were known to have died torrential rainfall affected eastern coastal india with a daily peak of in rains caused rivers to rise forcing 36 000 people to evacuate after 315 villages were affected floods killed 10 000 cattle and killed four people in khammam pyarr also wrecked of crop fields in andhra pradesh storm damaged or destroyed 12 041 houses with overall damage estimated at million 2005 indian rupees 11 4 million united states dollars more than 140 000 people were forced to relocate after godavari and krishna rivers burst their banks and caused tremendous flooding at least 64 people died across andhra and odisha deep depression bob 04 a low pressure area formed in western bay of bengal on october 25 it had a well defined circulation helped by low wind shear and good outflow imd classified it as a depression on october 26 and later that day upgraded it to a deep depression moving northwestward system moved ashore near ongole andhra pradesh early on october 28 depression rapidly weakened over land degenerating into a remnant low next day heavy rainfall affected coastal andhra pradesh with a daily peak of in in tamil nadu to south chennai recorded of rainfall storm brought several days of heavy rainfall to southern india forcing 50 000 people to evacuate low lying areas of chennai were inundated disrupting travel by road rail and air and causing schools to close a car was washed away killing three people in city two people in chennai were electrocuted and provincial electric board shut off power in heavily flooded areas rains flooded of crop fields and inundated many rail lines across andhra pradesh 1 045 houses collapsed and rains killed at least 100 people cyclonic storm baaz an area of convection formed on november 26 in eastern bay of bengal within an area of moderate wind shear as shear decreased convection organized about a developing circulation on november 27 jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 07b and next day imd classified it as a depression that day agency quickly upgraded it to cyclonic storm baaz by that time storm was moving steadily westward due to a ridge to north on november 29 imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph increasing wind shear weakened baaz on december 1 in conjunction with storm turning to west northwest storm quickly deteriorated and imd downgraded it to a remnant low on december 2 same day that jtwc issued their final advisory remnants continued to west eventually crossing indian coast north of pondicherry on december 3 precursor to storm brought heavy rainfall to southern thailand reaching in ko samui rains killed 11 people in country and caused bh 400 million thai baht 10 million usd in damage remnants also dropped heavy rainfall in southern india with a daily peak of in rains flooded several villages in tamil nadu killing 11 people cyclonic storm fanoos a low pressure area developed on december 4 in south andaman sea it consisted of a circulation with increasingly organized convection system moved west southwestward through bay of bengal due to a ridge to north organizing into a depression two days later that day jtwc also classified it as tropical cyclone 06b moderate wind shear allowed system to strengthen further and imd classified it as cyclonic storm fanoos early on december 7 later that day agency estimated peak 3 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph two days later jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph as storm bypassed northern sri lanka wind shear and proximity to land weakened fanoos into a deep depression on december 10 and shortly after it made landfall on eastern tamil nadu near vedaranyam imd downgraded storm to a remnant low pressure area later that day although jtwc tracked storm across southern india into arabian sea agency stopped following fanoos on december 12 threat of storm necessitated fishermen to remain at port while 25 000 people evacuated to shelters final landfalling storm of season fanoos brought heavy rainfall to tamil nadu with a daily peak of in ramanathapuram rains heavily damaged crops across tamil nadu although damage was less than expected it was fifth storm to affect southern india in six weeks deep depression bob 08 an area of convection formed on december 14 over bay of bengal with a broad circulation it was in an area of low wind shear which allowed for slow development and it became a depression on december 15 a ridge to north steered system to northwest and later to west on december 17 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 07b same day that imd upgraded it to a deep depression with peak 3 minute winds of 55 km h 35 mph on next day jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph increasing wind shear prevented further development as storm turned to north keeping it east of sri lanka an approaching trough turned weakening system to northeast on december 21 and next day imd downgraded it to a remnant low in central bay of bengal outskirts of system brushed chennai with city receiving of rainfall although there was no reported damage other systems right thumb satellite image of january tropical depression jtwc tracked a short lived depression in early january system formed southeast of sri lanka on january 7 days before hibaru formed it remained weak as it drifted northward with peak winds of only 55 km h 35 mph depression dissipated on january 10 in middle of june an area of convection formed along monsoon offshore saurashtra region of western india on june 21 a depression developed with winds of 45 km h 30 mph moving to west northwest it dissipated on june 22 bringing light rainfall up to in gujarat in late july a low pressure area formed in northwest bay of bengal organizing into a depression on july 29 system remained nearly stationary just offshore west bengal on july 30 depression intensified into a deep depression shortly thereafter system moved ashore near balasore odisha it moved west northwestward over land dissipating on july 31 depression dropped widespread rainfall peaking at in rains swelled rivers and flooded fields affecting many roadways one person died after a wall collapsed on september 10 a low pressure area formed in northwestern bay of bengal moving to northwest it organized into a depression on september 12 and soon after made landfall near paradip odisha with winds of 45 km h 30 mph it continued through northeastern india weakening into a remnant low over uttar pradesh on september 17 depression brought heavy rainfall to eastern india with a daily peak of in across odisha rains inundated of crop fields and later killed six people after flooding villages in madhya pradesh another low pressure area formed south of gujarat on september 13 developing into a depression next day it moved slowly to northwest at first before turning to east never attaining wind speeds higher than 45 km h 30 mph late on september 16 depression struck gujarat just north of porbandar and rapidly weakened over land system brought rainfall and gusty winds that killed 13 people an area of convection formed on october 1 southeast of india it was located in an area of moderate wind shear system moved to northeast developing more convection over circulation on october 2 jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 03b although imd never issued warnings on system jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 65 km h 40 mph early on october 3 storm moved ashore just south of kolkata and dissipated soon after heavy rains swamped portions of northern bangladesh causing tremendous flooding that destroyed more than 100 000 mud built homes government officials estimated that 1 5 million people were rendered homeless floods also damaged 200 000 hectares 500 000 acres of crops and of roads at least 16 people were killed while waterborne diseases in aftermath threatened to kill dozens more a low pressure area formed in western bay of bengal on november 19 moving to west northwest it concentrated into a depression on next day on november 22 it crossed over sri lanka and later degenerated into a remnant low over gulf of mannar never reaching winds beyond 45 km h 30 mph remnants brought heavy rainfall to tamil nadu with reporting of precipitation over 72 hours season effects this is a table
