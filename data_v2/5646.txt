king vulture sarcoramphus papa is a large bird found in central and south america it is a member of new world vulture family this vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern mexico to northern argentina it is only surviving member of genus sarcoramphus although fossil members are known large and predominantly white king vulture has gray to black ruff flight and tail feathers head and neck are bald with skin color varying including yellow orange blue purple and red king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak this vulture is a scavenger and it often makes initial cut into a fresh carcass it also displaces smaller new world vulture species from a carcass king vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity king vultures were popular figures in mayan codices as well as in local folklore and medicine although currently listed as least concern by iucn they are decreasing in number due primarily to habitat loss taxonomy and systematics king vulture was originally described by carl linnaeus in 1758 in tenth edition of his systema naturae as vultur papa type specimen originally collected in suriname it was reassigned to genus sarcoramphus in 1805 by french zoologist andre marie constant dumeril generic name is a new latin compound formed from greek words sarx sarx flesh combining form of which is and crooked beak of bird of prey genus name is often misspelled as improperly retaining greek rough breathing despite agglutination with previous word element bird was also assigned to genus by constantin wilhelm lambert gloger in 1841 but this classification is not used in modern literature since sarcoramphus has priority as earlier name species name is derived from latin word papa bishop alluding bird s plumage resembling clothing of one king vulture s closest living relative is andean condor vultur some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from other new world vultures though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary there are two theories on how king vulture earned king part of its common name first is that name is a reference to its habit of displacing smaller vultures from a carcass and eating its fill while they wait an alternative theory reports that name is derived from mayan legends in which bird was a king who served as a messenger between humans and gods this bird was also known as white crow by spanish in paraguay it was called cozcacuauhtli in nahuatl derived from collar and bird of prey exact systematic placement of king vulture and remaining six species of new world vultures remains unclear though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles new world and old world vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of world just how different two are is currently under debate with some earlier authorities suggesting that new world vultures are more closely related to storks more

other new world vultures king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80 fossil record and evolution genus sarcoramphus which today contains only king vulture had a wider distribution in past kern vulture sarcoramphus lived in southwestern north america during mid pliocene piacenzian some 3 5 2 5 million years ago it was a little known component of blancan faunal stages only material is a broken distal humerus fossil found at creek kern county california as per loye h miller s original description c with s papa type conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness large span in time between existence of two species suggests that kern vulture might be distinct but as fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non diagnostic even assignment to this genus is not completely certain during late pleistocene another species probably assignable to genus sarcoramphus fisheri occurred in peru a supposed king vulture relative from quaternary cave deposits on cuba turned out to be bones of eagle sized hawk formerly in little can be said of evolutionary history of genus mainly because remains of other neogene new world vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary held sway over ecological niche of extant group especially in north america kern vulture seems to slightly precede main bout of great american interchange and it is notable that living diversity of new world vultures seems to have originated in central america kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to s fisheri s papa lineage fossil record though scant supports theory that ancestral king vultures and south american condors separated at least some 5 mya bartram s painted vulture thumb upright eleazar albin s 1734 drawing which has sometimes been identified as a painted vulture a painted vulture sarcoramphus sacra or s papa sacra is described in william bartram s notes of his travels in florida during 1770s this bird s description matches appearance of king vulture except that it had a white not black tail bartram describes bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one however no other naturalists record painted vulture in florida and sixty years after sighting its validity began to be questioned leading to what john cassin described as most inviting problem in north american ornithology an independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by eleazar albin in 1734 while most early ornithologists defended bartram s honesty joel asaph allen argued that painted vulture was mythical and that bartram mixed elements of different species to create this bird allen pointed out that birds behavior as recorded by bartram is in complete agreement with caracara s for example bartram observed birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles such behavior is typical of caracaras but larger and shorter legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking northern crested caracara caracara was believed to be common and conspicuous in bartram s days but it is notably absent from bartram s notes if painted vulture is accepted as a sarcoramphus however francis harper argued that bird could as in 1930s have been rare in area bartram visited and could have been missed harper noticed that bartram s notes were considerably altered and expanded in printed edition and detail of white tail appeared in print for first time in this revised account harper believed that bartram could have tried to fill in details of bird from memory and got tail coloration wrong harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove former existence of king vulture or a close relative in florida at this late date suggesting that population was in process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell day david 1981 doomsday book of animals ebury london viking new york additionally william noting tendency of birds to form floridian subspecies suggested that white tail could be a sign that painted vulture was a subspecies of king vulture description left thumb soaring in brazil thumb side view of head excluding two species of condors king vulture is largest of new world vultures its overall length ranges from and its wingspan is its weight ranges from an imposing bird adult king vulture has predominantly white plumage which has a slight rose yellow tinge to it in stark contrast wing coverts flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black as is prominent thick neck ruff head and neck are devoid of feathers skin shades of red and purple on head vivid orange on neck and yellow on throat on head skin is wrinkled and folded and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached on cere above its orange and black bill this caruncle does not fully form until bird s fourth year king vulture has relative to its size largest skull and braincase and strongest bill of new world vultures this bill has a hooked tip and a sharp cutting edge bird has broad wings and a short broad and square tail irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera unlike some new world vultures king vulture lacks eyelashes it also has gray legs and long thick claws right thumb london zoo 2006 vulture is minimally sexually dimorphic with no difference in plumage and little in size between males and females juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes and a downy gray neck that soon begins to turn orange of an adult younger vultures are a slate gray overall and while they look similar to adult by third year they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around five or six years of age jack of center for study of tropical birds in san antonio texas reviewed plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards followed by wing feathers until full adult plumage was achieved final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in otherwise white lesser wing coverts vulture s head and neck are featherless as an adaptation for hygiene though there are black bristles on parts of head this lack of feathers prevents bacteria from carrion it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes skin to effects of sun dark plumaged immature birds may be confused with turkey vultures but soar with flat wings while pale plumaged adults could feasibly be confused with wood stork although latter s long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar distribution and habitat king vulture inhabits an estimated between southern mexico and northern argentina in south america it does not live west of andes except in western ecuador north western colombia and far north western venezuela it primarily inhabits undisturbed tropical lowland forests as well as savannas and grasslands with these forests nearby it is often seen near swamps or marshy places in forests this bird is often most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range but in amazon rainforest it is typically outnumbered by greater yellow headed vulture while typically outnumbered by lesser yellow headed turkey and american black vulture in more open habitats king vultures generally do not live above although are found in places at altitude east of andes and have been rarely recorded up to they inhabit emergent forest level or above canopy pleistocene remains have been recovered from buenos aires province in central argentina over south of its current range giving rise to speculation on habitat there at time which had not been thought to be suitable ecology and behavior thumb flying king vulture soars for hours effortlessly only flapping its wings infrequently while in flight its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips and from a distance vulture can appear to be headless while in flight its wing beats are deep and strong birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in venezuela by naturalist marsha who has proposed it could be a part of courtship behaviour despite its size and gaudy coloration this vulture is quite inconspicuous when it is perched in trees while perched it holds its head lowered and thrust forward it is non migratory and unlike turkey lesser yellow headed and american black vulture it generally lives alone or in small family groups groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in belize one or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food king vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity though their lifespan in wild is unknown this vulture uses urohidrosis defecating on its legs to lower its body temperature despite its bill and large size it is relatively unaggressive at a kill king vulture lacks a voice box although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship and bill snapping noises when threatened its only natural predators are snakes which will prey upon vulture s eggs and young and large cats such as jaguars which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass breeding left thumb egg exhibited at brevard zoo right thumb adult at berlin zoo reproductive behaviour of king vulture in wild is poorly known and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity particularly at paris menagerie an adult king vulture sexually matures when it is about four or five years old with females maturing slightly earlier than males birds mainly breed during dry season a king vulture mates for life and generally lays a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree to ward off potential predators vultures keep their nests foul smelling both parents incubate egg for 52 to 58 days before it hatches if egg is lost it will often be replaced after about six weeks parents share incubating and brooding duties until chick is about a week old after which they often stand guard rather than brood young are semi altricial they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers truly altricial birds are born naked and their eyes are open at birth developing quickly chicks are fully alert by their second day and able to beg and wriggle around nest and preen themselves and peck by their third day they start growing their second coat of white down by day 10 and stand on their toes by day 20 from one to three months of age chicks walk around and explore vicinity of nest and take their first flights at about three months of age feeding king vulture eats anything from cattle carcasses to beached fish and dead lizards principally a carrion eater there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals newborn calves and small lizards although it locates food by vision role smell has in how it specifically finds carrion has been debated consensus has been that it does not detect odours and instead follows smaller turkey and greater yellow headed vultures which do have a sense of smell to a carcass but a 1991 study demonstrated that king vulture could find carrion in forest without aid of other vultures suggesting that it locates food using an olfactory sense king vulture primarily eats carrion found in forest though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food once it has found a carcass king vulture displaces other vultures because of its large size and strong bill however when it is at same kill as larger andean condor king vulture always defers to it using its bill to tear it makes initial cut in a fresh carcass this allows smaller weaker beaked vultures which can not open hide of a carcass access to carcass after king vulture has fed vulture s tongue is rasp like which allows it to pull flesh off of carcass s bones generally it only eats skin and harder parts of tissue of its meal king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of palm when carrion is scarce in bolivar state venezuela conservation this bird is a species of least concern to iucn with an estimated range of and between 10 000 and 100 000 wild individuals however there is evidence that suggests a decline in population though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed this decline is due primarily to habitat destruction and poaching although distinctive its habit of perching in tall trees and flying at altitude render it difficult to monitor relationship with humans right thumb 100px cozcacuauhtli from codex laud king vulture is one of most common species of birds represented in maya codices its glyph is easily distinguishable by knob on bird s beak and by concentric circles that make up bird s eyes sometimes bird is portrayed as a god with a human body and a bird head according to maya mythology this god often carried messages between humans and other gods it may also be used to represent cozcacuauhtli thirteenth day of month in aztec calendar 13 reed an ocellated turkey meleagris ocellata was also considered to be bird depicted but hooked bill and wattle point to raptor bird s blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases king vulture is also a popular subject on stamps of countries within its range it appeared on a stamp for el salvador in 1963 belize in 1978 guatemala in 1979 honduras in 1997 bolivia in 1998 and nicaragua in 1999 because of its large size and beauty king vulture is an attraction at zoos around world king vulture is one of several bird species with an aza studbook which is kept by shelly
