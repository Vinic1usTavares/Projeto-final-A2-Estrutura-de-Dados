kirov class project 26 cruisers were a class of six cruisers built in late 1930s for soviet navy after first two ships armor protection was increased and subsequent ships are sometimes called maxim gorky class these were first large ships built by soviets from keel up after russian civil war and they were derived from being designed with assistance from italian ansaldo company two ships each were deployed in black and baltic seas during world war ii while last pair was still under construction in russian far east and saw no combat during war first four ships bombarded axis troops and facilities after germans invaded soviet union in june 1941 all six ships survived war and lingered until 1970s in training and other secondary roles before being scrapped design following october revolution and subsequent russian civil war soviet industry was not capable of designing large complex warships by itself and sought foreign assistance ansaldo company provided plans for contemporary raimondo montecuccoli class cruisers and a design displacing and armed with six guns in twin turrets was produced in 1933 italians guaranteed that cruiser could make on trials if size was kept under 7200 tonne limit designer of new turret managed to persuade his superiors that he could fit triple turrets to ship while keeping it within specified limit and this design was approved in november 1934 as project 26 yakubov and worth p 83 soviets bought an example of and plans for machinery of later duca d aosta class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting smaller hull for larger and more powerful machinery so much so that it delayed start of construction another problem was that italian design had to be adapted to use soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for hull framing amidships and transverse framing for ends while also reinforcing hull structure to withstand more severe weather conditions that soviets commonly encountered yakubov and worth pp 83 4 kirovs were built in pairs each pair incorporating some improvements over earlier pair these pairs were designated as project 26 project 26bis and project 26bis2 in sequence differences between pairs usually related to size armor armament and aircraft yakubov and worth p 85 general characteristics project 26 class ships were long overall they had a beam of and at full load a draft of they displaced at standard load and at full load their single rudder meant that they were not very maneuverable kirov and voroshilov were fitted with a massive quadruped foremast but this proved to restrict view from conning tower as well as fields of fire of 100 mm anti aircraft guns and greatly increased their silhouette it was reduced to a simple pole mast in later ships and superstructure enlarged to accommodate fire control facilities formerly housed in foremast shortly after kirov was launched in 1936 two project 26bis ships were laid down they incorporated a number of changes from first batch not least of which was that they were larger they displaced at standard load and at full load they were only slightly longer at overall and had a deep draft of at full load on trials they proved to be fastest ships of class with a speed of their armament was much same as earlier ships although nine 61 k anti aircraft guns were mounted rather than six on first pair and they were fitted to carry 150 model 1908 39 mines in place of model 1912 mines yakubov and worth p 84 project 26bis2 pair were still larger and displaced at standard load and at full load they were a tenth of a meter shorter than project 26 ships although waterline length did not change at all between any of pairs their turbines proved to be slightly more powerful than those of project 26bis ships and propelled them at on trials production delays with 100 mm b 34 dual purpose guns forced them to use 90 k guns instead and ten 70 k anti aircraft guns supplemented 45 mm guns mines changed yet again as they could carry 100 kb or 106 model 1926 mines armament main armament consisted of three electrically powered mk 3 180 triple turrets with three 57 calibre 180 mm b 1 p guns turrets were very small to fit them into hull space available and were so cramped that their rate of fire was much lower than designed only two rounds per minute instead of six guns were mounted in a single cradle to minimize space and were so close together that their dispersion was very high because muzzle blast from adjacent guns affected each gun turrets weighed approximately and guns could be depressed to 4deg and elevated to 48deg guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of this provided a maximum range of around depending on ammunition and gun type normally 100 rounds per gun were carried although an additional four rounds per gun could be carried at overload by project 26 ships only secondary armament consisted of six single 56 caliber b 34 anti aircraft guns with 325 rounds per gun fitted on each side of rear funnel in all ships except project 26bis2 which used eight single 52 caliber 90 k guns with 300 rounds per gun when b 34 program ran into problems light aa guns initially consisted of six semi automatic 45 mm 21 k aa guns with 600 rounds per gun and four dk machine guns with 12 500 rounds per gun but were significantly increased in service project 26bis ships carried nine 21 k mounts and project 26bis were built with an additional ten fully automatic 70 k aa guns with a thousand rounds per gun over course of world war ii most if not all of 45 mm guns were replaced by 37 mm guns and one or two lend lease quadruple vickers 50 machine gun mk iii mounts were fitted to ships in baltic and black seas although each ship varied in its anti aircraft suite yakubov and worth pp 84 86 7 six 39 yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings these tubes could be individually adjusted to spread out their salvos molotov and kaganovich replaced their launchers with more modern 1 n mount during war a total of 96 kb or 164 model 1912 mines could be carried by first pair of ships a pair of depth charge racks were mounted as well as four bmb 1 depth charge throwers twenty large bb 1 and thirty small bm 1 depth charges were carried although no sonar was fitted for project 26 and project 26bis ships they did mount underwater acoustic communication system kalinin and kaganovich received lend lease asdic 132 system which soviets called drakon 132 as well as experimental soviet mars 72 sonar system yakubov and worth p 88 project 26 ships were fitted with molniya fire control system for their main guns which included tsas 2 mechanical computer and 6 director each turret and director had dm 6 rangefinders which allowed multiple targets to be engaged using a combination of local and central fire control four later ships had an improved molniya ats fire control system which could accept data from spotter aircraft anti aircraft armament was controlled by gorizont 1 system with a so 26 computer gazon vertical gyroscope and a pair of spn 100 directors on each side of superstructure each director had a fully stabilized rangefinder voroshilov had spn 200 directors but project 26bis ships used gorizont 2 system this had a more advanced gorizont 2 computer and shar vertical gyroscope yakubov and worth p 87 first soviet ship to carry a radar was molotov which was given a k air warning system in 1940 which she used for entire war lend lease radars equipped most of other ships british types 281 291 and american sg radars were used for air search main battery fire control radars were british types 284 and 285 while anti aircraft fire control was provided by type 282 radar soviet designed yupiter 1 and mars 1 gunnery radars were fitted in molotov and kalinin by 1944 machinery ships had a twin shaft unit machinery layout with alternating boiler rooms and engine rooms machinery for kirov was shipped from italy being diverted from contract for machinery for rest was built in kharkiv to italian plans soviet tb 7 geared turbines proved to be more powerful and more economical than originals kirov burned of fuel oil per unit of horsepower compared to furthermore kirov produced only on trials while voroshilov made and was almost a full knot faster six license built yarrow normand type water tube boilers powered turbines with a nominal capacity of 106 tonnes hour of superheated steam at a pressure of and a temperature of each shaft drove a three bladed bronze propeller for a designed speed of although this varied from ship to ship normal oil capacity was between but ships varied widely in amount of oil carried at full load this ranged from endurance figures also varied widely at full load from at maximum amount of fuel that could be carried ranged from yakubov and worth p 90 protection armour scheme formed a raft around vitals protected by a waterline belt deck and traverse bulkheads uniformly in thickness turret and barbette armour was also 50 mm thick conning tower sides were with a 100 mm roof a box protected steering gear and a number of control positions were protected against splinters for torpedo control station for main battery fire control and secondary gun shields for secondary battery control position and auxiliary command station had sides and roof yakubov and worth p 89 belt extended or 64 5 of ship s length its total height was of which was below designed waterline a double bottom extended past armored traverse bulkheads and a thin longitudinal bulkhead provided some measure of protection against flooding it has been judged too thin to withstand a torpedo s detonation but possibly far side bulkhead might survive intact which would cause a list from asymmetrical flooding armor of project 26 ships was vulnerable even to destroyer class weapons at ranges under and last four ships were given additional armor belt traverse bulkheads barbettes and turret face thicknesses were all increased to and box protecting steering gear was increased to one oddity of later ships armor scheme was joint between armour deck and belt top and bottom edges of belt were tapered outer surface angling in from edge to a thickness of 45 mm similarly deck edge was also tapered down to about 25 mm for its outermost 200 mm it has been speculated that this seam in protection representing a small target area may simply have served to save weight and simplify construction yakubov and worth pp 89 90 aircraft kirovs were designed to carry two aircraft but german catapults had to be imported two heinkel k 12 catapults were bought in 1937 for kirov and voroshilov they could traverse 360deg and launch an aircraft weighing at a speed of although no suitable aircraft were in service until kor 1 seaplane entered service in september 1939 they proved to be unsuitable for rough weather landings and were disembarked when operation barbarossa began gorky and molotov mounted soviet built zk 1 catapults of roughly comparable performance but were destined never to use them for lack of suitable aircraft project 26 ships landed their catapult during 1941 to make room for more aa guns as did molotov in 1942 a zk 1a catapult was installed aboard molotov in 1943 and she conducted successful experiments with a catapult launched supermarine spitfire fighter project 26bis2 ships did not receive a catapult until after end of war when a zk 2b was fitted catapults however were removed from all ships by 1947 construction while voroshilov was laid down first kirov was prototype for class and was completed first her trials were a disappointment as her italian built turbines initially had minor defects and she was slower than guaranteed italians pointed out that guarantee only applied if she displaced 7200 tonnes or less and she was overweight by over her turrets had numerous teething problems and inflicted more blast damage than anticipated which showed that her welding plan had not been followed her firing arcs were reduced in an attempt to mitigate problem voroshilovs soviet built turbines were more powerful than anticipated and she almost achieved her design speed components for project 26bis2 ships were manufactured in west ordzhonikidze built those for kalinin and marti those for kaganovich and shipped to komsomolsk on amur for assembly they were launched from drydocks and towed incomplete to

into early 1939 yakubov and worth p 91 she sailed to riga on 22 october 1940 when soviet union began to occupy latvia following day she sailed for liepaja rohwer p 7 during winter war kirov escorted by destroyers smetlivyi and stremitel nyi attempted to bombard finnish coast defense guns at russaro south of hanko she fired only 35 rounds before she was damaged by a number of near misses and had to return to soviet naval base at liepaja for repairs she remained there for rest of winter war and afterwards was under repair at kronstadt from october 1940 to 21 may 1941 both kirov and maxim gorky were transferred to gulf of riga on 14 june 1941 shortly before beginning of operation barbarossa both cruisers were active in last days of june covering soviet defensive mining operations but gorky and her escorts ran into german laid apolda minefield on 23rd and maxim gorky and destroyer gnevny both lost their bows gnevny sank while gorky made it to port before being transferred with assistance to tallinn and later to kronstadt kirov followed her to tallinn at end of month after being lightened to pass through shallows of moon sound rohwer pp 81 2 84 gorky had a new bow section fabricated in kronstadt and it was mated with ship on 21 july yakubov and worth p 93 kirov provided gunfire support during defense of tallinn and served as flagship of evacuation fleet from tallinn to leningrad at end of august 1941 rohwer pp 94 5 for most of rest of war both cruisers were blockaded in leningrad and kronstadt by axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for defenders during siege of leningrad and support for soviet vyborg petrozavodsk offensive in mid 1944 both ships were damaged by german air and artillery attacks but were repaired during war yakubov and worth pp 91 93 black sea fleet on 23 june 1941 voroshilov covered soviet destroyers bombarding constanta but destroyer leader moskva was sunk by a mine and kharkov was damaged by return fire she bombarded axis positions near odessa in mid september but was transferred to novorossiysk shortly afterwards on 2 november she was hit twice in harbor by junkers ju 88 bombers of kg 51 one hit started a fire in 3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from second hit yakubov and worth p 92 she had to be towed to poti for repairs which lasted until february 1942 she shelled axis positions near feodosiya on 2 april 1942 but was damaged by some near misses on 10 april and had to return to batumi for repairs in may she supported soviet troops around kerch and taman peninsula while helping to transfer 9th naval infantry brigade from batumi to sevastopol on 29 november 1942 she was damaged by nearby mine explosions while bombarding but managed to return to poti under her own power just after her repairs were completed she assisted soviet forces landing behind german lines at so called malaya zemlya at end of january 1943 loss of three destroyers to german aircraft attempting to interdict german evacuation of taman bridgehead on 6 october 1943 caused stalin to forbid deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant end of voroshilovs active participation in war whitley p 211 molotov was commissioned just before german invasion and spent most of 1941 moving from port to port to take advantage of her air warning radar first fitted in soviet navy she bombarded axis positions near feodosiya in early november and was sent to reinforce sevastopol with elements of rifle division from poti damaged by a number of shell hits while off loading troops on 29 december she was still able to take 600 wounded when she departed she reprised her role as a transport during first week of january her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in tuapse when it was thrown against jetty on 21 22 january 1942 she spent most of next month under repair although her bow could not be straightened which reduced her speed by several knots after making a number of bombardment sorties in support of soviet troops on kerch peninsula she returned to poti for more permanent repairs on 20 march in june she made a number of transport runs in support of garrison of sevastopol on 2 august her stern was blown off by torpedo bombers acting in concert with italian mas torpedo boats damage reduced her speed to and she had to be steered by her engines she was under repair at poti until 31 july 1943 using stern of incomplete frunze rudder of incomplete cruiser steering gear from kaganovich and steering sensor from submarine l 25 she saw no action after completing her repairs due to stalin s order yakubov and worth p 94 pacific fleet thumb right 250px cruiser lazar kaganovich alt water level rear quarter view of a large grey warship at anchor one gun turret main mast and both funnels are prominent even though lazar kaganovich and kalinin were both commissioned before end of war they saw no action during soviet invasion of manchuria in 1945 in any event lazar kaganovich was not fully completed until 29 january 1947 yakubov and worth p 95 postwar careers kirov was damaged by a german magnetic mine while leaving kronstadt on 17 october 1945 she was under repair until 20 december 1946 refitted from november 1949 to april 1953 her machinery was completely overhauled with her radars fire control systems and anti aircraft guns being replaced by latest soviet systems she was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 august 1961 regularly visited poland and east germany and was sold for scrap on 22 february 1974 two of her gun turrets were installed at saint petersburg as a monument maxim gorky tested first soviet naval helicopter kamov ka 10 in december 1950 and began her refit in mid 1953 this was planned much like kirovs refit although her displacement was to increase from torpedo bulges with consequent penalties to her speed and range navy reevaluated scope of work in 1955 deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended refit gorky was sold for scrap on 18 april 1959 after it was decided that she was not required as a missile test ship voroshilov began her postwar modernization in april 1954 but encountered same issues as maxim gorky unlike her half sister she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as project 33 on 17 february 1956 conversion process was quite prolonged as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts and she was not recommissioned as os 24 until 31 december 1961 she was modernized under project 33m from 11 october 1963 to 1 december 1965 converted to a floating barracks on 6 october 1972 she was briefly redesignated as pkz 19 before being sold for scrap on 2 march 1973 yakubov and worth pp 91 2 voroshilovs 14 ton propeller and 2 5 ton stop anchor are on display at museum of heroic defense and liberation of sevastopol on mountain in sevastopol molotov suffered a fire in 2 turret handling room on 5 october 1946 which required magazine to be flooded 22 sailors were killed and 20 wounded she was used as a testbed for new radars intended for chapayev and cruisers in late 1940s modernized like her half sister kirov between 1952 and 29 october 1955 she was renamed slava on 3 august 1957 after vyacheslav molotov fell out of favor with nikita khrushchev she was reclassified as a training cruiser on 3 august 1961 and deployed to mediterranean during 5 30 june 1967 to show soviet support for syria during six day war she returned to mediterranean between september and december 1970 where she assisted after latter s collision with aircraft carrier on 9 november 1970 she was sold for scrap on 4 april 1972 yakubov and worth p 91 95 kalinin was placed in reserve on 1 may 1956 and was restored to navy list on 1 december 1957 before being disarmed and converted into a floating barracks on 6 february 1960 she was sold for scrap on 12 april 1963 kaganovich was renamed lazar kaganovich on 3 august 1945 to distinguish her from lazar s disgraced brother mikhail kaganovich she was renamed petropavlovsk on 3 august 1957 after lazar kaganovich was purged from government after an unsuccessful coup against nikita khrushchev that same year her superstructure was badly damaged by a force 12 typhoon on 19 september 1957 and she was deemed uneconomical to repair and sold for scrap on 6 february 1960 yakubov
