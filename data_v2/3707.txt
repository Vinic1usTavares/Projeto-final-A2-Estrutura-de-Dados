rating and called series funniest show you haven t seen yet review noted that flight of conchords deserves buzz it is slowly building this is a very funny show blogcritics reviewer daniel j stasiewski noted that series was different for hbo writing flight of conchords isn t entourage or sex in city or even extras it s different and sometimes different is just good stasiewski however did note that availability of band s music on video sites like youtube meant that watching series was not worth cost of a cable subscription further more noted that while fun quirky music videos that pop up can make this long half hour worth watching 10 or so minutes in between numbers aren t groundbreaking comedy chris schonberger from entertainment weekly gave episode a largely positive review he called new series funniest hour of comedy on television and noted that performance of rhys darby as murray hewitt was excellent calling his character scene stealing finally schonberger positively compared episode to 2004 comedy film napoleon dynamite writing indeed whole pilot vaguely reminded me of napoleon in way that characters just sort of lurk around and pour their limited energy into absurd
