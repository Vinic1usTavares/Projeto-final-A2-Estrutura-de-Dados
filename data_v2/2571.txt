recording session did not go easy he had traveled to new york recording studio from washington d c after a long night of partying gaga was already in studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon atop her head by which wale was taken aback and was a cultural difference for him in an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with interscope by end of session gaga had created five different hooks for chillin and added her vocals on track rapper added it took a while once we finally got ball rolling it was almost time to go it was natural though it s wack when you get in studio with somebody and it s automatically music time it feels fake we were trying to feel each other out wale later added that he would like to collaborate with gaga again

seen on her ellen appearance one of two massive dogs from her other videos does make an appearance however with headphones on even without all of crazy things we know gaga for she s still great in this video critical reception chillin received mixed reviews from critics steve roberts from mtv praised gaga s verse and for employing a similar singing style to m i a jason lipshutz from billboard complimented club ready single for its bouncy hook and slick verses and called song perfect precursor to wale s long awaited debut mehan jayasuriya from popmatters commended song for being a token party jam on album track list she added that for all flack that track has caught it s still an indisputably catchy song even if 9th wonder and nick reworking from wale s back to feature stands as definitive version andres from hiphopdx believed composition of song as pop friendly a reviewer for xxl compared and described chillin as distinctly d c sounding anthem david jeffries from allmusic praised wale s natural delivery and quirky sense of humor in song likening his vocals to that of jay z and gaga s vocals to that of singer rihanna describing chillin as a club friendly hopper chris richards from washington post believed that using rihanna or m i a on track would have made it successful rather than gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer richards recalled a similar situation when washington d c based go go band experience unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer grace jones on a track sobhi youssef from sputnikmusic noticed that song s production made it sound like a different track than rest of attention deficit new york post critic ryan brockington liked song but questioned gaga s emulation of m i a mosi reeves from spin criticized gaga s wanna be m i a cadences calling it unnecessarily crass another review from spin by brandon soderberg panned song saying that i t wasn t a wale song and it wasn t a gaga song with wale wedged in there somewhere either chillin became something of an internet rap watershed moment sean fennessey from pitchfork media described song as much maligned adding that there won t be much to gain from chillin this was first step in wale s multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much nothing else on attention deficit resembles goofy sneakers shouting writing here in another review ryan dombal from same website criticized wale s repetition of his name and usage of samples calling it unnecessary brian howe from paste described track as flashy and hollow greyhound gave song a negative review and believed that with a lackluster hook and repetition of name wale airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon vocals of lady gaga wilson mcbee from slant magazine criticized both chillin and follow up single world tour as tepid cool dre productions in which wale seems to be attempting black eyed peas style halftime show rap mcbee believed that songs did not represent true nature of album prefix magazine was also critical of song saying that just when you think wale understands consequences of mindlessly horny partying he gives us dumb cheaply agreeable
