talking to nagisa clannad is a drama and romance visual novel in which player assumes role of tomoya okazaki much of its gameplay is spent on reading story s narrative and dialogue clannad follows a branching plot line with multiple endings depending on decisions that player makes during game plot will progress in a specific direction there are six main plot lines that player will have chance to experience five which are initially available throughout gameplay player is given multiple options to choose from and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made to view all plot lines in their entirety player must replay game multiple times and make different choices to change plot progression when first playing game scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called school life story arc when player completes a character s scenario he or she receives an orb of light when eight of these lights are obtained game s second story arc called after story is made available one of lights disappears during school life but reappears in after story to view true ending of clannad all 13 lights must be obtained originally lights were meant to be items that players could use in game but since this increased game s complexity and detracted from storyline function of lights was simplified and made less intrusive plot setting and themes first half of story takes place primarily at hikarizaka private high school a fictional school located in japan outside of school frequented locations include bakery run by nagisa s parents and dormitory where youhei sunohara lives throughout story glimpses into an illusionary world are shown this world is devoid of all life except for a young girl though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which player can interact with her remaining half of story takes place in same city after conclusion of first half while town s name was never directly mentioned one can infer that town s name is hikarizaka based on many companies and establishments that share this name there are recurring themes that appear throughout story main theme is value of having a family as title of series implies because main scenario writer jun maeda mistakenly thought name of irish band clannad meant clan or family in irish of six main characters tomoya nagisa and kotomi have no siblings though their parents are major factors in their stories nagisa s story was written to incorporate what maeda described as a perfect family with a focus on mental consciousness in nagisa s story there is a recurring appearance of a fictional group mascot for children that nagisa is fond of tomoya s and nagisa s characters were written in a style to exemplify a growth to adulthood by end of story fuko s and kyou s stories have their sisters playing an integral part and tomoyo s story is influenced by her entire family a minor motif of irish words continues with opening theme of game mag mell which means roughly plain of joy and is connected with irish mythology arrange album a short music cd that contained remixed versions of songs in game that was bundled with original game release was titled

even if he comes off as rude during such times despite this tomoya is loyal to his friends and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support he generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them tomoya meets nagisa furukawa main heroine of clannad at onset of story nagisa is a shy girl who has an illness which causes her to rely on those around her for support she has developed strange habit of muttering names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself such as kyou fujibayashi another of clannad heroines is a loud aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family when angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often

naoyuki to raise him after accident tomoya s father turned to alcohol and gambling and had frequent fights with his son one day naoyuki while arguing with his son slammed tomoya against window dislocating tomoya s shoulder this injury prevents tomoya from playing on basketball team and causes him to distance himself from others ever since then his father has treated tomoya nicely but distantly as if tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family this hurts tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father and awkwardness of returning home leads tomoya constantly to stay out all night thus his delinquent life begins tomoya s good friend youhei sunohara who was thrown out of soccer club over a dispute with his seniors is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with tomoya doing nothing much story opens on monday april 14 2003 at beginning of school year when tomoya meets nagisa furukawa a soft spoken girl who is one year older than he is but

afterwards tomoya resolves to raise ushio and acknowledges naoyuki as his father shortly after tomoya overcomes his depression ushio is stricken with same disease that nagisa had tomoya sanae and akio struggle to save her tomoya even quits his job but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain in coming winter wanting to do anything for his daughter tomoya takes her on a trip but she dies shortly after tomoya s psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world called where small orbs of light float around in first few dreams he sees a world devoid of all life except for one girl each time

illusionary world if all lights are collected throughout both story parts a chance to save nagisa from dying will become available as well as true ending where she survives and lives with tomoya and ushio development executive producer for clannad was takahiro baba from visual arts publishing company which controls key jun maeda who was one of three main scenario writers with kai and yuichi suzumoto led planning for clannad and wrote majority of scenarios scenario assistance was provided by toya itaru hinoue headed art direction and also worked on character design miracle mikipon na ga and shinory supplemented computer graphics torino provided background art game s music was composed by maeda shinji orito and magome togoshi for key s second visual novel air maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for game s scenario but he later discovered that air was difficult for players to receive and experience due to this maeda felt that for key s next work clannad he had a sense of duty to make game easier to receive for as many users as possible in any case he wanted to make it an entertaining game and started planning on clannad almost immediately after airs completion from start of clannads planning maeda did not want to write a story like in air but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between people and town and humanity maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of scenarios in clannad and equates clannads writing process as a wall that i will never be able to get over again while at beginning maeda felt he was prepared entire game s story started to increase to a level maeda never predicted and suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from original projected length suzumoto attributed increase due to lengthening structure of game s base scenario which caused branch scenarios to increase as well there were more concerns about clannad being similar to air when nagisa s scenario was being written there were some disputes concerning length of her scenario and thus putting too much focus on main heroine some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how air was structured with overall focus on takahiro baba company president of visualart s is even noted as suggesting to minimize differences between other characters scenarios but this was ultimately ignored since maeda thought game s evaluation by players would not decrease on account of scenarios being vastly different and thought end result was a good one maeda was concerned that after story arc mainly a continuation of nagisa s scenario would eclipse entire game s scenario much like what happened with air according to maeda in order to prevent same thing happening in clannad maeda focused on making first half of story school life arc just as enjoyable by making it long and heart breaking clannad is key s second longest work as reported by yuto tonokawa where he stated that clannad is about 4 000 words fewer than key s 2008 game little busters ecstasy release history key announced in 2001 a release date of 2002 for clannad
