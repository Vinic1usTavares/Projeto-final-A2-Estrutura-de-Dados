was underway to meet needs of world war ii working with a staff that included george bergstrom a former president of american institute of architects casey set about revising standard designs for barracks a number of new features were added to improve comfort safety and durability substitutions were made for scarce materials it was discovered that standard 63 man barracks was now too small of 81 companies in new triangular division 51 fitted more easily into 74 man barracks by slightly increasing barracks size substantial savings were made by reducing overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed size of cantonment areas required and length of required roads and utility lines casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 april 1941 on afternoon of thursday 17 july 1941

behind him is covered in huge map of new guinea in australia casey became chief engineer at macarthur s general headquarters ghq southwest pacific area swpa he faced enormous engineering challenges most of new guinea consisted of mountains and jungle with very few airstrips ports or roads all of these had to be developed to support operations to provide additional expertise in construction casey had leif sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of construction section with rank of colonel as u s army engineers were few casey worked closely with his australian army counterpart at general sir thomas blamey s allied land forces headquarters major general clive steele construction activities in australia were also undertaken by civilians of allied works council casey attempted to coordinate activities of various agencies he had to fend off attempts by u s army air forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions royal australian air force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was casey able to control their activities casey s initial need was for engineer units to accomplish daunting construction program but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low this was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment or with it stowed on numerous ships which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart critical shortages developed of tractors graders concrete mixers and welding equipment in absence of a proper stock control system an overall coordinating agency and adequate numbers of engineer depot units allocation and distribution of meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks worst problem was spare parts equipment was operated around clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke a large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts requisitions sent to united states took months to arrive so recourse was made to limited sources of supply in australia in september 1942 macarthur decided to outflank japanese troops on kokoda trail by sending an american regimental combat team over owen stanley range two alternate means of crossing mountains seemed possible one kapa kapa trail was known to climb to elevations above and present formidable obstacles casey and sverdrup took charge of investigating abau trail they reached abau on 18 september casey explored harbor taking depth soundings from a native canoe sverdrup set out for with a party of one american two australians from australian new guinea administrative unit ten native police from royal papuan constabulary and 26 native carriers after eight days on trail scaling heights of sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse route and turned back meanwhile casey had concluded that harbor was too shallow even for lighters however trip was not a total loss for sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of owen stanley range suitable for airstrips allowing troops to be flown across owen stanley range casey was awarded silver star in new guinea logistics and construction activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs these were often hastily assembled and had not always been able to meet demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations scale of operations in philippines was much greater so for this purpose army service command ascom was formed in brisbane on 23 july 1944 casey was appointed to command ascom in his absence sverdrup became macarthur s chief engineer although part of usasos ascom operated under control of sixth army moving as far forward as combat operations allowed developed new bases and operated them until usasos was ready to take over at which point units under ascom simply reverted to usasos allowing a seamless transfer of command for battle of leyte casey s ascom had 43 000 men of whom 21 000 were engineers casey and some members of his staff came ashore on a day advance echelon of his ascom headquarters arrived two days later work began immediately on airfield at tacloban and commenced on airfields in central leyte soon after they were captured heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop airbases in central leyte and it was decided to abandon their development and construct a new airbase on coast at a site occupied by sixth army headquarters need to get aircraft based on leyte to stop japanese from reinforcing island was so pressing that lieutenant general walter krueger agreed to move his headquarters casey had intended to come ashore on first day of landing at lingayen gulf in january 1945 but was delayed a day because destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport despite enormous difficulties ascom was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule on 13 february 1945 ascom was transferred to usasos and redesignated luzon base section casey then resumed his old post now renamed chief engineer us army forces pacific for his services as commander of ascom he was awarded legion of merit he was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his distinguished service medal for his services as chief engineer us army forces pacific casey hoped to become chief of engineers when lieutenant general raymond a wheeler retired in
