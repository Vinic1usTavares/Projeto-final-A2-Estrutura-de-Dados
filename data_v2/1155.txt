by bosnian serbs finally offensive was also aimed at capturing bocac hydroelectric power station last significant source of electricity under vrs control in western bosnia and herzegovina combined hv and hvo forces were under overall command of hv major general ante gotovina offensive achieved its objectives and significantly contributed along with operations sana and maestral 2 to forcing bosnian serb leadership to serious peace negotiations offensive also contributed to displacement of 10 000 bosnian serb refugees and resulted in deaths of at least 181 serbs while hundreds more went missing following operation a country wide ceasefire came into effect on 12 october one day after offensive ended and was soon followed by negotiations which produced dayton agreement ending bosnian war background as yugoslav people s army jugoslovenska narodna armija jna withdrew from croatia following acceptance and start of implementation of vance plan its 55 000 officers and soldiers born in bosnia and herzegovina were transferred to a new bosnian serb army which was later renamed army of republika srpska vojska republike srpske vrs this re organisation followed declaration of serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina on 9 january 1992 ahead of referendum on independence of bosnia and herzegovina that took place between 29 february and 1 march 1992 this declaration would later be cited by bosnian serbs as a pretext for bosnian war bosnian serbs began fortifying capital sarajevo and other areas on 1 march 1992 on following day first fatalities of war were recorded in sarajevo

armija republike bosne i hercegovine arbih and croatian defence council hrvatsko vijece obrane hvo reporting to bosniak dominated central government and bosnian croat leadership respectively as well as hv which occasionally supported hvo operations in late april 1992 vrs was able to deploy 200 000 troops hundreds of tanks armoured personnel carriers apcs and artillery pieces hvo and croatian defence forces hrvatske obrambene snage hos could field approximately 25 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons while arbih was largely unprepared with nearly 100 000 troops small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons arming of various forces was hampered by a united nations un arms embargo that had been introduced in september 1991 by mid may 1992 when those jna units which had not been transferred to vrs withdrew from bosnia and herzegovina to newly declared federal republic of yugoslavia vrs controlled approximately 60 percent of bosnia and herzegovina extent of vrs control was extended to about 70 percent of country by end of 1992 prelude by 1995 arbih and hvo had developed into better organised forces employing comparably large numbers of artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications vrs was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics for instance in battle of orasje in may and june 1995 after recapture of bulk of republic of serb krajina croatian serb controlled areas of croatia in operation storm in august 1995 hv shifted its focus to western bosnia and herzegovina shift was motivated by a desire to create a security zone along croatian border establish croatia as a regional power and gain favours with west by forcing an end to bosnian war government of bosnia

storage facilities around city bombing resumed on 5 september and its scope extended to vrs air defences near banja luka by 9 september as nato had nearly exhausted its list of targets near sarajevo

starting line west of mrkonjic grad against positions held by 11th mrkonjic light infantry brigade this effort was intended as a diversion aimed at misleading vrs defences regarding main axis of offensive it was hampered by poor weather which prevented effective use of artillery fire main hv force committed to offensive comprising 4th guards and 7th guards brigades and 1st hgz began their advance on 9 october poor weather and heavy fog forced hv to postpone attack from 6 00 until 8 50 advance was supported by strong artillery fire support and two mil mi 24s of croatian air force hv 7th

within of banja luka whose electrical power supply was interrupted and where a curfew was imposed in response to deteriorating situation operation southern move ended on night of 11 12 october aftermath thumb 300px right areas captured in september october 1995 and offensive captured an area wide and deep defeat of vrs also made it clear to bosnian serb leadership that they had to commit to ending war through negotiations or risk capture of banja luka in addition offensive proved decisive in halting vrs counteroffensive against arbih near kljuc and bosanska krupa and allowing arbih to mount a successful advance against vrs 1st krajina corps defending sanski most finally outcome of battle brought vrs to a position where it was forced to choose between defending prijedor banja luka or doboj brcko route this route had been vital for resupply of both banja luka and doboj since vrs secured it in operation corridor 92 three years earlier according to a central intelligence agency analysis ground offensives of hv hvo and arbih in western bosnia and herzegovina including operation southern move were a more significant contributor to bringing bosnian serbs to negotiation table than nato airstrikes a country wide ceasefire went into effect on 12 october followed by negotiations which produced dayton agreement on 21 november and ended bosnian war offensive displaced 10 000 serb refugees from mrkonjic grad adding to a growing humanitarian crisis as another 30 000 serbs fled sanski most before arbih captured it in final days of operation sana approximately 6 000 non serbs were forced to flee their homes in prijedor and novi grad by bosnian serb forces according to bosnian serb sources 480 serbs died or went missing in fighting in area of mrkonjic grad figure includes 181 bodies recovered in a mass grave at town s serbian orthodox cemetery according to republika srpska police who investigated scene and interviewed witnesses most of dead were vrs prisoners of war or
