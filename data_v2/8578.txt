british engineerium formerly brighton and hove engineerium is an engineering and steam power museum in hove east sussex it is housed in goldstone pumping station a set of high victorian gothic buildings started in 1866 goldstone pumping station supplied water to local area for more than a century before it was converted to its present use site has been closed to public since 2006 and in march 2018 entire complex was put up for sale at its greatest extent between 1884 and 1952 complex consisted of two boiler houses with condensing engines a chimney coal cellars workshop cooling pond leat and underground reservoir situated on top of a naturally fissured chalk hollow it provided vast quantities of water to rapidly growing towns of hove and its larger neighbour fashionable seaside resort of brighton for more than a century as new sources of water were found elsewhere and more modern equipment installed to exploit them pumping station s importance declined and by 1971 brighton water department had closed it and threatened complex with demolition an industrial archaeologist offered to restore buildings and machinery in return for a lease from brighton water corporation and a charitable trust was formed to enable this expertise developed by engineerium s employees and volunteers was exploited across world they founded museums undertook restoration projects and trained young people in engineering heritage conservation another enthusiast subsequently bought complex and as of it is closed to public while more restoration and extension work takes place high victorian gothic buildings are a landmark in hove and are a good example of 19th century ethos that utility definitely does not equal dullness in industrial buildings polychrome brickwork moulded dressings and facings decorative gables and elaborate windows characterise all structures even chimney which stands apart from main buildings like a campanile english heritage has listed complex for its architectural and historical importance giving its structures five separate listings former boiler house and chimney are both listed at grade ii second highest designation and former coal shed cooling pond and leat and tall flint and brick wall surrounding site each have lower grade ii status as well as restored pumping station equipment complex has a wide range of exhibits more than 1 500 were in place less than a year after it opened these include a 19th century horse drawn fire engine traction engines veteran motorcycles victorian household equipment and old tools a french built horizontal steam engine dating from 1859 is principal exhibit engineerium has always used its exhibits to educate and promote study of industrial history it has been called world s only centre for teaching of engineering conservation and was central to activities of english industrial heritage year in 1993 for many years larger and indigenous exhibits were fully operational and in steam at weekends history thumb left chimney at former pumping station is tall brighton and neighbouring hove on english channel coast between south downs and sea were built on top of a vast aquifer of chalk a regular supply of naturally pure water was always available from this natural reservoir and in settlements early days many wells were sunk to exploit it rapid growth of brighton in 18th and early 19th century followed by similar expansion in hove put pressure on local authorities to provide more sources and a better supply system though wells became increasingly contaminated by sewage from cesspits and some had to be blocked because they were so polluted reducing two towns water supply further first local water company brighton hove and preston waterworks company was founded on 16 june 1834 by means of an act of parliament it built a waterworks on road to lewes and provided piped water for two hours per day to a few wealthy customers this facility had two 20 horsepower beam engines by 1850s more water was needed for continually expanding population intermittent supply from lewes road waterworks was only alternative to wells and boreholes in 1853 a new company was formed with aim of introducing a large scale consistent supply to brighton hove and surrounding villages brighton hove and preston constant water service company bought its predecessor waterworks company in 1854 by time it was in turn acquired by brighton corporation in 1872 by means of another act of parliament it was pumping per day to 18 000 houses in brighton hove and surrounding villages of falmer patcham preston and thumb right two engine rooms seen from rear with cooling pond in foreground flank boiler house thumb right this coal storage shed was added to complex in 1875 thumb right on site workshop had its own steam engine thumb right a cooling pond and leat were built behind main buildings in 1884 thumb right two of four lancashire boilers were restored in 1975 76 company employed eminent civil engineer thomas hawksley to find a suitable site for a new pumping station hawksley built more waterworks than any of his victorian counterparts he oversaw more than 150 schemes in britain and abroad in 1858 he advised company that shallow chalk valley at goldstone bottom at south end of west village just outside hove would be a good candidate for exploratory drilling test wells were sunk and confirmed his impression company bought of land in 1862 and in 1865 it was granted permission to build a pumping station on site by this stage lewes road facility was suffering from pollution and opening of another pumping station at falmer and building of more reservoirs had not been sufficient to satisfy demand work took place during 1866 and facility opened in that year with name goldstone pumping station brighton hove and preston constant water service company operated it until their acquisition by brighton corporation in its original form complex consisted of a boiler house and adjacent engine room coal cellars and a chimney described by one historian as truly monumental all built of polychrome brick engine room housed a 120 horsepower beam engine made by charles amos of london based manufacturer easton and amos it was a compound engine of type patented by engineer arthur woolf water was drawn from a well which started immediately below engine which was known as number 1 engine it was driven by three lancashire boilers with twin furnaces which were fed by two coal cellars up to of water could be pumped per hour in 1872 ownership of goldstone pumping station and all other water facilities in brighton area passed to brighton corporation who formed a new committee called brighton water corporation to operate them demand for water continued to rise so in 1876 corporation undertook a major expansion of pumping station a second engine room was added and a separate coal storage shed was built in grounds workshop facilities were also provided with a range of machine tools forge lathe and planer and a separate easton and amos steam engine apparently left over from great exhibition new engine house was equipped with number 2 engine a 250 horsepower woolf compound unit built by firm of easton and anderson and with a pumping capacity of per hour it was powered by three more lancashire boilers mayor of brighton henry abbey fired up engine for first time on 26 october 1876 his visit with members of water corporation committee was recorded on a plaque in engine room a network of arched tunnels were built to link new coal shed workshop and firing platform of boiler room subterranean passages were used by coal trucks next extension took place in 1884 a cooling pond and a leat an artificial waterway were built on land behind pumping station and a new underground reservoir was built by j t chappell it ran for westwards from complex brighton water corporation spent ps11 000 on this work and on building of two other reservoirs in brighton at dyke road and race hill all three were built of tile brick and portland cement they were constantly replenished by a per minute inflow from numerous natural fissures in chalk because surrounding area became substantially urbanised in interwar period water was treated with ozone from 1937 to disinfect it meanwhile in 1934 boilers powering number 2 engine were replaced by four new models of same type built by blackburn based yates and thom company their capacity was greater they could each generate of steam per hour pumping station soon went into decline though electric pumps became available in 1940s and one was installed in number 1 engine room engine itself was decommissioned at that time four new lancashire boilers were in full time use for only 18 years number 2 engine was taken out of service in 1952 although it was maintained for a further two years in case it was required several pumping stations had been newly built or rebuilt since world war ii at falmer mile oak newmarket down near lewes patcham and and old lewes road source closed in 1903 because of pollution came back into use corporation increased its supplies further by acquiring waterworks in and lewes in 1950s goldstone pumping station was considered outdated and no longer required and in 1971 corporation announced plans to build a small electric pumphouse on site demolish 19th century buildings and scrap steam era equipment jonathan minns a london based steam and engineering expert immediately set about trying to save buildings and their contents he applied to historic buildings council for england forerunner of present english heritage body for listed status to be granted to buildings in complex this was granted on 17 june 1971 and in following year department of environment issued a preservation order preventing demolition or significant alteration of buildings minns acquired lease of complex in 1974 and planned to restore it from its derelict state and establish an industrial museum and educational centre he also set up a trust to run it by this time complex had a new owner water act 1973 restructured water industry in england and wales transferring ownership of water infrastructure from local authorities to ten government controlled regional companies brighton water corporation became part of southern water authority it was this entity which granted lease to minns minns had only ps350 when he started work on engineerium but more money soon arrived in form of grants and donations southern water authority gave trust ps22 000 department of environment granted ps40 000 and trust received largest historic buildings grant awarded in sussex up to that point in 1975 in october of that year minns and eight volunteers began to restore complex and its machinery which were in a state of disrepair boiler house and number 2 engine were priority but before they could be started workshop had to be repaired so that its equipment could be used to carry out necessary work elsewhere boiler house and number 2 engine were in a particularly bad condition roof was wrecked metal fixtures were corroded moss was growing on exposed surfaces and boilers were not operational number 2 engine had not been steamed since 1954 and had to be taken apart and rebuilt while building was restored around it every moving part was cleaned by hand and exterior was repainted in its correct colour after original paintwork was discovered under layers of mould and rust eight men worked for about six months on these tasks number 2 engine was successfully fired up again on 14 march 1976 after two renovated lancashire boilers were tested and inspected by safety officials other two were left in their unrestored state complex was first opened to public on good friday 1976 official reopening on 26 october 1976 exactly 100 years after number 2 engine was first fired up came after coal store was converted into an exhibition and educational area at this time it was named brighton and hove engineerium complex was given its present name on 30 may 1981 by this time about 1 500 exhibits were on display and boilers and number 2 engine were fired up every weekend cost of running engineerium and employing 18 people including six professional engineers was running at about ps250 000 per year although southern water authority which still owned site paid for improvements in 1983 and grants came in from east sussex county council and hove borough council there was no financial backing from central government although engineerium was acknowledged as a national and international leader in industrial heritage and world s only centre for teaching of engineering conservation employees of engineerium have helped to set up or renovate more than 20 similar institutions across world and it was designated as england s south east regional centre during industrial heritage year in 1993 centre s second royal visit by duke of kent in 1993 coincided with a fundraising plea for ps4 million to be spent on extensions to exhibition space and workshop minns also applied unsuccessfully for a national lottery grant vodafone paid for right to attach a mobile phone mast to chimney though ongoing funding problems caused engineerium to close in 2006 and complex and its contents were put up for auction by bonhams inventory was split into hundreds of separate lots and buildings themselves were valued at ps1 25 million just before auction was due to begin a local businessman and enthusiast offered ps2 million for buildings and more than ps1 million for contents conditional on his being donated half of minns collection this was accepted and on 10 may 2006 engineerium trust assets passed into mike holland s ownership engineerium stayed shut while its new owner invested in improvements and extensions in february 2010 he stated that he expected engineerium to reopen within a year on 10 october 2010 it was opened for a day to raise money for charity number 2 engine was demonstrated and many steam engines and other exhibits from museum s own collection and from outside were on display in august 2011 brighton and hove city council approved a planning application for some renovation and remodelling work including an extension structural engineers found that part of building was in poor condition and in january 2012 a further application was submitted to seek permission to demolish and rebuild part of machine room general restoration work began in october 2012 supported by a second open day jonathan minns died on 13 october 2013 aged 75 two years later an arson attack damaged chimney in march 2018 entire complex was put up for sale architecture thumb right walls have multi coloured multi layered brickwork thumb right coursed flint walls surround engineerium engineerium has been described by brighton historian clifford musgrave as an unusually fine asset for brighton and hove and by fellow historian ken fines a splendid example of victorian industrial engineering buildings have intricately patterned polychrome brickwork and chimney to south is also finely detailed and is a landmark in hove both buildings and machinery inside demonstrate widespread belief among victorian designers and architects that every object and building no matter how commonplace or humble should be elaborately and expansively embellished on main buildings walls consist of bands of red yellow and purplish blue brick with moulded layers and coping ground floor has red brickwork with a rusticated appearance cast iron windows are set in round arched openings below a string course which runs around whole building and consists of alternate patterns of red and black brick slate roof has flat topped gables set above pediments at top of each engine room two engine rooms are two storey and have a three bay three window range they flank single storey boiler room which also has three bays left and right hand bays are recessed all have windows that are similar to those of engine rooms chimney stands about south of engine rooms and boiler house rectangular campanile style structure stands on a rusticated base with a tapering plinth below it above this is a moulded cornice chimney itself tapers slightly and has tall arched panels on each face forming slight recesses an entablature runs all way round linking these brickwork is of same colours and detailing as other buildings former coal shed now exhibition hall and its attached workshops are of red and brown brick with coping on walls and a shallow slate roof workshops which do not contribute to architectural interest of building are a perpendicular adjunct to rear of coal shed so building has an overall l shape sloping land gives building a single storey at front north end and a second lower storey towards rear three bay north facade has three arched entrances smaller flanking pair have replacement doors standing in grounds behind complex cooling pond measures and has a leat around three sides it opens out on southwest side it is surrounded by small walls of red brick and terracotta pipework connects leat to boiler house from which hot water flows heat exchange takes place in cooling pond and cold water is returned to be used in boilers tall flint and brick walls dating from 1866 surround complex on all sides small flints laid in courses form main building material on three sides other parts have red brickwork with inset flints and main entrance has red brick piers with knapped flintwork there are also iron railings and gates with fleur de lis emblem walls have recesses on inside and outside at irregular intervals one on outside of south wall contains a drinking fountain with a panel imploring users to flints are prevalent in this downland area so many were found when pumping station was built that contractors fashioned them into a deliberately ancient looking folly on southwest corner of engine rooms exhibits thumb right engineerium has a corliss steam engine dating from 1859 engineerium has hundreds of exhibits relating to history of engineering and steam power many are on display in exhibition hall which occupies former coal storage shed central feature of hall is a corliss steam engine built in france in 1859 american inventor george henry corliss patented design in 1849 and became president of corliss steam engine company valve gear he invented improved efficiency of horizontal reciprocating engines more than any other innovation engineerium s example was assembled in 1859 by lille based company grand it was shown at exposition universelle in paris in 1889 where it won first prize it was then used for more than 50 years at l hopital emile roux in it was bought by jonathan minns taken apart brought to engineerium and reassembled in 1975 engine can generate 91 horsepower its flywheel turns 80 times a minute and whole machine weighs thumb left exhibits include this 1890 steam powered fire engine engineerium also has a horse drawn fire engine dating from 1890 originally owned by local authority in barnstaple devon shand mason company vehicle was bought and restored by museum s employees it is a vertical steam engine with two cylinders and a pair of pistons flanking a central crank a steam traction engine built in 1886 by marshall sons company has also been restored a range of veteran motorcycles are on display oldest is an ariel motorcycles vehicle built in 1915 elsewhere in complex smaller steam engines are on display alongside victorian tools and domestic equipment such as stoves much of equipment in workshop is also original such as main forge and a heavy duty metal lathe single cylinder easton and amos steam engine used to power belts which drive machine tools in workshop was already several years old when goldstone pumping station acquired it in 1875 from beginning overriding purpose of collection of exhibits was to portray and explain history and development of civil and mechanical engineering and british industry through both restoration of pumping station s original equipment and acquisition of other pieces associated with industrial pioneers such as james watt michael faraday and george stephenson an example is a model of stephenson s locomotion no 1 engine which was valued at ps75 000 by bonhams when engineerium was up for auction in 2006 heritage status when jonathan minns who later bought complex found in 1971 that it was threatened with demolition he successfully sought to get it listed by historic buildings council for england predecessor of english heritage organisation granted listed status in five separate parts on 7 june 1971 covering pumping station s five main structures boiler rooms and engine house were jointly listed at grade ii as was its free standing chimney three more structures were listed at grade ii cooling pond and leat coal storage shed and flint and brick walls surrounding complex grade ii is second highest of three designations awarded to listed buildings such buildings are defined as being particularly important and of more than special interest as of february 2001 boiler house and chimney represented two of 70 grade ii listed buildings and structures and 1 218 listed buildings of all grades in city of brighton and hove grade ii is lowest status given to nationally important buildings of special interest in february 2001 there were 1 124 such buildings in city in 1982 an zone incorporating whole engineerium complex became a conservation area one of 34 such areas in city of brighton and hove see also brede
