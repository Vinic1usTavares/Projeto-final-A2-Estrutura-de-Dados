in united states senate election held in state of new york on november 7 2000 hillary rodham clinton then first lady of united states and first first lady to run for political office defeated u s representative rick lazio general election coincided with u s presidential election race began in november 1998 when four term incumbent senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement both democratic party and republican party sought high profile candidates to compete for open seat by early 1999 clinton and mayor of new york city rudy giuliani were likely respective nominees clinton and her husband president bill clinton purchased a house in chappaqua new york in september 1999 she thereby became eligible for election although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in state before lead in statewide polls swung from clinton to giuliani and back to clinton as campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events in late april and may 2000 giuliani s medical romantic marital and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four week period culminating in his withdrawal from race on may 19 republicans chose lesser known u s representative rick lazio to replace him election included a record 90 million in campaign expenditures between clinton lazio and giuliani and national visibility clinton showed strength in normally republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by lazio solidified clinton s previously shaky support among women clinton won election in november 2000 with 55 percent of vote to lazio s 43 percent background when four term senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement in november 1998 his previously safe u s senate seat became open in 2000 u s senate elections both parties tried to find high profile candidates to run for it new york city mayor rudy giuliani who was prevented by term limits from running for mayoral reelection in 2001 immediately indicated interest due to his high profile and visibility giuliani was supported by new york state republican party even though he had irritated many by endorsing incumbent democratic governor mario cuomo over republican george pataki in 1994 giuliani became presumptive republican nominee and by april 1999 had formed a formal exploratory committee for a senate run there were still possible republican primary opponents rick lazio a u s representative representing suffolk county on long island was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for august 16 he had openly discussed a primary against giuliani believing his more conservative record would be appealing to republican primary voters in early august under pressure from state and national republican figures pataki endorsed giuliani pataki prevailed upon lazio to forgo his candidacy which lazio agreed to despite frustration that giuliani had still not officially announced that he was running lazio said if mayor wants to be a candidate i think he needs to get into this race it is time to put soap opera aside and step up to plate nassau county u s representative peter t king also considered running and had raised some funds u s representative nita lowey was candidate first expected to be democratic nominee while other mentioned possible candidates included secretary of housing and urban development andrew cuomo new york state comptroller carl mccall as well as u s representative carolyn maloney state democratic figures were concerned that neither lowey nor others had star power to rival giuliani and that seat would be lost late in 1998 prominent democratic politicians and advisors including u s representative charles rangel urged first lady hillary rodham clinton to run for u s senate seat an unprecedented action if she did it clinton spent considerable time mulling over idea while lowey waited in wings her political advisors told her race would be difficult and some of them told her she would lose she waited for impeachment proceedings of bill clinton to conclude pp 203 204 which it did with his acquittal on february 12 1999 early clinton campaign on february 16 1999 first lady s office announced that she was considering running for senate position once it was clear clinton was going to run lowey stepped aside although she would be disappointed at lost opportunity on july 7 1999 clinton formally announced an exploratory committee for senate run gerth van natta jr her way pp 208 209 setting was moynihan s farm in corners in rural delaware county p 540 bill clinton was less than enthusiastic about her candidacy staging of event was brokered by clintons political consultant mandy grunwald hillary clinton embarked upon a listening tour of all parts of new york after her entrance into race hillary rodham clinton living history simon schuster 2003 pp 508 she planned to visit all 62 counties in new york talking to new yorkers in small group settings according to principles of retail politics gerth van natta jr her way p 210 during race she spent considerable time campaigning in traditionally republican upstate regions clinton faced charges of carpetbagging since she had never resided in state of new york nor directly participated in state politics prior to her senate race meanwhile in september 1999 clintons purchased a 1 7 million 11 room dutch colonial style home in chappaqua new york north of new york city even commonplace activity of house hunting leading up to this was subject of considerable media attention coverage of personal lives would be norm in this contest of two electrifying and polarizing figures as one reporter put it in november 1999 hillary clinton announced that she would set aside most of her official duties as first lady in order to take up residency in new york and pursue her campaign her move in took place in january 2000 with house furnished with many of couple s possessions from their arkansas days it became first time since woodrow wilson s first wife died in 1914 that a president lived in white house without a spouse early stages of her campaign were not without mistakes and as she later wrote mistakes in new york politics aren t easily brushed aside living history p 509 in a much publicized move clinton donned a new york yankees baseball cap at a june 1999 event when she had been a lifelong fan of chicago cubs this brought her much criticism and thomas kuiper would later write an anti clinton book titled i ve always been a yankees fan hillary clinton in her own words clinton said she had to develop an american league rooting interest since fans of cubs were not expected to root for american league chicago white sox in her 2003 autobiography she said that putting on hat had been a bad move but reiterated what had been reported in press prior to incident that she had been a die hard mickey mantle fan living history p 509 book included a photograph of her with a yankees cap on from 1992 living history plate 40 first photo section more seriously on november 11 1999 at dedication of a u s funded health program in west bank she exchanged kisses with suha arafat wife of palestinian president yasser arafat after suha arafat had delivered a speech claiming that israel had deliberately poisoned palestinians through environmental degradation and use of poisonous gas some israeli supporters said that clinton never should have kissed wife of palestinian leader especially after such inflammatory remarks following day clinton denounced suha arafat s allegations and said that palestinian negotiator saeb erekat had told her suha arafat had been referring to tear gas and not poison gas kiss became a campaign issue especially with jewish voters clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident clinton later wrote that live arabic to english translation had failed to convey accurate nature of her remarks had i been aware of her hateful words i would have denounced them on spot living history pp 509 510 somewhat surprisingly clinton faced an erosion of support from women voters during her campaign with her numbers declining throughout 1999 this was partly a typical pattern seen with women candidates where they have an early surge of female support which then wears off and it was partly due to her early campaign stumbles but it also reflected particular set of mixed feelings that women had towards clinton s marriage and ambition and power she derived from it problem was especially acute among some female demographics one of her longtime advisers later said women in educated professional class they fucking couldn t stand her we could never figure out why we had psychologists come in clinton s campaign to all counties carried by a ford conversion van helped to defuse carpetbagger issue bernstein a woman in charge p 542 with many new york residents saying that clinton seems like one of us she discussed local issues such as price supports for dairy industry fares for air travel college tuition levels and brain drain in parts of state her political positions were well matched to different constituencies in state that she targeted in a january 2000 appearance on late show with david letterman she established a rapport with host that would continue throughout her senate years and into her 2008 presidential campaign gerth van natta jr her way p 211 clinton formally announced her official candidacy in purchase new york in february 2000 adopting simple name hillary for her campaign literature distrustful of press since her husband s 1992 presidential campaign and her early days as first lady she imposed limits on her availability to press van following her associated press reporter beth harpaz later recounted a typical day from this time but we d been told there d be no avail today and we d accepted it that didn t prevent me from feeling slightly humiliated i was so worn down and so exasperated by lack of access and lack of news in this campaign that i d given up fighting p 86 early giuliani campaign an early january 1999 marist institute of public opinion poll showed giuliani trailing clinton by 10 points by january 2000 marist poll showed giuliani up by 9 points giuliani s tactics involved intentionally baiting clinton campaign with deliberate keeping them off balance and behind in response cycle giuliani emphasized his depiction of clinton as a carpetbagger he made a one day visit to little rock arkansas where he announced he would fly arkansas state flag over new york s city hall when hillary clinton visited new york from washington he said i hope she knows way i hope she doesn t get lost on one of side streets giuliani s campaign prepared a 315 page opposition research dossier that went back to her time at wellesley college it included eleven pages of what they termed stupid actions and remarks giuliani campaign had no problems raising money getting over 40 percent of its funds from out of state and clinton overall two to one giuliani campaign showed some structural weaknesses so closely identified with new york city he had somewhat limited appeal to naturally republican voters in upstate new york garbage scandal was indicative of his lower levels of support upstate by late december 1999 clinton adapted to giuliani s psychological warfare saying in response to one such gambit i can t be responding every time mayor gets angry because that s all i would do a february 2000 attempt by giuliani to capitalize on a clinton campaign event s accidental playing of billy joel s suburban drug tale captain jack led to more ridicule for him than for her on march 11 2000 giuliani and clinton met face to face for first time since campaigning began at new york inner circle press dinner an annual event in which new york politicians and press corps stage skits roast each other and make fun of themselves with proceeds going to charity giuliani was on stage in male disco garb spoofing john travolta in saturday night fever but also appeared in drag in taped video clips that reworked rudy theme of a past inner circle dinner as well as in an exchange with joan rivers that sought to make fun of clinton other performers skits made fun of clinton s yankees claim and infidelity of her husband new york police department s fatal shooting of patrick on march 15 2000 inflamed giuliani s already strained relations with city s minority communities and clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue by april reports showed clinton gaining upstate and generally giuliani who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more he gave priority to city duties over campaign activities some giuliani aides and national republican figures concluded that his interest in campaign was flagging as although he was desirous of winning in political combat against a clinton he was by nature an executive personality and prospect of serving as one of a hundred legislators was unappealing to him by this time clinton was 8 to 10 points ahead of giuliani in polls living history p 515 in retrospect new york times would write that battle so far between two had comprised a blistering year of mental gamesmanship piercing attacks contrasts in personalities and positions and blunders played out by two outsize political figures in a super heated atmosphere giuliani s tumultuous four weeks giuliani s marriage to his wife broadcast journalist and actress donna hanover had been distant since 1996 and two were rarely seen in public together there had been no formal announcement of any change in their relationship although hanover had indicated that she and their children would not move to washington if giuliani won race beginning in october 1999 a new woman was being spotted at mayoral functions p 434 by march 2000 giuliani had stopped wearing his wedding ring and was being seen more in company of this other woman including at inner circle press dinner st patrick s day parade and town hall meetings but it was not yet fully clear whether relationship was personal or professional harpaz girls in van p 113 while this woman had become a frequent subject of insider talk among new york political circle she had not been mentioned in press on april 20 hanover announced that she would soon be taking over lead role in eve ensler s controversial play vagina monologues political observers speculated that hanover was partly engaging in a political act against her husband as ensler was a friend and supporter of hillary clinton and role would not go over well with social conservatives within republican party giuliani declined to say whether he would attend one of her performances on april 22 new york post obtained photographs of giuliani openly strolling on a manhattan street with other woman after they left a restaurant but did not have more than a first name for her barrett rudy p 437 post sat on story but it was clear relationship was a personal one on april 26 television channel ny1 reported that giuliani had undergone a second round of tests for prostate cancer at mount sinai medical center same disease had led to death of his father on april 28 giuliani held a news conference to announce that he did in fact have prostate cancer but it was in an early stage he was unsure of which of several types of treatment he might undergo and that decision would impact whether he could stay in senate race or not hanover was not present at conference but issued a note saying she would support him in his decision process as giuliani mulled over his medical options on may 1 hanover announced that she was postponing her appearance in vagina monologues due to personal family circumstances on may 2 new york daily news published a brief item about giuliani s other woman without name or description barrett rudy p 436 on may 3 new york post finally published its photographs of giuliani and woman now identified as judith nathan leaving a restaurant together under front page headline rudy s mystery brunch pal is upper east side divorcee some observers felt that giuliani known for his ability to manipulate new york media had been eager for news of relationship to come out later that day giuliani responded to a barrage of questions on subject at a news conference by acknowledging judith nathan publicly for first time calling her a very good friend and expressing his annoyance that her privacy was being invaded next days were filled with new york media coverage on nathan s background and on relationship on may 6 hanover held an unusually located news conference at back of st patrick s cathedral before funeral of cardinal john o connor visibly trembling she said i will be supportive of rudy in his fight against his illness as this marriage and this man have been very precious to me following day half press tried to stake out nathan s known locations while rest pestered nathan s hometown relatives in hazleton pennsylvania barrett rudy p 438 giuliani looked weak in a public appearance on may 10 giuliani held what new york times described as an extraordinary emotional news conference in bryant park to announce that he was seeking a separation from hanover saying this is very very painful for quite some time it s probably been apparent that donna and i lead in many ways independent and separate lives regarding nathan giuliani said i m going to need her now more than maybe i did before making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing regarding senate race he again did not commit to a decision saying i don t really care about politics right now i m thinking about my family people that i love and what can be done that s honest and truthful and that protects them best i m not thinking about politics politics comes at least second maybe third maybe fourth somewhere else it ll all work itself out some way politically giuliani had however neglected to inform hanover in advance of his announcement her reaction was described as distraught three hours later she held her own news conference at gracie mansion where she said today s turn of events brings me great sadness i had hoped to keep this marriage together for several years it was difficult to participate in rudy s public life because of his relationship with one staff member in this she was making reference to lategano former communications director for giuliani vanity fair had reported in 1997 that lategano and giuliani were having an affair which both of them had denied hanover continued beginning last may i made a major effort to bring us back together rudy and i re established some of our personal intimacy through fall at that point he chose another path state republican leaders who until now had avoided talk of replacements for giuliani should he not run now gave more attention to matter with state party convention coming up on may 30 former possible contenders rick lazio and pete king immediately indicated they were available other names mentioned included wall street financier theodore j and governor pataki although latter indicated no interest giuliani continued to ponder his senate race decision when he had dinner with nathan on may 12 they were trailed by a flock of photographers giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate new york and california on may 13 suggesting he would not run but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on may 15 two republican county chairmen became upset at indecision saying like waiting for godot we have waiting for rudy and we need a decision like tomorrow would be nice because this is getting ridiculous a top state republican said he seem s to like attention he seems to be going through some sort of catharsis in public and we re like psychiatrists watching it i can t quite figure it out i don t think anybody can clinton meanwhile said as little as possible about situation preferring to let giuliani s drama play out on its own on may 17 as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides she won unanimous approval of delegates to democratic party state convention at pepsi arena in albany giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent finally on may 19 giuliani held what new york times again described as an emotional riveting news conference that reached a new level of introspection to announce that he was dropping out of senate race this is not right time for me to run for office if it were six months ago or it were a year from now or timing were a little different maybe it would be different but it isn t different and that s way life is he added that i used to think core of me was in politics probably it isn t when you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that that core of you is first of all being able to take care of your health he said that he would instead devote remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome hostile relations he had with many of city s minority groups a change of republicans lazio thumb 146px right after giuliani withdrew in may 2000 lesser known long island congressman rick lazio took his place while previous republican nominee candidates and fellow long island congressmen rick lazio and pete king had both indicated an interest in replacing giuliani upon giuliani s withdrawal state party quickly rallied around lazio who had more campaign funds and who was viewed as a potentially strong candidate in particular governor pataki who never cared much for giuliani to begin with was strongly in favor of lazio and praised him as fresh unencumbered challenger to clinton this also caused a shuffle in new york s unique third party ballot line alignments liberal party of new york which was previously set to run giuliani whom they had supported in all three of his mayoral races now switched to clinton while conservative party of new york which had previously been loath to endorse socially liberal giuliani and was set to nominate former westchester congressman joe dioguardi lined up behind lazio lazio accepted unanimous approval of delegates to republican party state convention at a hotel ballroom in buffalo on may 30 clinton now faced a lesser known candidate in lazio while a relative moderate among house republicans lazio had frequently supported former house speaker newt gingrich a largely despised figure among many new yorkers lazio did bring to table an ethnic suburban background familiar to many new yorkers and had a reputation as an energetic campaigner one formality left were new york s late in season primary elections on september 12 which in this case merely served to ratify state party conventions choices lazio won unopposed while clinton won 82 percent of vote in easily defeating unknown manhattan doctor mark mcmahon who ran on grounds that clintons have tried to hijack democratic party for her part clinton said that she was surprised in a way to see her name in voting booth i stood there for a minute staring at my name in any case general election was already

democrat clinton and republicans lazio and giuliani had spent a combined 90 million most of any u s senate race in history as of 2007 it still holds record of most expensive senate race see lazio outspent clinton 40 million to 29 million with clinton also getting several million dollars in soft money from democratic organizations among clinton antagonists circles direct mail based fundraising groups such as emergency committee to stop hillary rodham clinton sprung up sending out solicitations regarding carpetbagging issue clinton secured a broad base of support including endorsements from conservation example sierra club and organized labor but notably not new york city police union which endorsed lazio while firefighters supported hillary while clinton had a solid base of support in new york city candidates and observers expected race to be decided in upstate new york where 45 percent of state s voters live during campaign clinton vowed to improve economic picture in upstate new york promising that her plan would deliver 200 000 new york jobs over six years her plan included specific tax credits with purpose of rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment especially in high tech sector she called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long term care lazio faced a unique tactical problem campaigning upstate major issue there was persistently weak local economy which lazio hoped to link to his opponent s husband s tenure in office attacks on state of upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent republican governor george pataki however limiting effect of this line of attack in july 2000 release of state of a union inside complex marriage of bill and hillary clinton by author jerry oppenheimer led to reports that clinton had called someone a fucking jew bastard in 1974 report which received international media coverage rocked clinton s campaign with daily telegraph describing campaign as having mounted a frantic damage limitation exercise after details of alleged incident were leaked clinton had reportedly screamed insult at paul fray who managed bill clinton s unsuccessful 1974 congressional campaign fray his wife and another campaign staffer stated that they had heard clinton s outburst while both clintons adamantly denied that she had referenced fray s heritage while oppenheimer wrote that fray s father was jewish in reality fray was a southern baptist whose closest jewish ancestor was a paternal great grandmother bill clinton did allow that hillary might have simply called fray a bastard in media interviews fray and his wife acknowledged several factors that tended to undermine his credibility he had lost his license to practice law for altering court records he had made false accusations against clintons in past and he had suffered a brain hemorrhage with some resultant losses of memory opponents continued to make carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout race and during debates talk radio hammered on this with new york based sean hannity issuing a daily mantra name me three things hillary clinton has ever done for people of new york clinton s supporters pointed out that state was receptive to national leaders such as robert f kennedy who was elected to senate in 1964 despite similar accusations in end according to exit polls conducted in race a majority of voters dismissed carpetbagging issue as unimportant during campaign independent counsel robert ray filed his final reports regarding long running whitewater ray insufficient evidence to prosecute clintons in whitewater probe cnn com september 20 2000 retrieved april 30 2007 travelgate ray first lady s answers false in travel office probe but no prosecution

white house each of which included specific investigations of hillary clinton actions reports exonerated her on files matter said there was insufficient evidence regarding her role in whitewater and said that she had made factually false statements regarding travel office firings but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute her although new york times editorialized that release of reports seemed possibly timed to coincide with senate election in practice findings were not seen as likely to sway many voters opinions a september 13 2000 debate between lazio and clinton proved important lazio was on warpath against soft money and amounts of it coming from democratic national committee into clinton s campaign and challenged clinton to agree to ban soft money from both campaigns he left his podium and waved his proposed paper agreement in clinton s face gerth van natta jr her way pp 212 213 many debate viewers thought he had invaded her personal space and as a result clinton s support among women voters solidified late in campaign lazio criticised clinton for accepting campaign donations from various arab groups in wake of uss cole bombing lazio campaign orchestrated a wave of telephone calls to voters using this attack this issue caused former new york mayor ed koch to take out ads telling lazio to stop with sleaze already and did not change dynamic of race some of lazio s campaign strategists would later say that cole based attack had backfired and became campaign s biggest blunder results thumb 193px right having won election clinton is sworn in as junior senator from new york january 3 2001 per new york state law clinton and lazio totals include their minor party line votes liberal party of new york and working families party for clinton conservative party for lazio analysis clinton won election on november 7 with 55 percent of vote to lazio s 43 percent a difference larger than most observers had expected clinton won traditionally democratic base of new york city by large margins and carried suburban westchester county but lost heavily populated long island part of which lazio represented in congress she won 13 of 61 counties with surprising victories in upstate counties such as cayuga rensselaer and niagara overall she lost upstate to lazio by only 3 percentage points to which her win has been attributed in comparison with other results this 12 percentage point general election margin was smaller than gore s 25 point margin over bush in state presidential contest was slightly larger than 10 point margin by which fellow new york senator charles schumer defeated incumbent republican al d amato in hotly contested 1998 race but was considerably smaller than 47 point margin by which senator schumer won reelection in 2004 race against little known republican challenger howard mills victory of a democrat in senate election was not assured because in recent decades republicans had won about half elections for governor and senator lazio s bid was handicapped by weak performance of george w bush in new york in 2000 election but it was also clear hillary clinton had made substantial inroads in upstate new york prior to lazio s entry into race exit polls also showed a large gender gap with clinton running stronger than expected among moderate women and unaffiliated women post election charges hasidic pardons in january 2001 two months after hillary rodham clinton s election to senate president clinton pardoned four residents of new square hasidic enclave in rockland county new york who had been convicted of defrauding federal government of 30 million by establishing a fictitious religious school new square had voted almost unanimously for hillary rodham clinton in new york senate race a lawyer following matter stated that even if clinton had promised to lobby her husband for clemency in exchange for town s votes a claim for which there was no proof it would be difficult to establish a crime had taken place politicians make promises all time that s nothing new or illegal clinton acknowledged sitting in on a post election meeting discussing possible clemency for four but said she had played no part in her husband s decision a federal investigation launched to investigate various clinton pardons closed its investigation of new square matter in june 2002 by taking no action against bill clinton hillary rodham clinton or any residents of new square hollywood fundraiser thumb 146px right hillary clinton with her largest 2000 contributor peter paul at gala hollywood farewell salute to president clinton hillary clinton s former finance director david rosen was indicted on january 7 2005 on campaign finance charges related to a fund raising event produced by peter f paul paul a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from brazil stated that he spent 1 2 million to produce august 12 2000 hollywood gala salute to president william jefferson clinton event which was both a tribute to honor president clinton and a fundraiser for first lady s 2000 senate campaign justice department indictment charged rosen with filing false reports with federal election commission by reporting only 400 000 in contributions on may 27 2005 jury acquitted rosen on all counts on january 5 2006 it was reported that clinton s campaign group agreed to pay a 35 000 fine related to underreporting of fundraiser s expenses peter paul also filed a civil suit in this matter paul v clinton on april 10 2006 judge in charge of case removed hillary clinton as a defendant citing a lack of evidence but leaving open possibility that she might still be called to testify as a witness in case removal was upheld by california second district court of appeal on october 16 2007 meanwhile by time of hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign a 13 minute video produced by paul and describing his various allegations against hillary clinton had become quite popular on internet gaining 1 4 million hits on google video and about 350 000 on youtube in a single week in october 2007 legacy clinton s victory would establish her as an effective campaigner and an electoral force on her own able to capture republican and independent votes and overcome her polarizing image she would easily win re election in 2006 and in 2007 began her presidential campaign for 2008 lazio gave up his house seat to run for senate following his defeat which set a record for most money spent in a losing senate effort he took positions in corporate world and avoided electoral politics until becoming a candidate in new york s 2010 gubernatorial election however he was defeated by a wide margin in republican primary giuliani would undergo treatment for his cancer and eventually recover he would also divorce donna hanover and eventually marry judith nathan after his campaign withdrawal his political future looked uncertain at best but less than a year after senate general election september 11 2001 terrorist attacks took place with giuliani still mayor giuliani s performance in aftermath of september 11 earned him many accolades and resurrected his
