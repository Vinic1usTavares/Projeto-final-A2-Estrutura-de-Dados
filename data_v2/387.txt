depicting east side conditions photography of these particular scenes is not ideal of thanhouser productions new york dramatic mirror was more moderate in its criticism by identifying specific faults with portrayal but found that story to be good and parts well acted morning telegraph offered similar criticism story of this picture is fairly good but details are wrong in first place producers evidently never were in a sweatshop or else they would not have representing a sweatshop a store like a custom tailor shop doing a thriving business people who are supposed to be hebrews hardly resemble them next objection is when settlement worker falls into a faint girl is very slow in picking him up story tells of a poor immigrant hebrew girl who falls in love with a settlement worker who returns her affection which finally results in their marriage some advertisements would bill production as seeing other side of new york city life see also list of american films of 1910 references
