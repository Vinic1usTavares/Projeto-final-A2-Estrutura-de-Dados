thumb right chief justice john marshall marshall court 1801 1835 heard forty one criminal law cases slightly more than one per year among such cases are united states v simms 1803 united states v more 1805 ex parte bollman 1807 united states v hudson 1812 cohens v virginia 1821 united states v perez 1824 worcester v georgia 1832 and united states v wilson 1833 during marshall s tenure supreme court had no general appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases court could review criminal convictions from state courts but not lower federal courts via writs of error it only did so twice court could hear original habeas petitions but disclaimed authority to grant writ post conviction unless sentence had already been completed thus majority of marshall court s opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of circuit courts by a certificate of division most of marshall court s criminal opinions involved defining elements of federal crimes criminal statutes considered by court during this period involved assimilative crimes counterfeiting insurance fraud piracy and slave trading but court twice disclaimed authority to define common law crimes not proscribed by congressional statute marshall court also issued important opinions regarding criminal procedure although court did not explicitly cite or quote constitutional provisions its opinions remain influential in interpreting double jeopardy clause of fifth amendment and venue provision of article three court also laid down common law rules of evidence in federal courts including hearsay exception for party admissions and narrowing of best evidence rule background thumb right judiciary act of 1789 under articles of confederation there were no general federal courts or crimes kurland 1996 at 21 25 rossman 1990 at 550 although articles authorized a federal court to punish piracies and felonies committed on high seas of 1781 art ix para 1 and congress of confederation in 1775 created court of appeals in prize cases 1977 congress soon devolved this power to states rather than creating additional crimes congress merely recommended to states that they criminalize acts like piracy and counterfeiting criminal law was considered in framing of constitution in addition to criminal procedure provisions of article three constitutional convention discussed piracy crimes against law of nations treason and counterfeiting kurland 1996 at 25 53 as alexander hamilton noted in federalist no 21 a most palpable defect of subsisting confederation is total want of a to its

federal prisoners presumably in state prisons at expense of united states many of substantive federal crimes during this period were created by two omnibus pieces of legislation crimes act of 1790 authored and introduced by senator and future chief justice oliver ellsworth and crimes act of 1825 authored by justice joseph story and introduced by representative daniel webster congress also passed a variety of single subject criminal statutes which were not centrally codified in any official publication between 1790 and 1797 only 143 or 147 criminal cases were brought in circuit courts

court has no appellate jurisdiction confided to it in criminal cases by laws of united states it cannot entertain a writ of error to revise judgment of circuit court in any case where a party has been convicted of a public offence and undoubtedly denial of this authority proceeded upon great principles of public policy and convenience if every party had a right to bring before this court every case in which judgment had passed against him for a crime or misdemeanor or felony course of justice might be materially delayed and obstructed and in some cases totally frustrated if then this court cannot directly revise a judgment of circuit court in a criminal case what reason is there to suppose that it was intended to vest it with authority to do it indirectly kearney 20 u s at 42 story explained only objection is not that court acted beyond its jurisdiction but that it erred in its judgment of law applicable to case if then we are to give any relief in this case it is by a revision of opinion of court given in course of a criminal trial and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings and take from them conclusive effect which law intended to give them if this were an application for a habeas corpus after judgment on an indictment for an offence within jurisdiction of circuit court it could hardly be maintained that this court could revise such a judgment or proceedings which led to it or set it aside and discharge prisoner kearney 20 u s at 42 43 ex parte watkins in ex parte watkins 1830 court held that writ did not lie after a federal criminal

judiciary act of 1802 plainly did contemplate that certificates of division would issue in criminal cases section 6 provided that imprisonment shall not be allowed nor punishment in any case be inflicted where judges of said court are divided in opinion upon question touching said imprisonment or punishment and while statute provided only for certification of point upon which disagreement shall happen justices sometimes took liberty of enlarging question for example in united states v hudson 1812 question certified was whether circuit court of united states had a common law jurisdiction in cases of libel but question answered was whether circuit courts of united states can exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases rowe 1992 at 930 and in united states v bevans 1818 court noted that i t may be deemed within scope of question certified to this court to inquire whether murder was cognizable under ss 3 of crimes act of 1790 even though defendant had only been indicted under ss 8 united states v bevans 16 u s 3 wheat 336 389 1818 but not every question or every case was eligible for a certificate of division in united states v daniel 1821 court held that a
