during war but g n r club entered both irish junior cup and leinster junior cup competitions of 1913 14 1914 15 and 1916 17 after exiting irish junior cup in january 1917 club appears to have been

before being elected to free state league on 15 june 1926 to replace dublin club pioneers as national league looked to spread to provinces on 21 august 1926 they travelled to cork to face fordsons for their league debut eventually finishing eighth in 1926 27 season by this stage team represented g n r works in name only and club s management committee decided to make it independent of company in january 1928 new colours of white shirts with a crest of town s coat of arms were adopted and by end of 1928 29 season g n r moniker had been phased out with a new manager steve wright doing everything except selling programmes they finished as runners up in both league and fai cup in 1930 31 proof that they could compete at a national level gave management committee confidence to press ahead and club was converted to a membership based company dundalk a f c limited on 25 january 1932 works teams when dundalk g n r joined league of ireland in 1926 it was one of four works teams in 10 team league others being jacobs st james s gate and fordsons another railway works team midland athletic of midland great western railway had competed for two seasons but became defunct when company went through a merger by 1944 45 only dundalk remained another side transport representing cie joined in 1948 49 but they failed to be re elected for 1962 63 leaving dundalk again as only surviving club with works team roots with demise of g n r i company in 1958 works themselves became dundalk engineering works ltd first successes 1932 1949 with wright still in charge dundalk became first team from outside of dublin to win a league title in 1932 33 sealing title with their first ever victory over bohemians in dalymount park indeed they were first team from outside dublin or belfast to win a league title in ireland since inception of irish league in 1890 hoping to improve gate receipts and revenue club s management committee decided to move from athletic grounds to a ground of their own in 1936 they secured land on carrick road owned by p j casey a former committee member and named it oriel park after winning league title they had six runners up finishes across five main competitions before winning 1937 38 dublin city cup their first cup final victory they then won their first fai cup in their fourth appearance in final with victory over cork united in dalymount park in 1942 they won inaugural dublin and belfast inter city cup five weeks later to become unofficially champions of all ireland following september in new season city cup was won for a second time during mid 1940s management committee relied on player sales to english clubs to bankroll club as gate receipts alone did not meet running costs after just missing out in both league and dublin city cup by a point in 1947 48 committee decided to invest surplus from its transfer dealings on a player coach ned weir and a number of professional players from scotland in an attempt to attract larger attendances and win trophies that had been beyond reach investment paid off when city cup was won at start of new season by topping its new league format unbeaten while club s second fai cup was won with victory over shelbourne in 1949 final but new team fell short in both shield and league and despite cup double and improved gate receipts additional income was not enough to cover increase in costs struggles and recovery 1950 1964 attempt to maintain a full time squad hadn t paid off and as a result 1949 cup winning team was broken up a surplus from transfer dealings prevented a more serious financial crisis arising and despite turnover in players dundalk finally won leinster senior cup for first time in 1950 51 after five previous defeats in final with victory over st patrick s athletic but cutbacks started to have an impact and they finished second from bottom in league table following season they went on a memorable fai cup run however coming from 3 1 down against waterford in a semi final replay to win 6 4 in extra time then defeated cork athletic in 1952 fai cup final also in a replay to win cup for a third time midway through 1952 53 season club secretary sam prole left to take over at prole a great northern railway employee had played for dundalk g n r in junior football and had been secretary for 25 years he had been responsible for club s transfer activities and player sales tailed off after his departure subsequent drop in income obliged club to focus on controlling costs and dundalk struggled for most of decade finishing last two seasons in a row 1953 54 and 1954 55 but in contrast to their league form they won their fourth fai cup with a 1 0 victory over shamrock rovers in 1958 final having not challenged for league or shield during 1950s they ended decade at top of league table and although they subsequently fell short of winning title it led to optimism that lean years were coming to an end a second leinster cup was won in 1960 61 then with trainer gerry mccourt a veteran of 1932 33 league winning side club won its first league title in 30 years in 1962 63 following that success they entered european competition for first time where they became first irish side to win an away leg of a european tie by beating fc zurich 2 1 in a 4 2 aggregate defeat in 1963 64 european cup dundalk couldn t manage to retain title that season finishing as runners up they were also runners up in shield but did win season end top four cup takeover rise and fall 1964 1974 by end of 1965 investment on and off pitch was needed and membership based ownership model could not raise required finance a new public limited company took over in january 1966 after voluntary liquidation of old company new board invested heavily in both oriel park and squad ahead of 1966 67 season including a new player coach alan fox signed from bradford city pay off was immediate dundalk finally won their first league of ireland shield then charged to league title winning it by seven points to seal club s only league and shield double they also won that season s top four cup following season oriel park hosted european football for first time under newly installed floodlights with visit of vasas sc of hungary but fox fell out with club s board during trip to budapest for return leg and he was released following march despite his side being set to retain title dublin city cup of 1967 68 was his final success at club they subsequently finished as runners up in league qualifying for 1968 69 fairs cup where they won a european tie for first time with victory over dos utrecht but fourth place in league that season and another city cup was all that remnants of fox s team could achieve future ireland manager liam tuohy took over in summer of 1969 and also joined board and as a result of his managerial experience they entered new decade at top of league table but tuohy was obliged to thin squad and cut wage bill due to scale of debts still hanging over club from redevelopment of oriel park and he couldn t build a side able to sustain a title challenge 1971 72 shield success would be high point of his reign and he quit at end of that season criticising a lack of local support in process his only other trophy at club was 1970 71 leinster senior cup dundalk had to sell or release a number of players to survive after tuohy left and they slid down table with a young inexperienced team finishing second from bottom in 1972 73 bringing what became known as fox era to a close to recover situation a new board took over running of club and hired english player manager john smith from walsall after renegotiating club s debts they were able to provide smith with funds to sign a number of players there was a fast start to new season and a leinster cup final win over bohemians in a replay but smith quit two matches into 1974 75 league schedule for a job outside football with his departure club appointed jim mclaughlin as player manager in november 1974 a trophy laden era 1975 1995 thumb right alt photo of dundalk player manager jim mclaughlin in action away to psv eindhoven in 1976 dundalk player manager jim mclaughlin in action away to psv eindhoven in 1976 it was under mclaughlin that dundalk recovered and reached a new level of success despite a still meagre playing budget he won his first league title club s fourth in 1975 76 losing only one match in process which brought european football back to town for first time since 1969 in following season s european cup they met psv eindhoven and were deemed unlucky to only draw first leg at home that match started an unbeaten run in europe in oriel park of eight matches over following five seasons they went on to win fai cup club s first since 1958 when they defeated limerick united in 1977 final having also won leinster senior cup a week earlier league form was mixed for two seasons following title and despite winning their first league cup and retaining leinster cup a poor end to 1977 78 season led to rumours that mclaughlin would be let go but club supported reorganisation he demanded and used funds from sale of three players to liverpool to invest in squad and make ground improvements at oriel his second league title followed in 1978 79 and they went on to defeat waterford in cup final thereby completing club s first league and cup double double winning side s 1979 80 european cup run following season where they narrowly missed out on qualifying for quarter finals going down 3 2 on aggregate to celtic in front of oriel park s record attendance was club s best european performance until 2016 they finished as runners up for next two seasons but achieved their only domestic cup double in 1980 81 winning both league cup and fai cup mclaughlin s third and final league title at club arrived in 1981 82 after an early season 10 point gap to bohemians was overhauled a trophy less 1982 83 season which saw dundalk slip to third place in league table behind louth rivals drogheda united signalled that team was entering a transition period but mclaughlin resigned in may 1983 saying he needed a change after next two seasons ended in mid table former player turlough o connor was appointed ahead of league s split into two divisions in 1985 86 o connor quickly built a squad capable of challenging for honours and over following eight seasons his sides consistently finished in top four after winning 1987 league cup final his first trophy as manager at oriel they finished as runners up in both league and fai cup qualifying for europe for first time in five years following season started with a visit from cup winners cup holders ajax amsterdam and ended with club s second league and cup double with title being won on last day of season

cross against cork city but dundalk spurned an opportunity to progress in european cup when a 1 1 draw away to honved was followed by a 0 2 home defeat attendances started to drop noticeably during 1992 93 as new english premier league broadcast live on bskyb was growing in popularity by end of season board was facing financial issues that threatened club s survival a healthy surplus in 1989 had become a serious deficit with income falling due to some of lowest gate receipts in memory 1993 94 season started with mixed results with good away victories being followed by defeats at home and after a home defeat to monaghan united o connor resigned he was replaced by another former player dermot keely older players were released and a thin squad struggled missing out on top six round robin that decided title they played out final third of season in a meaningless bottom six round robin in front of tiny crowds which contributed to worsening financial position early following season financial issues came to a head and a number of local businessmen formed a new interim company to take club over saving it from bankruptcy despite problems and with a squad still lacking in depth keely led his team to a ninth league title on a dramatic final day they defeated galway united at home then with players and supporters waiting on pitch to hear results of shelbourne s and derry city s respective matches news filtered through that both had failed to win confirming dundalk as champions decline and upheaval 1995 2012 1994 95 title did not halt overall decline and keely did not see out title defence quitting midway through 1995 96 season reportedly frustrated at being unable to strengthen his squad they sank down table and had to survive a promotion relegation play off in 1996 97 board turned to jim mclaughlin to try and turn things around but early in 1998 99 season it was revealed that club was in serious financial trouble again and whole squad had been transfer listed an end of season collapse saw club drop from top tier for first time with relegation confirmed 20 years to day after they had won their first double plans for a supporters co op to take club over led to some optimism and initial expectations were of an immediate return to top flight but dundalk became embroiled in a losing battle with league s hierarchy and kilkenny city which reached high court over latter playing an improperly registered player following season co op invested heavily in playing squad and under new manager martin murray they were promoted as 2000 01 first division champions although seemingly well placed for return to top flight they were relegated again following season with league being reduced from 12 teams to 10 despite this setback they won club s ninth fai cup a week later with victory over bohemians in final after being relegated again dundalk were stuck in lower reaches of first division for next four seasons with no sign of promotion co op members agreed to club being taken back into private ownership by its ceo gerry matthews they finished second under new manager john gill in 2006 securing a play off tie against waterford united but even though they won play off they were still denied a place in 2007 premier division with galway united who had finished third in that season s first division selected by fai s 2006 iag report to be promoted ahead of both dundalk and waterford in 2008 they finally won promotion back to premier division shelbourne to top spot on final night of season gill was let go however despite winning first division title at

or white socks since 1940 black trims were introduced in 1960s original colours when club competed as dundalk g n r were black and amber striped shirts with white shorts in advance of dropping g n r moniker they adopted a strip of white shirts with a blue crest representing corporation arms of town and navy blue shorts new kit was first worn in january 1928 white was chosen because when clubs of town first amalgamated as dundalk association football club in 1904 they had also adopted white shirts these colours were worn until 1939 but came to be seen as unlucky due to number of cup final defeats club had in 1930s hoping a change of colours would bring more luck a sky blue and maroon quartered shirt with white shorts and maroon socks was introduced in 1939 40 but they promptly lost to non league opposition in first round of fai cup and they returned to white shirts for following season this time paired with black shorts and black socks possibly by coincidence first dundalk a f c known as dundalk rovers adopted black shorts and socks to go with their white shirts in 1906 wearing combination for first time in an irish junior cup tie with dundalk g n r home colours have remained essentially unchanged although an all white kit was introduced for first time in 1965 66 season and was also used in 1973 74 and 2003 all white kits are still worn occasionally when required to avoid

their own navy blue shorts and black socks on their first visit to cork after adopting white shirts previous season as fordsons also wore white shirts from then until end of following season when cork club adopted green and white striped shirts after it severed ties with ford motor company they wore their old black and amber striped shirts with new navy blue shorts and black socks when playing in cork for most of next 60 years away colours were not required if change colours were needed red shirts were used and for cup winners cup ties away to hajduk split in 1977 and tottenham hotspur in 1981 all red kits were worn an all red away kit was introduced in 1990 91 season and away kits have typically been red or black based designs since red is currently not in use as base away colour because a number of other league clubs use red and white combinations for home colours alternative colour combinations have been in use since 2012 although black remains most common base away colour prior to 2019 ad hoc third colours had only been worn by team when both home and away kits clashed with opponent s colours a formal third kit was introduced that season for first time an all lilac strip with

of chief herald at national library of ireland in 1968 and is a replication of seal matrix of new town of dundalk which itself dates to 14th century prior to 1968 a simpler form of seal three martlets proper on a blue field was used for town s coat of arms dating to when town had been granted a charter in 1675 it appears as corporation arms in a town plan dated 1675 football club adopted this coat of arms for its crest adding it to new shirt with change of team colours in 1928 crest disappeared from playing shirts by 1931 however after town council proposed to remove three black crows from seal of town a modified crest of three black martlets on a white shield incorporating club name was reintroduced to shirt for 1952 fai cup final white shield became a red shield with white martlets in 1997 and in 2015 this crest was modified to incorporate a gold star to commemorate dundalk s tenth league of ireland title home grounds between 1903 and 1936 dundalk mostly played at athletic grounds near town centre paying a ground fee per game athletic grounds were a shared facility however also used for cricket gaelic games and athletics matches were usually played on sundays enabling a large northern irish contingent of spectators inconvenienced by sunday observance laws to attend games therefore if matches had to be moved to saturdays club suffered financially from lower gate receipts on weekends when athletic grounds were unavailable matches would usually move to carroll s recreation ground club secured its own ground on long avenue in town in summer of 1921 but 12 months later

contracts meaning they become free agents at end of each season contracts of two year duration are less typical while players and clubs very rarely sign deals of a longer duration as a result transfer fee inflation seen throughout european club football has not been a feature of game in ireland and dundalk have not benefited financially from player transfers since bosman ruling came into effect indeed players player of year for 2015 richie towell and 2016 daryl horgan both left for efl championship clubs at end of their respective award winning seasons on free transfers due to contract expiry transfer fees both paid and received have generally remained undisclosed record transfer fee received when all clauses were eventually triggered and paid is approximately ps80 000 equivalent to eur200 000 in 2019 for steve staunton who was signed by liverpool in august 1986 for an initial fee of ps20 000 dundalk subsequently received a further estimated ps70 000 equivalent to eur150 000 in 2019 when staunton was transferred by liverpool to aston villa in 1991 media television ireland s state owned public service broadcaster rte has broadcast rights for league of ireland and fai cup matches as part of a package from fai that includes international matches however there is little or no income derived from these rights for clubs indeed network refused to pay fee asked to broadcast home leg of dundalk s champions league victory against bate borisov in 2016 only a few months after they were named rte s team of year for 2015 rte had also previously offered fai eur4 million to avoid having to televise any league of ireland matches on its channels at all commercial broadcaster eir sport a number of live league and european matches during season though again clubs receive little or no financial dividend as matches are considered a marketing opportunity for league rather than a commercial interest for network eir sport also broadcast majority of league of ireland clubs european matches radio and online highlights of all matches are made available by club on its youtube channel shortly after full time while live commentary of matches is broadcast on dundalk fm a
