producer bob sertner wanted film to have higher end special effects to mimic quality of those seen in feature films to do this film uses visual computer effects created by special effects company area 51 fx which created over 100 different shots using digital modeling program 3d during shooting special effect supervisor craig weiss noted that scenes with randy quaid were particularly difficult to capture on film due to his appearing in multiple scenes where his character was chased by twisters and surrounded by their destructive actors also faced new challenges as film often replaced traditional green screen setup where special effects were added during editing with live shots taken with effects in place at same time nancy mckeon who was pregnant with her first child during production filmed some of her scenes using a green screen she found experience to be fun noting that it challenges actors to use their imaginations while performing she also found it easy to play a television reporter due to her being a self admitted news junkie unable to find wind machines powerful enough to mimic hurricane force winds sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at actors and props during necessary scenes three dimensional storyboards called animatics were used to allow filmmakers to see what a scene would look like before shooting using a digital version of actors various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with computer generated shots with care taken to match up details of various scenes release category 6 was initially aired in

push channel to top spot for year s november sweeps week despite high ratings film was generally panned by critics except for almost universal praise for high budget special effects new york magazine s john leonard found it lacking compared to feature film day after tomorrow though he did feel it had a certain raffish zombie charm charlie mccollum of san jose mercury news called it a third rate disaster flick with lame dialogue voodoo science and wooden performances spread out over two nights and four seemingly endless hours aaron barnhart of kansas city star agreed feeling filmmakers spent their budget on special effects to detriment of film s dialog he called film an assault on common sense for positing idea that power outage would keep everyone in chicago from knowing that something bad was coming daily variety found film to be full of cliches and felt side plots gave appearance that film was cast first and that plot had been written to work around actors in comparing film to a reese s peanut butter cup magazine notes that it had two or more disastrous taste treats providing a very loud macro backdrop to micro tales that play out involving characters kay mcfadden of seattle times also felt storm became a backdrop for a contrived soap opera that could take place in sunshine or rain and that special effects were fun but did not feel properly integrated into their scenes chicago tribunes sid smith found film to be pretty lousy despite a wealth of impressive special effects that end with an image of a completely demolished chicago skyline he found plot to be overly melodramatic and hokey with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill fortunes thrown at characters despite performances of star studded cast australia s age gave film a slightly more favorable review praising stunts and special effects though it noted effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to film as a little entertaining that does require one to not think too much about
