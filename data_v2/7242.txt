circuit city stores inc v adams 532 u s 105 2001 was a united states supreme court case that concerned whether section one exemption of federal arbitration act applied to an employment contract of an employee at circuit city stores court held that exemption was limited to specific listing of professions contained in text this decision meant that general employment contracts like one adams sued under would have to be arbitrated in accordance with federal statute background in 1995 saint clair adams who was hired as a sales counselor signed an employment application with circuit city a provision in adams application required all employment disputes to be settled by arbitration specifically it stated i agree that i will settle any and all previously claims disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to my application or candidacy for employment employment and or cessation of employment with circuit city exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator in 1997 adams filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against circuit city in california state court alleging violations of state employment law circuit city then filed suit in federal district court seeking to enjoin state court action and to compel arbitration of adams claims under federal arbitration act adams 532 u s at 108 district court entered an order to that effect because it decided that adams was obligated by arbitration agreement in reversing ninth circuit court of appeals found that arbitration agreement between adams and circuit city was contained in a contract of employment and thus not subject to act under section 1 of act section 1 of faa excludes contracts of employment of seamen railroad employees or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce from act s coverage circuit city appealed to supreme court which agreed to hear case opinion of court justice anthony kennedy wrote majority opinion reversing ninth circuit and holding that exception did not apply to this case main reason for this finding was decision that section one s exemption would only be confined to transportation workers adams 532 u s at 112 wording of section one calls for application of maxim generis statutory canon that where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by preceding specific words adams 532 u s at 114 under this method of reading statute he would be able to reach an understanding of what exemption meant he wrote under this rule of construction residual clause should be read to give effect to terms seamen and railroad employees and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it interpretation of clause pressed by respondent fails to produce these results adams 532 u s at 115 therefore section one exempts from faa only contracts of employment of transportation workers adams 532 u s at 116 kennedy s decision was joined by four other justices to create a 5 justice majority dissenting opinions justice john paul stevens wrote a dissent with which justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer joined justice david souter joined all sections of stevens dissent besides a critique of previous decision of supreme court in arbitration case law stevens examined history of arbitration and purpose of it throughout century federal arbitration act was designed he explained to maintain enforceability of contractual agreements but private arbitration is a whole other situation stevens wrote as history of legislation indicates potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was source of organized labor s opposition to act which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts adams 532 u s at 132 stevens j dissenting he went on to quote former chief justice of israeli supreme court aharon barak in supporting idea that court should look at purpose of act rather than its pure statutory language justice souter wrote a separate dissent which was joined by other three justices who signed onto stevens dissent as listed above he mainly attacked method of majority s statutory reading and its failure to look at statute as a whole adams 532 u s at 137 souter j dissenting he wrote it is something very odd to working of congressional brain to say that congress took care to bar application of act to class of employment contracts it most obviously had authority to legislate about in 1925 adams 532 u s at 138 souter j dissenting with that understanding of act he would have affirmed decision and holding of ninth circuit subsequent history case was remanded to ninth circuit which declared arbitration agreement unconscionable under california law that precluded arbitration proceedings and allowed adams to pursue a regular lawsuit in california courts adams was then able to pursue original claims notwithstanding decision by justice kennedy in aftermath of case legal analysts said that this case would be important for future
