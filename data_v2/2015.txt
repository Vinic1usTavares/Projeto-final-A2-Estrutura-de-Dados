fisher pekania pennanti is a small carnivorous mammal native to north america it is a member of mustelid family commonly referred to as weasel family and is in monospecific genus pekania fisher is closely related to but larger than american marten martes americana fisher is a forest dwelling creature whose range covers much of boreal forest in canada to northern united states names derived from aboriginal languages include pekan wejack and it is sometimes misleadingly referred to as a fisher cat although it is not a cat males and females look similar adult males are long and weigh adult females are long and weigh fur of fisher varies seasonally being denser and glossier in winter during summer color becomes more mottled as fur goes through a moulting cycle fisher prefers to hunt in full forest although an agile climber it spends most of its time on forest floor where it prefers to forage around fallen trees an omnivore fisher feeds on a wide variety of small animals and occasionally on fruits and mushrooms it prefers snowshoe hare and is one of few animals able to prey successfully on porcupines despite its common name it rarely eats fish reproductive cycle of fisher lasts almost a year female fishers give birth to a litter of three or four kits in spring they nurse and care for their kits until late summer when they are old enough to set out on their own females enter estrus shortly after giving birth and leave den to find a mate implantation of blastocyst is delayed until following spring when they give birth and cycle is renewed fishers have few predators besides humans they have been trapped since 18th century for their fur their pelts were in such demand that they were extirpated from several parts of united states in early part of 20th century conservation and protection measures have allowed species to rebound but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits in 1920s when pelt prices were high some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers however their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult when pelt prices fell in late 1940s most fisher farming ended while fishers usually avoid human contact encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts etymology despite name fisher animal is not known to eat fish name is instead related to word fitch meaning a european polecat mustela or pelt thereof due to resemblance to that animal name comes from colonial dutch equivalent or in french language pelt of a polecat is also called or in some regions fisher is known as a pekan derived from its name in abenaki language wejack is an algonquian word cf cree ojibwa borrowed by fur traders other american indian names for fisher are chipewyan and carrier both meaning big marten and wabanaki taxonomy upright thumb skull diagram latin specific name pennanti honors thomas pennant who described fisher in 1771 buffon had first described creature in 1765 calling it a pekan pennant examined same specimen but called it a fisher unaware of buffon s earlier description other 18th century scientists gave it similar names such as schreber who named it mustela canadensis and boddaert who named it mustela coues p 66 fisher was eventually placed in genus martes by smith in 1843 powell pp 11 12 in 2008 advances in dna analysis allowed a more detailed study of fisher s evolutionary history fisher and genus martes were determined to have descended from a common ancestor but fisher was distinct enough to put it in its own genus it was decided to create genus pekania and reclassify fisher as pekania pennanti members of genus pekania are distinguished by their four premolar teeth on upper and lower jaws its close relative mustela has just three fisher has 38 teeth dentition formula is powell p 12 evolution some evidence shows that ancestors of fisher migrated to north america during pliocene era between 2 5 and 5 0 million years ago two extinct mustelids m and m anderssoni have been found in eastern asia first true fisher m diluviana has only been found in middle pleistocene north america m diluviana is strongly indicated to be related to asian finds which suggests a migration m pennanti has been found as early as late pleistocene era about 125 000 years ago no major differences are seen between pleistocene fisher and modern fisher fossil evidence indicates that fisher s range extended farther south than it does today three subspecies were identified by goldman in 1935 m p columbiana m p pacifica and m p pennanti later research has debated whether these subspecies could be positively identified in 1959 e m concluded that subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics although some debate still exists in general fisher is recognized to be a monotypic species with no extant subspecies powell p 14 biology and behavior physical characteristics thumb fisher in winter coat fishers are a medium sized mammal comparable in size to domestic cat their bodies are long thin and low to ground sexes have similar physical features but they are sexually dimorphic in size with male being much larger than female males are in length and weigh females measure and weigh largest male fisher ever recorded weighed powell p 3 fisher s fur changes with season and differs slightly between sexes males have coarser coats than females in early winter coats are dense and glossy ranging from on chest to on back color ranges from deep brown to black although it appears to be much blacker in winter when contrasted with white snow from face to shoulders fur can be hoary gold or silver due to tricolored guard hairs underside of a fisher is almost completely brown except for randomly placed patches of white or cream colored fur in summer fur color is more variable and may lighten considerably fishers undergo moulting starting in late summer and finishing by november or december powell pp 4 6 fishers have five toes on each foot with unsheathed retractable claws their feet are large making it easier for them to move on top of snow packs in addition to toes four central pads are on each foot on hind paws are coarse hairs that grow between pads and toes giving them added traction when walking on slippery surfaces powell p 9 fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180deg allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head first fergus p 101 fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with ability to descend trees head first a circular patch of hair on central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor since these patches become enlarged during breeding season they are likely used to make a scent trail to allow fishers to find each other so they can mate hunting and diet fishers are generalist predators although their primary prey is snowshoe hares and porcupines they are also known to supplement their diet with insects nuts berries and mushrooms since they are solitary hunters their choice of prey is limited by their size analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds small mammals and even deer latter two indicating that they are not averse to eating carrion fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses fergus p 102 while behavior is not common fishers have been known to kill larger animals such as wild turkey bobcat although in most cases confrontations tend to be dominated by cat that frequently prey on them and in fact is one of their main predators and canadian lynx researchers in maine have found about a dozen cases of confirmed fisher predation on canadian lynx and several more suspected cases in a four township area of maine maine researchers track deadly

fishers are one of few predators that seek out and kill porcupines stories in popular literature indicate that fishers can flip a porcupine onto its back and scoop out its belly like a ripe melon this was identified as an exaggerated misconception as early as 1966 observational studies show that fishers make repeated biting attacks on face of a porcupine and kill it after about 25 30 minutes powell pp 134 6 reproduction female fisher begins to breed at about one year of age and her reproductive cycle is an almost year long event mating takes place in late march to early april blastocyst implantation is then delayed for ten months until mid february of following year when active pregnancy begins after gestating for about 50 days female gives birth to one to four kits burt henry w 1976

partially covered with fine hair kits begin to crawl after about three weeks after about seven weeks they open their eyes they start to climb after eight weeks kits are completely dependent on their mother s milk for first eight to ten weeks after which they begin to switch to a solid diet after four months kits become intolerant of their litter mates and at five months mother pushes them out on their own after one year juveniles will have established their own range social structure and home range fishers are generally crepuscular being most active at dawn and dusk they are active year round and are solitary associating with other fishers only for mating males become more active during mating season females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits a fisher s hunting range varies from in summer to in winter ranges up to in winter are possible depending on quality of habitat male and female fishers have overlapping territories this behavior is imposed on females by males due to dominance in size and a male s desire to increase mating success feldhamer p 641 parasites parasites of fishers include baylisascaris taenia sibirica

journal of wildlife diseases 15 3 409 412 habitat right thumb a fisher in woods near ipswich massachusetts although fishers are competent tree climbers they spend most of their time on forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats they have been found in extensive conifer forests typical of boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer forests fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80 coverage and avoid areas with less than 50 coverage powell p 88 fishers are more likely to be found in old growth forests since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning forests that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appear to be unsuitable for their needs powell p 92 fishers also select for forest floors with large amounts of coarse woody debris in western forests where fire regularly removes understory debris fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content powell p 93 distribution thumb a fisher climbing a tree at night fishers are widespread throughout northern forests of north america they are found from nova scotia in east to pacific shore of british columbia and alaska they can be found as far north as great slave lake in northwest territories and as far south as mountains of oregon isolated populations occur in sierra nevada of california throughout new england and appalachian mountains of pennsylvania maryland west virginia feldhamer p 636 and virginia in late 19th and early 20th centuries fishers were virtually eliminated from southern and eastern parts of their range including most american states and eastern canada including nova scotia overtrapping and loss of forest habitat were reasons for decline powell p 77 most states had placed restrictions on fisher trapping by 1930s coincidental with end of logging boom a combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover populations have since recovered sufficiently that species is no longer endangered increasing forest cover in eastern north america means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for near future between 1955 and 1985 some states had allowed limited trapping to resume in areas where fishers were eliminated porcupine populations subsequently increased areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops in these cases fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into forest once fisher populations became re established porcupine numbers returned to natural levels powell pp 77 80 in washington fisher sightings were reported into 1980s but an extensive survey in 1990s did not locate any scattered fisher populations now exist in pacific northwest in 1961 fishers from british columbia and minnesota were reintroduced in oregon to southern cascades near klamath falls and to wallowa mountains near la grande from 1977 1980 fishers were introduced to region around crater lake starting in january 2008 fishers were reintroduced into washington state initial reintroduction was on olympic peninsula 90 animals with subsequent reintroductions into south cascade mountains reintroduced animals are monitored by radio collars and remote cameras and have been shown to be reproducing from 2008 to 2011 about 40 fishers were reintroduced in northern sierra nevada near stirling city complementing fisher populations in yosemite national park and along california s northern boundary between pacific coast ranges and klamath mountains fishers are a protected species in oregon washington and wyoming in idaho and california fishers are protected through a closed trapping season but they are not afforded any specific protection however in california fisher has been granted threatened status under endangered species act in june 2011 u s fish and wildlife service recommended that fishers be removed from endangered list in idaho montana and wyoming recent

having virtually disappeared after construction of cape cod canal in early 1900s some reports have shown that populations have become re established on cape cod although populations are likely smaller than populations in western part of new england relationship with humans fishers have had a long history of contact with humans but most of it has been to detriment of fisher populations unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered in one case a fisher was blamed for an attack on a 6 year old boy in another case a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a 12 year old boy fur trade and conservation right thumb fisher pelts sold 1920 1984 fishers have been trapped since 18th century they have been popular with trappers due to value of their fur which has been used for scarves and neck pieces it is reported that fisher tails were used in making of a form of ceremonial hat worn by jews of certain hasidic sects best pelts are from winter trapping with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping lowest quality furs come from out of season trapping when fishers are moulting they are easily trapped and value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species hodgson pp 17 18 prices for pelts have varied considerably over past 100 years they were highest in 1920s and 1930s when average prices were about us 100 powell roger a martes pennanti american society of mammalogists may 8 1981 in 1936 pelts were being offered for sale in new york city for 450 750 per pelt hodgson pp 97 98 prices declined through 1960s but picked up again in late 1970s in 1979 hudson s bay company paid 410 for one female pelt in 1999 16 638 pelts were sold in canada for c 449 307 at an average price of 27 between 1900 and 1940 fishers were threatened with near extinction in southern part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat in new england fishers along with most other furbearers were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping fishers became extirpated in many northern u s states after 1930 but were still abundant enough in canada to maintain a harvest over 3 000 fishers per year limited protection was afforded in early 20th century but total protection was not given to few remaining fishers until 1934 closed seasons habitat recovery and reintroductions have restored fishers to much of their original range trapping resumed in u s after 1962 once numbers had recovered sufficiently during early 1970s value of fisher pelts soared leading to another population crash in 1976 after a few years of closed seasons fisher trapping reopened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits population has steadily increased since then with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals despite a much lower pelt value captivity left thumb fisher fur pelt dyed fishers have been captured live for fur farming zoo specimens and scientific research from 1920 1946 pelt prices averaged about c 137 since pelts were relatively valuable attempts were made to raise fishers on farms fur farming was popular with other species such as mink and ermine so same techniques were thought to be applicable to fishers however farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle in general knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at time farmers noted that females mated in spring but did not give birth due to declining pelt prices most fisher farms closed operations by late 1940s hodgson pp 4 5 fishers have also been captured and bred by zoos but they are not a common zoo species fishers are poor animals to exhibit because in general they hide from visitors all day some zoos have had difficulty keeping fishers alive since they are susceptible to many diseases in captivity powell pp 207 8 yet at least one example shows a fisher kept in captivity that lived to be 10 years old and another living to be about 14 years old well beyond its natural lifespan of 7 years in 1974 r a powell raised two fisher kits for purpose of performing scientific research his primary interest was an attempt to measure activity of fishers to determine how much food animals required to function he did this by running them through treadmill exercises that simulated activity in wild he compared this to their food intake and used data to estimate daily food requirements research lasted for two years after one year one of fishers died due to unknown causes second was released back into wilderness

samples poisoning thumb male fisher killed by anticoagulant rodenticide on a marijuana grow site on us forest service lands southern sierra nevada mountains in 2012 a study conducted by integral ecology research center integral ecology research center uc davis u s forest service and tribe showed that fishers in california were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation in this study 79 of fishers that were tested in california were exposed to an average of 1 61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants a 2015 follow up study building on these data determined that trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85 that california fishers were now exposed to an average of 1 73 different anticoagulant rodenticides and that 9 more fishers died bringing total to 13 extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within sierra national forest fishers had an average of 5 3 individual grow sites within their home range one fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory literature one of first mentions of fishers in literature occurred in audubon book of true nature stories robert snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in woods of adirondack mountains of new york he recounts three sightings including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine in winter of fisher cameron langford relates a fictional encounter between a fisher and an aging recluse living in forest recluse frees fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health fisher tolerates attention but being a wild animal returns to forest when well enough langford uses ecology and known habits of fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in northern woods of canada fishers are mentioned in several other books including
