a brain is an organ that serves as center of nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals it is located in head usually close to sensory organs for senses such as vision it is most complex organ in a vertebrate s body in a human cerebral cortex contains approximately 14 16 billion neurons and estimated number of neurons in cerebellum is 55 70 billion each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons these neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of brain or body targeting specific recipient cells physiologically brains exert centralized control over a body s other organs they act on rest of body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving secretion of chemicals called hormones this centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in environment some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by spinal cord or peripheral ganglia but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved recent models in modern neuroscience treat brain as a biological computer very different in mechanism from an electronic computer but similar in sense that it acquires information from surrounding world stores it and processes it in a variety of ways this article compares properties of brains across entire range of animal species with greatest attention to vertebrates it deals with human brain insofar as it shares properties of other brains ways in which human brain differs from other brains are covered in human brain article several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context most important is brain disease and effects of brain damage that are covered in human brain article anatomy thumb right alt a blob with a blue patch in center surrounded by a white area surrounded by a thin strip of dark colored material cross section of olfactory bulb of a rat stained in two different ways at same time one stain shows neuron cell bodies other shows receptors for neurotransmitter gaba shape and size of brain varies greatly between species and identifying common features is often difficult nevertheless there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species some aspects of brain structure are common to almost entire range of animal species others distinguish advanced brains from more primitive ones or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other and then sliced apart for examination of interior visually interior of brain consists of areas of so called grey matter with a dark color separated by areas of white matter with a lighter color further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations it is also possible to examine microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope and to trace pattern of connections from one brain area to another cellular structure thumb 250px alt drawing showing a neuron with a fiber emanating from it labeled axon and making contact with another cell an inset shows an enlargement of contact zone neurons generate electrical signals that travel along their axons when a pulse of electricity reaches a junction called a synapse it causes a neurotransmitter chemical to be released which binds to receptors on other cells and thereby alters their electrical activity brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells neurons and glial cells glial cells also known as glia or come in several types and perform a number of critical functions including structural support metabolic support insulation and guidance of development neurons however are usually considered most important cells in brain property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances they send these signals by means of an axon which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from cell body and projects usually with numerous branches to other areas sometimes nearby sometimes in distant parts of brain or body length of an axon can be extraordinary for example if a pyramidal cell an excitatory neuron of cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became size of a human body its axon equally magnified would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter extending more than a kilometer these axons transmit signals in form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along axon at speeds of 1 100 meters per second some neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of 10 100 per second usually in irregular patterns other neurons are quiet most of time but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses a single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells when an action potential traveling along an axon arrives at a synapse it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in membrane of target cell thumb left alt a bright green cell is seen against a red and black background with long highly branched green processes extending out from it in multiple directions neurons often have extensive networks of dendrites which receive synaptic connections shown is a pyramidal neuron from hippocampus stained for green fluorescent protein synapses are key functional elements of brain essential function of brain is cell to cell communication and synapses are points at which communication occurs human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses even brain of a fruit fly contains several million functions of these synapses are very diverse some are excitatory exciting target cell others are inhibitory others work by activating second messenger systems that change internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways a large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable that is they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by patterns of signals that pass through them it is widely believed that activity dependent modification of synapses is brain s primary mechanism for learning and memory most of space in brain is taken up by axons which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts a myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin which serves to greatly increase speed of signal propagation there are also axons myelin is white making parts of brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light colored white matter in contrast to darker colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies evolution generic bilaterian nervous system thumb right 300px alt a rod shaped body contains a digestive system running from mouth at one end to anus at other alongside digestive system is a nerve cord with a brain at end near to mouth nervous system of a generic bilaterian animal in form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements and a brain at front except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges which have no nervous system and cnidarians which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net all living multicellular animals are bilaterians meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape that is left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other all bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in cambrian period 485 540 million years ago and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had shape of a simple with a segmented body at a schematic level that basic worm shape continues to be reflected in body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians including vertebrates fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from mouth to anus and a nerve cord with an enlargement a ganglion for each body segment with an especially large ganglion at front called brain brain is small and simple in some species such as nematode worms in other species including vertebrates it is most complex organ in body some types of worms such as leeches also have an enlarged ganglion at back end of nerve cord known as a tail brain there are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain including echinoderms and tunicates it has not been definitively established whether existence of these brainless species indicates that earliest bilaterians lacked a brain or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to disappearance of a previously existing brain structure invertebrates thumb right alt a fly resting on a reflective surface a large red eye faces camera body appears transparent apart from black pigment at end of its abdomen fruit flies drosophila have been extensively studied to gain insight into role of genes in brain development this category includes tardigrades arthropods molluscs and numerous types of worms diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains arthropods insects crustaceans arachnids and others and cephalopods octopuses squids and similar molluscs brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through body of animal arthropods have a central brain ganglion with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing cephalopods such as octopus and squid have largest brains of any invertebrates there are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work fruit flies drosophila because of large array of techniques available for studying their genetics have been a natural subject for studying role of genes in brain development in spite of large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals many aspects of drosophila have been shown to be relevant to humans first biological clock genes for example were identified by examining drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles a search in genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes which were found to play similar roles in mouse biological clock and therefore almost certainly in human biological clock as well studies done on drosophila also show that most regions of brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans like drosophila has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics in early 1970s sydney brenner chose it as a model organism for studying way that genes control development one of advantages of working with this worm is that body plan is very stereotyped nervous system of hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons always in same places making identical synaptic connections in every worm brenner s team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope then visually matched fibers from section to section to map out every neuron and synapse in entire body complete neuronal wiring diagram of c elegans its connectome was achieved nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism and information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible sea slug aplysia californica was chosen by nobel prize winning neurophysiologist eric kandel as a model for studying cellular basis of learning and memory because of simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments vertebrates thumb upright alt a t shaped object is made up of cord at bottom which feeds into a lower central mass this is topped by a larger central mass with an arm extending from either side brain of a shark first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago mya during cambrian period and may have resembled modern hagfish in form sharks appeared about 450 mya amphibians about 400 mya reptiles about 350 mya and mammals about 200 mya each species has an equally long evolutionary history but brains of modern lampreys sharks amphibians reptiles and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows evolutionary sequence all of these brains contain same set of basic anatomical components but many are rudimentary in hagfish whereas in mammals foremost part telencephalon is greatly elaborated and expanded brains are most simply compared in terms of their size relationship between brain size body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species as a rule brain size increases with body size but not in a simple linear proportion in general smaller animals tend to have larger brains measured as a fraction of body size for mammals relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0 75 this formula describes central tendency but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree in a way that reflects in part complexity of their behavior for example primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than formula predicts predators tend to have larger brains than their prey relative to body size thumb 250px left alt nervous system is shown as a rod with protrusions along its length spinal cord at bottom connects to hindbrain which widens out before narrowing again this is connected to midbrain which again bulges and which finally connects to forebrain which has two large protrusions main subdivisions of embryonic vertebrate brain left which later differentiate into structures of adult brain right all vertebrate brains share a common underlying form which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development in its earliest form brain appears as three swellings at front end of neural tube these swellings eventually become forebrain midbrain and hindbrain prosencephalon mesencephalon and rhombencephalon respectively at earliest stages of brain development three areas are roughly equal in size in many classes of vertebrates such as fish and amphibians three parts remain similar in size in adult but in mammals forebrain becomes much larger than other parts and midbrain becomes very small brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue living brain tissue is pinkish on outside and mostly white on inside with subtle variations in color vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate skull from brain blood vessels enter central nervous system through holes in meningeal layers cells in blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another forming blood brain barrier which blocks passage of many toxins and pathogens though at same time blocking antibodies and some drugs thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of brain neuroanatomists usually divide vertebrate brain into six main regions telencephalon cerebral hemispheres diencephalon thalamus and hypothalamus mesencephalon midbrain cerebellum pons and medulla oblongata each of these areas has a complex internal structure some parts such as cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within available space other parts such as thalamus and hypothalamus consist of clusters of many small nuclei thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure chemistry and connectivity although same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry especially in forebrain area brain of a shark shows basic components in a straightforward way but in teleost fishes great majority of existing fish species forebrain has become everted like a sock turned inside out in birds there are also major changes in forebrain structure these distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species thumb right alt corresponding regions of human and shark brain are shown shark brain is splayed out while human brain is more compact shark brain starts with medulla which is surrounded by various structures and ends with telencephalon cross section of human brain shows medulla at bottom surrounded by same structures with telencephalon thickly coating top of brain main anatomical regions of vertebrate brain shown for shark and human same parts are present but they differ greatly in size and shape here is a list of some of most important vertebrate brain components along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood medulla along with spinal cord contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting heart rate and digestive processes pons lies in brainstem directly above medulla among other things it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep respiration swallowing bladder function equilibrium eye movement facial expressions and posture hypothalamus is a small region at base of forebrain whose complexity and importance belies its size it is composed of numerous small nuclei each with distinct connections and neurochemistry hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles eating and drinking and release of some hormones thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions some are involved in relaying information to and from cerebral hemispheres while others are involved in motivation subthalamic area zona incerta seems to contain action generating systems for several types of behaviors such as eating drinking defecation and copulation cerebellum modulates outputs of other brain systems whether motor related or thought related to make them certain and precise removal of cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy this precision is not built in but learned by trial and error muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within cerebellum 10 of brain s total volume consists of cerebellum and 50 of all neurons are held within its structure knierim james 2015 cerebellum section 3 chapter 5 neuroscience online department of neurobiology and anatomy university of texas medical school at houston optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space most commonly in response to visual input in mammals it is usually referred to as superior colliculus and its best studied function is to direct eye movements it also directs reaching movements and other object directed actions it receives strong visual inputs but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions such as auditory input in owls and input from pit organs in snakes in some primitive fishes such as lampreys this region is largest part of brain superior colliculus is part of midbrain pallium is a layer of gray matter that lies on surface of forebrain and is most complex and most recent evolutionary development of brain as an organ in reptiles and mammals it is called cerebral cortex multiple functions involve pallium including smell and spatial memory in mammals where it becomes so large as to dominate brain it takes over functions from many other brain areas in many mammals cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci folds increase surface area of cortex and therefore increase amount of gray matter and amount of information that can be stored and processed hippocampus strictly speaking is found only in mammals however area it derives from medial pallium has counterparts in all vertebrates there is evidence that this part of brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes birds reptiles and mammals basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in forebrain primary function of basal ganglia appears to be action selection they send inhibitory signals to all parts of brain that can generate motor behaviors and in right circumstances can release inhibition so that action generating systems are able to execute their actions reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within basal ganglia olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to olfactory part of pallium it is a major brain component in many vertebrates but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell mammals most obvious difference between brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size on average a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of same body size and ten times as large as that of a reptile of same body size size however is not only difference there are also substantial differences in shape hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates but dramatic differences appear in forebrain which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure cerebral cortex is part of brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals in non mammalian vertebrates surface of cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three layered structure called pallium in mammals pallium evolves into a complex six layered structure called neocortex or several areas at edge of neocortex including hippocampus and amygdala are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates elaboration of cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas superior colliculus which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates shrinks to a small size in mammals and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of cerebral cortex cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion dedicated to supporting cerebral cortex which has no counterpart in other vertebrates primates encephalization 4 7 2 2 13 2 4 brains of humans and other primates contain same structures as brains of other mammals but are generally larger in proportion to body size encephalization quotient eq is used to compare brain sizes across species it takes into account nonlinearity of brain to body relationship humans have an average eq in 7 to 8 range while most other primates have an eq in 2 to 3 range dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans but nearly all other mammals have eq values that are substantially lower most of enlargement of primate brain comes from a massive expansion of cerebral cortex especially prefrontal cortex and parts of cortex involved in vision visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas with a complex web of interconnections it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of total surface of primate neocortex prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning working memory motivation attention and executive control it takes up a much larger proportion of brain for primates than for other species and an especially large fraction of human brain development thumb right 300px alt very simple drawing of front end of a human embryo showing each vesicle of developing brain in a different color brain of a human embryo in sixth week of development brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages it changes in shape from a simple swelling at front of nerve cord in earliest embryonic stages to a complex array of areas and connections neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells and then migrate through tissue to reach their ultimate locations once neurons have positioned themselves their axons sprout and navigate through brain branching and extending as they go until tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections in a number of parts of nervous system neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during early stages and then unneeded ones are pruned away for vertebrates early stages of neural development are similar across all species as embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure a narrow strip of ectoderm running along midline of back is induced to become neural plate precursor of nervous system neural plate folds inward to form neural groove and then lips that line groove merge to enclose neural tube a hollow cord of cells with a fluid filled ventricle at center at front end ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are precursors of prosencephalon forebrain mesencephalon midbrain and rhombencephalon hindbrain at next stage forebrain splits into two vesicles called telencephalon which will contain cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures and diencephalon which will contain thalamus and hypothalamus at about same time hindbrain splits into metencephalon which will contain cerebellum and pons and myelencephalon which will contain medulla oblongata each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated resulting cells then migrate sometimes for long distances to their final positions once a neuron is in place it extends dendrites and an axon into area around it axons because they commonly extend a great distance from cell body and need to reach specific targets grow in a particularly complex way tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone studded with chemical receptors these receptors sense local environment causing growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path result of this pathfinding process is that growth cone navigates through brain until it reaches its destination area where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses considering entire brain thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes though in many parts of brain axons initially overgrow and then are pruned by mechanisms that depend on neural activity in projection from eye to midbrain for example structure in adult contains a very precise mapping connecting each point on surface of retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer in first stages of development each axon from retina is guided to right general vicinity in midbrain by chemical cues but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons retina before birth contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across retinal layer these waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at same time that is they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about spatial arrangement of neurons this information is exploited in midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken and eventually vanish if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of target cell result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of map leaving it finally in its precise adult form similar things happen in other brain areas an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance but then gradually refined by activity dependent mechanisms partly driven by internal dynamics partly by external sensory inputs in some cases as with retina midbrain system activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in developing brain and apparently exist solely to guide development in humans and many other mammals new neurons are created mainly before birth and infant brain contains substantially more neurons than adult brain there are however a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are olfactory bulb which is involved in sense of smell and dentate gyrus of hippocampus where there is evidence that new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories with these exceptions however set of neurons that is present in early childhood is set that is present for life glial cells are different as with most types of cells in body they are generated throughout lifespan there has long been debate about whether qualities of mind personality and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing this is nature and nurture controversy although many details remain to be settled neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important genes determine general form of brain and genes determine how brain reacts to experience experience however is required to refine matrix of synaptic connections which in its developed form contains far more information than genome does in some respects all that matters is presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development in other respects quantity and quality of experience are important for example there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices indicating a higher density of synaptic connections than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted physiology functions of brain depend on ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes most notably interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses neurotransmitters and receptors neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on membrane of synapse s target cell and thereby alter electrical or chemical properties of receptor molecules with few exceptions each neuron in brain releases same chemical neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters at all synaptic connections it makes with other neurons this rule is known as dale s principle thus a neuron can be characterized by neurotransmitters that it releases great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems this applies to drugs such as nicotine heroin cocaine alcohol fluoxetine chlorpromazine and many others two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in vertebrate brain are glutamate which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons and gamma aminobutyric acid gaba which is almost always inhibitory neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of brain because of their ubiquity drugs that act on glutamate or gaba tend to have broad and powerful effects some general anesthetics act by reducing effects of glutamate most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing effects of gaba there are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of brain often areas dedicated to a particular function serotonin for example primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called raphe nuclei norepinephrine which is involved in arousal comes exclusively from a nearby small area called locus coeruleus other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in brain but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and gaba electrical activity thumb right alt

plot brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure as a side effect of electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active when large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside skull using electroencephalography eeg or magnetoencephalography meg eeg recordings along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside brains of animals such as rats show that brain of a living animal is constantly active even during sleep each part of brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and activity which may vary according to behavioral state in mammals cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep faster alpha waves when animal is awake but inattentive and chaotic looking irregular activity when animal is actively engaged in a task during an epileptic seizure brain s inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels producing eeg traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain relating these population level patterns to computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology metabolism all vertebrates have a blood brain barrier that allows metabolism inside brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of body glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling chemical composition of fluid that surrounds neurons including levels of ions and nutrients brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals need to limit body weight in order for example to fly has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats most of brain s energy consumption goes into sustaining electric charge membrane potential of neurons most vertebrate species devote between 2 and 8 of basal metabolism to brain in primates however percentage is much higher in humans it rises to 20 25 energy consumption of brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this forms basis for functional brain imaging methods of pet fmri and brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen dependent metabolism of glucose i e blood sugar but ketones provide a major alternative source together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids caprylic and heptanoic acids lactate acetate and possibly amino acids function thumb right model of a neural circuit in cerebellum as proposed by james s albus information from sense organs is collected in brain there it is used to determine what actions organism is to take brain processes raw data to extract information about structure of environment next it combines processed information with information about current needs of animal and with memory of past circumstances finally on basis of results it generates motor response patterns these signal processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems function of brain is to provide coherent control over actions of an animal a centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co activated in complex patterns it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of body to evoke responses in other parts and it can prevent different parts of body from acting at cross purposes to each other perception thumb right alt drawing

with information about light sound chemical composition of atmosphere temperature head orientation limb position chemical composition of bloodstream and more in other animals additional senses are present such as infrared heat sense of snakes magnetic field sense of some birds or electric field sense of some types of fish each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells such as light receptive neurons in retina of eye or vibration sensitive neurons in cochlea of ear axons of sensory receptor cells travel into spinal cord or brain where they transmit their signals to a first order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality this primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher order sensory areas that are dedicated to same modality eventually via a way station in thalamus signals are sent to cerebral cortex where they are processed to extract relevant features and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems motor control motor systems are areas of brain that are involved in initiating body movements that is in activating muscles except for muscles that control eye which are driven by nuclei in midbrain all voluntary muscles in body are directly innervated by motor neurons in spinal cord and hindbrain spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to spinal cord and by inputs that descend from brain intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming descending connections from brain allow for more sophisticated control brain contains several motor areas that project directly to spinal cord at lowest level are motor areas in medulla and pons which control stereotyped movements such as walking breathing or swallowing at a higher level are areas in midbrain such as red nucleus which is responsible for coordinating movements of arms and legs at a higher level yet is primary motor cortex a strip of tissue located at posterior edge of frontal lobe primary motor cortex sends projections to subcortical motor areas but also sends a massive projection directly to spinal cord through pyramidal tract this direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of fine details of movements other motor related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to primary motor areas among most important secondary areas are premotor cortex basal ganglia and cerebellum major areas involved in controlling movement area location function ventral horn spinal cord contains motor neurons that directly activate muscles oculomotor nuclei midbrain contains motor neurons that directly activate eye muscles cerebellum hindbrain calibrates precision and timing of movements basal ganglia forebrain action selection on basis of motivation motor cortex frontal lobe direct cortical activation of spinal motor circuits premotor cortex frontal lobe groups elementary movements into coordinated patterns supplementary motor area frontal lobe sequences movements into temporal patterns prefrontal cortex frontal lobe planning and other executive functions in addition to all of above brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control autonomic nervous system which works by secreting hormones and by modulating smooth muscles of gut arousal many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas a key component of arousal system is suprachiasmatic nucleus scn a tiny part of hypothalamus located directly above point at which optic nerves from two eyes cross scn contains body s central biological clock neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours circadian rhythms these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of clock genes scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution but it ordinarily receives input from optic nerves through tract that allows daily light dark cycles to calibrate clock scn projects to a set of areas in hypothalamus brainstem and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep wake cycles an important component of system is reticular formation a group of neuron clusters scattered diffusely through core of lower brain reticular neurons send signals to thalamus which in turn sends activity level controlling signals to every part of cortex damage to reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma sleep involves great changes in brain activity until 1950s it was generally believed that brain essentially shuts off during sleep but this is now known to be far from true activity continues but patterns become very different there are two types of sleep rem sleep with dreaming and nrem non rem usually without dreaming sleep which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured rem light nrem and deep nrem during deep nrem sleep also called slow wave sleep activity in cortex takes form of large synchronized waves whereas in waking state it is noisy and desynchronized levels of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep and fall almost to zero during rem sleep levels of acetylcholine show reverse pattern homeostasis thumb right cross section of a human head showing location of hypothalamus for any animal survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation these include temperature water content salt concentration in bloodstream blood glucose levels blood oxygen level and others ability of an animal to regulate internal environment of its body milieu as pioneering physiologist claude bernard called it is known as homeostasis greek for standing still maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of brain basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback any time a parameter diverges from its set point sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes parameter to shift back toward its optimum value this principle is widely used in engineering for example in control of temperature using a thermostat in vertebrates part of brain that plays greatest role is hypothalamus a small region at base of forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or importance of its function hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei most of which are involved in basic biological functions some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality aggression or maternal behaviors but many of them relate to homeostasis several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in lining of blood vessels conveying information about temperature sodium level glucose level blood oxygen level and other parameters these hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies some of outputs also go to pituitary gland a tiny gland attached to brain directly underneath hypothalamus pituitary gland secretes hormones into bloodstream where they circulate throughout body and induce changes in cellular activity motivation thumb right 350px components of basal ganglia shown in two cross sections of human brain blue caudate nucleus and putamen green globus pallidus red subthalamic nucleus black substantia nigra individual animals need to express survival promoting behaviors such as seeking food water shelter and a mate motivational system in brain monitors current state of satisfaction of these goals and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise motivational system works largely by a reward punishment mechanism when a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences reward mechanism in brain is activated which induces structural changes inside brain that cause same behavior to be repeated later whenever a similar situation arises conversely when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences brain s punishment mechanism is activated inducing structural changes that cause behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in future most organisms studied to date utilize a reward punishment mechanism for instance worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers in vertebrates reward punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures at heart of which lie basal ganglia a set of interconnected areas at base of forebrain basal ganglia are central site at which decisions are made basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of motor systems in brain when this inhibition is released a motor system is permitted to execute action it is programmed to carry out rewards and punishments function by altering relationship between inputs that basal ganglia receive and decision signals that are emitted reward mechanism is better understood than punishment mechanism because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively research has shown that neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role addictive drugs such as cocaine amphetamine and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause effects of dopamine inside brain to be enhanced learning and memory almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience even most primitive types of worms because behavior is driven by brain activity changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside brain already in late 19th century theorists like santiago ramon y cajal argued that most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in synaptic connections between neurons until 1970 however experimental evidence to support synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking in 1971 tim bliss and terje lomo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long term potentiation paper showed clear evidence of activity induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified mechanism of synaptic change and uncovered other types of activity driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas including cerebral cortex hippocampus basal ganglia and cerebellum brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in process neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by brain in distinct ways working memory is ability of brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about task that an animal is currently engaged in this sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by formation of cell assemblies groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another episodic memory is ability to remember details of specific events this sort of memory can last for a lifetime much evidence implicates hippocampus in playing a crucial role people with severe damage to hippocampus sometimes show amnesia that is inability to form new long lasting episodic memories semantic memory is ability to learn facts and relationships this sort of memory is probably stored largely in cerebral cortex mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information instrumental learning is ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior it is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on basal ganglia motor learning is ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing or more generally by repetition a number of brain areas are involved including premotor cortex basal ganglia and especially cerebellum which functions as a large memory bank for of parameters of movement research thumb human brain project is a large scientific research project starting in 2013 which aims to simulate complete human brain field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand brain and rest of nervous system psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior and neurology is medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of nervous system brain is also most important organ studied in psychiatry branch of medicine that works to study prevent and treat mental disorders cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with brain such as computer science artificial intelligence and similar fields and philosophy oldest method of studying brain is anatomical and until middle of 20th century much of progress in neuroscience came from development of better cell stains and better microscopes neuroanatomists study large scale structure of brain as well as microscopic structure of neurons and their components especially synapses among other tools they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure chemistry and connectivity in recent years development of techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes also functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior study chemical pharmacological and electrical properties of brain their primary tools are drugs and recording devices thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect nervous system some in highly specific ways recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes either glued to scalp as in eeg studies or implanted inside brains of animals for extracellular recordings which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons because brain does not contain pain receptors it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize brain area responsible for epileptic seizures functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time but they have great advantage of being noninvasive thumb left 300px alt drawing showing a monkey in a restraint chair a computer monitor a arm and three pieces of computer equipment with arrows between them to show flow of information design of an experiment in which brain activity from a monkey was used to control a robotic arm another approach to brain function is to examine consequences of damage to specific brain areas even though it is protected by skull and meninges surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from bloodstream by blood brain barrier delicate nature of brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage in humans effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function because there is no ability to experimentally control nature of damage however this information is often difficult to interpret in animal studies most commonly involving rats it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine consequences for behavior computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches first use of computers to study brain second study of how brains perform computation on one hand it is possible to write a computer program to simulate operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks on other hand it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating or mathematically analyzing operations of simplified units that have some of properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity computational functions of brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists computational modeling is concerned with study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to study of brain and a focus on roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity most common subjects are mice because of availability of technical tools it is now possible with relative ease to knock out or mutate a wide variety of genes and then examine effects on brain function more sophisticated approaches are also being used for example using cre lox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of brain at specific times history thumb right illustration by rene descartes of how brain implements a reflex response oldest brain to have been discovered was in armenia in 1 cave complex brain estimated to be over 5 000 years old was found in skull of a 12 to 14 year old girl although brains were shriveled they were well preserved due to climate found inside cave early philosophers were divided as to whether seat of soul lies in brain or heart aristotle favored heart and thought that function of brain was merely to cool blood democritus inventor of atomic theory of matter argued for a three part soul with intellect in head emotion in heart and lust near liver unknown author of on sacred disease a medical treatise in hippocratic corpus came down unequivocally in favor of brain writing thumb left upright andreas vesalius fabrica published in 1543 showing base of human brain including optic cerebellum olfactory bulbs etc roman physician galen also argued for importance of brain and theorized in some depth about how it might work galen traced out anatomical relationships among brain nerves and muscles demonstrating that all muscles in body are connected to brain through a branching network of nerves he postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called usually translated as animal spirits galen s ideas were widely known during middle ages but not much further progress came until renaissance when detailed anatomical study resumed combined with theoretical speculations of rene descartes and those who followed him descartes like galen thought of nervous system in hydraulic terms he believed that highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non physical res but that majority of behaviors of humans and all behaviors of animals could be explained mechanistically first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function though came from investigations of luigi galvani 1737 1798 who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract since that time each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from development of a new technique of investigation until early years of 20th century most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells particularly critical was invention of golgi stain which when correctly used stains only a small fraction of neurons but stains them in their entirety including cell body dendrites and axon without such a stain brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers in which it is impossible to determine any structure in hands of camillo golgi and especially of spanish santiago ramon y cajal new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity thumb right alt a drawing on yellowing paper with an archiving stamp in corner a spidery tree branch structure connects to top of a mass a few narrow processes follow away from bottom of mass drawing by santiago ramon y cajal of two types of golgi stained neurons from cerebellum of a pigeon in first half of 20th century advances in electronics enabled investigation of electrical properties of nerve cells culminating in work by alan hodgkin andrew huxley and others on biophysics of action potential and work of bernard katz and others on electrochemistry of synapse these studies complemented anatomical picture with a conception of brain as a dynamic entity reflecting new understanding in 1942 charles sherrington visualized workings of brain waking from sleep invention of electronic computers in 1940s along with development of mathematical information theory led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems this concept formed basis of field of cybernetics and eventually gave rise to field now known as computational neuroscience earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise as for example in john von neumann s 1958 book computer and brain over years though accumulating information about electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in direction of increasing realism one of most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled what frog s eye tells frog s brain paper examined visual responses of neurons in retina and optic tectum of frogs and came to conclusion that some neurons in tectum of frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as bug a few years later david and torsten wiesel discovered cells in primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in field of view a discovery for which they won a nobel prize follow up studies in higher order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity color movement and aspects of shape with areas located at increasing distances from primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates some related to memory some to abstract types of cognition such as space theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks which can be simulated using computers some useful models are abstract focusing on conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than details of how they are implemented in brain other models attempt to incorporate data about biophysical properties of real neurons no model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function though essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time furthermore even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations so brain models that don t reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources however human brain project is trying to build a realistic detailed computational model of entire human brain wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested with high profile scientists on both sides of argument in second half of 20th century developments in chemistry electron microscopy genetics computer science functional brain imaging and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function in united states 1990s were officially designated as decade of brain to commemorate advances made in brain research and to promote funding for such research in 21st century these trends have continued and several new approaches have come into prominence including recording which allows activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at same time genetic engineering which allows molecular components of brain to be altered experimentally genomics which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in dna properties and neuroimaging other uses as food thumb otak cattle s brain curry from indonesia animal brains are used as food in
