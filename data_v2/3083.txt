iraq ended in repeated failure twice his capital mosul was captured by buyid forces which were however unable to defeat local opposition to their rule as a result of his failures to retain power nasir al dawla declined in influence and prestige he was eclipsed by actions of his brother ali who established his rule more firmly over aleppo and northern syria after 964 nasir al dawla s eldest son abu

traditionally controlled mosul and its region until late 9th century when abbasid government tried to impose firmer control over province hamdan ibn hamdun was one of most determined taghlibi leaders in opposing this move notably in his effort to fend off abbasids he secured alliance of kurds living in mountains north of mosul a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family s later fortunes family members intermarried with kurds who were also prominent in hamdanid military canard 1971 p 2004 pp 266 269 hamdan s possessions were captured in 895 by abbasid caliph al mu tadid and hamdan himself was forced to surrender near mosul after a long chase he was put in prison but his son husayn ibn hamdan who had surrendered fortress of ardumusht to caliph s forces managed to secure family s future he raised troops among taghlib in exchange for tax remissions and established a commanding influence in jazira by acting as a mediator between abbasid authorities and arab and kurdish population it was this strong local base which allowed family to survive its often strained relationship with central abbasid government in baghdad during early 10th century kennedy 2004 pp 266 268 husayn was a successful general distinguishing himself against kharijites and tulunids but was disgraced after supporting failed usurpation of ibn al mu tazz in 908 his younger brother ibrahim was

himself upon hamdanids and appointed an unrelated governor over mosul while abdallah s domains were divided among his surviving brothers faced with claims of his uncles hasan was left in charge of a small portion on left bank of tigris in 930 after caliph s governor died hasan managed to regain control over mosul but his uncles nasr and sa id soon removed him from power and confined him to western parts of diyar rabi a in 934 hasan again recovered mosul but sa id residing in baghdad and supported by caliphal government evicted him again hasan fled to armenia from where he orchestrated sa id s murder only then did his troops occupy mosul and establish him permanently as its ruler finally after defeating caliphal forces under wazir ibn muqla and banu habib his rivals among taghlib in late 935 caliph al radi was forced to formally recognize him as governor of mosul and entire jazira in exchange for an annual tribute of 70 000 gold dinars and supplies of flour for two caliphal capitals of baghdad and samarra kennedy 2004 p 268 resistance to hasan s rule outside of his family s core region around mosul remained however in diyar bakr governor of mayyafariqin ali ibn ja far rebelled against hasan and in diyar mudar qaysi tribes of region around saruj also revolted hasan subdued them and secured control over entire jazira by end of 936 due to efforts of his brother ali who was given governorship of two provinces as a reward bianquis 1997 p 104 in meantime defeated banu habib some 10 000 strong and under leadership of al ala ibn al mu ammar left their lands and fled to territory controlled by byzantine empire this unprecedented move may be explained by fact that a significant portion of tribe still practised christianity or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from south but primary goal of move was to escape from hamdanid authority and taxation hasan also attempted to extend his control to sajid ruled azerbaijan in 934 and 938 but his efforts failed

his rule over mosul hasan showed himself conspicuously loyal to abbasid regime and refused to support revolt of mu nis al khadim against caliph al muqtadir in 932 mu nis succeeded in overthrowing and killing al muqtadir but over next few years abbasid government all but collapsed until in 936 powerful governor of wasit muhammad ibn ra iq assumed title of amir al umara commander of commanders and with it de facto control of abbasid government caliph al radi was reduced to a figurehead role while extensive civil bureaucracy was cut down dramatically both in size and power kennedy 2004 pp 192 195 ibn ra iq s position was anything but secure however and soon a convoluted struggle for control of his office and caliphate with it broke out among various local rulers and turkish and daylamite military chiefs which ended in 946 with ultimate victory of buyids bonner 2010 pp 355 2004 pp 195 196 thus in late 930s hasan encouraged by his control over a large and rich domain entered intrigues of abbasid court and became one of main contenders for title of amir al umara at first hasan tried to exploit weakness of abbasid government to withhold his payment of tribute but turk bajkam who had ousted ibn ra iq in 938 quickly forced him to back down hasan then supported ibn ra iq in latter s quest to regain his lost position bajkam tried to forcefully evict hasan from his jaziran domains but in vain and was eventually killed in a skirmish with kurdish brigands in early 941 bonner 2010 p 355 hasan s great chance came in early 942 when caliph al muttaqi r 940 944 and his closest aides fled baghdad to escape city s imminent fall to barids of basra and sought refuge at mosul hasan now made a direct bid for power he had ibn ra iq assassinated and succeeded him as amir al umara receiving honorific laqab of nasir al dawla defender of dynasty he then escorted caliph back to baghdad which they entered on 4 june 942 to secure his position further nasir al dawla married his daughter to caliph s son bowen 1993 pp 994 995 along with their cousin husayn ibn sa id nasir al dawla s brother ali was instrumental in hamdanid enterprise taking field against baridis who still controlled rich province of basra and were determined to regain baghdad after scoring a victory over them ali was awarded laqab of sayf al dawla sword of dynasty by which he became famous kennedy 2004 p 270 this double award marked first time that a laqab incorporating prestigious element al dawla were granted to anyone other than wazir caliphate s chief minister and was a symbolic affirmation of military s predominance over civil bureaucracy hamdanids success and rule over abbasid capital lasted for little more than a year they lacked funds and were politically isolated finding little support among caliphate s most powerful vassals samanids of transoxiana and ikhshidids of egypt consequently when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops mostly composed of turks daylamites and only a few arabs over pay issues under leadership of turkish general tuzun they were forced to quit baghdad and return to their base mosul bowen 1993 p 995 caliph al muttaqi now appointed tuzun as amir al umara but turk s overbearing manner induced al muttaqi to once again seek refuge in hamdanid court hamdanid forces under sayf al dawla took field against tuzun s army but were defeated hamdanids now concluded an agreement with tuzun which allowed them to keep jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern syria which at time was not under hamdanid control in exchange for an annual tribute of 3 6 million dirhams in meantime caliph was brought to raqqa for greater safety while husayn ibn sa id tried to secure control over northern syria and pre empt egypt s ruler muhammad ibn tughj al ikhshid taking control of region attempt failed as al ikhshid himself advanced into syria took aleppo and marched to raqqa where he met caliph al ikhshid tried to persuade al muttaqi to come to egypt under his protection but caliph refused and al returned to egypt instead al muttaqi persuaded by tuzun s assurances of loyalty and safety returned to baghdad where tuzun deposed and blinded him replacing him with al mustakfi r 944 946 kennedy 2004 p 196 at news of this crime nasir al dawla again refused payment of tribute but tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance henceforth nasir al dawla would be tributary to baghdad but he would find it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over city he once ruled and subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it kennedy 2004 pp 270 271 wars with buyids thumb right 300px map of iraq in 9th 10th centuries in late 945 tuzun died his death weakened abbasid government s ability to maintain its independence against rising power of buyids who under ahmad ibn buya had already consolidated control over fars and kerman and secured cooperation of barids al mustakfi s secretary ibn tried to confront buyids by calling upon nasir al dawla but ahmad advanced on baghdad with his troops and in january 946 he obtained his appointment as amir al umara with honorific mu izz al dawla of state bonner 2010 p 356 to secure their position buyids immediately marched against hamdanids nasir al dawla countered by marching down eastern bank of tigris river and blockading baghdad in end however buyids defeated hamdanids in battle and forced nasir al dawla to retire to from there nasir al dawla began negotiations with buyids aiming to secure recognition of hamdanid control over jazira syria and even egypt as tributaries of caliphate with boundary between buyid and hamdanid spheres placed at tikrit negotiations were disrupted by a rebellion among hamdanids turkish troops but mu izz al dawla who for moment preferred a stable hamdanid state to anarchy on his northern border helped nasir al dawla suppress it peace was agreed on terms outlined above and was affirmed by one of nasir al dawla s sons being taken as a hostage to baghdad conflict between two rivals was renewed in 948 when mu izz al dawla again marched against mosul but was forced to cut off his campaign to assist his brother al dawla who was having trouble in persia in exchange nasir al dawla agreed to recommence payment of tribute for jazira and syria as well as to add names of three buyid brothers after that of caliph in friday prayer another round of warfare erupted in 956 958 while buyids were preoccupied with rebellion of their daylamite troops under ibn khurshid in southern iraq nasir al dawla opportunity to advance south and capture baghdad after suppression of daylamite revolt however hamdanids were not able to maintain their position in face of counteroffensive and abandoned city kennedy 2004 pp 221 271 peace was renewed in exchange for recommencement of tribute and an additional indemnity but when nasir al dawla refused to send second year s payment buyid ruler advanced north unable to confront buyid army in field nasir al dawla abandoned mosul and fled to mayyafariqin and then to his brother sayf al dawla in aleppo buyids captured mosul and nasibin but hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their home territory in mountains of north taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers as a result buyid army was unable to support itself in conquered territory all more since predominantly daylamite troops were resented by local people who launched guerrilla attacks on them kennedy 2004 p 271 sayf al dawla tried to mediate with mu izz al dawla but his first approaches were rebuffed only when he agreed to assume burden of paying his brother s tribute for entire diyar rabi a did buyid ruler agree to peace this agreement marks reversal of roles between two hamdanid brothers and establishment of predominance of family s syrian branch in 964 nasir al dawla tried to renegotiate terms of arrangement but also to secure buyid recognition for his eldest son fadl allah abu taghlib al as his successor mu izz al dawla refused nasir al dawla s demands and again invaded hamdanid territory once again mosul and nasibin were captured while hamdanids fled to mountain fortresses as in 958 buyids were unable to maintain themselves for long in jazira and soon an agreement was reached which allowed hamdanids to return to mosul this time however abu taghlib emerged as effective leader in his father s place it was with him rather than aged nasir al dawla that mui zz al dawla concluded a treaty end of nasir al dawla s rule came in 967 in same year that saw deaths of his brother sayf al dawla and his great rival mu izz al dawla nasir al dawla was reportedly so much affected by his brother s death that he lost interest in life and became remote and avaricious in end abu taghlib already de facto governor of emirate deposed him with aid of his kurdish mother fatima bint ahmad nasir al dawla tried to counter them by turning to one of his other sons hamdan but he was seized and imprisoned in fortress of ardumusht where he died in 968 or 969 domestic policies nasir al dawla was heavily criticized by contemporaries for his oppressive fiscal policies and suffering they caused among population traveller ibn hawqal who visited nasir al dawla s domains reports in length on his seizure of private land in most fertile regions of jazira on flimsy legal charges until he became greatest landowner in his province this was linked with practice of a monoculture of cereals destined to feed growing population of baghdad and coupled with heavy taxation so that sayf al dawla and nasir al dawla are said to have become wealthiest princes in muslim world kennedy 2004 p 265 nevertheless hamdanid administrative machinery seems to have been fairly rudimentary and tribute paid to buyids estimated at somewhere between two and four million dirhams when it was paid at all was a heavy burden on treasury notes references bibliography category 10th
