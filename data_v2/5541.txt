inscribed with club s newly adopted latin motto victoria concordia victory comes from harmony coined by club s programme editor harry homer for first time crest was rendered in colour which varied slightly over crest s lifespan finally becoming red gold and green because of numerous revisions of crest arsenal were unable to copyright it although club had managed to register crest as a trademark and had fought and eventually won a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold unofficial arsenal merchandise arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection therefore in

tradition with such a radical modern design and that fans had not been properly consulted on issue until 1960s a badge was worn on playing shirt only for high profile matches such as fa cup finals usually in form of a monogram of club s initials in red on a white background monogram theme was developed into an art deco style badge on which letters a and c framed a football rather than letter f

put together first team in area no kit could be found so beardsley and bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball shirt was redcurrant a dark shade of red and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops in 1933 herbert chapman wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed updated kit adding white sleeves and changing shade to a brighter pillar box red two possibilities have been suggested for origin of white sleeves one story reports that chapman noticed a supporter in stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by cartoonist tom webster with whom chapman played golf regardless of which story is true red and white shirts have come to define arsenal and team have worn
