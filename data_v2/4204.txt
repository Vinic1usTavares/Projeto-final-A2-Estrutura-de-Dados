strong advocate of free public education financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to larger city of lancaster pennsylvania there he joined whig party and was elected to congress in 1848 his activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852 after a brief flirtation with know nothing party stevens joined newly formed republican party and was elected to congress again in 1858 there with fellow radicals such as massachusetts senator charles sumner he opposed expansion of slavery and concessions

legislation through house as ways and means chairman as war progressed towards a northern victory stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished but that african americans should be given a stake in south s future through confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to freedmen see 40 acres and a mule his plans went too far for moderate republicans and were not enacted after assassination of abraham lincoln in april 1865 stevens came into conflict with new president johnson who sought rapid restoration of seceded states without guarantees for freedmen difference in views caused an ongoing battle between johnson and congress with stevens leading radical republicans after gains in 1866 election radicals took control of reconstruction away from johnson stevens s last great battle was to secure in house articles of impeachment against johnson though senate did not convict president historiographical views of stevens have dramatically shifted over years from early 20th century view of stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of white south to perspective of of 1950s and afterwards who applauded him for his commitment to equality early life and

briefly taught there stevens also began to study law with john mattocks in early 1815 correspondence with friend samuel merrill a fellow vermonter who had moved to york pennsylvania to become

of adams county trefousse p p 14 where he opened an office in september 1816 brodie p 32 stevens knew no one in gettysburg and initially had little success as a lawyer his breakthrough in mid 1817 was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of constables who had arrested him his defense although unsuccessful impressed local people and he never lacked for business thereafter in his legal career he demonstrated propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt of court sir i am doing my best to conceal it metzger p 17 many who memorialized stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer he was involved in first ten cases to reach supreme court of pennsylvania from adams county after he began practice and won nine one case he later wished he had not won was butler v in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner pp 13 16 in gettysburg stevens

them in gettysburg real estate becoming largest landowner in community by 1825 and had an interest in several iron furnaces outside town in addition to assets he acquired enemies after death of a

stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as killer he successfully sued for libel brodie pp 42 45 anti masonry stevens s first political cause was anti masonry which became widespread in 1826 after disappearance and death of william morgan a mason in upstate new york fellow masons were presumed to be killers of morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing order s secret rites since leading candidate in opposition to president john quincy adams was general andrew jackson a mason who mocked opponents of order anti masonry became closely associated with opposition to jackson and to his jacksonian democracy policies once he was elected president in 1828 brodie pp 38 39 jackson s adherents were from old democratic republican party and eventually became known as democrats stevens had been told by fellow attorney and future president james buchanan that he could advance politically if he joined them but stevens could not support jackson out of principle trefousse pp 17 19 for stevens anti masonry became one means of opposing jackson he may also have had personal reasons as masons barred cripples from joining stevens took to anti masonry with enthusiasm and remained loyal to it after most pennsylvanians had dropped cause his biographer hans trefousse suggested that another reason for stevens s virulence was an attack of disease in late 1820s that cost him his hair he thereafter wore wigs often ill fitting and unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning masons trefousse pp 25 26 by 1829 anti masonry had evolved into a political party anti masonic party that proved popular in rural central pennsylvania stevens quickly became prominent in movement attending party s first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831 at latter he pressed candidacy of supreme court justice john mclean as party s presidential candidate but in vain as nomination fell to former attorney general william wirt jackson was easily reelected crushing defeat wirt won only vermont caused party to disappear in most places though it remained powerful in pennsylvania for several years metzger pp 27 pp 26 31 in september 1833 stevens was elected to a one year term in pennsylvania house of representatives as an anti mason and once in capital harrisburg sought to have body establish a committee to investigate masonry stevens gained attention far beyond pennsylvania for his oratory against masonry and also quickly became expert in legislative maneuvers in 1835 a split among democrats put anti masons in control of pennsylvania general assembly legislature granted subpoena powers stevens summoned leading state politicians who were masons including governor george wolf witnesses invoked their fifth amendment right against self incrimination and when stevens verbally abused one of them it created a backlash that caused his own party to end investigation fracas cost stevens reelection in 1836 and issue of anti masonry died in pennsylvania nevertheless stevens remained an opponent of order for rest of his life brodie pp 57 pp 33 37 42 43 crusader for education beginning with his early years in gettysburg stevens advanced cause of universal education at time no state outside new england had free public education for all in pennsylvania there was free education in philadelphia but elsewhere in state those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a pauper s oath stevens opened his extensive private library to public and gave up his presidency of borough council believing his service on school board more important metzger pp 31 32 in 1825 he was elected by voters of adams county as a trustee of gettysburg academy as school was failing stevens got county voters to agree to pay its debt allowing it to be sold as a lutheran seminary it was granted right to award college degrees in 1831 as pennsylvania college and in 1921 became gettysburg college stevens gave school land upon which a building could be raised and for many years served as a trustee brodie p pp 164 166 thumb right portrait of stevens by jacob now owned by gettysburg college in april 1834 stevens working with governor wolf guided through legislature an act to allow districts across state to vote on whether to have public schools and taxes to pay for them gettysburg s district voted in favor and also elected stevens as a school director where he served until 1839 tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal result was a repeal bill that easily passed pennsylvania senate it was widely believed bill would also pass house and be enacted despite opposition by stevens when he rose to speak on april 11 1835 he defended new educational system stating that it would actually save money and demonstrated how he stated opponents were seeking to separate poor into a lower caste than themselves and accused rich of greed and failure to empathize with poor stevens argued build not your monuments of brass or marble but make them of mind brodie pp 60 pp 39 40 repeal bill was defeated stevens was given wide credit trefousse suggested that victory was not due to stevens s eloquence but due to his influence combined with that of governor wolf trefousse p 40 political change move to lancaster in 1838 stevens ran again for legislature he hoped that if remaining anti masons and emerging whig party gained a majority he could be elected to united states senate whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures a campaign dirty even by standards of times followed result was a democrat elected as governor whig control of state senate and state house in dispute with a number of seats from philadelphia in question though stevens won his seat in adams county stevens sought to have those philadelphia democrats excluded which would create a whig majority that could elect a speaker and himself as senator amid rioting in harrisburg later known as buckshot war stevens s ploy backfired with democrats taking control of house stevens remained in legislature most years through 1842 but episode cost him much of his political influence as whigs blamed him for debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party nevertheless he supported pro business and pro development whig stances brodie pp 75 84 he campaigned for whig candidate in 1840 presidential election former general william henry harrison though stevens later alleged that harrison had promised him a cabinet position if elected he received none and any influence ended when harrison died after a month in office to be succeeded by john tyler a southerner hostile to stevens s stances on slavery trefousse pp 57 67 although stevens was most successful lawyer in gettysburg he had accrued debt due to his business interests refusing to take advantage of bankruptcy laws he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality in order to gain money to pay his obligations in 1842 stevens moved his home and practice to city of lancaster he knew lancaster county was an anti mason and whig stronghold which ensured that he retained a political base within a short period he was earning more than any other lancaster attorney by 1848 he had reduced his debts to 30 000 and paid them off soon after it was in lancaster that he engaged services of lydia hamilton smith a housekeeper whose racial makeup was described as mulatto and who remained with him rest of his life trefousse pp 68 69 abolitionist and prewar congressman evolution of views in 1830s few sought immediate eradication of slavery abolitionist movement was young and only recently had figures such as william lloyd garrison taken on fight brodie pp 105 106 stevens s reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers richard current in 1942 suggested it was out of ambition fawn brodie in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of stevens suggested it was out of identification with downtrodden based on his handicap berlin pp 155 158 trefousse in his 1997 work also suggested that stevens s feelings towards downtrodden were a factor combined with remorse over butler case but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator as stevens s fervor in anti slavery cause inhibited his career trefousse p 46 thumb upright stevens s home on queen street lancaster pennsylvania at 1837 pennsylvania constitutional convention stevens who was a delegate fought against disenfranchisement of african americans see black suffrage in pennsylvania meltzer pp 52 53 according to historian eric foner when stevens refused to sign 1837 constitution because of its voting provision he announced his commitment to a non racial definition of american citizenship to which he would adhere for remainder of his life foner p 143 after he moved to lancaster a city not far from mason dixon line he became active in underground railroad not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves but coordinating movements of those seeking freedom trefousse p 73 a 2003 renovation at his former home in lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern attached to main building by a concealed tunnel in which escaped slaves hid stevens until outbreak of american civil war took public position that he supported slavery s end and opposed its expansion nevertheless he would not seek to disturb it in states where it existed as constitution protected their internal affairs from outside interference he also supported whig candidates for president henry clay in p 103 and zachary taylor in 1848 meltzer pp 81 82 first tenure in congress in 1848 stevens ran for election to congress from pennsylvania s 8th congressional district there was opposition to him at whig convention some delegates felt that because stevens had been late to join party he should not receive nomination others disliked his stance on slavery he narrowly won nomination in a strong year for whigs nationally taylor was chosen as president and stevens was elected to congress trefousse pp 76 77 when 31st united states congress convened in december 1849 stevens took his seat joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as salmon p chase stevens spoke out against compromise of 1850 crafted by kentucky senator henry clay that gave victories to both north and south but would allow for some of territories of united states recently gained from mexico to become slave states trefousse pp 79 80 in june as debates continued he stated this word compromise when applied to human rights and constitutional rights i abhor trefousse p 81 nevertheless pieces of legislation that made up compromise passed including fugitive slave act of 1850 which stevens found particularly offensive meltzer p 94 although many americans hoped that compromise would bring sectional peace stevens warned that it would be fruitful mother of future rebellion disunion and civil war brodie p 114 stevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850 even though his stance caused him problems among pro compromise whigs brodie pp 116 119 in 1851 stevens was one of defense lawyers in trial of 38 african americans and three others in federal court in philadelphia on treason charges defendants had been implicated in so called christiana riot in which an attempt to enforce a fugitive slave act warrant had resulted in killing of slaveowner justice robert grier of u s supreme court as circuit justice tried case and instructed jury to acquit on grounds that though defendants might be guilty of murder or riot they were not charged with that and were not guilty of treason well publicized incident and others like it increased polarization over issue of slavery and made stevens a prominent face of northern abolitionism bond p 305 despite this trend stevens suffered political problems he left whig caucus in december 1851 when his colleagues would not join him in seeking repeal of offensive elements of compromise though he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president general winfield scott his political opposition and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in treason trial made him unlikely to win renomination and he sought only to pick his successor his choice was defeated for whig nomination trefousse pp 84 86 know nothing and republican out of office stevens concentrated on practice of law in lancaster remaining one of leading attorneys in state he stayed active in politics and in 1854 to gain more votes for anti slavery movement he joined nativist know nothing party members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations thus they knew nothing and stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar rules of secrecy as masons in 1855 stevens joined new republican party other former whigs who were anti slavery joined as well including william h seward of new york charles e sumner of massachusetts and abraham lincoln of illinois brodie pp 121 123 stevens was a delegate to 1856 republican national convention where he supported justice mclean as he had in 1832 convention however nominated john c fremont whom stevens actively supported in race against his fellow lancastrian democratic candidate james buchanan nonetheless pennsylvania helped elect buchanan brodie pp 129 130 stevens returned to practice of law but in 1858 with president and his party unpopular and nation torn by such controversies as dred scott decision stevens saw an opportunity to return to congress as republican nominee he was easily elected democratic papers were appalled one banner headline read triumphant trefousse pp 95 97 1860 election secession crisis stevens took his seat in 36th united states congress in december 1859 only days after hanging of john brown who had attacked federal arsenal at harpers ferry hoping to cause a slave insurrection stevens opposed brown s violent actions at time though later he was more approving sectional tensions spilled over into house which proved unable to elect a speaker of united states house for eight weeks stevens was active in bitter flow of invective from both sides at one point mississippi congressman william barksdale drew a knife on him though no blood was spilled brodie pp 130 132 thumb

to win nomination as democrats put up no candidate in his district stevens was assured of reelection to house and campaigned for lincoln in pennsylvania lincoln won a majority in electoral college president elect s known opposition to expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in southern states a threat that stevens had downplayed during campaign trefousse pp 100 p 133 congress convened in december 1860 with several of southern states already pledging to secede stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease southerners such as crittenden compromise which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment metzger pp 119 121 he stated in a remark widely quoted both north and south that rather than offer concessions because of lincoln s election he would see this government crumble into a thousand atoms and that forces of united states would crush any rebellion trefousse p 107 despite stevens s protests lame duck buchanan administration did little in response to secession votes allowing most federal resources in south to fall into rebel hands many even in abolition movement were content to let it be so and to let south go its own way

to government trefousse p p 139 american civil war slavery when war began in april 1861 stevens argued that confederates were revolutionaries to be crushed by force he also believed that confederacy had placed itself beyond protection of u s constitution by making war and in a reconstituted united states slavery would have no place speaker galusha grow whose views placed him with stevens among members becoming known as radical republicans for their position on slavery as opposed to conservative or moderate republicans appointed him as chairman of house ways and means committee this position

introduced a tenure of office act restricting johnson from firing officials who had received senate confirmation without getting that body s consent tenure of office act was ambiguous since it could be read to protect officeholders only during tenure of president who appointed them and most of officials radicals sought to protect had been named by lincoln chief among these was secretary of war

resolution on february 24 though due to his poor health he was unable to complete his speech and gave it to clerk to read aloud he accused johnson of usurping powers of other branches of government and of ignoring will of people he did not deny impeachment was a political matter but this is not to be temporary triumph of a political party but is to endure in its consequence until whole continent

made denying legitimacy of congress due to exclusion of southern states and stated that johnson had tried to disobey reconstruction acts stevens was one of managers or prosecutors elected by house to present its case in impeachment trial although stevens was too ill to appear in senate on march 3 when managers requested that johnson be summoned president would appear only by his counsel or defense

managers on april 27 as he spoke his voice weakened and finally he allowed butler to read second half of his speech for him stevens focused on article xi taking position that johnson could be removed for political crimes he need not have committed an offense against law president having sworn to faithfully execute laws had intentionally disobeyed tenure of office act after senate had refused to uphold his removal of stanton and now this offspring of assassination turns upon senate who have rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance how can he escape just vengeance of law trefousse pp 231 pp 233 234 most radicals were confident that johnson would be convicted and removed from office stevens however was never certain of result as chief justice chase former treasury secretary made rulings that favored defense and he had no great confidence republicans would stick together on may 11 senate met in secret session and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote all democrats were opposed but an unexpectedly large number of republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of articles counting votes managers realized their best chance of gaining required two thirds for conviction was on stevens inspired article xi and when senate assembled to give its verdict they scheduled it to be voted upon first suspense was broken when kansas senator edmund ross whose position was uncertain voted for acquittal this meant that with votes of those who remained president would not be convicted on that article article failed 35 in favor to 19

such vindictiveness brodie pp 356 357 nevertheless stevens planned to revisit question of impeachment when congress met again in late 1868 trefousse p 235 brodie suggested that stevens s hatred of johnson was only thing keeping him from despair aware as he was of continued violence in south some of which was committed by ku klux klan several of southern states had been re admitted by this time and murders and intimidation were aiding democrats there in restoring white rule with republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and democrats opposed to it stevens feared democratic victory in 1868 elections might even bring back slavery he told his fellow pennsylvania politician alexander mcclure my life has been a failure with all this great struggle of years in washington and fearful sacrifice of life and treasure i see little hope for republic he took pride he continued in his role in establishing free public education in pennsylvania brodie pp 361 363 when

were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly richard current s 1942 work reflected current historiography which saw all american history including reconstruction as a three way economic struggle between industrialists of northeast represented by stevens planters of south and farmers of midwest current argued that stevens was motivated in his reconstruction policies by frustrated

they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights and castigated johnson for obstructionism they took view that african american was central to reconstruction and only things wrong with congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon brodie s 1959 biography of stevens was of this school controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography it found that stevens was a consummate underdog who identified with oppressed and whose intelligence won him success while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development berlin p pp 222 225 according to brodie this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing andreasen pp 76 77 scholars who followed brodie continued to chip away at idea of stevens as a vindictive dictator who dominated congress to get his way in 1960 eric mckitrick deemed stevens a picturesque and adroit politician but a very limited one whose career was a long

knowledge of parliamentary law and sheer willpower even though he was often unable to prevail in his 1997 biography of stevens though he took a position similar to mckitrick s that stevens was a relatively marginal figure with his influence often limited by his extremism andreasen p 80 trefousse believed that brodie went too far both in deeming stevens s clubfoot responsible for so much about him and in giving full credence to stevens smith relationship both those things cannot now be determined with certainty andreasen p 77 stevens was celebrated for his wit and sarcasm when lincoln
