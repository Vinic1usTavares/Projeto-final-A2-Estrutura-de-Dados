episode it wasn t nearly as fun as i had hoped it would be i mean if you were going to bring floyd back and name episode after him it would have been nice to give liz and floyd a little spark a v club s nathan rabin gave it a c rating calling it a disappointing episode in regards to jason sudeikis rabin commented that he is a gifted comic actor but this episode found him at his hammy embarrassing worst meredith blake writing for los angeles times remarked that episode may have been worst one yet and said that when floyd called liz a badger her heart broke into smithereens there s mean funny and then there s plain old mean liz s love life has become central butt of joke on 30 rock and it s starting to feel like writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic sean gandert of paste said that floyd was not a great episode but it s still pretty good by this season s standards if a somewhat disappointing use of floyd s return he explained that part of episode s problem was that liz s relationships not succeeding has become pretty old hat for show since we ve seen it time and time again and hoped to see her find a good man and let show move onto something else for a while tv guide s adam mersel wrote that it really didn t do it for me i didn t really laugh out loud much and cameo from one of my favorite snl players came off a bit forced bob sassone of aol s tv squad gave a positive review of both liz and jack s plot but was not favorable towards jenna and tracy s opining that floyd was one of those episodes of 30 rock where their plot really dragged show down he reported that he felt bad for liz because of all guys she has dated over these four seasons floyd s one she should end up with sassone hoped episode would have concluded with two finding out something horrible about floyd s fiancee or maybe we d find out that floyd did all of this just to get close to liz again in some weird way like sassone time contributor james poniewozik said that floyd character was one of better drawn boyfriends for liz further in his recap poniewozik was a little disappointed that episode brought him back to get sloppy drunk to tell off liz and to get engaged to a vapid seeming ab model television columnist alan sepinwall for star ledger commented that sudeikis s return gave tina fey s liz one of her more down to earth and relatable stories in a while and enjoyed frank toofer and lutz rivalry with jack and danny as well as pete s involvement in jenna and tracy story overall sepinwall said that episode did not really hang together for me
