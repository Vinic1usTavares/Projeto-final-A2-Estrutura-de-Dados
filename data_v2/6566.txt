praise lord my soul is an early cantata by johann sebastian bach he appears to have composed cantata for new year s day probably when he was in his 20s but whether it was first performed in muhlhausen or weimar is not known date of composition is unclear bach s authorship has been doubted because cantata has several features one of these is scoring it is only bach cantata to combine three corni da caccia with timpani an unknown librettist drew mainly from psalm 146 and from jakob ebert s hymn to develop seven movements supplying only two of movements himself text assembly is similar to bach s early cantatas cantata is in seven movements which combine three major text sources psalm hymn and contemporary poetry opening chorus is based on a psalm verse followed by first hymn stanza and another psalm verse as a recitative an aria on poetry is followed by a third psalm verse as an aria it is followed by another aria on poetry which simultaneously quotes hymn tune instrumentally last movement combines elements of a chorale fantasia on third stanza of hymn with vivid counterpoint of hallelujah which closes psalm history and text thumb upright alt disputed portrait of young bach with brown curled hair dressed festively portrait of young bach disputed bach wrote cantata for new year s day which is also feast of circumcision of christ prescribed readings for day were from epistle to galatians by faith we inherit and from gospel of luke circumcision and naming of jesus eight days after his birth however most of text for cantata was taken by unknown librettist from and from jakob ebert s hymn written in 1601 text is compiled from psalm verses verse 1 for movement 1 verse 5 for movement 3 and verse 10 for movement 5 and two stanzas from hymn first as movement 2 third as final movement only movements 4 and 6 are free poetry with hymn tune sounding again instrumentally during movement 6 due to its text structure bach scholar christoph wolff dates work to around 1710 oldest and also only manuscript was written in 1762 after bach s death provenance of cantata is disputed some suggest that it may not be a bach work because of its unpretentious nature and lack of authoritative original music or perhaps it was a transposition of an earlier work pommer max liner notes to kantaten mit corno da caccia thomanerchor leipzig neues bachisches collegium musicum eterna 1984 alternatively part of cantata may have been written by bach while other parts likely choruses and bass aria were added or amended by other composers john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 remarks on stylistic similarity of text structure to bach s early cantatas written in muhlhausen he also sees similar musical expression to cantata for inauguration of a new town council there gott ist mein konig bwv 71 written in 1708 while some musicologists assume that it may have been composed for same occasion one year later documentary evidence suggests that there was such a lost work gardiner proposes that it could either be a still earlier work or that it was at least in part an apprentice piece written in weimar under bach s direct tutelage bach s 19th century biographer philipp spitta proposed that cantata was first performed on new year s day of 1735 however according to more recent research piece performed that day was part iv of christmas oratorio
