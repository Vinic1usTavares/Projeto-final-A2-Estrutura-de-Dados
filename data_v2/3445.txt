thomas bonham v college of physicians commonly known as dr bonham s case or simply bonham s case was a case decided in 1610 by court of common pleas in england under sir edward coke court s chief justice who explained why he thought that in many cases common law will control acts of parliament pollard 2007 p 51 coke s meaning has been disputed over years according to one interpretation coke intended kind of judicial review that would later develop in united states but other scholars believe that coke meant only to construe a statute not to challenge parliamentary sovereignty 2008 p 7 if coke intended former he may have later changed his view martin 2007 p 42 statement by coke is sometimes considered to be an obiter dictum a statement made by way rather than part of ratio decidendi rationale for decision of case whatever coke s meaning after an initial period during which his decision enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void bonham s case was thrown aside in favour of growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty in one of most prominent early treatises supporting doctrine william blackstone wrote that parliament is sovereign lawmaker preventing common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in fashion that coke had suggested parliamentary sovereignty is now accepted judicial doctrine in legal system of england and wales bonham s case was met with mixed reactions at time with king james i and his lord chancellor lord ellesmere both deeply unhappy with it one of reasons for coke s dismissal from common pleas in 1613 was suggested to be case academics in 19th and 20th centuries have been scarcely more favourable and called it a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra judicially and simply an abortion in united states coke s decision met with a better reaction during legal and public campaigns against writs of assistance and 1765 stamp act bonham s case was used as a justification for nullifying legislation but by 1772 blackstone s views had gained acceptance hamburger 2008 p 278 1803 case marbury v madison which in 1803 formed basis for exercise of judicial review in united states under article iii of us constitution used words void and repugnant but usage of marbury was somewhat different from that of coke academics have argued that case forms basis of judicial review in united states other academics disagree one scholar calling that one of most enduring myths of american constitutional law and theory to say nothing of history background thumb right 250px a picture of st john s college cambridge where bonham studied from around 1685 college of physicians renamed in 1674 to royal college of physicians was an elite organisation created by royal charter in 1518 it was founded by six english academic doctors trained in english universities it admitted only british men who had trained at a university and passed a three part latin exam in medical theory only 24 fellows were allowed and if an entrant came at a time when all 24 fellowships were full he would instead become a candidate most senior candidate being admitted to first vacant fellowship cook 2004 p 129 an act of parliament confirming royal charter also gave college ability to act as a court to judge other practitioners and to punish those who were acting badly or practising without a licence a second act college of physicians act 1553 amended charter and gave college right to imprison indefinitely those judged gray 1972 p 37 that flew in face of common law assumption that to practice medicine one needed only consent of patient cook 2004 p 130 still on 8 april 1602 john popham chief justice upheld college s authority to imprison and fine that no man though never so learned a or doctor may practise in london or within myles without colledge that a free man of london may lawfully be by colledge cook 2004 p 133 thomas bonham had been admitted to st john s college cambridge in 1581 earning a bachelor s degree in 1584 he completed a master s by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at cambridge which was later granted by university of oxford by 1602 he had completed his studies and moved to london where he practised medicine and associated himself with barber surgeons company campaigning for it to be allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to college of physicians apparently giving up after a failed petition to parliament in 1605 bonham petitioned to join college on 6 december 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study cook 2004 p 134 returning on 14 april 1606 he was again told he could not join and was fined ps5 and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise bonham still kept working as a doctor on 3 october it was announced he was to be arrested and fined ps10 bonham again appeared before college now with a lawyer on 7 november plucknett 2004 p 152 he announced that he would continue to practise without seeking college s permission which he claimed had no power over graduates of oxford or cambridge he was then imprisoned some say at fleet prison hamburger 2008 p 624 and some say at newgate prison for contempt but his lawyer had a writ of habeas corpus issued by court of common pleas which freed him on 13 november cook 2004 p 135 bonham s successful writ worried college whose previous success with popham and keen cultivation of same as well as lord ellesmere and other crown officials had left them assured that their jurisdiction would be maintained as such college appealed directly to crown officers and on 1 may 1607 it met with a committee of judges at ellesmere s house committee were ellesmere popham thomas fleming two judges from court of common pleas and two from court of king s bench judges all agreed that for not well or practicing or arte of or for disobedience or donne and committed against anye made by colledge they may offenders without bayle or cook 2004 p 136 that success spurred college to move against bonham yet again now by suing him in king s bench for ps60 for maintaining an illicit practice in a counterattack bonham brought a suit in common pleas requesting ps100 ps damages gray 1972 p 36 and alleging that they had trespassed against his person and wrongfully imprisoned him against law and custom of this kingdom of england cook 2004 p 137 case left thumb 200px sir edward coke chief justice of common pleas who decided in favour of bonham case was heard in court of common pleas by warburton j daniel j foster j walmisley j and chief justice sir edward coke with a decision finally reached in winter of 1610 college s lawyers had argued that two acts of parliament and royal charter intends that none shall practise here but those who are most learned and expert more than ordinary as such college was free to punish for both practising without a licence and for malpractice with 1553 act giving them authority to imprison those they judged bonham s lawyers replied by arguing that acts and charter were intended to prevent malpractice not practising without a licence moreover bonham s study in texts at university is practise sic and to become a doctor means to be considered capable of teaching when a man brings with him ensign of doctrine there is no reason that he should be examined again for then if thou will not allow of him he shall not be allowed though he is a learned and grave man and it is not intent of king to make a monopoly of this practise as such act doth not inhibit a doctor to practice sic but only him for ill using exercising and making of physic in other words it covered malpractice not illicit practice cook 2004 p 138 walmisley and foster sided with college with walmisley delivering joint opinion he said that since statute clearly said no person could practise without college s licence only one verdict was acceptable as college had a valid licensing authority royal charter was to be interpreted as granting college a duty on behalf of king as such in walmisley s mind king had a duty to protect health of his subjects and had delegated it to college in addition bonham had given an absurd and contemptuous answer when he claimed that he would not submit to college and it should be a vain law if it did not provide punishment for them that offend against that king had delegated part of his prerogative powers to college for purposes of punishment and imprisonment and as such it had right to sit as a court cook 2004 p 141 coke delivered majority opinion in favour of bonham with daniel and warburton agreeing he undertook a closer reading of college s charter and associated acts and divided relevant passage into two clauses one gave power to fine practitioners without licences latter specified that they could imprison a practitioner for not well doing using or practicing physic he argued that they constituted separate powers and issues former dealt with authorisation to punish for illicit practise and other covered punishment for malpractice simply practising without a licence did not constitute malpractice as such college did not have power to imprison bonham who was accused of practising without a licence not of practising dangerously cook 2004 p 142 coke also went further by arguing against validity of charter and its associated acts which gave college right to act as both as a judge and as a party to a case which provided for an absurdity because of that and four other reasons given by coke conklin 1979 p 20 college was to stop trying to supervise medical practice arbitrating and acting as a court williams 2006 p 116 in support of his judgment coke cited not only tregor s case but also two anonymous cases with academic names of cessavit 42 and annuitie 11 respectively y b pasch 8 edw iii 2004 p 153 criticism decision in bonham s case has been described by john campbell lord chief justice and lord chancellor in 19th century as a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra judicially orth 1999 p 37 philip allott in cambridge law journal simply called it an abortion allott 1990 p 379 coke was later dismissed from his judicial posts and ellesmere immediately began making veiled criticisms maintaining that it was unconscionable to allow judges power to throw aside acts of parliament if they were repugnant or contrary to reason however he spoke not of impossibilities or direct it was acceptable to overturn an act if it was clearly and obviously repugnant but not otherwise williams 2006 p 126 coke has come under criticism for his examples to justify his decision first case that he gave tregor s case was seriously misquoted coke stated herle said some statutes are made against law and right which those who made them perceiving would not put into execution in fact there is no reference to law and right is found in original text herle wrote that there are some statutes made which he himself who made them does not will to put into execution meaning only that some statutes are poorly drafted and if they cannot be interpreted to work parliament would accept courts not applying them theodore plucknett wrote whoever reads whole of herle s remarks can see that he did not regard statute then under discussion as falling within this category on contrary he suggested a perfectly obvious and straightforward interpretation of it coke s first authority is far from convincing plucknett 2004 p 155 his second authority cessavit 42 goes much further to support his thesis and concerns a situation in which william refused to apply an act of parliament because it would undermine several common law principles however plucknett notes distinction that in cessavit 42 statute is not held void it is just ignored to this fact coke has really added an explanation and a theory of his own plucknett 2004 p 156 his third example annuitie 11 was based on statute of carlisle which required all religious orders to have seals placed in custody of prior and four of worthiest brethren so that abbot could not use it without their knowledge any decisions made without seal kept in that fashion were invalid plucknett 2004 p 157 that clashed with church law and was incredibly difficult for small religious orders as such sir anthony fitzherbert said that statute was void as it was impertinent or impossible plucknett 2004 p 160 however plucknett again casts doubt on example s validity by stating that it would have looked strong but is in fact of doubtful import plucknett 2004 p 163 bonham s case was deeply unpopular with crown bowen 1957 p 170 coke was removed from common pleas and sent to king s bench in theory a more senior office but in practice a less rewarding one in 1613 in june 1616 he was suspended from office and ordered to correct his case reports in october 1617 james i demanded an explanation from coke of reasoning behind bonham s case coke claimed that words of my report do not import any new opinion but only a relation of such authorities of law as had been adjudged and resolved in former times and were cited in argument of bonham s case he refused to admit to any flaws with his writings and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of language plucknett 2004 p 168 if he meant case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of parliamentary sovereignty withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings interpretation decision has been variously interpreted it can be construed as marking supremacy of common law over parliament by judicial review or only as being another form of statutory interpretation noah feldman suggested that dispute over two meanings has its origins in 1930s america where frustration over judicial review of elements of new deal spilled into academic world feldman 2004 p 30 james kent in his commentaries on american law argued that bonham s case and similar cases meant only that statutes should be given a reasonable construction orth 1999 p 33 charles gray in proceedings of american philosophical society argues that coke as a judge never intended to advocate judicial review of statutes bernard bailyn wrote that coke had not meant that there were superior principles of right and justice which acts of parliament might not contravene and also that by saying that courts might void a legislative provision that violated constitution he meant only that courts were to construe statutes so as to bring them into conformity with recognized legal principles berger 1969 p 526 william searle holdsworth agreed that it would be a mistake to view isolated statements by coke in bonham s case as endorsing limitations upon parliament coke himself elsewhere acknowledged power of parliament as being so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds holdsworth 1912 pp 28 29 raoul berger in university of pennsylvania law review disagrees words of statute were clear and only application that it could have was unjust statutory interpretation allows for ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings but what coke did was nullify statute as a whole along with its main intention berger 1969 p 527 john v orth writing in constitutional commentary concurs if that were so why did they not say so is it likely that royal judges confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received royal assent would lightly use word void research by samuel thomas and sir john baker has led to a reassessment during early 17th century non common law courts were claiming an i almost legislative discretion over statutory interpretation free from any supervisory jurisdiction of common law courts coke s decision can therefore be seen as him reminding such courts that their interpretations were subject to law not to individual discretion later impact britain thumb william blackstone s comments in commentaries on laws of england saw parliamentary sovereignty overtake coke s doctrine during coke s lifetime he was judicially dominant and his ideas were upheld by his successor as chief justice sir henry hobart in day v and lord sheffield v ratcliffe plucknett 2004 p 167 after coke s death however his jurisprudence naturally suffered an eclipse and its next appearance is in godden v hales in 1686 where doctrine was twisted to argue that crown had prerogative to dismiss government laws plucknett 2004 p 169 plucknett notes that revolution of 1688 marks abandonment of doctrine of bonham s case plucknett 2004 p 171 but in 1701 common law judges cited coke s decision with approval in city of london v wood 12 mod 669 1701 with john holt concluding that coke s statement is a very reasonable and true saying berger 1969 p 523 his position was to treat statutes in same way as other documents for purpose of judicial review and was followed for decades williams 2006 p 125 outside judiciary john lilburne used bonham s case in his book liberties of people of england and then in his 1649 treason trial to justify his attack on rump parliament parkin speer 1979 p 276 with growth of doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty coke s theory gradually died out william blackstone in first edition of his commentaries on laws of england wrote that if parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable i know of no power that can control it and examples alleged in support of this sense of rule do none of them prove that where main object of a statute is unreasonable judges are at liberty to reject it for that were to set judicial power above that of legislature which would be subversive of all government plucknett 2004 p 176 parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by english judiciary as a central principle of british constitutionalism despite with some issues by membership in european union elliott 2004 p 546 case s modern irrelevance is such that philip hamburger wrote in 2008 bonham s case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty except for reasons that are now largely forgotten hamburger 2008 p 622 in america in thirteen colonies there were instances of coke s statement being interpreted to mean that common law was superior to statute for example drawing on coke s statement james otis jr declared during struggle over writs of assistance courts had to ignore acts of parliament against constitution and against natural equity which had a significant impact on john adams morris 1940 p 429 when 1765 stamp act was declared invalid by massachusetts assembly rationale was that it was against magna charta and natural rights of englishmen and therefore according to lord coke null and void bowen 1957 p 172 by 1772 otis and others had reversed course by adopting blackstone s position that judges cannot challenge acts of parliament even before then dr bonham s case had rarely been used as a rallying cry in america judicial review in america grew primarily from other political and intellectual sources kramer 2006 pp 21 1985 p 206 in marbury v madison 1803 case that forms basis for exercise of judicial review in america chief justice john marshall stated that particular phraseology of constitution of united states confirms and strengthens principle supposed to be essential to all written constitutions that a law repugnant to constitution is void and that courts as well as other departments are bound by that instrument marshall specifically used words void and repugnant which has been characterised as a deliberate reference to coke but marshall s principle involved repugnancy to written constitution instead of repugnancy to reason feldman 2004 p 29 in hurtado v california 1884 us supreme court discussed bonham s case specifically by saying that it had not affected omnipotence of parliament over common law taylor 1917 p 16 edward samuel corwin writing in harvard law review praised idea of a fundamental higher law of reason enforceable by judges and so endorsed ratification which coke s doctrine received in american constitutional law and theory corwin 1929 pp 370 371 gary mcdowell writing in review of politics called case s influence one of most enduring myths of american constitutional law and theory to say nothing of history mcdowell 1993 p 393 mcdowell pointed out that it was never discussed during 1786 constitutional convention during ratification conventions despite coke being mentioned it was not during debates over striking down of unconstitutional statutes also other writings of coke were brought up but never bonham s case itself mcdowell 1993 p 395 7 an additional point of view is that us supreme court has come full circle to dictum in bonham s case by using due process clause to strike down what court deems unreasonable legislation schwartz 1968 p 50 see also wednesbury references sources holdsworth william central courts of law and representative assemblies in sixteenth century columbia law review
