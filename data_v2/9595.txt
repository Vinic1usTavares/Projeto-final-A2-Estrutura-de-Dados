first australian centurion on tour fingleton pp 46 47 morris found batting difficult for first few weeks as he adapted to alien batting conditions reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24 77 morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught morris was worried about edging ball to slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across crease fingleton p 80 81 he rectified this and success followed with 184 against sussex in final p 9 before first test five more centuries before end of season perry 2000 p 189 morris test form peaked in series heading test averages with 696 runs at 87 00 and he was only player to compile three test centuries after scoring 31 and 9 in

cricket english hoped that he would be weapon to cut through australia s strong batting line up robinson p 213 morris assault ended goddard s hopes of test selection his innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of pitch of ball followed by decisive footwork morris confidently went out of his crease when ball was of a full length and rocked onto back foot to drive and cut if it was short on

in all directions fingleton p 198 while former english test paceman maurice tate said tom goddard is not used to batsmen using their feet to him county batsmen diddle and diddle shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking to him and that gets him many wickets fingleton p 199 australia promptly crushed locals by an innings morris followed his effort in bristol with two half centuries 51 and 54 not out in drawn third test he then struck 108 against middlesex in a tour match morris century meant that he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of

fingleton p 174 morris and hassett started slowly with only six runs in first six overs when laker was introduced to exploit spin 13 runs were taken from his first over but only 44 runs came in first hour leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes just 13 runs were added in next 28 minutes before hassett was dismissed bradman joined morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving laker against spin for a boundary fingleton p 175 morris promptly joined bradman in counter attack hitting three consecutive fours off len hutton s bowling as australia reached lunch at 1 121 pollard p 15 upon resumption morris severely attacked denis compton s bowling morris struck seven fours in two overs of what fingleton called indescribably bad bowling

first australian to hit 20 boundaries in his reaching his century in a test in england this forced english captain norman yardley to replace compton and australia reached 202 halfway to required total

run out as australia reached 389 pollard p 17 fingleton p 188 he scored more than half runs as rest of team struggled against leg spin of hollies who took five wickets with england having been bowled out for 52 in their first innings australia sealed series 4 0 with an innings victory morris took four catches including a famous dismissal of compton who hooked ball morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch fingleton p 185 described by fingleton as one of catches of season in recognition of his performances morris was named as one of wisden cricketers of year in 1949 described as one of world s best left hand batsmen neville cardus his former critic praised morris performance during invincibles tour as masterful stylish imperturbable sure in defence quick and handsome in stroke play his batting is true to himself charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful morris ended first class tour with 1 922 runs at 71 18 despite being troubled by a split

series by aggregating only 45 runs in first three tests which included two ducks four of his five dismissals came at hands of alec bedser leading commentators to claim that bedser had a hoodoo on morris and he was called bedser s bunny mcharg pp 87 88 in contrast to his struggles in tests morris played for an australian xi and new south wales in two matches against england during this period and scored 100 and 105 in a match against arch rivals victoria morris hammered 182 and targeted test teammate jack iverson who responded poorly to being attacked match ended in a draw but stopped victoria s challenge for interstate supremacy attack effectively ended iverson s run at top of cricket perry 2005 pp 298 299 haigh p 40 however on his 29th birthday morris again fell cheaply to bedser in a tour match and he found himself eating at table 13 ahead of next test robinson p 215 facing omission from side morris recovered in fourth test at adelaide oval where hassett shielded him from bedser this helped morris to settle in before batting for a day and a half to score 206 his highest test score and only double century at highest level it constituted majority of australia s total of 371 pollard p 43 which set up 274 run victory and a 4 0 series lead and was his seventh ashes century ranking him second only to bradman at time for ashes centuries bradman described innings as faultless a terrific test double hundred comparing it to morris s 182 and 196 at headingley and oval during 1948 invincibles tour morris ended series with a half century in melbourne in australia s only loss to give him a series aggregate of 321 runs at 35 66 it was first test loss he had played in after 24 matches for australia in contrast to his below par test series morris was in strong form during first class season he scored three centuries against england in tour matches and compiled six in all to finish with 1 221 runs at 58 14 despite these performances press continued to emphasise his perceived difficulties against bedser perry 2001 p 90 91 difficulties against west indies 1951 52 season saw second tour to australia by west indies morris experimented with his stance during winter in response to criticism about his footwork when facing bedser morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on leg side mcharg p 94 he opened his season by punishing queenslanders with a score of 253 in a shield match and then scored 210 against victoria perry 2001 p 91 in first of these innings morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team s 400 with last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting haigh p 4 his test form was unimpressive though he started steadily with 122 runs in first two tests which were won by australia third test in adelaide was morris s first test as captain after hassett withdrew on match eve due to a strained hip muscle australia were already one batsman short after australian board of control had earlier vetoed selection of barnes for grounds other than cricketing ability which was widely believed to be a result of barnes previous clashes with authority mcharg p 96 haigh and frith pp 100 106 under board s regulations at time a replacement player needed approval of entire board since it was weekend some of members could not be contacted by phone and as a result hassett could not be replaced by another specialist batsman from outside twelve man squad pollard p 52 instead his place was taken by a specialist bowler already in squad robinson p 216 this left morris leading an extremely unbalanced team with four specialist batsmen and miller as all rounder morris had a long tail with wicketkeeper gil langley and five specialist bowlers all with batting averages less than 23 benaud p 55 and was reportedly in a state of shock robinson p 217 morris won toss and elected to bat on a sticky wicket because of a leak in covers one end of pitch was dry and other was wet australia were bowled out for a low score of 82 but managed to restrict west indies to 105 in all 22 wickets fell on first day most in a test on australian soil in 50 years morris proceeded to reverse batting order in second innings with bowler ian johnson and langley opening batting they were followed by bowlers and doug ring in order to protect batsmen from a wicket that was still wet ring made an unexpected 67 and morris scored 45 as australia compiled 255 but it was not enough west indies reached target with six wickets in hand perry 2000 pp 186 187 after scores of 6 and 12 in fourth test he missed final test due to injury ending an unproductive test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23 25 series was noted for morris difficulties against spin duo of alf valentine and sonny ramadhin who bowled left arm orthodox and leg spin respectively pair was responsible for five of his eight dismissals on tour perry 2000 pp 190 191 morris did not play a match after new year and ended season with 698 runs at 53 69 he topped his state s shield batting averages leading from front as new south wales regained title derriman pp 190 191 australia s decline 1952 53 season started poorly for morris he was replaced by keith miller as state captain despite having scored almost 700 runs at a fast rate in previous shield season at an average above 50 and leading his state to another title as was norm for era morris was not informed personally and learned of his demotion second hand no official reason was given by new south wales cricket association pollard p 57 but it was speculated among media that his penchant for wearing brightly coloured rubber soled shoes could have upset conservative administrators and that morris was too genial to be captain media made morris a scapegoat for dwindling public attendances following retirement of bradman and lobbied for miller who they deemed to be more appealing to public benaud p 56 haigh p 61 perry 2005 pp 314 315 morris had led his state to two shield triumphs but remained national vice captain ahead of miller richie benaud said that morris led side just as well as miller but in a less flamboyant manner perry 2005 p 316 in spite of this morris started new season consistently scoring four fifties in his first five innings including 55 and 39 in his state s victory over touring south africans ahead of tests on field action against south africans brought no immediate upturn in morris test fortunes he made only one half century and a total of 149 runs in first three tests as australia took series lead 2 1 in second test he had progressed to 42 when he drove hugh tayfield into a close fielder piesse p 171 ball ballooned to mid off and tayfield ran back and dived parallel to ball s trajectory and caught it by standards of era catch was regarded as miraculous he ended series strongly with 77 in second innings of fourth test in adelaide before making his best performances of 99 and 44 in melbourne in fifth test which australia lost by six wickets morris 99 occurred when he was involved in a mix up while batting with debutant ian craig australia s youngest ever test cricketer morris decided to sacrifice his wicket for craig s in a run out his action meant that he had not scored a test century for two years and would have to wait another two years to reach milestone again morris was widely praised for his unselfishness and his sacrifice for his new teammate mcharg p 103 he ended series with 370 runs at 41 11 and took his maiden test wicket in adelaide that of john watkins series ended 2 2 first test series in morris career that australia had not won morris ended season with 105 in a warm up match before tour of england and totalled 913 runs at 45 65 for summer in 1953 morris returned to england setting for his three test centuries five years earlier for another ashes series in a tour opening festival match against east molesey morris made 103 in eighty minutes haigh p 74 after modest run scoring of previous three test seasons morris warmed up in 10 lead in matches that yielded a moderate return of 347 runs at 34 70 however his performances in first two drawn tests in which he struck three half centuries indicated that might be returning to his earlier form he was unable to maintain his form however and did not pass 40 in last three tests ending series with 337 runs at a modest average of 33 70 teams were locked at 0 0 heading into fifth test and hassett and morris thought that pitch at oval would favour fast bowling haigh p 80 however they were mistaken and morris could manage only 16 and 26 as hosts spinners cut down tourists while their australian counterparts watched from stands haigh pp 80 81 denis compton pulled morris spin for four to seal an english win by eight wickets haigh p 83 this meant that hosts regained ashes for first time in two decades with a 1 0 triumph and morris thus tasted a series defeat for first time in his career it was a low scoring series and morris placed third in australian test averages and aggregates behind hassett with 365 at 36 50 morris batting was regarded by commentators as being more carefree than during invincibles tour he took his second and final wicket in test cricket that of alec bedser in third test at old trafford morris also struggled in first class matches making 1 302 runs at 38 09 with only one century which did not come until almost four months had elapsed on tour against gentlemen of england morris placed third in aggregates but only ranked sixth in averages he made many starts with 11 fifties but was only able to capitalise and reached triple figures only once speculation linked his difficulties on field to his personal relationships during tour morris had fallen in love with english showgirl valerie hudson he spotted her when she was performing in crazy gang vaudeville show at london s victoria palace perry 2001 pp 92 93 mcharg p 127 robinson p 218 team was also hindered by tension brought on by a generational divide senior players morris among them were retired servicemen who were drinkers while younger players tended to abstain from alcohol haigh pp 28 29 seniors frequently stopped team bus to drink at pubs leaving their younger colleagues disgruntled at fact that squad travelled at around haigh p 29 career twilight with retirement of hassett following 1953 england tour australian captaincy was open for competition cashman pp 119 120 no international cricket was scheduled until 1954 55 so there was a full domestic season in 1953 54 for players to stake their claims morris started strongly with consecutive centuries against queensland and south australia but was unable to maintain his form passing fifty only twice in his remaining eight innings he ended with 487 runs at 54 11 as new south wales won sheffield shield under miller s leadership perry 2005 pp 348 349 nevertheless australian selectors indicated that they were considering morris as a captaincy option by making him captain of morris xi which played hassett s xi in a testimonial match morris xi won by 121 runs 1954 55 ashes at start of next season morris was not made australian captain despite being incumbent vice captain instead he remained as deputy as victoria s ian johnson was recalled to team and assumed captaincy there was speculation that two queensland board members voted for morris three new south wales delegates voted for miller while remainder voted johnson perry 2005 pp 350 350 haigh and frith p 113 when england returned to australia in 1954 55 morris made his first test century in almost four years during opening test at brisbane after english skipper len hutton won toss and controversially sent australia in perry 2005 p 353 haigh p 87 morris made 153 to lay foundation for a score of 8 601 declared and an innings victory this included a partnership of 202 runs with neil harvey pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over despite both players being repeatedly struck by bowling of frank tyson who was regarded as fastest bowler of his era perry 2001 pp 93 94 those were only centuries made by australian batsmen for entire series and morris was covered in bruises he deliberately used his body to fend off short pitched balls rather than risk a catch robinson pp 215 216 in second test in sydney johnson and miller were both unavailable due to injury morris led team for second and final time in tests mcharg p 133 australian board of control made surprising move of appointing young and inexperienced richie benaud as morris vice captain for match benaud selected as a batsman had scored just 195 runs at 13 92 in ten test matches and was not a regular member of team benaud noted that situation was embarrassing and that morris had asked him not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players ray lindwall and harvey who had been test regulars for seven years cashman pp 118 119 174 175 morris won toss and elected to bat on a green pitch in a match marred by time wasting although australia took a first innings lead they lost low scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse in face of a tyson pace barrage on final day benaud p 92 pollard p 84 haigh pp 89 90 aided by a powerful tailwind tyson bowled at extreme pace and slips cordon stood 45 m away from wicket piesse p 182 morris had a poor personal performance

times in first class cricket including 18 times in test matches bedser dismissed morris more than any other bowler typically bedser took morris wicket with deliveries pitched on leg stump that moved
