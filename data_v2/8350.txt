constitution of roman republic was a set of unwritten norms and customs which together with various written laws guided procedural governance of roman republic constitution emerged from that of roman kingdom evolved over almost five hundred years of republic and was transformed into constitution of roman empire roman republican constitution can be divided into three main branches assemblies composed of people which served as supreme repository of political power and had authority to elect magistrates accept or reject laws administer justice and declare war or peace senate which advised magistrates and state acting primarily not on legal authority per se but rather with its influence and magistrates elected by people to govern republic in their name holding religious military and judicial powers along with right to preside over and call upon assemblies a complex set of checks and balances developed between these three branches polybius observed that it was impossible to tell whether roman constitution was aristocratic monarchical or democratic city of rome from republic to empire by john r patterson journal of roman studies vol 82 1992 pp 186 215 for example assemblies theoretically held all power but were called and governed by magistrates who controlling discussion exercised dominating influence over them similarly to check power of magistrates each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto actions of a magistrate republic s constitution slowly evolved over time starting from a period of patrician domination conflict of orders eventually granted plebeian citizens equal political rights while also creating tribunate to check patrician power and empowering plebeian council an assembly composed of plebeians of rome with full legislative authority late republic saw an increase in centralisation of power into hands of provincial governors use of military power to enforce political changes e g sullan dictatorship and use of violence combined with exploitation of suitably bribed or intimidated sovereign assemblies to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders increasing of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would with collapse of trust in republic s institutions put it on a path to civil war and its transformation by augustus into an autocratic empire cloaked with nothing more than veneer of republican legitimacy development of constitution 250px thumb capitoline brutus a bust of lucius junius brutus d 509 bc traditionally first consul of republic dated to 4th or 3rd centuries bc early republican constitution was dominated by patricians who monopolised all control of magistracies senate and voting blocs of assemblies generally it slowly developed with a tendency towards greater popular representation at expense of patrician class main historical sources for origins of roman political system livy and dionysius of halicarnassus relied heavily on roman annalists who supplemented what little written history existed with oral history this lack of evidence poses problems for reliability of traditional account of republic s origins according to this traditional account rome had been ruled by a succession of kings romans believed that this era that of roman kingdom began in 753 bc and ended in 510 bc after overthrow of monarchy and establishment of republic people of rome began electing two consuls each year according to consular fasti a list of consuls going back to foundation of republic first consuls were chosen in 509 bc some scholars doubt this traditional account arguing instead that monarchy evolved into a government led by elected magistrates remnants of monarchy however were reflected in republican institutions such as religious office of rex king of sacred and interregnum a period of time presided over by an interrex when offices of consul praetor and dictator were all vacant there is however certainly evidence that early republic was a time of violent change with word rex carrying same connotations as tyrant and laws which declared forfeit life and property of any man who plotted to install himself as a king or tyrant first assemblies of republic emerged during kingdom with their use to ratify regal elections and repurposing of comitia centuriata to elect first consuls this regime was dominated by patricians and sources on early republic overwhelmingly focus on conflicts between patricians and plebs in what is known as conflict of orders early years of republic were a time of external strife and periodic popular unrest in 494 bc under harsh measures from patrician creditors during a military campaign plebeians under arms seceded to mons sacer outside city and refused to fight in campaign without political concessions with pressure of an external threat patricians were forced to recognise office of plebeian tribune who were declared sacrosanct i e that they were declared inviolable and that anyone could be summarily executed for violation of sanctity of his person this was basis of tribune s ability to veto literally translated as i forbid any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate known as intercessio and auxilium respectively people gave tribunes whose number is unclear two assistants known as plebeian aediles later again under pressure from plebs a political compromise was reached in which consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men decemviri who would be empowered to publish a code of laws for all rome twelve tables according to livy it codified all public and private law but its promulgation did not grant further political rights to plebs as it enshrined into tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians with a short attempt to establish a tyranny by decemviri they were overthrown by second secession of army restoring old republic and preventing creation of a new constitution based on ten man commission in 446 bc quaestors administrators with wide terms of reference were first elected and office of censor was created to administer census in 443 bc however creation of censors also was concurrent with practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority which while open to plebs stalled efforts to reform consulate itself in 367 bc plebeians were allowed to stand for consulship and this implicitly opened both censorship as well as dictatorship to plebeians around this time practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped in 366 bc in an effort by patricians to reassert their influence over magisterial offices two new offices were created these two offices praetorship and curule aedileship so called because its holder like consuls and praetors had right to sit in a curule seat were at first open only to patricians but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well beginning around year 350 bc senators and plebeian tribunes began to grow closer senate began giving tribunes more power and tribunes began to feel indebted to senate as tribunes and senators grew closer plebeian senators began to routinely secure office of tribune for members of their own families also this period saw enacting of plebiscitum ovinium which transferred power to appoint new senators from consuls to censors this law also required censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to senate which probably resulted in a significant increase in number of plebeian senators as privileged status of old patrician elite eroded over time a plebeian aristocracy developed whose status was theoretically based on merit and popular election rather than birth because patricians were ineligible to run for plebeian offices new plebeian aristocracy actually had more opportunities for advancement than their patrician counterparts over time distinctions between patricians and plebeian aristocrats became less important giving rise to a new patricio plebeian aristocracy termed in 287 bc plebeians again seceded to end secession lex hortensia was passed which required that plebiscites laws passed by plebeian council be binding on whole roman people hortensian law resolved last great political question of earlier era electoral and legislative sovereignty of assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of constitution until demise of republic as a whole outcome of political struggles of early republic was to eliminate privileged status of patricians in constitution and grant plebs recognition of their own officers institution of senate was also now arguably stronger as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles assemblies thumb right 400px chart showing checks and balances of constitution of roman republic in roman constitutional law assemblies were a sovereign authority with power to enact or reject any law confer any magistracies and make any decision in fact with a single law they held authority to override norms and precedents of republic as well as ancient laws long unchanged there were two necessary components to any assembly 1 convening magistrate and 2 citizens in assembly itself assemblies did not participate or discuss matters laid before them they heard speakers put forth by presiding officer and after such discussion presiding officer could call for a direct up or down vote without a magistrate there would be nobody to legally call upon assembly and without citizens there is naught but a magistrate assemblies did not consist of whole roman people as only adult male citizens were permitted to participate until social war around 90 bc italian non romans were prohibited from voting as well that civil war between rome and her italian allies led to various laws granting citizenship and voting rights to their italian allies procedure there were three types of gatherings comitia concilium and or conventio first two were formal gatherings where legal decisions were made first comitia or was an assembly of all roman citizens convened to take a legal action such as enacting laws electing magistrates and trying judicial cases second type of legislative meeting was council which was a gathering of a specific group of citizens for example concilium plebis or plebeian council was for meetings of plebeians only third type of gathering convention or conventio was an unofficial forum for communication where citizens gathered to hear public announcements and arguments debated in speeches as well to witness examination or execution of criminals in contrast to formal assembly or council no legal decisions were made by convention voters met in conventions to deliberate prior to meeting in assemblies or councils to vote assemblies and councils operated according to established procedures overseen by augurs they could only be convened by magistrates and citizens only voted on matters proposed by presiding magistrate over years laws were passed which mandated a written ballot attempted to reduce voter intimidation and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud for elections it was not a matter of who received most votes but rather who could first be approved by a majority of voting blocs all votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned assembly types roman citizens were organized into three types of voting units curiae centuria and tribus or tribes these corresponded to three different kinds of assemblies curiate assembly centuriate assembly and tribal assembly each unit curia century or tribe cast one vote before their assembly majority of individual votes in any century tribe or curia decided how that unit voted curiate assembly traditionally dates to early monarchy from 30 divisions of city made by romulus by middle republic it served only a symbolic purpose at some point 30 curiae ceased to actually meet and were instead represented by 30 lictors this assembly had authority over some elements of family law and ratified imperium of elected magistrates and promagistrates through a lex curiata de imperio in realm of family law it was presided over by pontifex maximus however there was considerable debate in late republic on whether or not a magistrate s election actually required ratification by curiae and by 212 bc senate refrained from enforcing this quirk of precedent centuriate assembly was formed under monarchy and widely seen by ancients as a means of allotting voting privileges in proportion to military duties demanded of citizenry disproportionately granting voting power to richest in society as at time of its formation wealthiest were also expected to contribute most to military by middle republic connection between voting power and military service had long ceased turning into a system to suppress voting power of poor because of its military roots it could only be called into session by a magistrate holding imperium originally divided into 193 voting blocs these blocs were further subdivided into five classes and a class of equites by wealth each further subdivided by age into a junior and senior bloc first class and equites held 98 of 193 voting blocs an absolute majority this was later reformed around 241 bc into an assembly of 373 voting blocs with each class having same number of votes though wealth requirements necessarily meant that wealthier classes were composed of fewer people body was primarily called for election of consuls praetors and censors while it could hear legislation trials and only it could declare an offensive war these were increasingly rare by second century bc tribal assembly dates from time immemorial as no ancient historian mentions its establishment in early republic there were four urban tribes and 17 rural tribes in 241 bc fourteen rural tribes were added bringing total to thirty five tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups but rather a district to which people were assigned a citizen s tribe was inherited from his father and only changed upon adoption or reallocation in census over time this meant that tribal affiliation had little relationship to a citizen s home or even place of birth vast majority of legislation was enacted in comitia tributa which also elected quaestors curule aediles and military tribunes plebeian council was identical to tribal assembly with one key exception only plebeians had power to vote in it it elected plebeian tribunes and aediles and later various other minor posts it also had ability to enact laws called plebiscites which in early republic only applied to plebs but after passage of lex hortensia applied to all romans in early republic council also had some judicial functions but by middle republic much of these functions were transferred to permanent courts senate thumb right artist s impression of senate in session cicero delivering his oration catiline from a 19th century fresco senate was predominant political institution in roman republic senate s authority derived primarily from custom and tradition it was also one of few places in which free political discussion could take place senate s principal role was as an advisory council to consuls on matters of foreign and military policy and it exercised a great deal of influence over consular decision making during kingdom senate consisted of persons selected to position by king a power which consuls inherited after end of monarchy in very early republic senators were primarily chosen due to their birth but by late republic and especially after sulla membership in senate became predicated on having previously held a magistracy in late 4th century bc consul s power to control senate membership was transferred to censor exercised with considerable discretion until laws passed in late republic formalised some kind of hearing before censorial decisions in line with censor s duty to protect morals senators were required to be of good character not have been found guilty of a criminal offence and not be a person tainted with ignominy e g bankrupts former gladiators prostitutes or deserters before time of augustus there is no evidence of any kind of property qualification senate consisted of around 300 prior to dictatorship of sulla but after his dictatorship it consisted of somewhere over 500 men a decree from senate was called senatus consultum plural senatus consulta while this was formally advice from senate to a magistrate stating senate s position on some topic senatus consulta were usually obeyed by magistrates if a senatus consultum conflicted with a law that was passed by a popular assembly law overrode senatus consultum meetings could take place either inside or outside of formal boundary of city pomerium though official meeting place or curia was at centre of roman forum president of senate was normally one of consuls but it could be called to meet by any of praetors or tribunes both of whom had authority to call senate though praetors rarely did so unless consuls were away and tribunes almost never did so meetings were suffused in religious ritual temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before meeting could commence presiding consul began each meeting with a speech on an issue and then referred issue to senators who discussed matter by order of seniority unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands while important votes resulted in a physical division of house with senators voting by taking a place on either side of chamber any vote was always between a proposal and its negative since all meetings had to end by nightfall a senator could talk a proposal to death a filibuster if he could keep debate going until nightfall any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune and if it was not vetoed it was then turned into a final senatus consultum each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by presiding magistrate and then deposited into aerarium public treasury executive magistrates thumb 200px toga praetexta dress of magistrates from aedile to consul magistrates were elected officials serving as representatives of people for conduct of public business there were two broad categories of magistrates ordinary magistrates such as consuls products of republican constitution and extraordinary magistrates such as dictators remnants of monarchial constitution and reserved primarily for emergencies each magistrate held potestas authority to exercise office s powers conferred by custom or statute most powerful magistrates such as extraordinary magistrates consuls and praetors held a kind of authority known as imperium authority to command in a military or judicial sense ordinary magistrates of ordinary magistrates there were two further divisions higher magistrates composed of consuls praetors their prorogued equivalents and censors and lower magistrates composed of tribunes aediles quaestors and other minor positions all higher magistrates were elected by centuriate assembly most powerful ordinary magistrate was consul of whom there were two who served for period of one year these consuls had authority to call assemblies of people in early republic they held judicial duties until these responsibilities were moved to praetors and later to permanent courts similarly they held financial responsibilities until these duties were transferred to quaestors consuls also held vague religious duties inherited from kings along with their more important military functions serving as commander in chief of rome s armies next magistrate was praetor who increased in number over course of republic and were primarily judges in later republic praetors were increasingly sent out to provinces to serve as provincial governors especially as prorogued magistrates in rome there were primarily two kinds of praetor praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus in charge of suits involving citizens and foreigners respectively they were also assigned in late republic to various permanent courts with specific criminal jurisdiction when consuls were away praetors were empowered to command armies and serve in place of consuls and thus also held authority to call assemblies and introduce legislation over time as rome s empire grew two annual consuls ceased to be enough to command its many armies in field or administer its many provinces to solve this problem it became normal to prorogue authority of current consuls and praetors beyond their normal terms so they could continue to command in field over time however with increasing need for competent generals and administrators prorogation of magistrates became norm and device was used increasingly by assemblies to grant imperium to popular politicians censor was appointed specifically to conduct census this involved counting roman people assessing their property and assigning them to their appropriate centuria and tribus they were elected around every four or five years after passage of lex censors were also transferred power from consuls to control membership in senate along with main responsibility of dealing with census censors also dealt with property disputes public contracts and management of public lands thumb right gaius gracchus tribune of people presiding over plebeian council in an artist s impression from 1799 lower magistrates included tribune of plebs who was elected by plebeian council and aediles and quaestors elected by tribal assembly tribune was sacrosanct i e declared inviolable with summary execution for violators of his sanctity it was on this basis that tribune could veto any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate known as intercessio and auxilium respectively this power was used increasingly to block public business in later republic and was only limited in that a tribune could not oppose will of people as a whole aediles were in charge of various municipal tasks e g upkeep of temples streets and water supply they were also responsible for public games and some aspects of police work in city quaestors were elected administrators which could be put in charge of treasury granaries or various administrative postings in italy with consuls or in provinces in late republic election to quaestorship became basis for a life appointment to senate extraordinary magistrates there were two extraordinary magistrates dictator and magister equitum literally master of horse dictators were selected by consuls to resolve some crisis threatening republic and served for a term of around six months before they were expected to resign and return their powers to ordinary magistrates magister equitum was then appointed by dictator as his lieutenant dictatorship was only used in early and middle republic before falling out of fashion after end of second punic war only to be revived during time of sulla as an measure not to defeat some foe or quell unrest but rather to bring stability to political order dictator had maius imperium and total authority to command state however since dictator generally tried to maintain order this did not conflict with responsibilities of other magistrates who continued to function during a dictatorship magister equitum had similar plenary authority with parallel and somewhat subordinate authority to dictator in middle and later republic with office of dictator falling out of fashion need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate but rather to consuls through a senatus consultum ultimum or final decree this decree took form of a recommendation from senate to consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend republic due to its general vagueness however its use was hotly contested in late republic and is still debated among scholars today as in a strict legal sense final decree did not grant legal authority to consuls but rather served as an urging from senate to ignore laws to protect state constitutional instability thumb 250px a bust of sulla first dictator and general to march on rome of late republic who marched on rome with his troops in 88 and 82 bc after second punic war there was a great increase in income inequality while middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy with rome s great military victories vast numbers of slaves were imported into italy in middle of second century bc tribunate of tiberius gracchus led to a breakup of long standing norms of republican constitution legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging socio political power of old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted his younger brother gaius gracchus further challenged senate s political preeminence by threatening it with new judicial procedures senate s violent reaction against both gracchi which led to their deaths also served to legitimise use of violence for political ends sullan constitution later populist attempts to introduce similarly broad reaching legislation enlisted support of gaius marius a great general who was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships this violated roman law which mandated a decade between consulships and further weakened primarily norms based constitution attempts to recall general sulla led to his marching on rome in 88 bc installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of constitution at sword point before leaving on a military campaign in east this further strengthened precedent that republic s constitution was malleable after various violent political turnovers while sulla was on campaign in east he returned in 82 bc after winning a second civil war and purging republic of thousands of his enemies many of whom were targeted for their wealth he forced assemblies to make him dictator for settling of constitution with an indefinite term sulla attempted to concentrate political power into senate and aristocratic assemblies whilst trying to reduce obstructive and legislative powers of tribune and plebeian council to this end he required that all bills presented to assemblies first be approved by senate restricted tribunician veto to only matters of individual requests for clemency and required that men elected tribune would be barred from all other magistracies beyond stripping tribunate of its powers last provision was intended to prevent ambitious youth from seeking office by making it a dead end he also doubled size of senate restored its judicial powers and formalised cursus honorum by clearly stating progression of office and associated age requirements next to aid administration he doubled number of quaestors to 20 and added two more praetors greater number of magistrates also meant he could shorten length of provincial assignments and lessen chances of building provincial power bases by increasing rate of turnover moreover magistrates were barred from seeking reelection to any post for ten years and barred for two years from holding any other post after their term ended after securing election as consul in 80 bc sulla resigned dictatorship and attempted to solidify his republican constitutional reforms however many of his changes were not to last with significant popular unrest tribunate s powers were quickly restored by 70 bc by sulla s own lieutenants pompey and crassus sulla passed legislation to make it illegal to march on rome as he had but having just shown that doing so would bring no personal harm so long as one was victorious this obviously had little effect sulla s actions and civil war fundamentally weakened authority of constitution and created a clear precedent that an ambitious general could make an end run around republican constitution simply by force of arms collapse of republic right thumb 300x300px a depiction of death of caesar from death of caesar jean leon gerome painted in 1867 over course of late republic formerly authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority for example sullan reforms to senate strongly split aristocratic class between those who stayed in city and those who rose to high office abroad further increasing class divides between romans even at highest levels furthermore dominance of military in late republic along with stronger ties between a general and his troops caused by their longer terms of service together and troops reliance on that general to provide for their retirements along with an obstructionist central government meant a huge number of soldiers willing to take up arms against state adding in institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change e g deaths of gracchi and sulla s dictatorship respectively republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between senate assemblies at rome and promagistrates it would only be resolved by civil war a war which governors and their troops would win and in doing so collapse republic see also notes references further reading primary sources cicero s de re publica book two rome at end of punic wars an
