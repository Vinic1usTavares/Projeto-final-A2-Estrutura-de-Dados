14th century telugu poet and scholar tenali ramakrishna one of a collective title given to eight telugu poets in court of krishnadevaraya which literally translates as eight great elephants he planned it as a multilingual film to be filmed simultaneously in telugu and tamil languages as well as kannada but with a slightly altered cast ranga collaborated with samudrala raghavacharya kannadasan and murugadasa on basic script for all versions they decided to adapt ch venkataramaiah s kannada language stage play tenali ramakrishna into film instead of following h m reddy script for 1941 telugu directorial of same name ranga titled film tenali raman in tamil while tenali ramakrishna was chosen for other versions venkataramaiah s play was comical in nature and focused on life and times of ramakrishna fearing it would fail to translate on screen effectively raghavacharya and kannadasan decided to incorporate political elements during rule of krishnadevaraya while raghavacharya focused on administrative aspects of krishnadevaraya kannadasan opted to humanise king by writing scenes related to his personal life and preferences tenali ramakrishna was filmed in and around revathy studios in madras due to floors of ranga s production company vikram studios still being under construction v s film s associate director assisted ranga in directing telugu version cast and crew ranga

for adapting jayadeva s ashtapadi and other complicated poems and not compromising for common audience to understand however reviewer was critical of grammatical and pronunciation errors made by

4th national film awards film received mixed reviews from critics swatantra in its review dated 27 january 1956 wrote film is paced evenly until end raghavacharya s writing is one of biggest strengths of film reviewer praised nageswara rao s performance and dialogue delivery but was critical of rama rao and bhanumathi noting that latter was very ill at ease playing krishnasani which was surprising given that role was in her comfort zone zameen raithu gave a negative review writing that film was disappointing and criticising climax as film s weakest link in its review dated 10 february 1956 zameen raithu wrote ranga has a great vision which cannot be ignored and an eye for subtle and innuendo free comedy raghavacharya s writing and screenplay are praiseworthy reviewer added that characterisations were ill developed with rama rao and nageswara rao salvaging film to an extent though bhanumathi struggled in portraying grey shades with authenticity film was also criticised for being historically inaccurate swatantra pointed out that ramakrishna is given credit for solving problem of distributing 17 disputed elephants among three brothers though this was actually done by timmarusu zameen raithu was very critical of portrayal of ramakrishna as a staunch sri vaishnavite while he was a telugu shaivite brahmin with alternate name reviewer noted that depiction of clean shaven ramakrishna a 6000 brahmin by birth was inaccurate for period as niyogis always sported a moustache in 14th century remake tenali ramakrishna was remade by ranga into kannada language again in 1982 as hasyaratna ramakrishna starring anant nag and srinath in lead roles as ramakrishna and krishnadevaraya unlike original remake was a commercial failure with critics specifying that audience did not accept ramakrishna dominating krishnadevaraya throughout film notes references external links category 1950s telugu language films category 1956 films category best telugu feature film national
