of most of stages in dynasty warriors 4 is to defeat enemy commander player must make their way through stage defeating enemy officers and troops while trying to keep their own commander alive some stages have secondary objectives for player to complete to make stage easier unlock new features or help in later stages each playable character has their own unique weapon and individual superhuman

level and allows player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon while a 10th level is accessible through special in

power defense and movement speed you can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having game over by obtaining chinese meatbuns that at first look like onions like in any other game in so far successful dynasty warriors franchise you can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time only you can also get packs of wine and packs of chinese

boost a unique ability or skill or even a ride able mount such as an elephant or horse musou mode main campaign mode has separate campaigns for each kingdom rather than a separate musou mode for each character as was featured in dynasty warriors 3 which made it more frustrating for player to unlock their favorite characters so dynasty warriors 4 modes are easier for player to unlock their favorite characters while storyline is still linear musou mode is rather open ended in sense that depending on user s actions different events will occur such as unlocking new characters for use or new kingdoms unlockable kingdoms in game include wu shu and wei kingdoms and unlockable characters include warlords who were defeated in book that game series is based on romance of three kingdoms thumb

decreased by performing a number of positive actions for player s army action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty defeating enemy officers and completing special events such as ambushes siege attacks and finding enemy strongholds morale in game has a strong effect on player s forces determining their strength and speed as well as their ability to perform berwald attacks morale will also affect how cpu characters move along through battle example ally are winning they are more likely to charge enemy and destroy enemies in path they may or may not stop if charging armies morale drops to losing more chances they ll stop and stay where they are or they ll flee back to ally side of battlefield occasionally when player confronts an enemy officer officer will challenge them to a one on one duel if player accepts they will be transported to a small arena away from main battlefield where a one on one fight with officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out if player declines your morale will drop if player wins their morale will rise and enemy officer will be removed from battlefield if you accept officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in duel plot setting dynasty warriors 4 is set in ancient china during time of three kingdoms era game begins at fall of han dynasty shortly before death of emperor ling when yellow turban rebellion led by zhang jiao begun an uprising against empire a number of elements in game build on aspects of chinese mythology and there is a mix between fact and fiction as game is built on story of romance of three kingdoms many of locations characters and events in dynasty warriors 4 are reported to have happened in chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make game more appealing to player there are also some features that are historically inaccurate game features environments resembling that of ancient china and various items from era common items throughout game include fairy wine and dim sum s stages many of stages are recreations of notable battles present historically or from novel romance of three kingdoms while original creations became more common with newer installments of course battlefields are not exact reproductions of original locations as newer establishments buildings and othe facilities have been built on top of them for example he fei a key site in both game and in historical context has been developed and expanded into an urbanised area making an exact replication impossible instead levels are designed to be vaguely accurate focusing more on expression of mood and effects these are not re used in every game but are instead updated in every dynasty warriors game save games extension packages in this case dynasty

expansions fourth game in series was first to introduce an empires expansion but it wasn t designed by same person who designed dynasty warriors 4 tomohiko sho although he was not designer for all of dynasty warriors games he was involved in production for them usually as planner omega force works under koei as an internal development team and have mainly concentrated on dynasty warriors series and samurai warriors series similarities have been pointed out between two series such as xtreme legends and empires expansions as well as a similar voice cast that has been used throughout a number of games from each series repeated voices between games include beau steven jay blum and richard epcar audio dynasty warriors series has never used musical style commonly made in era that games are set in dynasty warriors 4 is no different and features a similar style of music to dynasty warriors 3 using a mix of rock metal and heavy metal with undertones of traditional chinese music however this does not detract from fact that there are a large number of varied tracks throughout game ending song of game cross colors is performed by chasen and music was composed by kazuhiro hara song was performed in both japanese and english by same singer and was released for us and japanese versions of game reception before its main release dynasty warriors 4 was already looking promising after gamespot uk s preview two months before game was released although still very similar to previous titles in series graphics engine had been tweaked and gameplay been expanded featuring more characters and stages after its release it had high sales rates in japan selling over one million copies a short time after release its release in us did not create as much hype as in japan mainly because market for dynasty warriors series is smaller there but it still sold fairly well and together with japanese sales dynasty warriors 4 entered into greatest hits charts in its time dynasty warriors 4 has managed to become ign s 5th best co operative game on ps2 as well game is criticized for being very similar to older games in series and retaining some of features such as fogging and repetitive gameplay even with these drawbacks koei went on to release two expansions for dynasty warriors 4 xtreme legends and dynasty warriors 4 empires it had also been ported to xbox and to pc as a hyper edition armchair empire commented that when there is a lot happening on screen at once game tended to slow down english voice acting for series commonly criticized as being poor has remained in dw4 english voice overs of dynasty warriors series uses straightforward english pronunciations for romanized pinyin names of characters and locations results tend to leave errors in dialogue with incorrect english pronunciations of originally chinese text versions and expansions dynasty warriors 4 has had two expansions and a re release first was dynasty warriors 4 xtreme legends and added new gameplay options and modes second was dynasty warriors 4 empires which added a strategy mode of gameplay to original it has also been re released as in japan hyper is a port of dynasty warriors 4 to
