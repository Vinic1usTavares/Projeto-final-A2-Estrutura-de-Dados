preceded by succeeded by hms agincourt was a dreadnought battleship built in united kingdom in early 1910s originally part of brazil s role in a south american naval arms race she holds distinction of mounting more heavy guns fourteen and more turrets seven than any other dreadnought battleship in keeping with brazilians requirement for an especially impressive design brazil ordered ship in 1911 as rio de janeiro from british company armstrong whitworth however collapse of brazil s rubber boom and a warming in relations with argentina country s chief rival led to ship s sale while under construction to ottoman empire ottomans renamed her sultan osman i after empire s founder and ship was nearly complete when first world war broke out british government seized her for use by royal navy together with another ottoman dreadnought being constructed in britain this act caused resentment in ottoman empire as payments for both ships were complete and contributed to decision of ottoman government to join central powers renamed agincourt by royal navy she joined grand fleet in north sea during war ship spent bulk of her time on patrols and exercises although she did participate in battle of jutland in 1916 agincourt was put into reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1922 to meet terms of washington naval treaty background 250px left thumb right elevation and plan view of

which were significantly more modern and powerful than brazil s ships scheina pp 45 52 brazilian navy was left behind its argentine and chilean counterparts in quantity as well by turn of 20th century

went to armstrong hough p 22 livermore pp 39 41 since brazil s relations with argentina were warming and country s economic boom was losing steam government negotiated with armstrong to remove third dreadnought from contract but without success they borrowed necessary money and armstrong laid down rio de keel in march 1910 topliss pp 247 49 brazilian navy had divided into two distinct factions based on size of main battery outgoing naval minister favoured an increase over 12 inch guns mounted on board minas geraes class while his incoming counterpart admiral marques leao favoured keeping smaller but faster firing gun while exact influences upon brazilian government are unclear leao was advocating strongly for his position in meetings with president other events probably influenced them as well such as november 1910 revolt of lash payments on loans taken out for dreadnoughts and a worsening economy that had led to high government debt compounded by budget deficits scheina pp 81

000 tons with an armament of 14 in guns considerations of every kind pointed to inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to revision of contract in sense of reducing tonnage this was done and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood time of experience hermes rodrigues da fonseca 3 may 1911 in scheina p 354 a contract to build ship that would become agincourt was signed on 3 june 1911 and its keel was laid on 14 september 1911 design called for fourteen 12 inch guns an extreme number that historian david topliss attributed to political necessity ship had to appear more powerful to brazilian populace than her predecessors with twelve 12 inch guns but without increasing gun size only option left was increasing total number of guns topliss p 280 design and description general characteristics agincourt had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load she displaced at load and at deep load ship had a metacentric height of at deep load burt p 244 she had a large turning circle but manoeuvred well despite her great length she was considered to be a good gun platform parkes p 604 when she came to serve in royal navy agincourt was considered a particularly comfortable ship and very well appointed internally a knowledge of portuguese was necessary to work many of fittings including those in heads as original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by british in 1917 her crew numbered 1 268 officers and men propulsion agincourt had four parsons direct drive steam turbines each of which drove one propeller shaft high pressure ahead and astern turbines drove wing shafts while low pressure ahead and astern turbines drove inner shafts three bladed propellers were in diameter turbines were designed to produce a total of but achieved more than during her sea trials slightly exceeding her designed speed of burt pp 245 250 steam plant consisted of twenty two babcock wilcox water tube boilers with an operating pressure of agincourt normally carried of coal but could carry a maximum of as well as of fuel oil to be sprayed on coal to increase its burn rate at full capacity she could steam for at a speed of electrical power was provided by four steam driven reciprocating electrical generators burt p 245 armament thumb right upright 1 2 sultan osman i evvel soon to become agincourt in fitting out stage of her construction agincourt mounted fourteen bl 12 inch mk xiii 45 calibre guns in seven twin hydraulically powered turrets gardiner and gray p 37 unofficially named after days of week starting from sunday forward to aft hough p 150 this was largest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a dreadnought battleship gibbons p 201 guns could be depressed to 3deg and elevated to 13 5deg they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at 13 5deg this provided a maximum range of just over with armour piercing ap shells during war turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16deg but this only extended range to rate of fire of these guns was 1 5 rounds per minute when a full broadside was fired resulting sheet of flame was big enough to create impression that a battle cruiser had blown up it was awe inspiring parkes p 603 no damage was done to ship when firing full broadsides despite common idea that doing so would break ship in half but much of ship s tableware and glassware did shatter when agincourt fired her first broadside hough p 160 as built agincourt mounted eighteen bl 6 inch mk xiii 50 calibre guns fourteen were placed in armoured casemates on upper deck and two each in fore and aft superstructures protected by gun shields two more were added abreast bridge in pivot mounts protected by gun shields when ship was purchased by british burt p 250 guns could be depressed to 7deg and elevated to 13deg later increased to 15deg they had a range of at 15deg when firing a shell with a muzzle velocity of their rate of fire was about five to seven rounds per minute but this dropped to about three rounds per minute after ready ammunition was used up because ammunition hoists were too slow or few to keep guns fully supplied about 150 rounds were carried per gun close range defence against torpedo boats was provided by ten 45 calibre quick firing guns these were mounted in superstructure in pivot mounts and protected by gun shields agincourt also carried three submerged torpedo tubes one was on each beam and last was in stern water that entered torpedo tubes when they were fired was discharged into torpedo flat to facilitate reloading tube and then pumped overboard this meant that torpedo crewmen would be operating in of water if rapid fire was required ten torpedoes were carried for them parkes pp 600 603 fire control each turret was fitted with an armoured rangefinder in turret roof in addition another one was mounted on top of foretop by time of battle of jutland in 1916 agincourt was possibly only dreadnought of grand fleet not fitted with a dreyer fire control table friedman p 46 a fire control director was later fitted below foretop and one turret was modified to control entire main armament later in war a director for guns was added on each side in 1916 17 a high angle rangefinder was added in 1918 to spotting top armour so much weight had been devoted to agincourts armament that little remained for her armour her waterline belt was just thick compared with twelve inches or more found in other british dreadnoughts it ran some from forward edge of monday barbette to middle of friday barbette forward of this belt thinned to six inches for about before further reducing to all way to bow aft of midships section belt reduced to six inches for about and then thinned to four inches 102 mm it did not reach stern but terminated at rear bulkhead upper belt extended from main to upper deck and was six inches thick it ran from monday barbette to thursday barbette armour bulkheads at each end of ship angled inwards from ends of midships armoured belts to end barbettes and were three inches thick four of agincourts decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from burt pp 244 45 armour of barbettes constituted a major weakness in agincourts protection they were 9 inches thick above upper deck level but decreased to 3 inches between upper and main decks and had no armour at all below main deck except for sunday barbette which had 3 inches and thursday and saturday barbettes which had 2 inches turret armour was 12 inches thick on face on side and in rear turret roofs were 3 inches thick at front and 2 inches at rear casemates for secondary armament were protected by 6 inches of armour and were defended from raking fire by 6 inch thick bulkheads main conning tower was protected by 12 inches of armour on its sides and it had a 4 inch roof aft conning tower sometimes called torpedo control tower had 9 inch sides and a 3 inch roof communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above upper deck and 2 inches thick below it each magazine was protected by two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads first one an inch thick and second one and a half inches thick agincourt had another weakness in that she was not subdivided to royal navy standards as brazilians preferred to eliminate all possible watertight bulkheads that might limit size of compartments and interfere with crew s comfort one example was officer s wardroom which was in size much larger than anything in grand fleet hough pp 89 90 wartime modifications approximately of high tensile steel was added to main deck after battle of jutland to protect magazines two anti aircraft guns were added to quarterdeck in 1917 18 a rangefinder was added to former searchlight platform on foremast at same time a high angle rangefinder was added to spotting top in 1918 construction and seizure thumb right agincourt depicted on a postcard prior to british modifications rio de janeiro as agincourt was named by her first owners was laid down on 14 september 1911 by armstrongs in newcastle upon tyne and launched on 22 january 1913 after keel laying brazilian government found itself in an unenviable position a european depression after end of second balkan war in august 1913 reduced brazil s ability to obtain foreign loans while at same time brazil s coffee and rubber exports collapsed latter due to loss of brazilian rubber monopoly to british plantations in far east martin pp 36 37 in addition reports on new dreadnought construction coming in from overseas indicated that vessel would be outclassed upon completion p 140 these factors caused brazil to put ship up for sale in october 1913 and she was sold to ottoman navy for ps2 750 000 on 28 december 1913 hough pp 72 75 renamed sultan osman i evvel she underwent trials in july 1914 and was completed in august just as first world war began hough pp 109 22 war broke out during her sea trials before delivery even though ottoman crew had arrived to collect her british government took over vessel for incorporation into royal navy turkish captain waiting with five hundred turkish sailors aboard a transport in river tyne threatened to board his ships and hoist turkish flag first lord of admiralty winston churchill gave orders to resist such an attempt by armed force if necessary at same time british also took over a second ottoman battleship a derived vessel being built by vickers which was renamed such an action was allowed for in contracts as churchill did not want to risk ships being used against british but it had consequences hough p 121 takeover caused considerable ill will in ottoman empire where public subscriptions had partially funded ships when ottoman government had been in a financial deadlock over budget of battleships donations for ottoman navy had come in from taverns cafes schools and markets and large donations were rewarded with a navy donation medal seizure and gift of german battlecruiser to ottomans influenced public opinion in empire to turn away from britain and they entered war on side of germany and austro hungarian empire against triple entente of britain france and russia on 29 october after goeben had attacked russian facilities in black sea hough pp 143 44 royal navy made modifications to agincourt before commissioning her in particular it removed flying bridge over two centre turrets ship was also initially fitted with turkish style lavatories that had to be replaced hough pp 152 53 her name agincourt was a favourite of churchill s and had initially been allocated to a sixth vessel of ordered under 1914 15 naval estimates but not yet begun at war s outbreak parkes p 600 her nickname gin palace came from her luxurious fittings and a corruption of her name a gin court pink gin being a popular drink among royal navy officers at time hough p 147 admiralty was unprepared to man a ship of agincourts size on such short notice and her crew was drawn from highest and lowest echelons of service royal yachts and detention barracks agincourts captain and executive officer came from most of whose crew was also transferred to agincourt on 3 august 1914 most of naval reservists had already been called up by this time and sent to other ships so a number of minor criminals who had had their sentences remitted were received from various naval prisons and detention camps hough pp 148 52 service agincourt was working up until 7 september 1914 when she joined 4th battle squadron bs of grand fleet parkes p 605 fleet anchorage at scapa flow was not yet secure against submarine attack and much of fleet was kept at sea where agincourt spent forty of her first eighty days with grand fleet this was beginning of a year and a half of inaction only broken by occasional north sea sweeps intended to draw enemy from his bases hough p 161 thumb left 4th battle squadron in north sea in 1915 agincourt is second ship from front on 1 january 1915 agincourt was still assigned to 4th bs but had been assigned to 1st battle squadron before battle of jutland on 31 may 1916 she was last ship of sixth division of 1st bs along with and flagship most heterogeneous group possible as each ship was from a different class sixth division was column of grand fleet as it headed south to rendezvous with ships of admiral beatty s battle cruiser fleet then engaged with their opposite numbers from german high seas fleet in north sea hough p 174 admiral jellicoe commander of grand fleet kept it in cruising formation until 18 15 when he ordered it to deploy from column into a single line based on port division each ship turning 90deg in succession this turn made sixth division closest ships in grand fleet to battleships of high seas fleet and they fired on each ship as they made their turn to port this concentration of fire later became known as windy corner to british as ships were drenched by german shell splashes although none were hit hough p 179 thumb left agincourt in 1918 at 18 24 agincourt opened fire on a german battlecruiser with her main guns shortly afterwards her six inch guns followed suit as german destroyers made torpedo attacks on british battleships to cover turn to south of high seas fleet tarrant pp 131 133 agincourt successfully evaded two torpedoes although another struck marlborough massie p 630 visibility cleared around 19 15 and she engaged a without result before it was lost in smoke and haze hough p 183 around 20 00 marlborough was forced to reduce speed because of strain on her bulkheads from her torpedo damage and her division mates conformed to her speed burt p 206 in reduced visibility division lost sight of grand fleet during night passing badly damaged battlecruiser without opening fire massie p 651 dawn found them with only detritus from previous day s battle in sight and division arrived back at scapa flow on 2 june hough pp 184 85 agincourt fired 144 twelve inch shells and 111 six inch shells during battle although she is not known to have hit anything right thumb both of seized ottoman ships in 1918 agincourt foreground with erin although grand fleet made several sorties over next few years it is not known if agincourt participated in them on 23 april 1918 agincourt and hercules were stationed at scapa flow to provide cover for scandinavian convoys between norway and britain when high seas fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy convoy reports from german intelligence were slightly off schedule as both inbound and outbound convoys were in port when germans reached their normal route so admiral scheer ordered fleet to return to germany without spotting any british ships newbolt pp 236 37 agincourt was later transferred to 2nd battle squadron and was present at surrender of high seas fleet on 21 november 1918 hough p 186 she was placed in reserve at rosyth in march 1919 after unsuccessful attempts to sell her to brazilian government she was listed for disposal in april 1921 but was used for experimental purposes later that year she was sold for scrap on 19 december 1922 to
