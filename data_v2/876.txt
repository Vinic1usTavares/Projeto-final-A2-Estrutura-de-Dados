nobelium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol no and atomic number 102 it is named in honor of alfred nobel inventor of dynamite and benefactor of science a radioactive metal it is tenth transuranic element and is penultimate member of actinide series like all elements with atomic number over 100 nobelium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles a total of twelve nobelium isotopes are known to exist most stable is 259no with a half life of 58 minutes but shorter lived 255no half life 3 1 minutes is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale chemistry experiments have confirmed that nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in periodic table chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known they are mostly only known in aqueous solution before nobelium s discovery it was predicted that it would show a stable 2 oxidation state as well as 3 state characteristic of other actinides these predictions were later confirmed as 2 state is much more stable than 3 state in aqueous solution and it is difficult to keep nobelium in 3 state in 1950s and 1960s many claims of discovery of nobelium were made from laboratories in sweden soviet union and united states although swedish scientists soon retracted their claims priority of discovery and therefore naming of element was disputed between soviet and american scientists and it was not until 1997 that international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac credited soviet team with discovery but retained nobelium swedish proposal as name of element due to its long standing use in literature discovery thumb right element was named after alfred nobel discovery of element 102 was a complicated process and was claimed by groups from sweden united states and soviet union first complete and incontrovertible report of its detection only came in 1966 from joint institute of nuclear research at dubna then in soviet union note for part i see pure and applied chemistry vol 63 no 6 pp 879 886 1991 first announcement of discovery of element 102 was announced by physicists at nobel institute in sweden in 1957 team reported that they had bombarded a curium target with carbon 13 ions for twenty five hours in half hour intervals between bombardments ion exchange chemistry was performed on target twelve out of fifty bombardments contained samples emitting 8 5 0 1 mev alpha particles which were in drops which eluted earlier than fermium atomic number z 100 and californium z 98 half life reported was 10 minutes and was assigned to either or 253102 although possibility that alpha particles observed were from a presumably short lived mendelevium z 101 isotope created from electron capture of element 102 was not excluded team proposed name nobelium no for new element which was immediately approved by iupac a decision which dubna group characterized in 1968 as being hasty following year scientists at lawrence berkeley national laboratory repeated experiment but were unable to find any 8 5 mev events which were not background effects in 1959 swedish team attempted to explain berkeley team s inability to detect element 102 in 1958 maintaining that they did discover it however later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259no no heavier isotopes could have been produced in swedish experiments with a half life over 3 minutes exist and that swedish team s results are most likely from thorium 225 which has a half life of 8 minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium 213 which has a decay energy of 8 mev this hypothesis is lent weight by fact that thorium 225 can easily be produced in reaction used and would not be separated out by chemical methods used later work on nobelium also showed that divalent state is more stable than trivalent one and hence that samples emitting alpha particles could not have contained nobelium as divalent nobelium would not have eluted with other trivalent actinides thus swedish team later retracted their claim and associated activity to background effects berkeley team consisting of albert ghiorso glenn t seaborg john r walton and torbjorn sikkeland then claimed synthesis of element 102 in 1958 team used new heavy ion linear accelerator hilac to bombard a curium target 95 244cm and 5 with 13c and 12c ions they were unable to confirm 8 5 mev activity claimed by swedes but were instead able to detect decays from fermium 250 supposedly daughter of 254102 produced from curium 246 which had an apparent half life of 3 s later 1963 dubna work confirmed that 254102 could be produced in this reaction but that its half life was actually in 1967 berkeley team attempted to defend their work stating that isotope found was indeed 250fm but isotope that half life measurements actually related to was californium 244 granddaughter of 252102 produced from more abundant curium 244 energy differences were then attributed to resolution and drift problems although these had not been previously reported and should also have influenced other results 1977 experiments showed that 252102 indeed had a 2 3 second half life however 1973 work also showed that 250fm recoil could have also easily been produced from isomeric transition of 250mfm half life 1 8 s which could also have been formed in reaction at energy used given this it is probable that no nobelium was actually produced in this experiment in 1959 team continued their studies and claimed that they were able to produce an isotope that decayed predominantly by emission of an 8 3 mev alpha particle with a half life of 3 s with an associated 30 spontaneous fission branch activity was initially assigned to 254102 but later changed to 252102 however they also noted that it was not certain that nobelium had been produced due to difficult conditions berkeley team decided to adopt proposed name of swedish team nobelium for element 4 meanwhile in dubna experiments were carried out in 1958 and 1960 aiming to synthesize element 102 as well first 1958 experiment bombarded plutonium 239 and 241 with oxygen 16 ions some alpha decays with energies just over 8 5 mev were observed and they were assigned to 251 252 253102 although team wrote that formation of isotopes from lead or bismuth impurities which would not produce nobelium could not be ruled out while later 1958 experiments noted that new isotopes could be produced from mercury thallium lead or bismuth impurities scientists still stood by their conclusion that element 102 could be produced from this reaction mentioning a half life of under 30 seconds and a decay energy of 8 8 0 5 mev later 1960 experiments proved that these were background effects 1967 experiments also lowered decay energy to 8 6 0 4 mev but both values are too high to possibly match those of 253no or 254no dubna team later stated in 1970 and again in 1987 that these results were not conclusive in 1961 berkeley scientists claimed discovery of element 103 in reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions they claimed production of isotope 257103 and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half life of 15 s and alpha decay energy 8 2 mev they assigned this to without giving a reason for assignment values do not agree with those now known for 255no although they do agree with those now known for 257no and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive work on element 102 also continued in dubna and in 1964 experiments were carried out there to detect alpha decay daughters of element 102 isotopes by synthesizing element 102 from reaction of a uranium 238 target with neon ions products were carried along a silver catcher foil and purified chemically and isotopes 250fm and 252fm were detected yield of 252fm was interpreted as evidence that its parent 256102 was also synthesized as it was noted that 252fm could also be produced directly in this reaction by simultaneous emission of an alpha particle with excess neutrons steps were taken to ensure that 252fm could not go directly to catcher foil half life detected for 256102 was 8 s which is much higher than more modern 1967 value of 3 2 0 2 s further experiments were conducted in 1966 for 254102 using reactions 243am 15n 4n 254102 and 238u 22ne 6n 254102 finding a half life of 50 10 s at that time discrepancy between this value and earlier berkeley value was not understood although later work proved that formation of isomer 250mfm was less likely in dubna experiments than at berkeley ones in hindsight dubna results on 254102 were probably correct and can be now considered a conclusive detection of element 102 one more very convincing experiment from dubna was published in 1966 again using same two reactions which concluded that 254102 indeed had a half life much longer than 3 seconds claimed by berkeley later work in 1967 at berkeley and 1971 at oak ridge national laboratory fully confirmed discovery of element 102 and clarified earlier observations in december 1966 berkeley group repeated dubna experiments and fully confirmed them and used this data to finally assign correctly isotopes they had previously synthesized but could not yet identify at time and thus claimed to have discovered nobelium in 1958 to 1961 6 in 1969 dubna team carried out chemical experiments on element 102 and concluded that it behaved as heavier homologue of ytterbium russian scientists proposed name jo for new element after irene joliot curie who had recently died creating an element naming controversy that would not be resolved for several decades which each group using its own proposed names in 1992 iupac iupap transfermium working group twg reassessed claims of discovery and concluded that only dubna work from 1966 correctly detected and assigned decays to nuclei with atomic number 102 at time dubna team are therefore officially recognised as discoverers of nobelium although it is possible that it was detected at berkeley in 1959 this decision was criticized by berkeley following year calling reopening of cases of elements 101 to 103 a futile waste of time while dubna agreed with iupac s decision in 1994 as part of an attempted resolution to element naming controversy iupac ratified names for elements 101 109 for element 102 it ratified name nobelium no on basis that it had become entrenched in literature over course of 30 years and that alfred nobel should be commemorated in this fashion because of outcry over 1994 names which mostly did not respect choices of discoverers a comment period ensued and in 1995 iupac named element 102 flerovium fl as part of a new proposal after either georgy flyorov or his eponymous flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions this proposal was also not accepted and in 1997 name nobelium was restored today name flerovium with same symbol refers to element 114 characteristics physical thumb upright 1 6 right energy required to promote an f electron to d subshell for f block lanthanides and actinides above around 210 kj mol this energy is too high to be provided for by greater crystal energy of trivalent state and thus einsteinium fermium and mendelevium form divalent metals like lanthanides europium and ytterbium nobelium is also expected to form a divalent metal but this has not yet been confirmed in periodic table nobelium is located to right of actinide mendelevium to left of actinide lawrencium and below lanthanide ytterbium nobelium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities and bulk preparation is currently impossible silva pp 1639 nevertheless a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties lanthanides and actinides in metallic state can exist as either divalent such as europium and ytterbium or trivalent most other lanthanides metals former have fn 1s2 configurations whereas latter have configurations in 1975 johansson and rosengren examined measured and predicted values for cohesive energies enthalpies of crystallization of metallic lanthanides and actinides both as divalent and trivalent metals silva pp 1626 8 conclusion was that increased binding energy of rn configuration over rn 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium was not enough to compensate for energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d as is true also for very late actinides thus einsteinium fermium mendelevium and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed increasing predominance of divalent state well before actinide series concludes is attributed to relativistic stabilization of 5f electrons which increases with increasing atomic number an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent unlike all other lanthanides and actinides in 1986 nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126 kj mol a value close to values for einsteinium fermium and mendelevium and supporting theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal like other divalent late actinides except once again trivalent lawrencium metallic nobelium should assume a face centered cubic crystal structure divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197 pm nobelium s melting point has been predicted to be 827 degc same value as that estimated for neighboring element mendelevium its density is predicted to be around 9 9 0 4 g cm3 chemical chemistry of nobelium is incompletely characterized and is known only in aqueous solution in which it can take on 3 or 2 oxidation states latter being more stable silva pp 1636 7 it was largely expected before discovery of nobelium that in solution it would behave like other actinides with trivalent state being predominant however seaborg predicted in 1949 that 2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium as no2 ion would have ground state electron configuration rn 5f14 including stable filled 5f14 shell it took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed silva pp 1639 41 in 1967 experiments were conducted to compare nobelium s chemical behavior to that of terbium californium and fermium all four elements were reacted with chlorine and resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube along which they were carried by a gas it was found that nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces proving that it was not very volatile like chlorides of other three investigated elements however both and were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what preferred oxidation state of nobelium was determination of nobelium s favoring of 2 state had to wait until next year when cation exchange chromatography and coprecipitation experiments were carried out on around fifty thousand 255no atoms finding that it behaved differently from other actinides and more like divalent alkaline earth metals this proved that in aqueous solution nobelium is most stable in divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with alkaline earth metals between ca2 and sr2 nobelium is only known f block element for which 2 state is most common and stable one in aqueous solution this occurs because of large energy gap between 5f and 6d orbitals at end of actinide series it is expected that relativistic stabilization of 7s subshell greatly destabilizes nobelium dihydride noh2 and relativistic stabilisation of 7p1 2 spinor over 6d3 2 spinor mean that excited states in nobelium atoms have 7s and 7p contribution instead of expected 6d contribution long no h distances in noh2 molecule and significant charge transfer lead to extreme ionicity with a dipole moment of 5 94 d for this molecule in this molecule nobelium is expected to exhibit main group like behavior specifically acting like an alkaline earth metal with its ns2 valence shell configuration and core like 5f orbitals nobelium s complexing ability with chloride ions is most similar to that of barium which complexes rather weakly its complexing ability with citrate oxalate and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0 5 m ammonium nitrate is between that of calcium and strontium although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium standard reduction potential of edeg no3 no2 couple was estimated in 1967 to be between 1 4 and 1 5 v it was later found in 2009 to be only about 0 75 v positive value shows that no2 is more stable than no3 and that no3 is a good oxidizing agent while quoted values for edeg no2 no0 and edeg no3 no0 vary among sources accepted standard estimates are 2 61 and 1 26 v it has been predicted that value for edeg no3 couple would be 6 5 v gibbs energies of formation for no3 and no2 are estimated to be 342 and 480 kj mol respectively atomic a nobelium atom has 102 electrons of which three can act as valence electrons they are expected to be arranged in configuration rn 5f147s2 ground state term symbol 1s0 although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006 in forming compounds all three valence electrons may be lost leaving behind a rn core this conforms to trend set by other actinides with their rn 5fn electron configurations in tripositive state nevertheless it is more likely that only two valence electrons may be lost leaving behind a stable rn 5f14 core with a filled 5f14 shell first ionization potential of nobelium was measured to be at most 6 65 0 07 ev in 1974 based on assumption that 7s electrons would ionize before 5f ones this value has since not yet been refined further due to nobelium s scarcity and high radioactivity lide david r editor crc handbook of chemistry and physics 84th edition crc press boca raton fl 2003 section 10 atomic molecular and optical physics ionization potentials of atoms and atomic ions ionic radius of hexacoordinate and no3 had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 90 and 102 pm respectively ionic radius of no2 has been experimentally found to be 100 pm to two significant figures enthalpy of hydration of no2 has been calculated as 1486 kj mol isotopes twelve isotopes of nobelium are known with mass numbers 250 260 and 262 all are radioactive silva pp 1637 8 additionally nuclear isomers are known for mass numbers 251 253 and 254 of these longest lived isotope is 259no with a half life of 58 minutes and longest lived isomer is with a half life of 1 7 seconds however still undiscovered isotope is predicted to have a still longer half life of 170 min additionally shorter lived 255no half life 3 1 minutes is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from irradiation of californium 249 with carbon 12 ions after 259no and 255no next most stable nobelium isotopes are 253no half life 1 62 minutes 254no 51 seconds 257no 25 seconds 256no 2 91 seconds and 2 57 seconds all of remaining nobelium isotopes have half lives that are less than a second and shortest lived known nobelium isotope 250no has a half life of only 0 25 milliseconds isotope 254no is especially interesting theoretically as it is in middle of a series of nuclei from 231pa to and formation of its nuclear isomers of which two are known is controlled by proton orbitals such as 2 which come just above spherical proton shell it can be synthesized in reaction of 208pb with 48ca half lives of nobelium isotopes increase smoothly from 250no to 253no however a dip appears at 254no and beyond this half lives of even even nobelium isotopes drop sharply as spontaneous fission becomes dominant decay mode for example half life of 256no is almost three seconds but that of is only 1 2 milliseconds this shows that at nobelium mutual repulsion of protons poses a limit to region of long lived nuclei in actinide series even odd nobelium isotopes mostly continue to have longer half lives as their mass numbers increase with a dip in trend at 257no preparation and purification isotopes of nobelium are mostly produced by bombarding actinide targets uranium plutonium curium californium or einsteinium with exception of nobelium 262 which is produced as daughter of lawrencium 262 most commonly used isotope 255no can be produced from bombarding curium 248 or californium 249 with carbon 12 latter method is more common irradiating a 350 mg cm 2 target of californium 249 with three trillion 3 x 1012 73 mev carbon 12 ions per second for ten minutes can produce around 1200 nobelium 255 atoms once nobelium 255 is produced it can be separated out in a similar way as used to purify neighboring actinide mendelevium recoil momentum of produced nobelium 255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from target from which they are produced bringing them onto a thin foil of metal usually beryllium aluminium platinum or gold just behind target in a vacuum this is usually combined by trapping nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere frequently helium and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in reaction chamber using a long capillary tube and including potassium chloride aerosols in helium gas nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters silva pp 1638 9 thin layer of nobelium collected on foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving foil nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form divalent state unlike other trivalent actinides under typically used elution conditions bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid hdehp as stationary organic phase and 0 05 m hydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase or using 3 m hydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation exchange resin columns nobelium will pass through column and elute while other trivalent actinides remain on column however if a direct catcher gold foil is used process is complicated by need to separate out gold using anion exchange chromatography before isolating nobelium by elution from
