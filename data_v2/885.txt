nine percent in year after 1 may attacks according to state government increase in violence was a result of arrests carried out by security forces against criminal groups leadership structures as organized crime groups are destabilized and have to restructure often violently after their leaders are taken down in 2016 alone jalisco recorded 1 152 homicides compared to 1 017 in 2015 of 2016

he was arrested authorities confiscated four assault rifles three handguns a package of cocaine four vehicles and radio communication equipment according to pf chief enrique francisco galindo ceballos es el tanque was a high ranking leader of cjng and reported directly to el mencho as group s second in command following arrest of el mencho s son ruben oseguera gonzalez alias el pf also suspected that his center of operations was in guadalajara where he used money laundering proceeds to further his criminal activities they believed he was also responsible for drug trafficking extorting businesses leading oil theft rings and homicides in jalisco and veracruz prior to his arrest pf carried out several covert operations over six months and eventually found their way to el tanque s inner circle where they discovered that he frequented a location that cjng used as one of its centers of operations and as a recreation spot police highlighted that no shots were fired in operation partly because el tanque and his three accomplices were drinking alcohol and were not prepared to defend themselves when police raided building on 2 august 2018 mexican government arrested six people for their alleged participation in helicopter attack and in ambush in ocotlan men were arrested at a ranch in jalisco that was thought to be owned by cjng and used as a distribution hub renato salas

drug war government has swiftly responded against sensational acts of violence often leading to arrest or death of drug kingpins pena nieto said after attacks that cjng was going to be treated in similar fashion cns chief rubido garcia also told reporters that government was concentrating efforts to capture el mencho reaction from government was intensive because attacks were unprecedented in mexican drug war before attacks government had not seen that aggressive of a response from organized crime according to investigators cjng was able to carry out attacks because they had territorial knowledge and control and because they were able to manage resources logistics and intelligence information in their favor in addition cjng was suspected of having well trained foot soldiers likely with former police and military training who employed paramilitary tactics during 1 may attacks attention shifted from el mencho on 15 july 2016 when suspected sinaloa cartel leader joaquin el chapo guzman once on mexico s most wanted list escaped from prison a second time this event embarrassed mexican government which reallocated resources to apprehend el chapo this was important for cjng because it allowed el mencho to re evaluate group s violent methods against security forces over time ambushes and attacks against law enforcement declined and cjng began to focus on fighting rival
