outright team has not qualified for a major competition since 1998 german coach berti vogts became first foreign manager of team in 2002 but his time in charge was generally seen as a failure and fifa

sfa only allowed him to select a travelling party of 13 players beattie who felt this restriction made it impossible for him to perform his duties well resigned during tournament scotland were eliminated from tournament after a 7 0 defeat by uruguay after 1954 world cup selection committee resumed their duties continuing until appointment of matt busby in 1958 busby was initially unable to assume his duties due to serious injuries he sustained in munich air disaster with dawson walker taking charge of team while busby recovered busby only took charge of two scotland matches but he did give a young denis law his first scotland cap in march 1959 andy beattie became scotland manager for a second time during his second spell as scotland manager beattie combined those duties with managing a football club he resigned in november 1960 in order to manage english club nottingham forest on a full time basis 1960s ian mccoll who had just retired from a long playing career with rangers was appointed scotland manager in 1960 he enjoyed significant success winning british home championships in 1962 and 1963 and had an impressive winning percentage mccoll left team in 1965 to become manager of sunderland celtic manager jock stein was then appointed manager of scotland on a part time basis stein took charge of their attempt to qualify for 1966 world cup scotland achieved good results in their first two qualifiers a draw against poland and a win against finland stein was criticised by scottish press after team conceded two late goals and lost 2 1 at home to poland but they managed to beat italy 1 0 at hampden park to raise some hope of qualification scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from return match against italy due to injury and a 3 0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify clyde manager john prentice then took job on a full time basis in 1966 but left to manage dundee after just six months and four games in charge after malky macdonald took charge of two games on a caretaker basis bobby brown was appointed manager brown was first scotland manager to be given full control of team as until then sfa selection committee had continued to

manager in 1971 and had a brief but successful time in charge docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager but he left job in late 1972 to become manager of manchester united despite losing 5 0 to england in his first match in charge scotland qualified for 1974 world cup under management of willie ormond scotland performed creditably at finals winning against zaire and drawing against brazil and yugoslavia but were eliminated on goal difference ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure which included an infamous incident where jimmy johnstone after a night out drinking sat in a rowing boat that was drifting out to sea two teammates attempted to rescue johnstone but eventually he had to be retrieved by local fishermen ormond left scotland job in 1977 to become manager of hearts ally macleod had an immediate impact as scotland manager winning against england at wembley his team then qualified for 1978 fifa world cup by defeating wales at anfield although scotland were controversially given a penalty kick macleod was confident about team s prospects quipping that his plan for after world cup was to retain it supporters shared in this enthusiasm as hampden park was packed for a farewell parade before team flew to tournament hosted by argentina macleod dismissed his first two opponents peru and iran as old men and minnows respectively a defeat by peru and a draw with iran left scotland needing to defeat netherlands by three clear goals to qualify macleod made a number of contested selection decisions preferring out of form don masson and bruce rioch to graeme souness winger willie johnston failed a drugs test after peru match and was sent home scotland produced an outstanding performance against netherlands and won 3 2 but were eliminated on goal difference macleod stayed on as scotland manager after world cup but resigned after a defeat by austria in september 1978 writers have since considered question of whether macleod was cause of a lack of scottish self confidence or was someone who tried to counter it 1978 1986 stein and ferguson thumb upright alex ferguson managed scotland at 1986 fifa world cup jock stein who was working as manager of leeds united was recruited by sfa to manage scotland team for a second time two defeats to belgium meant that scotland failed to qualify for 1980 european

exited on goal difference after they drew 2 2 with soviet union in a must win game scotland then failed to qualify for 1984 european championship which led to criticism of stein leading into next competition 1986 world cup as a consequence stein was facing significant pressure to ensure qualification for tournament in mexico scotland defeated spain 3 1 but then lost 1 0 at home to wales this left scotland needing to secure at least a point from their final group match against wales in cardiff to qualify for a play off against australia stein was not helped by fact that a number of his senior players including graeme souness his captain kenny dalglish alan hansen and steve archibald would all miss game through injury or suspension stein had been taking diuretics to reduce pressure on his heart since home defeat by wales despite his enthusiasm for job these strains had let to stein indicating that he would step down after world cup finals in mexico scotland drew 1 1 thanks to a

scotland played well in a narrow defeat against brazil and a draw against norway but were eliminated after suffering a 3 0 defeat against morocco during 2002 fifa world cup qualification brown continued to rely on a group of ageing players including colin hendry and tom boyd none of his strikers were playing regularly for their clubs and team lacked pace brown resigned immediately after last qualification match 2001 present thumb upright berti vogts was first foreign manager of team appointed in 2002 thumb 200px right gordon strachan scotland manager from 2013 to 2017 pictured in 2007 former germany manager berti vogts was appointed scotland manager in january 2002 a number of players retired from international football after craig brown resigned which meant that vogts had to build a new squad he tried new players and formations but team suffered a number of heavy defeats in early friendly fixtures scotland reached uefa euro 2004 qualification play offs and won first leg at home against netherlands but were then beaten 6 0 in return match vogts continued as manager into 2006 fifa world cup qualification matches but resigned after team took just two points from their first three matches debate about why vogts had failed centred on whether scotland had sufficient playing talent to compete or if poor results had been due to his own failings by time walter smith had been appointed manager scotland had dropped to a record low position in fifa world rankings smith was credited with creating a club atmosphere within national squad scotland performed well in early stages of a tough uefa euro 2008 qualification group but smith resigned from scotland job in january 2007 to manage rangers alex mcleish was hired to replace smith scotland continued to pursue qualification for euro 2008 under mcleish but were eliminated after losing against italy in final match mcleish left scotland job soon afterwards to manage birmingham city despite failing to qualify

decided to keep burley in job but then decided to dismiss him after a heavy defeat in a friendly match against wales dundee united manager craig levein was appointed in december 2009 levein was heavily criticised by media for his decision to play without any strikers in a euro 2012 qualifier against czech republic which scotland lost 1 0 levein continued to defend this tactical approach even after he had left position scotland failed to qualify for euro 2012 but levein argued that team was improving for 2014 world cup qualification levein and sfa successfully pushed for scotland to have their first two fixtures at home this policy backfired however as scotland could only draw those two matches defeats in following away matches against wales and belgium resulted in levein being sacked by sfa gordon strachan was appointed to replace levein strachan was credited with improving fortunes of team in his first year in charge as scotland achieved victories against croatia twice macedonia and norway in uefa euro 2016 qualifying scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24 but were drawn in a tough group with germany poland and republic of ireland after losing their opening match in germany scotland recorded home wins against georgia ireland and gibraltar and away draws against poland and ireland in their following game scotland produced an insipid performance as they lost 1 0 in georgia a home defeat by germany and a late equalising goal by poland eliminated scotland from contention after a win against gibraltar in last qualifier strachan agreed a new contract with sfa improved results in later part of 2018 fifa world cup qualification gave scotland a chance of play off place but a 2 2 draw at slovenia ended those hopes on 12 october 2017 strachan left his position by mutual consent after a failed attempt to recruit northern ireland manager michael o neill alex mcleish was appointed in
