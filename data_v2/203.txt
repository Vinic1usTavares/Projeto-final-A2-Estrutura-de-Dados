canning dam and reservoir provide a major fresh water resource for city of perth western australia dam is situated on darling scarp and is an impoundment of canning river it is noted for its innovative structural and hydraulic design that was considered to be at forefront of concrete gravity dam design at time of construction canning dam was perth s primary water supply up until 1960s when other sources of fresh water were tapped currently dam supplies approximately 20 percent of perth s fresh water inflow into canning reservoir is estimated to be and has a storage capacity of since its completion in 1940 canning dam has contributed to a wide range of environmental and ecological problems in surrounding regions problems include more common algal blooms habitat loss and sedimentation despite these issues canning dam and adjacent parks and forests provide a variety of recreational activities for public such as bushwalking historic walks and picnic facilities history development of canning river as a source of water for perth was first proposed in a report of first metropolitan water works board of perth in 1896 investigation of site began in 1897 when engineer thomas hodgson surveyed and proposed dam s current location as a possible site however despite recommendations of further inquiries and an extreme shortage of water in some years government funds were not allocated for construction of a dam until great depression in 1930s in 1924 a small dam was built downstream from present canning dam it was only intended as a quick fix to water supply problem and it soon became apparent that a major reservoir was needed although it would be nine years before work on current canning dam would begin new dam was completed in 1940 at a cost of 1 million engineer russell dumas designed dam and directed most of its construction a further improvement was made in 1951 when a concrete lined channel was constructed to divert stream flow from nearby kangaroo gully catchment canning dam and reservoir was perth s primary source of water until boom growth of city in 1960s and completion of serpentine dam in 1961 in 1975 reservoir was connected to perth s integrated water supply scheme by canning tunnel day p 2 prior to its opening water had flowed through canning contour channel to gosnells canning dam and reservoir still supplies approximately 20 percent of perth s drinking water requirements and plays an important role in context of development of perth canning reservoir is also used to store water from newly completed kwinana desalination plant treated water can be pumped from plant to reservoir through new forrestdale pumping station hydrology canning dam catchment lies within darling scarp which forms part of an archaean shield composed largely of granite with some invaded linear belts of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks dam wall is situated in a narrow gorge running east and west with rock sides sloping upward from river bed behind dam wall south branch of canning river joins main stream with impounded water forming a lake which stretches back in three major arms to east south east and south thumb right canning dam as it appeared at 34 4 of capacity catchment has an area of reservoir is at ahd and highest point of catchment mount cooke is at ahd climatically area receives about of rainfall per annum with most of this falling between may and september there is widespread variability of rainfall across catchment however from between since 1975 long term average rainfalls at dam wall have decreased by 20 percent and streamflow into catchment by approximately 60 percent average annual inflow between 1948 and 1974 was which had reduced to between 1975 and 2004 construction thumb right construction of dam wall construction of canning dam ended a long period during which perth s water supply was generally unsatisfactory in quality either due to salinity or bacterial pollution or both and in quantity project biggest public works program of decade stimulated significant growth in local economy and provided desperately needed work for around five hundred men several innovative design concepts and construction methods which were new to australia were introduced on project while others which were used on nearby wellington dam were improved upon at canning dam site at canning dam and indeed all dams care had to be taken to prevent water seepage between foundation rock and structure of dam at canning in addition to cutting back foundation to solid rock a cut off trench was sited near upstream face of dam down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between rock face and concrete of dam inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at period near vertical tubular 8 in 200 mm cut off drains were provided at five foot 1 52 m intervals along dam to relieve internal seepage through concrete while state of art materials handling methods were used in some instances labour saving machinery worked beside operations intended to maximise labour content sustenance workers were employed chiefly for on site preparation road construction foundation excavation clearing timber from reservoir basin and on some concreting operations skilled workers were required on dam for fixing formwork where concrete was poured these workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates main employment method used on project bulk handling of cement was also used for first time in australia this saw a significant saving as opposed to bagged cement which was standard practice of day generally construction work proceeded smoothly and from an engineering point of view there were few setbacks however one did occur in early stages of construction in march 1934 there was a violent storm bringing of rain in less than two days as a result river rose rapidly which flooded dam foundation workings pumps had to be installed and work resumed three days later dam was completed in september 1940 when built it was longest concrete gravity dam in australia and also second highest after burrinjuck dam in new south wales as of 1997 of 90 large concrete and masonry gravity dams in australia canning dam is still fifth highest and sixth longest it is largest concrete dam in western australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete final cost of dam was significantly less than had been originally budgeted for and work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously remedial works recently canning dam has been subjected to considerable cracking of upper parts of dam and upper gallery investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong aar alkali aggregate reactivity in concrete aar results in swelling of concrete which may cause secondary compressive stresses localised map cracks and ultimately structural cracks in addition concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases many old concrete dams are known to suffer from aar including fontana dam in tennessee and pian dam in italy among others extensive remedial works were undertaken between 1999 and 2001 to strengthen dam wall this work involved removing top of existing dam wall and drilling blasting through dam wall plus up to a further into bedrock below top section of wall was then rebuilt using reinforced concrete finally permanent re ground anchors were then installed through formed and drilled holes from crest to be stressed and grouted into foundation rock at time of completion these were largest capacity and longest permanent ground anchors ever installed in world an innovative drilling and blasting technique called penetrating cone fracture pcf was used in remedial works process pcf was chosen over conventional drilling and or blasting techniques due to reduced risk of damage to existing structure from vibration as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels environmental issues since construction of canning dam among other drinking water supply dams water flow into canning river has been reduced by up to 96 a number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to south west of western australia are found in canning river system however studies of fish and fish habitats in area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds stagnant water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest damming of canning caused dramatic flow reductions that significantly altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities lack of water flow has also resulted in a poor flushing effect below dam wall an excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and eutrophication many river pools which are an important summer refuge and habitat for aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna have been lost due to sedimentation and modification of flow regime caused by impoundments in canning river periodic flooding of canning river from dam is required to disperse seed stimulate germination and ensure seedlings survive recharge shallow groundwater tables that are important during periods of drought and to discourage and prevent weed growth however during times of low rainfall periodic flooding is reduced recreation a number of recreation activities occur in and around dam and catchment area canning dam features a number of picnic areas with gas barbecues look outs and historic walks many with disabled access bushwalking occurs throughout catchment particularly along track which passes through catchment about 10 km upstream of canning dam several mountain bike trails run either through canning national park or adjacent state forest areas canning reservoir canning river and tributaries are illegally fished for marron especially during summer boating fishing and swimming are prohibited in reservoir for health and hygiene reasons unauthorised camping including overnight stays and or outside of designated areas and unauthorised trail establishment occur more and more frequently in canning catchment gallery see also
