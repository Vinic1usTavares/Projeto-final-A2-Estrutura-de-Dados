formal definition agreed by iau in 2006 and an informal working definition established by iau in 2001 2003 for objects outside of solar system official 2006 definition applies only to solar system whereas 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at 2006 iau conference term planet is ancient with ties to history astrology science mythology and religion five planets in solar system are visible to naked eye these were regarded by many early cultures as divine or as emissaries of deities as scientific knowledge advanced human perception of planets changed incorporating a number of disparate objects in 2006 international astronomical union iau officially adopted a resolution defining planets within solar system this definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit although eight of planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain planets under current definition some celestial bodies such as ceres pallas juno and vesta each an object in solar asteroid belt and pluto first trans neptunian object discovered that were once considered planets by scientific community are no longer viewed as planets under current definition of planet planets in astrology have a different definition planets were thought by ptolemy to orbit earth in deferent and epicycle motions although idea that planets orbited sun had been suggested many times it was not until 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from first telescopic astronomical observations performed by galileo galilei about same time by careful analysis of pre telescopic observational data collected by tycho brahe johannes kepler found planets orbits were elliptical rather than circular as observational tools improved astronomers saw that like earth each of planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons since dawn of space age close observation by space probes has found that earth and other planets share characteristics such as volcanism hurricanes tectonics and even hydrology planets are generally divided into two main types large low density giant planets and smaller rocky terrestrials there are eight planets in solar system in order of increasing distance from sun they are four

divine lights of antiquity to earthly objects of scientific age concept has expanded to include worlds not only in solar system but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy five classical planets being visible to naked eye have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology religious cosmology and ancient astronomy in ancient times astronomers noted how certain lights moved across sky as opposed to fixed stars which maintained a constant relative position in sky ancient greeks called these lights wandering stars or simply wanderers planetes h g liddell and r scott a greek english lexicon ninth edition oxford clarendon press 1940 from which today s word planet was derived in ancient greece china babylon and indeed all pre modern civilizations it was almost universally believed that earth was center of universe and that all planets circled earth reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around earth each day and apparently common sense perceptions that earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest babylon first civilization known to have a functional theory of planets were babylonians who lived in mesopotamia in first and second millennia bc oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is babylonian venus tablet of a 7th century bc copy of a list of observations of motions of planet venus that probably dates as early as second millennium bc mul apin is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from 7th century bc that lays out motions of sun moon and planets over course of year babylonian astrologers also laid foundations of what would eventually become western astrology enuma anu enlil written during neo assyrian period in 7th century bc comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including motions of planets venus mercury and outer planets mars

in 6th and 5th centuries bc appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory which consisted of earth sun moon and planets revolving around a central fire at center of universe pythagoras or parmenides is said to have been first to identify evening star hesperos and morning star phosphoros as one and same aphrodite greek corresponding to latin venus though this had long been known by babylonians in 3rd century bc aristarchus of samos proposed a heliocentric system according to which earth and planets revolved around sun geocentric system remained dominant until scientific revolution by 1st century bc during hellenistic period greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting positions of planets these schemes which were based on geometry rather than arithmetic of babylonians would eventually eclipse babylonians theories in complexity and comprehensiveness and account for most of astronomical movements observed from earth with naked eye these theories would reach their fullest expression in almagest written by ptolemy in 2nd century ce so complete was domination of ptolemy s model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained definitive astronomical text in western world for 13 centuries to greeks and romans there were seven known planets each presumed to be circling earth according to complex laws laid out by ptolemy they were in increasing order from earth in ptolemy s order and using modern names moon mercury venus sun mars jupiter and saturn note select etymology tab cicero in his de natura deorum enumerated planets known during 1st century bce using names for them in use at time cicero de natura deorum but there is most matter for wonder in movements of five stars which are falsely called wandering falsely because nothing wanders which through all eternity preserves its forward and retrograde courses and its other movements constant and unaltered for instance star which is farthest from earth which is known as star of saturn and is called by greeks phaethon phainon accomplishes its course in about thirty years and though in that course it does much that is wonderful first preceding sun and then falling off in speed becoming invisible at hour of evening and returning to view in morning it never through unending ages of time makes any variation but performs same movements at same times beneath it and nearer to earth moves planet of jupiter which is called in greek phaethon phaethon it completes same round of twelve signs in twelve years and performs in its course same variations as planet of saturn circle next below it is held by pyroeis which is called planet of mars and traverses same round as two planets above it in four and twenty months all but i think six days beneath this is planet of mercury which is called by greeks stilbon stilbon it traverses round of zodiac in about time of year s revolution and never withdraws more than one sign s distance from sun moving at one time in advance of it and at another in its rear lowest of five wandering stars and one nearest earth is planet of venus which is called phosphoros phosphoros in greek and lucifer in latin when it is preceding sun but hesperos when it is following it it completes its course in a year traversing zodiac both latitudinally and longitudinally as is also done by planets above it and on whichever side of sun it is it never departs more than two signs distance from it india in 499 ce indian astronomer aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated earth s rotation about its axis which he explains as cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of stars he also believed that orbits of planets are elliptical ref j j o connor and e f

in 12th century ibn bajjah observed two planets as black spots on face of sun which was later identified as a transit of mercury and venus by maragha astronomer qotb al din shirazi in 13th century ibn

saturn 14px with advent of scientific revolution use of term planet changed from something that moved across sky in relation to star field to a body that orbited earth or that was believed to do so at time and by 18th century to something that directly orbited sun when heliocentric model of copernicus galileo and kepler gained sway thus earth became included in list of planets whereas sun and moon were excluded at first when first satellites of jupiter and saturn were discovered in 17th century terms planet and satellite were used interchangeably although latter would gradually become more prevalent in following century see primary citations in timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moons until mid 19th century number of planets rose rapidly because any newly discovered

century such as ceres pallas juno and vesta were very different from traditional ones these bodies shared same region of space between mars and jupiter asteroid belt and had a much smaller mass as a result they were reclassified as asteroids in absence of any formal definition a planet came to be understood as any large body that orbited sun because there was a dramatic size gap between asteroids and planets and spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after discovery of neptune in 1846 there was no apparent need to have a formal definition 20th century planets 1854 1930 solar planets

wolszczan and dale frail announced discovery of planets around a pulsar psr b1257 12 this discovery is generally considered to be first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star then on october 6 1995 michel mayor and didier queloz of geneva observatory announced first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main sequence star 51 pegasi discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet point at which a planet becomes a star many known extrasolar planets are many times mass of jupiter approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium a heavier isotope of hydrogen although objects more massive than 75 times that of jupiter fuse hydrogen objects of only 13 jupiter masses can fuse deuterium deuterium is quite rare and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets 21st century with discovery during latter half of 20th century of more objects within solar system and large objects around other stars disputes arose over what should constitute a planet there were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt or if it was large enough to generate energy by thermonuclear fusion of deuterium a growing number of astronomers argued for pluto to be declassified as a planet because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in same region of solar system kuiper belt during 1990s and early 2000s pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands some of them such as quaoar sedna and eris were heralded in popular press as tenth planet failing to receive widespread scientific recognition announcement of eris in 2005 an object then thought of as 27 more massive than pluto created necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet acknowledging problem iau set about creating definition of planet and produced one in august 2006 number of planets dropped to eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune and a new class of dwarf planets was created initially containing three objects ceres pluto and eris extrasolar planets there is no official definition of extrasolar planets in 2003 international astronomical union iau working group on extrasolar planets issued a position statement but this position statement was never proposed as an official iau resolution and was never voted on by iau members positions statement incorporates following guidelines mostly focused upon boundary between planets and brown dwarfs objects with true masses below limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium currently calculated to be 13 times mass of jupiter for objects with same isotopic abundance as sun that orbit stars or stellar remnants are planets no matter how they formed minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be same as that used in solar system substellar objects with true masses above limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are brown dwarfs no matter how they formed or where they are located free floating objects in young star clusters with masses below limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not planets but are sub brown dwarfs or whatever name is most appropriate this working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals see for example list of references for although temporary it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted it does not address dispute over lower mass limit and so it steered clear of controversy regarding objects within solar system this definition also makes no comment on planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs such as one definition of a sub brown dwarf is a planet mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion this formation distinction between a sub brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification one reason for dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine formation process for example a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from system to become free floating and likewise a sub brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star one study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets evidence of an upper bound on masses of planets and its implications for giant planet formation

rather than a precise threshold value large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little and 13 value is somewhere in between in fact calculations show that an object fuses 50 of its initial deuterium content when total mass ranges between 12 and 14 amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on composition of object on amount of helium and deuterium present as of 2011 extrasolar planets encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 jupiter masses saying fact that there is no special feature around in observed mass spectrum reinforces choice to forget this mass limit as of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 jupiter massesexoplanets versus brown dwarfs corot view and future jean schneider 4 apr 2016 based on a study of mass density relationships exoplanet data explorer includes objects up to 24 jupiter masses with advisory 13 jupiter mass distinction by iau working group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores and observationally problematic due to sin i ambiguity nasa exoplanet archive includes objects with a mass or minimum mass equal to or less than 30 jupiter masses exoplanet criteria for inclusion in archive nasa exoplanet archive another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs rather than deuterium fusion formation process or location is whether core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure 2006 iau definition of planet thumb upright 1 6 right euler diagram showing types of bodies in solar system matter of lower limit was addressed during 2006 meeting of iau s general assembly after much debate and one failed proposal a large majority of those remaining at meeting voted to pass a resolution 2006 resolution defines planets within solar system as follows under this definition solar system is considered to have eight planets bodies that fulfill first two conditions but not third such as ceres pluto and eris are classified as dwarf planets provided they are not also natural satellites of other planets originally an iau committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include c as a criterion after much discussion it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets this definition is based in theories of planetary formation in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects as described by astronomer steven soter end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies planets in either non intersecting or resonant orbits which prevent collisions between them minor planets and comets including kbos kuiper belt objects differ from planets in that they can collide with each other and with planets 2006 iau definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because language is specific to solar system and because criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable astronomer jean luc margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during lifetime of its host star based on mass of planet its semimajor axis and mass of its host star this formula produces a value p that is greater than 1 for planets eight known planets and all known exoplanets have p values above 100 while ceres pluto and eris have p values of 0 1 or less objects with p values of 1 or more are also expected to be approximately spherical so that objects that fulfill orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill roundness requirement objects formerly considered planets table below lists solar system bodies once considered to be planets sun star classified as a classical

in 1930 until it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 beyond scientific community pluto still holds cultural significance for many in general public due to its historical classification as a planet from 1930 to 2006 mythology and naming thumb upright greek gods of olympus after whom solar system s roman names of planets are derived names for planets in western world are derived from naming practices of romans which ultimately derive from those of greeks and babylonians in ancient greece two great luminaries sun and moon were called helios and selene farthest planet saturn was called phainon shiner followed by phaethon jupiter bright red planet mars was known as pyroeis fiery brightest venus was known as phosphoros light bringer and fleeting final planet mercury was called stilbon greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods olympians helios and selene were names of both planets and gods phainon was sacred to cronus titan who fathered olympians phaethon was sacred to zeus cronus s son who deposed him as king pyroeis was given to ares son of zeus and god of war phosphoros was ruled by aphrodite goddess of love and hermes messenger of gods and god of learning and wit ruled over stilbon greek practice of grafting their gods names onto planets was almost certainly borrowed from babylonians babylonians named phosphoros after their goddess of love ishtar pyroeis after their god of war nergal stilbon after their god of wisdom nabu and phaethon after their chief god marduk there are too many between greek and babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately translation was not perfect for instance babylonian nergal was a god of war and thus greeks identified him with ares unlike ares nergal was also god of pestilence and underworld today most people in western world know planets by names derived from olympian pantheon of gods although modern greeks still use their ancient names for planets other european languages because of influence of roman empire and later catholic church use roman latin names rather than greek ones romans who like greeks were indo europeans shared with them a common pantheon under different names but lacked rich narrative traditions that greek poetic culture had given their gods during later period of roman republic roman writers borrowed much of greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon to point where they became virtually indistinguishable when romans studied greek astronomy they gave planets their own gods names mercurius for hermes venus aphrodite mars ares zeus and saturnus cronus when subsequent planets were discovered in 18th and 19th centuries naming practice was retained with neptunus poseidon uranus is unique in that it is named for a greek deity rather than his roman counterpart some romans following a belief possibly originating in mesopotamia but developed in hellenistic egypt believed that seven gods after whom planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on earth order of shifts went saturn jupiter mars sun venus mercury moon from farthest to closest planet therefore first day was started by saturn 1st hour second day by sun 25th hour followed by moon 49th hour mars mercury jupiter and venus because each day was named by god that started it this is also order of days of week in roman calendar after cycle was rejected and still preserved in many modern languages in english saturday sunday and monday are straightforward translations of these roman names other days were renamed after tiw tuesday woden wednesday thursday and friday anglo saxon gods considered similar or equivalent to mars mercury jupiter and venus respectively earth is only planet whose name in english is not derived from greco roman mythology because it was only generally accepted as a planet in 17th century there is no tradition of naming it after a god same is true in english at least of sun and moon though they are no longer generally considered planets name originates from 8th century anglo saxon word erda which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as name of sphere of earth perhaps around 1300 as with its equivalents in other germanic languages it derives ultimately from proto germanic word ground as can be seen in english earth german erde dutch and scandinavian many of romance languages retain old roman word terra or some variation of it that was used with meaning of dry land as opposed to sea non romance languages use their own native words greeks retain their original name ge ge non european cultures use other planetary naming systems india uses a system based on navagraha which incorporates seven traditional planets surya for sun chandra for moon budha for mercury for venus mangala for mars for jupiter and shani for saturn and ascending and descending lunar nodes rahu and ketu china and countries of eastern asia historically subject to chinese

reliable one from akkadian and saturn is zuhal zuhal formation left thumb upright 1 35 an artist s impression of protoplanetary disk it is not known with certainty how planets are formed prevailing theory is that they are formed during collapse of a nebula into a thin disk of gas and dust a protostar forms at core surrounded by a rotating protoplanetary disk through accretion a process of sticky collision dust particles in disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever larger bodies local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals form and these accelerate accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction these concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form protoplanets after a planet reaches a mass somewhat larger than mars mass it begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere greatly increasing capture rate of planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag depending on accretion history of solids and gas a giant planet an ice giant or a terrestrial planet may result thumb right upright 1 35 asteroid collision building planets artist concept when protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star surviving disk is removed from inside outward by photoevaporation solar wind poynting robertson drag and other effects thereafter there still may be many protoplanets orbiting star or each other but over time many will collide either to form a single larger planet or release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets protoplanets that have avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a process of gravitational capture or remain in belts of other objects to become either dwarf planets or small bodies energetic impacts of smaller planetesimals as well as radioactive decay will heat up growing planet causing it to at least partially melt interior of planet begins to differentiate by mass developing a denser core smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their atmospheres because of this accretion but lost gases can be replaced by outgassing from mantle and from subsequent impact of comets smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape mechanisms with discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other than sun it is becoming possible to elaborate revise or even replace this account level of metallicity an astronomical term describing abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2 helium is now thought to determine likelihood that a star will have planets hence it is thought that a metal rich population i star will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal poor population ii star solar system there are eight planets in solar system which are in increasing distance from sun mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus

first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main sequence star occurred on 6 october 1995 when michel mayor and didier queloz of university of geneva announced detection of an exoplanet around 51 pegasi from then until kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected catalog of kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets size of neptune and smaller down to smaller than mercury there are types of planets that do not exist in solar system super earths and mini neptunes which could be rocky like earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like neptune a radius of 1 75 times that of earth is a possible dividing line between two types of planet there are hot jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become planets which are leftover cores another possible type of planet is carbon planets which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in

sun like stars wasn t available so this statistic is an extrapolation from data about k type stars stars have an earth sized for purpose of this 1 in 5 statistic earth sized means 1 2 earth radii planet in purpose of this 1 in 5 statistic habitable zone means region with 0 25 to 4 times earth s stellar flux corresponding to 0 5 2 au for sun zone so nearest would be expected to be within 12 light years distance from earth frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of variables in drake equation which estimates number of intelligent communicating civilizations that exist in milky way there are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in solar system is to sun and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star mercury closest planet to sun at 0 4 au takes 88 days for an orbit but shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours e g kepler 70b kepler 11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than mercury s all of them much more massive than mercury neptune is 30 au from sun and takes 165 years to orbit but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of au from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit e g b planetary mass objects thumb right dwarf planet pluto thumb artist s impression of a super jupiter around brown dwarf a planetary mass object pmo planemo or planetary body is a celestial object with a mass that falls within range of definition of a planet massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium to be rounded under its own gravity but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star by definition all planets are planetary mass objects but purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet these include dwarf planets which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit larger moons and free floating which may have been ejected from a system rogue planets or formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion sometimes called sub brown dwarfs dwarf planets a dwarf planet is a planetary mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite it is in direct orbit of a star and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically shape usually a spheroid but has not cleared neighborhood of other material around its orbit alan stern who proposed term dwarf planet has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account geophysical planet definition and that dwarf planets are thus a subtype of planet however iau classifies dwarf planets as a separate category http www iau org static resolutions resolution 5 6 pdf iau 2006 general assembly international astronomical union retrieved january 26 2008 number of dwarf planets in solar system is unknown iau has recognized three ceres pluto and eris and assigned naming of two additional candidates haumea and makemake to iau dwarf planet naming committee rogue planets several computer simulations of stellar and planetary system formation have suggested that some objects of planetary mass would be ejected into interstellar space some scientists have argued that such objects found roaming in deep space should be classed as planets although others have suggested that they should be called low mass brown dwarfs sub brown dwarfs stars form via gravitational collapse of gas clouds but smaller objects can also form via cloud collapse planetary mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub brown dwarfs sub brown dwarfs may be free floating such as cha 110913 773444 and ots 44 or orbiting a larger object such as 2mass binary systems of sub brown dwarfs are theoretically possible was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 jupiter masses and a sub brown dwarf of 7 jupiter masses but further observations revised estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 jupiter masses making them brown dwarfs according to iau working definitions former stars in close binary star systems one of stars can lose mass to a heavier companion accretion powered may drive mass loss shrinking star can then become a planetary mass object an example is a jupiter mass object orbiting pulsar psr j1719 1438 these shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet satellite planets some large satellites moons are of similar size or larger than planet mercury e g jupiter s galilean moons and titan alan stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in definition of a planet and proposes term satellite planet for a planet sized satellite captured planets rogue planets in stellar clusters have similar velocities to stars and so can be recaptured they are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 au capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume and for a given cluster size it increases with host primary mass it is almost independent of planetary mass single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits non coplanar with each other or with stellar host spin or pre existing planetary system on origin of planets at very wide orbits from re capture of free floating planets b m b n 2012 attributes although each planet has unique physical characteristics a number of broad commonalities do exist among them some of these characteristics such as rings or natural satellites have only as yet been observed in planets in solar system whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets dynamic characteristics orbit thumb right upright 1 35 orbit of planet neptune compared to that of pluto note elongation of pluto s orbit in relation to neptune s eccentricity as well as its large angle to ecliptic inclination according to current definitions all planets must revolve around stars thus any potential rogue planets are excluded in solar system all planets orbit sun in same direction as sun rotates counter clockwise as seen from above sun s north pole at least one extrasolar planet wasp 17b has been found to orbit in opposite direction to its star s rotation period of one revolution of a planet s orbit is known as its sidereal period or year a planet s year depends on its distance from its star farther a planet is from its star not only longer distance it must travel but also slower its speed because it is less affected by its star s gravity no planet s orbit is perfectly circular and hence distance of each varies over course of its year closest approach to its star is called its periastron perihelion in solar system whereas its farthest separation from star is called its apastron aphelion as a planet approaches periastron its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy just as a falling object on earth accelerates as it falls as planet reaches apastron its speed decreases just as an object thrown upwards on earth slows down as it reaches apex of its trajectory each planet s orbit is delineated by a set of elements eccentricity of an orbit describes how elongated a planet s orbit is planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits planets in solar system have very low eccentricities and thus nearly circular orbits comets and kuiper belt objects as well as several extrasolar planets have very high eccentricities and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits thumb illustration of semi major axis semi major axis is distance from a planet to half way point along longest diameter of its elliptical orbit see image this distance is not same as its apastron because no planet s orbit has its star at its exact centre inclination of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies in solar system reference plane is plane of earth s orbit called ecliptic for extrasolar planets plane known as sky plane or plane of sky is plane perpendicular to observer s line of sight from earth eight planets of solar system all lie very close to ecliptic comets and kuiper belt objects like pluto are at far more extreme angles to it points at which a planet crosses above and below its reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes longitude of ascending node is angle between reference plane s 0 longitude and planet s ascending node argument of periapsis or perihelion in solar system is angle between a planet s ascending node and its closest approach to its star axial tilt thumb earth s axial tilt is about 23 4deg it oscillates between 22 1deg and 24 5deg on a 41 000 year cycle and is currently decreasing planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt they lie at an angle to plane of their stars equators this causes amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over course of its year when northern hemisphere points away from its star southern hemisphere points towards it and vice versa each planet therefore has seasons changes to climate over course of its year time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice each planet has two in course of its orbit when one hemisphere has its summer solstice when its day is longest other has its winter solstice when its day is shortest varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of planet jupiter s axial tilt is very small so its seasonal variation is minimal uranus on other hand has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around time of its solstices among extrasolar planets axial tilts are not known for certain though most hot jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars rotation planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres a planet s rotation period is known as a stellar day most of planets in solar system rotate in same direction as they orbit sun which is counter clockwise as seen from above sun s north pole exceptions being venus and uranus which rotate clockwise though uranus s extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is north and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti clockwise regardless of which convention is used uranus has a retrograde rotation relative to its orbit rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation a net angular momentum can be induced by individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects accretion of gas by giant planets can also contribute to angular momentum finally during last stages of planet building a stochastic process of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter spin axis of planet there is great variation in length of day between planets with venus taking 243 days to rotate and giant planets only a few hours rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known however for hot jupiters their proximity to their stars means that they are tidally locked i e their orbits are in sync with their rotations this means they always show one face to their stars with one side in perpetual day other in perpetual night orbital clearing defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has cleared its neighborhood a planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all planetesimals in its orbit in effect it orbits its star in isolation as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar sized objects this characteristic was mandated as part of iau s official definition of a planet in august 2006 this criterion excludes such planetary bodies as pluto eris and ceres from full fledged planethood making them instead dwarf planets although to date this criterion only applies to solar system a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs physical characteristics mass a planet s defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for force of its own gravity to dominate over electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium this effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal up to a certain mass an object can be irregular in shape but beyond that point which varies depending on chemical makeup of object gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until object collapses into a sphere mass is also prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from stars upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times jupiter s mass for objects with solar type isotopic abundance beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion other than sun no objects of such mass exist in solar system but there are exoplanets of this size 13 jupiter mass limit is not universally agreed upon and extrasolar planets encyclopaedia includes objects up to 20 jupiter masses how one astronomer became unofficial exoplanet record keeper www com and exoplanet data explorer up to 24 jupiter masses smallest known planet is psr b1257 12a one of first extrasolar planets discovered which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar its mass is roughly half that of planet mercury smallest known planet orbiting a main sequence star other than sun is kepler 37b with a mass and radius slightly higher than that of moon internal differentiation upright thumb illustration of interior of jupiter with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state in early formation denser heavier materials sank to centre leaving lighter materials near surface each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts but in giant planets mantle simply blends into upper cloud layers terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel and mantles of silicates jupiter and saturn are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen uranus and neptune which are smaller have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water ammonia methane and other ices fluid action within these planets cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field atmosphere thumb left earth s atmosphere all of solar system planets except d m d e morgan t h 1988 mercury atmosphere in mercury 19 91 university of arizona press pp 562 612 have substantial atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to surface larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of light gases hydrogen and helium whereas smaller planets lose these gases into space composition of earth s atmosphere is different from other planets because various life processes that have transpired on planet have introduced free molecular oxygen planetary atmospheres are affected by varying insolation or internal energy leading to formation of dynamic weather systems such as hurricanes on earth planet wide dust storms on mars a greater than earth sized anticyclone on jupiter called great red spot and holes in atmosphere on neptune at least one extrasolar planet hd 189733 b has been claimed to have such a weather system similar to great red spot but twice as large hot jupiters due to their extreme to their host stars have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation much like tails of comets these planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds although day and night sides of hd 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures indicating that that planet s atmosphere effectively redistributes star s energy around planet magnetosphere thumb earth s magnetosphere diagram one important characteristic of planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments which in turn give rise to magnetospheres presence of a magnetic field indicates that planet is still geologically alive in other words magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors which generate their magnetic fields these fields significantly change interaction of planet and solar wind a magnetized planet creates a cavity in solar wind around itself called magnetosphere which wind cannot penetrate magnetosphere can be much larger than planet itself in contrast non magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of ionosphere with solar wind which cannot effectively protect planet of eight planets in solar system only venus and mars lack such a magnetic field in addition moon of jupiter ganymede also has one of magnetized planets magnetic field of mercury is weakest and is barely able to deflect solar wind ganymede s magnetic field is several times larger and jupiter s is strongest in solar system so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons magnetic fields of other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of earth but their magnetic moments are significantly larger magnetic fields of uranus and neptune are strongly tilted relative rotational axis and displaced from centre of planet in 2004 a team of astronomers in hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around star hd which appeared to be creating a sunspot on surface of its parent star team hypothesized that planet s magnetosphere was transferring energy onto star s surface increasing its already high 7 760 degc temperature by an additional 400 degc secondary characteristics thumb upright rings of saturn several planets or dwarf planets in solar system such as neptune and pluto have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with smaller bodies this is also common in satellite systems all except mercury and venus have natural satellites often called moons earth has one mars has two and giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary type systems many moons of giant planets have features similar to those on terrestrial planets and dwarf planets and some have been studied as possible abodes of life especially europa four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size and complexity rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter but can host tiny moonlets whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure although origins of planetary rings is not precisely known they are believed to be result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet s roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces no secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets sub brown dwarf cha 110913 773444 which has been described as a rogue planet is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc and sub brown dwarf ots 44 was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 earth masses see also notes references external links international astronomical union website photojournal nasa
