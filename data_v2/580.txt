to its southeast was byzantine theme of dyrrhachium extending along southeast coast of adriatic sea duklja was an early medieval serbian principality whose borders coincided for most part with those of present day montenegro fine 1991 pp 202 3 state rose greatly in power after disintegration of serbia that followed death of its ruler prince caslav around 943 though extent of caslav s serbia is uncertain it is known that it included at least raska now part of central serbia and bosnia raska had subsequently come under duklja s political dominance along with neighboring serbian principalities of travunia and zachlumia in present day herzegovina and south dalmatia zivkovic 2006 pp 50 1991 pp 193 95 byzantines often referred to duklja as serbia ostrogorsky 1998 pp 293 298 around 1000 vladimir still a boy succeeded his father petrislav as ruler of duklja zivkovic 2006 pp 66 72 petrislav is regarded as earliest ruler of duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary sources which also indicate that he was in close relations with byzantium zivkovic 2009 pp 260 62 principality consisted of two provinces zenta in south and in north a local tradition has it that vladimir s court was situated on hillock called kraljic at village of near lake skadar in krajina region of southeastern montenegro milovic and mustafic 2001 p 54 near kraljic lie ruins of precista krajinska

once stood in krajina farlati 1817 p 13 col 2 vladimir s reign is recounted in chapter 36 of chronicle of priest of duklja completed between 1299 and 1301 chapters 34 and 35 deal with his father and uncles these three chapters of chronicle are most likely based on a lost biography of vladimir written in duklja sometime between 1075 and 1089 zivkovic 2009 pp 267 69 both chronicle and 11th century byzantine historian john skylitzes described vladimir as a wise pious just and peaceful ruler rudger 2010 para and cedrenus 1839 p 463 vladimir s reign coincided with a protracted war between byzantine emperor basil ii r 976 1025 and ruler of first bulgarian empire tsar samuel r 980 1014 basil ii might have sought support of other balkan rulers for his fight against samuel and he intensified diplomatic contacts with duklja for this purpose a serbian diplomatic mission most likely sent from duklja arrived in byzantine capital of constantinople in 992 and was recorded in a charter of great lavra monastery written in 993 ostrogorsky 1956 pp 273 75 in 1004 or 1005 emperor basil recovered from samuel city of dyrrhachium zivkovic 2002 pp 9 24 major stronghold on adriatic coast south of duklja since 1005 basil had also controlled coastal lands north and south of that city parts of byzantine theme of dyrrhachium stephenson 2005 pp 160 62 byzantium thus established a territorial contact with prince vladimir s duklja which was in turn connected to byzantine theme of dalmatia consisting of adriatic towns northwest of duklja republic of venice an ally of byzantium militarily intervened in dalmatia in 1000 to protect towns from attacks by croats and venetian rule over dalmatia on behalf of basil was confirmed by emperor in 1004 or 1005 svetoslav a venetian ally was crowned croatian king venice dalmatian towns croatia and vladimir s duklja were thus aligned in a compact pro byzantine bloc connected to byzantium via dyrrhachium close relations with byzantium however did not help prince vladimir samuel attacked duklja in 1009 or 1010 as part of his campaign aimed at breaking up that pro byzantine bloc which could have threatened him vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named close to southeastern tip of lake skadar according to chronicle of priest of duklja he performed a miracle there hill was infested with venomous snakes but when he offered up a prayer to lord their bites became harmless part of samuel s army lay siege to hill and remainder attacked nearby coastal town of ulcinj which was part of fortification system of theme of dyrrhachium vladimir eventually surrendered a decision chronicle attributed to his wish to deliver his people from famine and sword he was sent to a prison in samuel s capital of prespa located in western macedonia having failed to conquer ulcinj which received men and supplies by sea from dalmatian towns tsar directed his forces towards dalmatia there he burned towns of kotor and dubrovnik and ravaged region as far northwest as zadar he then returned to bulgaria via bosnia and raska a consequence of this campaign was bulgarian occupation of duklja travunia zachlumia bosnia and raska venetian and indirectly byzantine power in dalmatia was weakened samuel had succeeded in breaking up pro byzantine bloc chronicle states that while vladimir languished in prespa prison praying day and night an angel of lord appeared to him and foretold that he would shortly be freed but that he would die a martyr s death his fate in captivity was described in a romantic story involving him and theodora kosara tsar samuel s daughter this is chronicle s description of how they met rudger 2010 para 2 kosara then begged her father for vladimir s hand and tsar granted her request he restored his new son in law to throne of duklja jirecek 1911 pp 206 7 in reality marriage was probably a result of samuel s political assessment he may have decided that vladimir would be a more loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter resolving thus question of duklja samuel could concentrate more troops in macedonia and thessaly main site of his conflict with byzantium chronicle claims that tsar also gave vladimir whole territory of dyrrachium prince could in fact have been given a northern part of that territory which was partially under samuel s rule a brief note on vladimir by john skylitzes may indicate that prince also received some territory in raska his paternal uncle dragimir ruler of travunia and zachlumia who had retreated before samuel s army was given back his lands to rule also as tsar s vassal thereafter as recorded in chronicle vladimir lived with his wife in all sanctity and chastity worshipping god and serving him night and day and he ruled people entrusted to him in a and just manner rudger 2010 para 3 there are no indications that vladimir took any part in his father in law s war efforts warfare culminated in samuel s disastrous defeat by byzantines in 1014 and on 6 october that same year tsar died of a heart attack fine 1991 pp 198 99 he was succeeded by his son gavril radomir whose reign was short his cousin ivan vladislav killed him in 1015 and ruled in his stead vladislav sent messengers to vladimir demanding his attendance at court in prespa but kosara advised him not to go and went there herself instead vladislav received her with honor and urged vladimir to come as well sending him a golden cross as a token of safe conduct chronicle relates prince s reply two bishops and a hermit came to vladimir gave him a wooden cross and confirmed that tsar had made a pledge of faith on it vladimir kissed cross and clutched it to his chest collected a few followers and set off for prespa as he arrived on 22 may 1016 he went into a church to pray when he exited church he was struck down by vladislav s soldiers and beheaded rudger 2010 para 4 according to skylitzes vladimir believed vladislav s pledge told to him by bulgarian archbishop david he then allowed himself to fall into vladislav s hands and was executed motivation behind murder is unclear since samuel s defeat in 1014 bulgarians had been losing battle after battle and vladislav probably suspected or was informed that vladimir planned to restore duklja s alliance with byzantium this alliance would be particularly disturbing for tsar vladislav because of proximity of duklja to dyrrhachium which was a target of tsar s war efforts in early 1018 vladislav led an unsuccessful attack against dyrrhachium outside whose walls he found his death chronicle asserts that vladimir appeared before vladislav when he dined in his camp outside dyrrhachium and slew him while he cried for help rudger 2010 para 5 in same year byzantine army led by victorious emperor basil terminated first bulgarian empire as vladimir and kosara had no children his successor was his uncle dragimir ruler of travunia and zachlumia accompanied by soldiers he set off for duklja to establish himself as its ruler probably in first half of 1018 when he came to kotor town s inhabitants ambushed and killed him after inviting him to a banquet and his soldiers returned to travunia duklja was not mentioned again in sources until 1030s some scholars believe that it was placed under direct byzantine rule around 1018 while others believe it remained a byzantine

height within church novakovic 1893 pp 218 37 serbian scholar stojan novakovic theorized that vladimir was buried near elbasan immediately after his death novakovic conjectured that earthquake which ruined old church happened during thopia s rule and that thopia reinstated relics in rebuilt church if vladimir was previously buried in duklja novakovic reasoned he would not be absent as he was from serbian sources written during reign of nemanjic dynasty who ruled over duklja later named zeta from 1186 to 1371 novakovic did not consider idea that relics might have been removed from duklja to dyrrhachium in around 1215 he commented on chronicle s account that kosara transported vladimir s body to a place known as krajina where his court was while his court was possibly in region of krajina
