tom roald dahl starlog august 1991 retrieved 15 february 2011 as screenwriter of previous bond films richard maibaum was unavailable roald dahl a close friend of ian fleming was chosen to write adaptation despite having no prior experience writing a screenplay except for uncompleted bells of hell go ting a ling a ling dahl said that original novel was fleming s worst book with no plot in it which would even make a movie and compared it to a travelogue stating that he had to create a new plot though i could retain only four or five of original story s ideas on creating plot dahl said he did not know what hell bond was going to do despite having to deliver first draft in six weeks and decided to do a basic plot similar to dr no dahl was given a free rein on his script except for character of bond and girl formula involving three women for bond to seduce an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed and main bond girl while third involved a character from book kissy suzuki dahl had to create aki and helga brandt to fulfil rest gilbert was mostly collaborative with dahl s work as writer declared he not only helped in script conferences but had some good ideas and then left you alone and when you produced finished thing he shot it other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in and it s usually disastrous what i admired so much

typecasting in praise of george lazenby alternative 007 saltzman and broccoli were able to persuade connery by increasing his fee for film but geared up to look for a replacement jan werich was originally cast by producer harry saltzman to play blofeld upon his arrival at pinewood set both producer albert r broccoli and director lewis gilbert felt that he was a poor choice resembling a poor benevolent father christmas nonetheless in an attempt to make casting work gilbert continued filming after several days both gilbert and broccoli determined that werich was not menacing enough and recast blofeld with donald pleasence in role pleasence s ideas for blofeld s appearance included a hump a limp a beard and a lame hand before he settled on scar he found it uncomfortable though

exotic locales impressive special effects and a worthy central villain you only live twice overcomes a messy and implausible story to deliver another memorable early bond flick however most reviews pointed out various flaws in film james berardinelli said that first half was good but during second half as plot escalates beyond bounds of preposterousness that film starts to fragment criticising blofeld s appearance and stating rockets that swallow up spacecraft are a bit too extravagant roger ebert criticised focus on gadgets declaring that james bond formula fails to work its magic john brosnan in his book james bond in cinema compared film to an episode of thunderbirds with a reliance on gadgetry but admitted it had pace and spectacle christopher null considered film one of james bond s most memorable adventures but plot protracting and quite confusing ali barclay of bbc films panned dahl s script displaying a whole new world of villainy and technology leo goldsmith lauded volcano base as most impressive of ken adam s sets for franchise danny peary wrote that you only live twice should have been about twenty minutes shorter and described it as not a bad bond film but it doesn t compare to its predecessors formula had become a little stale danny peary guide for film fanatic simon schuster 1986 p 482 ign ranked you only live twice as fourth best bond film and entertainment weekly as second best considering that it pushes series to outer edge of coolness but norman wilner of msn chose it as fifth worst criticising plot action scenes and little screentime for blofeld literary critic paul simpson called film one of most colourful of series and credited prefecture of kagoshima for adding a good flavour of japanese influence on film but he panned depiction of blofeld as a let down small bald and a whooping scar simpson 71 simon winder said that film is perfect for parodies of series film is recognised by american film institute in these lists
