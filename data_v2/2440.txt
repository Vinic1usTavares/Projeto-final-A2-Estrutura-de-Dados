died of pneumonia early life rebmann was born to a swabian farmer and on january 16 1820 in wurttemberg village he lived in was very small with about 1 500 inhabitants even at an early age he aspired to be a preacher and canvasser of gospel later when rebmann became a young man he chose to devote himself to being a missionary and was trained in basel in 1844 he attended church missionary society college islington following year he was ordained as a priest by bishop of london and he became a member of church missionary society together with fellow missionary johann ludwig krapf rebmann traveled in 1846 by a ship called arrow to east africa where he worked in what is now kenya as well as at various other locations their work was hard and they had much trouble convincing tribal chiefs to let them speak to people krapf noted what he called surge of islam that was going through africa and wanted to make some sort of christian standing against its religious influence on people of continent as radius of two missionaries work expanded plans for christian missionary outposts in area began to develop during his time in africa rebmann kept a diary from 1848 until end of his life in diary rebmann writes of way his trust in his christianity kept him stable in continent of africa where only very few europeans had ventured before him an extract from diary which rebmann in turn took from bible psalm 51 12 reflects rebmann s belief in his faith restore to me joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me stumbling upon kilimanjaro and mt kenya right thumb kibo summit of kilimanjaro mountain on which rebmann saw snow in 1848 rebmann was first european to see mount kilimanjaro following year he saw mount kenya together with his colleague krapf on october 16 1847 two men set out for interior of kenya with them came eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named bwana kheri this expedition was designed with goal of establishing some of first mission posts in region journey was successful and group of tribesmen and missionaries returned to mombasa on october 27 sometime during their journey or their stay in region rebmann and krapf learned of a great mountain referred to as which reached clouds and which was capped in silver two men like most europeans at time were under impression that snow and ice could not exist so close to equator and failed to realize significance of mountain being topped with silver however two missionaries who had become just as much explorers as they were missionaries became quite interested in kilimanjaro and krapf sought permission of mombasa governor for an expedition to land of a people now known as who lived and live on actual slopes of kilimanjaro krapf told governor that this journey would be work based despite this krapf actually did not accompany rebmann on journey so only bwana kheri and rebmann left for kilimanjaro on april 27 1848 within two weeks rebmann and his guide were within sight of mountain he noted in his journal strange white on summit of kilimanjaro and he questioned his guide on what he thought it was according to rebmann s log guide did not know what it was but supposed it was coldness it was then that rebmann realised that kilimanjaro was in fact capped in snow in 1849 these observations were published but findings were not truly accepted by most of scientific community at time and even deemed as result of hallucinations induced by malaria on november 10 1848 rebmann recorded an entry in his log about mountain mt kenya was discovered by krapf in next year on december 3 1849 finding of this mountain was also met with disbelief in europe but effect of these discoveries was enough to trigger further investigation into other areas of africa thereby stimulating a growth of scientific among other fields knowledge of regions people history and geography of african continent other work in africa rebmann stayed in africa for almost thirty consecutive years he kept to a policy that in order to truly affect african people and to complete his task as a missionary much patience was needed it appears that this policy was driving force behind his many years of work on continent as well as visiting kilimanjaro rebmann and krapf visited other areas of africa including african great lakes and mount meru he even became married to a fellow missionary anna maria nee maisch with whom he spent fifteen years doing missionary work in africa before her death in 1866 and with whom he had a child who died only days after his birth also during his time in

of continent they traveled to several areas in regions of central and eastern africa including to what is now known as african great lakes finding of one especially large lake is depicted in a map known as slug map it was known by this name because layout of water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug basis for map was prepared by missionary jakob erhardt from reports of his companions krapf and rebmann and from verbal information that he had acquired from local people erhardt was struck by fact that travelers who had gone inland from different points on coast had all come to an inland sea in november 1854 while talking about problem to rebmann at one and same moment problem flashed on both of us solved by simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain land we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea on map that he and rebmann drew three lakes of victoria tanganyika and nyasa are shown as one very large l shaped lake on map several subtle but interesting things can be discovered including in northeast section of a reference to a stream flowing into lake victoria then known by missionaries as a note describes how waters of stream were very sweet but stained teeth a sickly yellow this note is probably first known text referring to drinking water found primarily around mount meru which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow brown stain to incisors which cannot be removed another piece of writing on slug map from where soda is bought provides evidence that trade in soda originating in lake obviously not known by that name then was already active at that time in 1855 erhardt was repatriated due to poor health and took his map with him it was first published in in 1855 and then in church missionary intelligencer in 1856 map is now in care of royal geographical society in london it is described by society as later life and death having almost lost his eyesight for unknown reasons rebmann went back to europe in september 1875 he returned to germany for first time in 29 years after being persuaded to do so by a fellow missionary who was working in area he then proceeded to take up residence in korntal near stuttgart where he was close to his old friend krapf in spring 1876 upon advice of krapf he married widow of another missionary from india louise rebmann
