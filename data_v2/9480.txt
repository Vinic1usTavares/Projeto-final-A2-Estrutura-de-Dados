tropical storm bavi known in philippines as tropical storm betty influenced trade winds over pacific ocean and was partially responsible for one of strongest trade wind reversals ever observed system was first noted as a tropical disturbance during march 8 while it was located to southeast of kwajalein atoll in marshall islands over next couple of days system moved north westwards through marshall islands before it was classified as a tropical depression during march 10 system subsequently moved north westwards and continued to develop further before it was classified as third tropical storm of 2015 pacific typhoon season and named bavi by japan meteorological agency jma during march 11 after continuing its north westwards movement system peaked as a tropical storm during march 14 before it started to weaken as it approached mariana islands system subsequently passed over guam during next day before continuing its west northwestwards movement as it gradually weakened over next few days system entered philippine area of responsibility where it was named betty by pagasa during march 17 as system weakened into a tropical depression system was subsequently last noted during march 21 as it dissipated over philippines bavi and its precursor tropical disturbance impacted eastern micronesia with strong to gale force winds of between reported on various atolls in marshall islands considerable damage was reported on islet of ebeye on main atoll of kwajalein a small amount of tree damage was reported while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use overall damages in marshall islands were estimated at us 2 1 million while a fishing vessel and its crew of nine were reported missing during march 12 after impacting eastern micronesia bavi approached mariana islands with its circulation passing over guam during march 15 where it caused highest waves to be recorded on island in a decade bavi also impacted northern mariana islands of rota tinian and saipan where power outages were reported and five houses were destroyed total property damages within mariana islands were estimated at around us 150 thousand meteorological history during opening days of march 2015 a major westerly wind burst occurred which subsequently contributed to development of 2014 16 el nino event and development of twin tropical cyclones in pacific ocean on both sides of equator first tropical cyclone became severe tropical cyclone pam within south pacific ocean and impacted various parts of melanesia including solomon islands and vanuatu second tropical cyclone was first noted by united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc as a tropical disturbance during march 8 while it was located about to southeast of kwajalein atoll in marshall islands disturbance consisted of a large area of atmospheric convection which was starting to wrap into system s developing low level circulation centre disturbance was also thought to be in a favourable environment for further development at this time with low vertical wind shear and a good outflow towards equator over next couple of days system moved north westwards through marshall islands and into a marginal environment for further development with moderate vertical wind shear being partially offset by system s outflow during march 10 japan meteorological agency subsequently started monitoring disturbance as a tropical depression while it was located about to northeast of bairiki in kiribati over next day system moved north westwards and gradually developed further before jma reported that system had developed into a tropical storm and named it bavi during march 11 later that day as system s low level circulation centre continued to consolidated and deep convection wrapped into it jtwc initiated advisories and designated system as 03w system subsequently continued to gradually intensify as it moved westwards around southern periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure located to northwest of system during march 14 system peaked as a tropical storm with jma reporting 10 minute sustained winds of 85 km h 50 mph while jtwc reported 1 minute sustained winds of 95 km h 60 mph by this time system was approaching mariana islands and had started to weaken with system s low level circulation becoming partially exposed and displaced from atmospheric convection as a result of this system s low level circulation passed over guam during march 15 while convection associated with system passed over northern mariana islands over next couple of days system moved westwards and continued to weaken before it weakened into a tropical depression during march 17 as it moved into philippine area of responsibility where it was named betty by pagasa jtwc stopped monitoring bavi during march 19 after system had weakened into a tropical disturbance however jma continued to monitor system as a tropical depression until it dissipated within philippines during march 21 preparations and impact thumb tropical storm bavi near mariana islands on march 15 tropical storm bavi impacted various atolls within micronesia while systems large wind field generated large waves which were problematic in marshall islands and mariana islands system also influenced pacific trade winds and with severe tropical cyclone pam caused one of strongest trade wind reversals that had been observed on record bavi and its precursor tropical disturbance impacted eastern micronesia between march 9 13 with gusty winds and high seas reported throughout marshall islands a pressure gradient between bavi and an area of high pressure generated strong to gale force winds of between on various atolls as a result various tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for parts of marshall islands including coral atolls of ujae and on 15 islands that make up atoll of ujae a significant period of strong winds were reported which lead to breadfruit trees being destroyed and several houses blown over across kwajalein atoll total damages amounted to over us 1 million with considerable damage reported on islet of ebeye on main island of kwajalein a small amount of tree damage was reported while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use at missile defense test range on island a 3 day rainfall total of was reported between march 9 11 on islet of ebeye located about to north of kwajalein high surf caused some coastal flooding while gale force winds damaged structures with tin roofs and plywood walls s large waves combined with high tide caused flooding on various islets of atoll of majuro within atoll a yacht struck a reef during march 10 while fishing vessel clearwater 2 and its crew of nine were reported missing during march 12 after they became overdue at their destination port a search and rescue mission was subsequently launched with various good samaritan vessels and two aircraft from united states coast guard and navy helping to look for vessel search effort subsequently found debris from ship in various locations along track taken by bavi including to east of majuro and southeast of kwajalein total damages to property within marshall islands were estimated at us 2 1 million while total crop damage was estimated at us 100 thousand after leaving eastern micronesia bavi continued to move westwards and threatened to impact mariana islands as a typhoon as a result guam weather forecast office issued a typhoon watch and a tropical storm warning for guam rota tinian and saipan during march 13 islands were also placed in tropical cyclone condition of readiness 1 by governors eddie calvo eloy and rear admiral bette bolivar guam waterworks authority advised residents on island stock up on water ahead of system in case bavi disrupted island s water service united airlines cape air and united express all cancelled flights that departed from guam while schools were shut on island during march 15 however as bavi approached islands upper level wind shear caused system to decouple and start to gradually weaken bavi s circulation subsequently passed over guam during march 15 with winds on island barely reaching gale force on island within guam sporadic power outages and minor tree damage were reported while waves on uninhabited northeastern coast of guam reached and were highest waves recorded on island in a decade a band of showers associated with system and a pressure gradient between bavi and an area of high pressure brought winds of up to to saipan and tinian as a result several trees and power lines were brought down across islands which resulted in saipan having sporadic power outages and temporarily losing all electric around 65 homes which were primarily constructed with wood and tin were affected by winds with 5 destroyed while a further 52 sustained some damage local red cross chapter subsequently provided tarpaulins cleaning materials and over 25 000 in assistance to 252 people
