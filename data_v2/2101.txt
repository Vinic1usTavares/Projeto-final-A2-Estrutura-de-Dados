diabetic ketoacidosis dka is a potentially life threatening complication of diabetes mellitus signs and symptoms may include vomiting abdominal pain deep gasping breathing increased urination weakness confusion and occasionally loss of consciousness a person s breath may develop a specific fruity smell onset of symptoms is usually rapid people without a previous diagnosis of diabetes may develop dka as first obvious symptom dka happens most often in those with type 1 diabetes but can also occur in those with other types of diabetes under certain circumstances triggers may include infection not taking insulin correctly stroke and certain medications such as steroids dka results from a shortage of insulin in response body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies dka is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar low blood ph and in either blood or urine primary treatment of dka is with intravenous fluids and insulin depending on severity insulin may be given intravenously or by injection under skin usually potassium is also needed to prevent development of low blood potassium throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection in those with severely low blood ph sodium bicarbonate may be given however its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended rates of dka vary around world in united kingdom about 4 of people with type 1 diabetes develop dka each year while in malaysia condition affects about 25 of type 1 a year dka was first described in 1886 and until introduction of insulin therapy in 1920s it was almost universally fatal risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is around 1 4 signs and symptoms symptoms of an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis usually evolve over a period of about 24 hours predominant symptoms are nausea and vomiting pronounced thirst excessive urine production and abdominal pain that may be severe in severe dka breathing becomes rapid and of a deep gasping character called kussmaul breathing abdomen may be tender to point that a serious abdominal condition may be suspected such as acute pancreatitis appendicitis or gastrointestinal perforation vomiting blood that resembles coffee grounds occurs in a minority of people and tends to originate from erosion of esophagus in severe dka there may be confusion or a marked decrease in alertness including coma on physical examination there is usually clinical evidence of dehydration such as a dry mouth and decreased skin turgor if dehydration is profound enough to cause a decrease in circulating blood volume a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure may be observed often a ketotic odor is present which is often described as fruity or like pear drops smell is due to presence of acetone if kussmaul respiration is present this is reflected in an increased respiratory rate small children with dka are relatively prone to brain swelling also called cerebral edema which may cause headache coma loss of pupillary light reflex and can progress to death it occurs in about 1 out of 100 children with dka and more rarely occurs in adults cause dka most frequently occurs in those who know they have diabetes but it may also be first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic there is often a particular underlying problem that has led to dka episode this may be illness pneumonia influenza gastroenteritis a urinary tract infection pregnancy inadequate insulin administration e g defective insulin pen device myocardial infarction heart attack stroke or use of cocaine young people with recurrent episodes of dka may have an underlying eating disorder or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain diabetic ketoacidosis may occur in those previously known to have diabetes mellitus type 2 or in those who on further investigations turn out to have features of type 2 diabetes e g obesity strong family history this is more common in african african american and hispanic people their condition is then labeled ketosis prone type 2 diabetes drugs in class sglt2 inhibitors which are generally used for type 2 diabetes have been associated with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where blood sugars may not be significantly elevated euglycemic dka while this is a relatively uncommon adverse event it is thought to be more common if someone receiving an sglt2 inhibitor who is also receiving insulin has reduced or missed insulin doses furthermore it can be triggered by severe acute illness dehydration extensive exercise surgery low carbohydrate diets or excessive alcohol intake sglt2 inhibitors may be used in people with type 1 diabetes but possibility of ketoacidosis requires specific risk management specifically they should not be used if someone is also using a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet mechanism diabetic ketoacidosis arises because of a lack of insulin in body lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by liver a process that is normally suppressed by insulin from glycogen via glycogenolysis and also through gluconeogenesis high glucose levels spill over into urine taking water and solutes such as sodium and potassium along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis this leads to polyuria dehydration and polydipsia absence of insulin also leads to release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue which are converted through a process called beta oxidation again in liver into ketone bodies acetoacetate and b hydroxybutyrate b hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in absence of insulin mediated glucose delivery and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation ketone bodies however have a low pka and therefore turn blood acidic metabolic acidosis body initially buffers change with bicarbonate buffering system but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for acidosis one such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower blood carbon dioxide levels a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis this hyperventilation in its extreme form may be observed as kussmaul respiration in various situations such as infection insulin demands rise but are not matched by failing pancreas blood sugars rise dehydration ensues and resistance to normal effects of insulin increases further by way of a vicious circle as a result of above mechanisms average adult with dka has a total body water shortage of about 6 liters or 100 ml kg in addition to substantial shortages in sodium potassium chloride phosphate magnesium and calcium glucose levels usually exceed 13 8 mmol l or 250 mg dl right thumb b hydroxybutyrate conjugate base of b acid drawn above despite chemically containing a carboxylate group instead of a ketone is principal ketone body in diabetic ketoacidosis dka is common in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by islets of in type 2 diabetes insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet body s requirements as a result of end organ insulin resistance usually these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis if dka occurs in someone with type 2 diabetes their condition is called ketosis prone type 2 diabetes exact mechanism for this phenomenon is unclear but there is evidence both of impaired insulin secretion and insulin action once condition has been treated insulin production resumes and often person may be able to resume diet or tablet treatment as normally recommended in type 2 diabetes clinical state of dka is associated in addition to above with release of various hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines latter of which leads to increased markers of inflammation even in absence of infection cerebral edema which is most dangerous dka complication is probably result of a number of factors some authorities suggest that it is result from fluid replacement but complication may develop before treatment has been commenced it is more likely in those with more severe dka and in first episode of dka likely factors in development of cerebral edema are dehydration acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels in addition increased level of inflammation and coagulation may together with these factors lead to decreased blood flow to parts of brain which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced swelling of brain tissue leads to raised intracranial pressure ultimately leading to death diagnosis investigations diabetic ketoacidosis may be diagnosed when combination of hyperglycemia high blood sugars ketones in blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated in about 10 of cases blood sugar is not significantly elevated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis a ph measurement is usually performed to detect acidosis either on blood from a vein or artery subsequent venous ph measurements to ensure treatment is effective may also be taken from a vein as there is little difference between arterial and venous ph ketones can be measured in urine acetoacetate and blood b hydroxybutyrate when compared with urine acetoacetate testing capillary blood b hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce need for admission shorten duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce costs of hospital care at very high levels capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise in addition to above blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine measures of kidney function which may be impaired in dka as a result of dehydration and electrolytes furthermore markers of infection complete blood count c reactive protein and acute pancreatitis amylase and lipase may be measured given need to exclude infection chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed if cerebral edema is suspected because of confusion recurrent vomiting or other symptoms computed tomography may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke criteria diabetic ketoacidosis is distinguished from other diabetic emergencies by presence of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine and marked metabolic acidosis hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state hhs sometimes labeled hyperosmolar non ketotic state or honk is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased plasma osmolarity above 320 mosm kg due to profound dehydration and concentration of blood mild acidosis and may occur in this state but not to extent observed in dka there is a degree of overlap between dka and hhs as in dka osmolarity may also be increased ketoacidosis is not always result of diabetes it may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation in both states glucose level is normal or low metabolic acidosis may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde american diabetes association categorizes dka in adults into one of three stages of severity mild blood ph mildly decreased to between 7 25 and 7 30 normal 7 35 7 45 serum bicarbonate decreased to 15 18 mmol l normal above 20 person is alert moderate ph 7 00 7 25 bicarbonate 10 15 mild drowsiness may be present severe ph below 7 00 bicarbonate below 10 stupor or coma may occur a 2004 statement by european society for paediatric endocrinology and lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society for children uses slightly different cutoffs where mild dka is defined by ph 7 20 7 30 bicarbonate 10 15 mmol l moderate dka by ph 7 1 7 2 bicarbonate 5 10 and severe dka by ph 7 1 bicarbonate below 5 prevention attacks of dka can be prevented in those known to have diabetes to an extent by adherence to sick day rules these are clear cut instructions to person on how to treat themselves when unwell instructions include advice on how much extra insulin to take when sugar levels appear uncontrolled an easily digestible diet rich in salt and carbohydrates means to suppress fever and treat infection and recommendations when to call for medical help people with diabetes can monitor their own ketone levels when unwell and seek help if they are elevated management main aims in treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis are replacing lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin admission to an intensive care unit icu or similar high dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary fluid replacement amount of fluid replaced depends on estimated degree of dehydration if dehydration is so severe as to cause shock severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to body s organs or a depressed level of consciousness rapid infusion of saline 1 liter for adults 10 ml kg in repeated doses for children is recommended to restore circulating volume slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if dehydration is moderate and again saline is recommended fluid very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration a special but unusual consideration is cardiogenic shock where blood pressure is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of heart to pump blood through blood vessels this situation requires icu admission monitoring of central venous pressure which requires insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein and administration of medication that increases heart pumping action and blood pressure insulin some guidelines recommend a bolus initial large dose of insulin of 0 1 unit of insulin per kilogram of body weight this can be administered immediately after potassium level is known to be higher than 3 3 mmol l if level is any lower administering insulin could lead to a dangerously low potassium level see below other guidelines recommend delaying initiation of insulin until fluids have been administered it is possible to use rapid acting insulin analogs injections under skin for mild or moderate cases in general insulin is given at 0 1 unit kg per hour to reduce blood sugars and suppress ketone production guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling some recommend reducing dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16 6 mmol l 300 mg dl but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin potassium potassium levels can fluctuate severely during treatment of dka because insulin decreases potassium levels in blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium potassium pump activity a large part of shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis hypokalemia low blood potassium concentration often follows treatment this increases risk of dangerous irregularities in heart rate therefore continuous observation of heart rate is recommended as well as repeated measurement of potassium levels and addition of potassium to intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5 3 mmol l if potassium levels fall below 3 3 mmol l insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of hypokalemia sodium bicarbonate administration of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve acid levels in blood is controversial there is little evidence that it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy and indeed some evidence that while it may improve acidity of blood it may actually worsen acidity inside body s cells and increase risk of certain complications its use is therefore discouraged although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis ph 6 9 and smaller amounts for severe acidosis ph 6 9 7 0 cerebral edema cerebral edema if associated with coma often necessitates admission to intensive care artificial ventilation and close observation administration of fluids is slowed ideal treatment of cerebral edema in dka is not established but intravenous mannitol and hypertonic saline 3 are used as in some other forms of cerebral edema in an attempt to reduce swelling resolution resolution of dka is defined as general improvement in symptoms such as ability to tolerate oral nutrition and fluids normalization of blood acidity ph 7 3 and absence of ketones in blood 1 mmol l or urine once this has been achieved insulin may be switched to usual subcutaneously administered regimen one hour after which intravenous administration can be discontinued in people with suspected ketosis prone type 2 diabetes determination of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cells may aid in decision whether to continue insulin administration long term if antibodies are detected or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes generally speaking routine measurement of c peptide as a measure of insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes epidemiology diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in 4 6 8 0 per 1000 people with diabetes annually rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4 in united kingdom developing dka a year while in malaysia condition affects about 25 a year in united states 135 000 hospital admissions occur annually as a result of dka at an estimated cost of 2 4 billion or a quarter to a half total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes there has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor such as an eating disorder and those who cannot afford insulin about 30 of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of dka lower socio economic status and higher area level deprivation are associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in people with diabetes mellitus type 1 previously considered universally fatal risk of death with adequate and timely treatment is around 1 4 up to 1 of children with dka develop a complication known as cerebral edema rates of cerebral edema in us children with dka has risen from 0 4 in 2002 to 0 7 in 2012 between 2 and 5 out of 10 children who develop brain swelling will die as a result history first full description of diabetic ketoacidosis is attributed to julius a german pathologist working in manchester united kingdom in his description which he gave in an 1886 lecture at royal college of physicians in london he drew on reports by adolph kussmaul as well as describing main ketones acetoacetate and b hydroxybutyrate and their chemical determination condition remained almost universally fatal until discovery of insulin in 1920s by 1930s mortality had fallen to 29 percent and by 1950s it had become less than 10 percent entity of cerebral edema due to dka was described in 1936 by a team of doctors from philadelphia numerous research studies since 1950s have focused on ideal treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis a significant proportion of these studies have been conducted at university of tennessee health science center and emory university school of medicine treatment options studied have included high or low dose intravenous subcutaneous or intramuscular e g alberti regime insulin phosphate supplementation need for a loading dose of insulin and appropriateness of using bicarbonate therapy in moderate dka various questions remain unanswered such as whether bicarbonate administration in severe dka makes any real difference to clinical course and whether an insulin loading dose is needed in adults entity of ketosis prone type 2 diabetes was first fully described in 1987 after several preceding case reports it was initially thought to be a form of maturity onset diabetes of young and went through several other descriptive names such as idiopathic type 1 diabetes flatbush diabetes atypical diabetes and type 1 5 diabetes before current terminology of ketosis prone type 2 diabetes was adopted references external links category diabetes category medical emergencies category rtt category rttneuro
