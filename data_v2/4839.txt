janjucetus is an extinct genus of cetacean and a basal baleen whale mysticeti from late oligocene around 25 million years ago mya off southeast australia containing one species j hunderi unlike modern mysticetes it possessed large teeth for gripping and shredding prey and lacked baleen and so was likely to have been a predator that captured large single prey animals rather than filter feeding however its teeth may have interlocked much like those of modern day filter feeding crabeater seal lobodon carcinophaga which would have allowed some filter feeding behavior its hunting behaviour was probably similar to modern day leopard seal hydrurga leptonyx probably eating large fish like baleen whales janjucetus could not echolocate however it did have unusually large eyes and so probably had an acute sense of vision only specimen was found on jan juc beach where remains of extinct whales mammalodon prosqualodon and waipatia have also been discovered discovery and naming thumb left restoration of janjucetus only known fossil of janjucetus was found in australia in late 1990s by a teenaged surfer named hunder near victorian township of jan juc in marine sediment that was deposited 27 23 9 million years ago mya in late oligocene name janjucetus hunderi honours both township and discoverer hunder is said to have seen brown fossils on a boulder while he surfed soon after discovering site hunder and his father removed boulder and transported it to monash university for further research well preserved fossil remains specimen nmv include a nearly complete skull mandibles vertebrae ribs scapulae and a radius and are held in museums victoria palaeontology collection in melbourne it was formally described by erich fitzgerald in 2006 and it represents most complete paleogene cetacean fossil from australia description thumb restoration of janjucetus janjucetus is estimated to have been about in length about size of modern bottlenose dolphin tursiops spp and much smaller than any living baleen whale snout was broad and triangular and was not flattened or elongated like those of modern baleen whales upper jaw maxilla made up around 79 of snout two halves of lower jaw were fused mandibular symphysis as opposed to flexible mandibular symphysis of modern baleen whales which allows them to significantly increase size of their mouth compared to archaeocetes primitive whales snout is wider which may have been a precursor to large mouths of modern baleen whales like other baleen whales janjucetus did not possess ability to echolocate however it may have had a large line of fat along its lower jaw similar to modern toothed whales odontoceti which would mean it could detect ultrasonic signals it had unusually large eyes for baleen whales compared to its body size which were positioned high up on skull likewise it probably relied on good eyesight instead of echolocation to navigate janjucetus did not have baleen and instead had large teeth incisors and canines formed a row of conical stabbing teeth while premolars and molars were shaped like serrated blades teeth were deeply rooted and cheek teeth had two roots perhaps adaptations for handling large prey teeth decreased in size towards back of mouth it had sizable muscles indicated by their location on top of head meaning it had a strong bite it had four or six incisor teeth two canine teeth eight premolars and four or six molars in upper jaw teeth had heavily ridged enamel and upper teeth were more widely spaced apart than lower teeth these teeth perhaps showcase how highly specialised janjucetus was to its niche or indicate that it was an evolutionary dead end given later proliferation of baleen bearing baleen whales classification janjucetus is considered to be a baleen whale mysticeti despite not having baleen due to key synapomorphies of skull anatomy for example in way nasal bones meet bones of braincase janjucetus is one of two genera along with extinct mammalodon which is also from southeastern australia in family mammalodontidae janjucetus was initially assigned to its own monotypic family janjucetidae but a subsequent cladistic analysis by fitzgerald in 2010 reassigned it to mammalodontidae making janjucetidae a junior synonym janjucetus is one of six toothed baleen whales of oligocene other being m m and palaeoecology thumb left comparison of teeth of dingo canis lupus dingo crabeater seal lobodon carcinophaga and janjucetus using three dimensional surface models unlike other baleen whales janjucetus did not use baleen to filter feed and instead used teeth to catch large prey such as fish and sharks its skull morphology seems to be convergent with modern day leopard seal hydrurga leptonyx and so it may have used a similar grip and tear feeding method however it is possible that front teeth interlocked and cheek sheared against each other when mouth was closed which perhaps allowed whale to filter feed similar to modern day crabeater seal lobodon carcinophaga this may have been a precursor to evolution of baleen and associated feeding habits head of janjucetus is similar to wide and blunt heads of modern day suction feeding toothed whales indicating it could suction feed palaeobiology jan juc beach where janjucetus was discovered also has yielded some fragmentary vertebrate species such as sharks rays and teleost fish a couple unidentified bird fossils have been found other than mammalodon other cetacean remains found there were those of prosqualodon and waipatia references external links national
