material and human resources to allied cause many belgians were involved in both armed and passive resistance to german forces although some chose to collaborate with german forces support from far right political factions and sections of belgian population allowed german army to recruit two divisions of waffen ss from belgium and also facilitated nazi persecution of belgian jews in which nearly 25 000 were killed most of country was liberated by allies between september and october 1944 though areas to far east of country remained occupied until early 1945 in total approximately 88 000

europe as part of what he termed an independent policy politique d independance to this end belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances leaving locarno treaty repudiating a defence pact with france signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from nazi germany in 1937 during this period belgian military was reorganized as an exclusively defensive force and began construction and modernization of fortifications around country particularly around liege near german border on declaration of war between united kingdom france and germany in september 1939 belgian

by french prime minister paul reynaud and by pierlot in a radio broadcast on 28 june 1940 where he declared leopold s decision to be an event without precedent in history king remained in belgium during war as a german prisoner while government went into exile and continued military action in allied cause unlike netherlands and luxembourg where monarchy was repressed or had joined government in exile leopold iii remained prominent in occupied territory and coins and stamps produced during occupation continued to carry his face or monogram nevertheless leopold remained a focus for resistance his position explained by slogan belgium is captive long live belgium king is captive long live king while imprisoned he sent a letter to adolf hitler in 1942 which has been credited with saving an estimated 500 000 belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in germany in november 1940 leopold visited hitler in berchtesgaden where he asked for belgian

belgians through taxes while also demanding external occupation costs or anti bolshevik charge to support operations elsewhere in total belgium was forced to pay nearly two thirds of its national income for these charges a figure equaling 5 7 billion reichsmarks as in all occupied countries in europe food fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by german authorities even with stringent rationing food and materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available a significant black market also existed in country supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it information and press were strictly controlled by german government and news was greatly restricted nevertheless sales of collaborationist newspapers like le soir

political organizations in both flemish and walloon communities before and during war most significant were devlag and vlaams vnv in flanders as well as catholic rex movement in wallonia each of these movements had subtly different ideologies their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers these organisations were also instrumental in encouraging belgians to enlist into german army unlike german style national socialist agenda of devlag vnv appealed directly to a flemish separatist agenda though this message was never main source of their popularity infighting between groups particularly vnv and devlag was considerable on whole belgian administrative system was very pliant and became an instrument of collaboration in a 2007 report by a belgian research institute a panel of historians concluded that belgium had offered maximum administrative collaboration with german occupation forces la belgique docile report quoted in same report also commented on apparently higher levels of collaboration in flanders as part of an attempted integration into a german flemish new order towns of brussels and liege report added remained generally patriotic belgian and decisively

members of belgian resistance with a canadian soldier during liberation of bruges 1944 resistance to german occupation came from all levels and regions of belgium and quarters of political spectrum but was highly fragmented and localised government in exile dealt only with sympathetic resistance groups like armee secrete however even these umbrella organisations had many different agendas or political ideologies some groups were very left wing like communist partisans armes but there were also right wing resistance movements like monarchist mouvement national and fascist legion belge created by members of pre war legion nationale movement there were also other groups like groupe g which had no obvious political affiliation resistance to occupiers chiefly came in form of helping allied airmen escape and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort for instance comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 allied servicemen to gibraltar comet line had a series of safe houses throughout belgium allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house staying with belgian families who supported resistance resistance would aid airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or allied occupied territory thumb left 210px bodies of belgian civilians killed by germans december 1944 as elsewhere sabotage was employed

resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of france resistance were instrumental in saving jews and roma from deportation to death camps for instance attack on twentieth convoy to auschwitz many belgians also hid jews and political dissidents during occupation with one estimate putting number at some 20 000 people hidden during war number provided by museum van en puts number at 20 000 jews including 3 000 children historian eva fogelman supplies a figure of 20 000 adults and 8 000 children in hiding there was also significant low level resistance for instance in june 1941 city council of brussels refused to distribute stars of david badges certain high profile members of belgian establishment including queen elizabeth and cardinal van roey archbishop of malines spoke out against german treatment of jews so far 1 612 belgians have been awarded distinction of righteous among nations by state of israel for risking their lives to save jews from persecution during occupation

focused in communities in towns of brussels and antwerp anti jewish legislation along lines of german nuremberg laws or french laws on status of jews was enacted in october 1940 a few months after german occupation several pogroms took place in 1941 notably in antwerp and economic assets belonging to jews were seized in may 1942 wearing of yellow star of david badge became compulsory for jews in belgium from june 1942 as part of final solution jews living in belgium were ordered to report to mechelen transit camp those who did not do so voluntarily were rounded up by police between august 1942 and july 1944 a total of twenty six railway convoys deported 25 000 jews and 350 roma from belgium to eastern europe most were sent to auschwitz death camp although others went to camps at bergen
