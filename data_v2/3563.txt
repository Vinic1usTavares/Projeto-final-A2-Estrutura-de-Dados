gilbert foliot c 1110 18 february 1187 was a medieval english monk and prelate successively abbot of gloucester bishop of hereford and bishop of london born to an ecclesiastical family he became a monk at cluny abbey in france at about age of twenty after holding two posts as prior in cluniac order he was appointed abbot of gloucester abbey in 1139 a promotion influenced by his kinsman miles of gloucester during his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for abbey and may have helped to fabricate some charters legal deeds attesting property ownership to gain advantage in a dispute with archbishops of york although foliot recognised stephen as king of england he may have also sympathised with empress matilda s claim to throne he joined matilda s supporters after her forces captured stephen and continued to write letters in support of matilda even after stephen s release foliot accompanied theobald of bec archbishop of canterbury to a papal council at reims in 1148 during his time there he was appointed to diocese of hereford by pope eugene iii despite a promise made in reims not to recognise stephen foliot on his return to england nevertheless swore fealty to king causing a temporary rift in his relationship with henry of anjou matilda s son who eventually became king henry ii of england in 1154 when theobald died in 1160 it was widely assumed that he would be replaced by foliot but king henry nominated his chancellor thomas becket instead foliot later claimed to have opposed this appointment and supported henry during king s dispute with new archbishop foliot was translated or moved to diocese of london in 1163 perhaps as consolation for not receiving canterbury during great dispute between becket and king foliot was reviled by becket and his supporters he acted as an envoy for king on a number of diplomatic missions related to this dispute and wrote a number of letters against becket which were circulated widely in europe becket excommunicated foliot on two occasions second of which precipitated archbishop s murder for a short period following becket s death papacy kept foliot excommunicate but he was quickly absolved and allowed to resume his episcopal functions in addition to his role in becket controversy foliot often served as a royal judge and was an active administrator and bishop in his different dioceses he was a prolific letter writer and some of his correspondence was collected after his death he also wrote sermons and biblical commentaries two of which are extant early life pope innocent ii left from a mosaic in rome thumb

huscroft ruling england pp 71 73 in about 1143 foliot wrote an account of proceedings of council in a letter to one of matilda s supporters no action was taken on her claim and no conclusion was reached as to its validity papacy continued to accept stephen as king and pope ordered english church to make no changes to status quo chibnall empress matilda pp 75 76 according to foliot s letter council s deliberations centred on legitimacy of marriage between matilda s parents matilda s mother edith matilda had been educated at a convent and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to henry i at time of council question caused some concern although in time most were persuaded that marriage was valid because anselm of canterbury had performed ceremony foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139 but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that matilda was indeed legitimate heiress and he supported angevin cause as matilda

called a council at westminster to gather support for her assuming throne foliot attended council and was one of her main supporters in following months as angevin cause tried to place her on throne chibnall empress matilda pp 97 99 it was during his time as abbot that foliot wrote his reply to brien fitzcount one of matilda s earliest supporters discussing second council of lateran s deliberations on matilda s cause fitzcount in a letter now lost had presented his reasons for supporting matilda and foliot s reply set forth a defence of matilda s claim to throne chibnall empress matilda pp 84 87 foliot also wrote that stephen had dishonoured episcopate with his behaviour in 1139 quoted in crouch reign of king stephen p 101 when king arrested roger of salisbury bishop of salisbury and roger s nephew alexander who was bishop of lincoln as well as attempting to arrest another of roger s nephews nigel bishop of ely after arrest stephen forced bishops to surrender their castles and secular government offices crouch reign of king stephen pp 93 101 most historians see foliot s letter as firmly supporting matilda s cause although one of king stephen s recent biographers donald matthew claims that foliot s support was lukewarm at best motivated by location of his abbey in one of matilda s strongholds matthew points out that gloucester abbey owed no military service in a feudal levy which allowed foliot to avoid choosing sides irrevocably matthew also points out that after 1141 foliot is a signatory to just one of matilda s charters matthew king stephen p 122 foliot did though address robert of gloucester s defence of matilda s rights buttressing it with arguments of his own robert had argued that bible supported female succession and quoted from numbers chapter 36 which allowed women to inherit but prohibited them marrying outside their tribe in his reply foliot claimed that robert had actually used numbers chapter 27 which had no restrictions on marriage of heiresses crouch reign of king stephen p 124 during his time as abbot foliot became friendly with aelred of rievaulx a writer and later saint knowles monastic order p 263 who dedicated a book of

theobald by forming a communication link to matilda s side foliot took an interest in dorset monastery of cerne abbey which in 1145 received prior of gloucester abbey bernard as abbot knowles et al heads of religious houses p 37 bernard was an active reformer and foliot supported bernard s efforts but monks objected to new abbot and drove him out of monastery matthew king stephen p 121 both abbot and monks appealed to papacy which supported abbot although matilda wrote to foliot and interceded on behalf of monks foliot pointed out that he was unable to disobey a papal command chibnall empress matilda pp 140 141 while abbot foliot supervised acquisition of a dependent priory in city of hereford for monastery most of abbey buildings predate foliot s time as abbot and there is no sure evidence of any buildings he added to monastery during his abbacy a dispute that had dragged on between gloucester and archdiocese of york over some manors was finally settled in gloucester s favour this was done with a group of forged charters that foliot may have helped to create forging charters was a common practice in english monasteries of time foliot also had disputes with welsh bishop

diocese of hereford which was held by angevin cause theobald was behind appointment having urged it on pope crouch reign of king stephen p 305 it appears likely that before his consecration foliot gave assurances that he would not swear fealty to stephen barlow english church p 100 he was consecrated bishop of hereford on 5 september et al handbook of british chronology p 250 at saint omer by archbishop theobald other english bishops present at reims hilary of chichester and josceline de bohon refused to help with consecration claiming it was contrary to custom for an english bishop to be consecrated outside england poole from domesday to magna carta p 192 another of bishops concerns was that pope had infringed stephen s right to a say in election matthew king stephen p 199 after his consecration foliot swore fealty to henry of anjou son of empress and new head of angevin party crouch reign of king stephen p 241 foliot switched his allegiance on his return to england and swore

homage to prince approved by papacy quoted in crouch reign of king stephen p 305 foliot also attempted to hold hereford in plurality or at same time with abbey of gloucester but monks of gloucester

reign foliot was active in judicial affairs including a case in 1150 involving sanctuary and his kinsman roger earl of hereford which ended up in court of archbishop theobald crouch reign of king stephen p 306 foliot s participation in legal affairs led him in 1153 to employ a clerk specialising in roman law crouch reign of king stephen p 307 after henry of anjou s accession to throne of england as henry ii in 1154 foliot persuaded earl of hereford to submit to new king s demand that he return custody of certain royal castles to king warren henry ii pp 59 60 in summer of 1160 foliot wrote to pope alexander iii whom king had just recognised as pope instead of alexander s rival victor iv intimating that canonisation of king edward confessor which had been delayed by alexander s predecessor innocent ii might be warranted as a reward for henry s recognition of alexander kemp alexander iii and canonization of saints transactions of royal historical society p 17 art historian hans j boker claims that foliot began construction of bishop s chapel at hereford cathedral boker contends that architectural style of chapel which was destroyed in 1737 resembled that of german imperial chapels and was deliberately chosen by foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to king henry boker bishop s chapel of hereford cathedral gesta p 52 however most sources credit robert of hereford bishop from 1079 to 1095 as builder of chapel romanesque architecture romanesque pp 232 medieval england p 17 when theobald died in 1160 most observers believed that foliot was leading candidate to become archbishop of canterbury traditionally see of canterbury had been held by a monk at least since replacement of stigand by lanfranc in 1070 although foliot was a cluniac monk they were a subset of benedictine order and thus cathedral chapter at canterbury which was benedictine but not cluniac would have had no objections to him on that score foliot denied that he ever lobbied for office but

miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop barlow thomas becket p 71 soon after becket s consecration king wrote to pope asking for permission to make foliot royal confessor this may have been a conciliatory move to appease foliot after loss of canterbury or it may have been that king and new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and king wished foliot to be a counter weight to becket s influence knowles episcopal colleagues p 46 after becket s election as archbishop foliot was nominated to diocese of london to which he was translated on 6 march 1163 his nomination had been put forward by king who wrote to pope stating that foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor if he was in london rather than in hereford on welsh marches becket wrote to foliot urging him to accept translation his transfer was confirmed by pope alexander iii on 19 march 1163 and foliot was enthroned at london on 28 april 1163 greenway fasti ecclesiae

canterbury by reviving pope gregory i s old plan for an archbishopric at london barlow english church 1066 1154 p 36 foliot proposed either to have london raised to an archdiocese along with

all clergy must be tried in church courts even if crime was non ecclesiastical at council of westminster called by henry in october 1163 to deal with issue foliot at first sided with other bishops who supported becket s position and opposed king however after council was dismissed foliot became leader of those bishops who changed sides in support of king in december becket capitulated to king poole from domesday book to magna carta pp 203 205 in january 1164 king summoned a council at clarendon bishops were asked to approve constitutions of clarendon which proposed restrictions on powers of church and limits to papal authority in england becket s refusal led to great dispute between king and archbishop poole from domesday book to magna carta pp 205 207 into which foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn when becket appeared before court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him a studied insult to king warren henry ii pp 485 487 foliot told archbishop that if king were to brandish his sword as you now brandish yours what hope can there be of peace between you quoted in warren henry ii p 487 king refused to see becket and negotiations between two camps soon revealed that becket had ordered bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did becket also threatened to appeal case to papacy both of these actions by archbishop breached constitutions of clarendon during subsequent back and forth between bishops and king as well as bishops and archbishop foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade becket to modify his behaviour foliot replied that becket was always a fool and always will be quoted in poole from domesday to magna carta p 208 after bishops refused to pass judgment barons attempted to do so but becket refused to hear court and left council without king s permission warren henry ii p 487 soon afterward foliot along with hilary of

becket s exile king confiscated archbishop s estates and also confiscated benefices of clerks who had followed becket into exile foliot was made custodian of those benefices in diocese of canterbury becket blamed both foliot and roger of york for confiscations but evidence appears to show that confiscations were henry s decision and that foliot at least was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to king and most of revenues from benefices went to religious purposes barlow thomas becket pp 124 125 in early summer 1165 pope alexander iii wrote twice to foliot ordering him to intercede with king and protest royal injunction against appeals to papacy foliot replied that king respected pope heard his protests carefully and that archbishop had not been expelled but had left of his own accord foliot wrote that king had said becket was free to return at any time but would still have to answer to charges he had faced at northampton foliot then advised pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate barlow thomas becket pp 137 138 in 1166 foliot accused becket of simony or purchase of church offices basing this on alleged purchase becket had made of chancellorship although there is no evidence that becket bought office barlow thomas becket p 43 by 1166 king had made foliot head of english church in fact if not in law king and foliot got along well and it was probably foliot s influence that kept king from more violent measures against becket barlow thomas becket p 140 on 10 june 1166 becket excommunicated a number of his opponents some specifically by name as well as any who opposed his cause barlow thomas becket pp 147 148 henry s response was to order english bishops to appeal to pope which they did at a council that foliot organised and led in london on 24 june appeal was written by foliot and a separate letter from bishops also written by foliot was sent to archbishop bishops rested their case on fact that those excommunicated had not been warned or allowed to defend themselves they pointed out to pope that king had not escalated conflict and had behaved reasonably to last papal overtures in summer of 1165 barlow thomas becket pp 149 150 becket replied to these moves with a letter written to foliot that was full of resentment and reproaches foliot s reply in a letter that is usually titled nobis set forth his view of becket s abilities as archbishop as well as giving reasons why becket was wrong he then suggested that archbishop compromise and exercise some humility in order to reach his goals barlow thomas becket pp 153 155 by end of 1166 foliot managed to resign his custody of confiscated canterbury benefices something he had been attempting to do for some time thus removing one source of conflict between him and becket barlow thomas becket p 160 in november 1167 foliot was summoned to normandy then ruled by henry ii to meet with papal legates and king roger of york hilary of chichester and roger of worcester were also summoned to attend after some discussion and argument henry appears to have agreed that legates could judge both king s case against becket as well as bishops case henry also offered a compromise on subject of constitutions of clarendon that legates accepted however when legates met with becket on 18 november it quickly became apparent that becket would not accept negotiations with king nor accept legates as judges of either case against him as legates had no mandate to compel becket to accept them as judges negotiations came to an end with king and bishops still appealing to papacy barlow thomas becket pp 171 173 on 13 april 1169 becket excommunicated foliot along with hugh earl of norfolk josceline de bohun and seven royal officials becket did this even though none of them had been warned and despite fact that pope had asked that becket not make any such sentences until after a pending embassy to king henry had ended becket also warned a number of others that unless they made amends to him they too would be excommunicated on 29 may ascension day barlow thomas becket pp 183 185 in his excommunication becket called foliot that wolf in sheep s clothing quoted in barlow thomas becket p 185 although foliot tried to enlist help of his fellow bishops in an appeal they were less than helpful foliot then prepared to appeal his sentence to pope in person and travelled to normandy in late june or early july where he met king but proceeded no further towards rome as papacy was attempting once more to secure a negotiated settlement barlow thomas becket pp 186 189 in late august and early september serious but ultimately fruitless negotiations took place between king and archbishop barlow thomas becket pp 189 192 foliot then proceeded to rome but at milan he received word that his envoy at papal court had secured right for him to be absolved by archbishop of rouen foliot then returned to rouen where he was absolved on 5 april and reinstated in his see on 1 may only requirement of this absolution was that foliot accept a penance to be imposed by pope barlow thomas becket p 201 much of foliot s objections to becket s excommunication stemmed from lack of warning that foliot and others had received contrary to customary and normal procedures becket and his supporters pointed out that there were some situations in which it was possible to excommunicate without warning helmholz excommunication in twelfth century england journal of law and religion p 243 but foliot claimed that present situation was not one of them according to foliot becket s habit was to condemn first judge second quoted in helmholz excommunication in twelfth century england journal of law and religion p 243

monarchs warren henry ii p 502 although there is no definitive evidence that foliot assisted in coronation it appears likely that he did so barlow thomas becket p 206 coronation drove pope to allow becket to lay an interdict or decree prohibiting church rites on england as punishment and threat of an interdict forced henry to negotiate with becket in july 1170 becket and king came to terms on 22 july 1170 allowing archbishop to return to england which he did in early december however shortly before he landed in england he excommunicated roger of york josceline of salisbury and foliot one possible reason for excommunications was that three ecclesiastics had electors from various vacant bishoprics with them and were escorting those electors to king on continent in order to reward a number of royal clerks with long vacant bishoprics included among those royal clerks were some of becket s most bitter foes during his exile barlow thomas becket p 223 although becket offered to absolve josceline and foliot he argued that only pope could absolve roger as he was an archbishop roger persuaded other two to appeal to king then in normandy when they did so royal anger at timing of excommunications was such that it led to henry uttering question often attributed to him will no one rid me of turbulent priest warren henry ii pp 506 509 this inspired four knights to set off from king s court in normandy to canterbury where on 29 december 1170 they murdered becket after becket s death his sentences of excommunication were confirmed as well as suspensions from ecclesiastical office barlow thomas becket p 257 pope in his confirmation referred to roger of york foliot and josceline of salisbury as gilbertine trinity excommunication was absolved for foliot on 1 august 1171

act of penance on 12 july 1174 at canterbury when he publicly confessed his sins and then allowed each bishop present including foliot to give him five blows from a rod then each of 80 monks of

been to effect downfall of church and ourself quoted in warren henry ii p 512 after pope absolved foliot s excommunication in early 1170 becket exclaimed to a cardinal that satan is for destruction of church a modern biographer of becket historian frank barlow feels that one reason for becket s change in behaviour after his election as archbishop was due to his need to out bishop other bishops and prevent foliot from making any more jibes about his inadequacies as an ecclesiastic barlow thomas becket p 90 foliot was mainly a force for moderation in quarrel between king and archbishop urging restraint on becket and curbing king s attempts to impose constitutions more rigorously foliot s rhetoric against archbishop was pointed and effective foliot also developed novel legal filing of ad cautelam which was an appeal to papacy against any future action by archbishop although foliot s tactic of ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents papacy did not challenge technique during his time as bishop foliot served for many years as a papal judge delegate especially in his later years he was active in both of his dioceses in supporting his cathedral chapters and other religious houses of dioceses he kept in constant contact with his archdeacons and deans about administration of dioceses he also gathered about himself a group of clerks who compiled a collection of decretals known as belvoir collection this collection mainly relates to foliot s activities at london and probably dates to before 1175 duggan decretal collections history of medieval canon law pp 257 258 writings

song of songs and lord s prayer still survive commentary on song of songs was first printed in 1638 by patrick young and again in patrologia latina volume 202 sharpe handlist of latin writers pp 144 145 commentary on lord s prayer was first published by david bell in 1989 commentary on song of songs has been printed three times last in middle of 20th century about 60 of his acta or decisions as bishop of hereford still survive and from his time at london a further 150 or so are extant a contemporary peter prior of holy trinity priory in aldgate london heard foliot preach a sermon at a synod and praised sermon as adorned with flowers of words and sentences and supported by a copious array of authorities it ran backwards and forwards on its path from its starting point back to same starting point quoted in hunt english learning transactions of royal historical society pp 33 34 sermon so inspired peter that he wrote a work entitled which dealt with method of exegesis which was developing around this time hunt english learning transactions of royal historical society pp 33 34 all of foliot s surviving theological works are based on exegesis and may include nine sermons on subject of saints peter and paul which were dedicated to aelred of these sermons are dedicated to a gilbert bishop of london which could mean either foliot or an earlier bishop gilbert universalis however historian richard sharpe feels that fact that sermons are paired with a group of aelred s sermons dedicated to foliot makes their authorship by foliot slightly more likely sharpe handlist of latin writers p 919 these sermons survive in manuscript now in british library as royal 2 d xxxii but have not yet been printed a further group of sermons which were dedicated to haimo abbot of bordesley did not survive but is known from surviving dedication letter antiquarian john bale in 1550s listed six works of foliot known to him five of which were letters sixth work known to bale was commentary on song of songs which survived in a single manuscript now in bodleian library young also recorded a ecclesiae as being by foliot scholar john pits gave much same list in 1619 adding one work a vitas aliquot sanctorum angliae but this work never appears in a medieval book catalogue and has not survived under this name so it is unclear if foliot wrote such a work antiquary thomas tanner writing in early 18th century listed foliot as author of seven works given by bale and pits adding an eighth tractatus gilberti episcopi london super sunt citing john leland 16th century antiquary as his source this apparently is collection of nine sermons on saints peter and paul that has yet to be published and is still in manuscript at bodleian library leland also listed another work by foliot episcopi which he stated was held at forde abbey this work since lost might have been sermons mentioned above or could have been a known collection of homilies also lost it is also possible that another gilbert was author lastly walter map recorded that foliot had begun work on a old and new law shortly before his death bell commentary recherches de theologie ancienne et medievale pp 83 87 death and legacy foliot died on 18 february 1187 fryde et al handbook of british chronology p 258 medieval chronicler walter map praised him as a man most accomplished in three languages latin french and english and eloquent and clear in each of them bartlett england under norman and angevin kings pp 502 503 modern historian frank barlow says of him that it was probably because he was so self righteous that it could be suggested that his behaviour was sometimes devious he went blind some time during 1180s but continued to work on his biblical writings foliot sent his nephew richard foliot and another clerk of his household to bologna to study law in 1160s exemplifying growing emphasis laid on roman law among his countrymen bartlett england under norman and angevin kings p 509 another nephew was ralph foliot archdeacon of hereford and a royal justice during reign of richard i turner english judiciary p 91 during his time at both dioceses he did much to promote his relatives and all of archdeacons he appointed while at london were either nephews or other relatives a member of his household at hereford was scholar roger of hereford who dedicated his computus
