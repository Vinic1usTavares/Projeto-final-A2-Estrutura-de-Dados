wrote books on military history and was black rod in house of lords for 14 years in 1940 horrocks commanded a battalion during battle of france first time he served under bernard montgomery most prominent british commander of war montgomery later identified horrocks as one of his most able officers appointing him to corps commands in both north africa and europe in 1943 horrocks was seriously wounded and took more than a year to recover before returning to command a corps in europe it is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion warner horrocks p 77 his contemporary corps commanders in north africa oliver leese and miles dempsey went on to command at army level and above horrocks wound continued to impair his health and led to his early retirement from army after war since 1945 horrocks has been regarded by some as one of most successful british generals of war a man who really led a general who talked to everyone down to simplest private soldier and beau ideal of a corps commander general dwight d eisenhower supreme allied commander in western europe called him outstanding british general under montgomery warner horrocks p 72 early life and first world war brian gwynne horrocks was only son of colonel sir william horrocks a lancashire born doctor in royal army medical corps ramc and his wife minna horrocks who had all gaiety and charm of irish born in in british india on 7 september 1895 young brian after having had particularly happy memories of four years spent at gibraltar when my father was working on causes of malta fever returned to britain where he was educated at bow school durham later uppingham school rutland an english public school where i gravitated automatically into army class there was never any question of my entering a profession other than army of his childhood he claimed to have had an extremely happy childhood horrocks later wrote that as his life was devoted almost entirely to sport he had very little aptitude for hard work he entered royal military college sandhurst in october 1912 bottom but one warner horrocks pp 3 6 horrocks s time at sandhurst was by his own admission not very distinguished let me be quite honest about it i was idle careless about my turnout in army parlance scruffy and due to fact that i am inclined to roll when i walk very on parade his score was sixth lowest of 167 successful applicants for even after addition of 200 bonus points for an officer training corps otc certificate which not all other candidates had an unpromising student he might not have received a commission at all but for outbreak of first world war in august 1914 horrocks was commissioned as a second lieutenant into middlesex regiment a line infantry regiment of british army on 8 august 1914 horrocks in charge of a ninety five man draft of replacements joined 1st battalion of his regiment as part of british expeditionary force bef during bef s retreat following its baptism of fire at battle of mons by time he and his men had got to southampton his ninety five man draft had increased to ninety eight with three others in their keenness to get into war having sneaked in he described feeling at time this was i should think last time there was any romance attached to war it is impossible now after bitter experience of two world wars to recapture spirit of this country in august 1914 as i marched through those cheering crowds i felt like a king among men it was all going to be over by christmas and our one anxiety was whether we would get over there in time and all ranks felt same arriving in france horrocks was assigned to no 16 platoon of 1st battalion middlesex with captain edward stephen gibbons who was killed in 1918 as his company commander battalion was part of 19th independent brigade which was not assigned to a division horrocks wrote that his chief memory of those days and memory retained by all platoon commanders was of marching endless and exhausting marches i had never realised before that it was possible to go to sleep while legs continued automatically to function he found comfort in that priceless cockney sense of humour a small private soldier in rank in front of me looked up at his neighbour who was blessed with a long lugubrious face and said why don t you give your face a holiday chum try a smile he also came to greatly admire captain gibbons along with his platoon sergeant sergeant once while it was pouring with rain when officers of battalion were offered billets in a comfortable farmhouse while other ranks slept in a manure packed field recently departed by some cows captain gibbons was furious insisting that officers should share in misery of their subordinates my heart sank but i knew instinctively that he was right horrocks later wrote douglas delaney writes that willingness of soldiers to follow was constructed on gestures like this it is interesting how some events though seemingly insignificant in bigger scheme of things become embedded in memory making lifelong memories of themselves horrocks was not to last much longer in battle as on 21 october at battle of armentieres his platoon was surrounded and horrocks while defending town of against a german attack received a bullet wound through lower abdomen and upper thigh and was taken prisoner war for me was over and my active military career had stopped for four years incarcerated in a military hospital he was repeatedly interrogated by his german captors who believed that british were using expanding bullets in contravention of 1899 hague convention horrocks captors refused to change his clothes or sheets and denied him and a fellow officer basic amenities both had temporarily lost use of their legs and were forced to crawl to toilet which caused horrocks wounds to become infected conditions improved after his discharge and transfer to a prisoner of war camp on his way to camp horrocks befriended his german escort he attributed their rapport to mutual respect that front line troops share he was promoted to lieutenant on 18 december 1914 despite being in enemy hands and often tried to escape once coming within of dutch border before being recaptured he was eventually placed in a compound for russian officers in hope that language barrier would hinder his escape attempts horrocks used time to learn russian language years later working in house of commons he startled nikita khrushchev and nikolai bulganin by greeting them in their native tongue in latter part of war he was held in holzminden prisoner of war camp his resistance in captivity would earn him military cross mc awarded in 1920 and backdated to 5 may 1919 repatriated at end of war horrocks had difficulty adapting to a peacetime routine he went on sprees in london spending four years of accumulated back pay in six weeks between wars russia in 1919 horrocks was posted to russia as part of allied intervention in
