traitor named konrad kiefer gameplay features real time planetary and space exploration combat trading and interaction with various non player characters in eight solar systems containing twenty eight visitable planets development presented paragon with technical challenges because this game distributed on floppy disks for computers hosting as little as 512 kb ram simulates detailed game mechanics of traveller tabletop role playing games within a sizable game world to meet difficulties posed by these hardware limitations paragon chose to excise or simplify some elements familiar to players of earlier traveller games reception upon release of game was very mixed some reviewers rated it highly and praised its playability and depth of gameplay others reviewed game less favorably substantial criticism was directed towards its handling of ground combat computer gaming world listed it as fourth worst game of all time in its november 1996 issue a sequel megatraveller 2 quest for ancients was published in 1991 a second sequel was planned but never released gameplay before players may begin a new game a party of adventurers must be created a pre generated party is available for quick entry into game lennon 1990 p 36 but players may also create new party members character creation process begins with player being presented with basic character profiles possessing randomly generated attributes player has option to accept displayed character or re roll to generate a new profile with another set of attributes an accepted character is enrolled in a military career chosen by player from army navy marines scouts or merchants player guides character through consecutive four year terms to obtain training in various skills and earn service benefits such as retirement pay longer characters remain in service more skills and benefits they are able to acquire but they do so at risk of diminished attributes due to old age injury or even death when a character retires or musters out he or she is added to pool of available adventurers from which a party is chosen by player to begin game lennon 1990 pp 17 26 if a character is killed during course of game player may recruit a new party member in some planetary game begins in a city on planet efate here as on all explorable planets in this game player observes party and its surroundings from a directly overhead point of view and issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen lichtmann 1990 p 18 explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets including a store for purchasing or selling armor weapons and other items a library hospital police station and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non player characters are located lennon 1990 p 92 94 building types are color coded for easier player identification player directs party s movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non player characters using objects or firing a weapon combat takes place in real time and requires player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons reload or move to a better position lennon 1990 p 95 space travel forms an important aspect of gameplay when traveling within a single solar system ship and its surroundings are viewed from a third person perspective on an in system travel screen navigation takes place in real time as player maneuvers ship between explorable worlds visits a gas giant to refuel or engages in combat with other spaceships some solar systems contain more than one explorable planet but most such planets in game may be reached only after player s spaceship has been outfitted with a jump drive capable of interstellar travel and accompanying computer software to control it lennon 1990 pp 39 40 plot game takes place within fictional universe in which prior traveller releases are also set most significant power in this universe is human dominated imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems bordering regions controlled by imperium are other interstellar powers including zhodani consulate imperium and zhodani have a long history of tense relations and as game begins rumors of another frontier war are circulating against this backdrop a security agent working for sharushid a large corporation active throughout imperium discovers that a company sub sector chief named konrad kiefer is secretly aiding zhodani by smuggling arms across border into hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within imperium to be coordinated with a zhodani attack this security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on planet efate and entrusts them with evidence of kiefer s treachery lichtmann 1990 p 16 lennon 1990 pp 11 15 these adventurers are tasked with delivering evidence to a second sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping kiefer and his conspiracy against imperium player assumes control over party just after security agent entrusts it with evidence against kiefer game includes numerous subplots which largely serve as means for player to earn money for example player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon on behalf of a religious leader in exchange for a reward other methods to earn money include stripping corpses of slain opponents for marketable items killing wanted criminals to earn a reward and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo gameplay in early stages of game primarily involves activities of this nature so that player can accumulate enough money to outfit party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling party s spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining means to stop kiefer events in this game transpire just prior to fifth frontier war between imperium and zhodani which marks line of demarcation between earlier tabletop role playing products released by game designers workshop under name traveller and later products set after war released under name megatraveller this game is only megatraveller product authorized by game designers workshop where events occur prior to this conflict development marc miller an original creator of traveller wrote in a letter of introduction to this game i ve always said that traveller would make perfect computer game for same two reasons that it s a great role playing game rules and background background and its wealth of detail will naturally capture interest of players but it s simplicity of rules which makes computerization possible lennon 1990 pp 4 5 after paragon software acquired video game rights to traveller from game designers workshop miller contributed generous support and research material lennon 1990 p 101 to paragon s development efforts limited capacity of floppy disk media on which game was distributed and hardware limitations of computer systems at time of game s release forced paragon s developers to limit certain aspects of traveller universe and game mechanics starship design and alien character creation both of which are available in other products set in traveller universe were deliberately excluded from this game explorable planetary terrain was limited to a relatively small area both space and planetary exploration employ relatively generalized maps to simplify program and eliminate minor details space combat uses a simpler set of rules than those found in travellers original starship combat rule set lennon 1990 pp 99 100 in computer gaming world l s lichtmann wrote that development of some aspects of game was left incomplete he observed that some promotional screenshots do not resemble anything players encounter in actual game and that a pamphlet included in game box lists a large number of differences between what is written in manual and actual game mechanics lichtmann 1990 p 105 reception reactions to megatraveller 1 varied greatly some reviewers commended game s design playability and depth of gameplay arnie katz wrote in videogames computer entertainment that extensive character generation system eye catching graphics flexible quick play interface and majestic scope make megatraveller a necessary addition to any adventurer s computer library reviewer sandra foley wrote in amiga computing that its gameplay brilliantly balance s complexity and playability s gameplay is a miracle in that it actually feels like a rpg a triumph of intelligent game design she assigned game a rating of 95 writing for amiga power reviewer stuart campbell gave game a rating of 88 and stated that megatraveller 1 is involving playable superbly designed and one of most atmospheric games i ve played ever it balances realism with gameplay and is extremely user friendly computer gaming world took a more negative view of game in 1993 scorpia stated that it comes off rather poorly criticizing atrocious combat system and economy she concluded that game is only for devoted megatraveller fan with a high tolerance for exasperation in 1996 magazine s editorial staff listed megatraveller 1 as fourth worst game of all time and easily mega worst role playing experience of all time they wrote that plot felt tossed off from rehashes of pen and paper modules that miller had designed in past amiga format also expressed disappointment with game s plot its reviewer wrote that player s effort is largely directed towards earning money and that main plot consists of about six conversations swapping a few items and blowing away kiefer konrad game s handling of ground combat received most substantial criticism computer gaming world s editorial staff wrote that game s real time combat system was handled so fast that players didn t have a chance in 90 of battles according to reviewer l s lichtmann many are disappointed because phased tactical system of traveller has been modified to have arcade game characteristics he also stated that player does not compete on a level playing field when he or she must issue commands in real time to individual party members engaged in combat while computer simultaneously controls multiple non player characters paragon responded to these criticisms by releasing an updated version of game which gave player ability to pause combat to issue orders to party members but even after this update some reviewers still found that whenever possible it is still far easier for party to flee from ground combat situations than to fight moreover immediately after player assumes control of party at start of game it is attacked by well armed opponents computer gaming world editorial staff criticized this design choice by stating that player would have to run away from first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 minutes to an hour generating a character another element of game mechanics which received significant criticism was game s handling of space flight paragon s attempt to simulate realistic space physics including planetary gravitational fields and spaceship inertia is a potential source of difficulty for some players according to paul presley asteroids inspired type of control method becomes very awkward until you get used to it and that could take some time graphics were another issue on which reviewers did not find consensus reviewer scott miller mentioned amazingly detailed ega graphics in game s ibm compatible release in a review published in compute l s lichtmann found this version s graphics to be merely adequate to task and reviewer chris jenkins stated that graphics are colourful but not overly imaginative sandra foley commended graphics of game s amiga release big colourful and easy on eye graphics are better than those of any previous computer rpg amiga formats reviewer wrote every time something moves on screen it jerks all moving graphics look small blocky and quite pathetic scrolling is scott miller stated that game s ibm compatible release supports both and speech thing which provide great sound effects to player with proper computer hardware reviews challenge 47 1990 versions criticism of game s handling of ground combat upon its initial release prompted paragon to issue an updated version 3 0 of game in late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system new version offered ability for player to pause repeatedly real time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire their weapons at a selected opponent this update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of game paragon implemented additional changes in preparation for game s publication in united kingdom by its european distributor empire software on basis of criticism generated upon game s initial release user interface was retooled to provide player with greater ability to control game with a mouse and realistic inertia based thrust model of spaceship flight was replaced legacy marc miller subsequently assumed a more direct role as a game designer with paragon software in its work on a sequel megatraveller 2 quest for ancients published in 1991 megatraveller 2 featured an updated user interface which incorporated some of enhancements paragon made in preparation for megatraveller 1s release in united kingdom in summer of 1992 microprose issued a newsletter promising release of a third installment in series to be published in fall of 1992 under its label advertisement claimed that megatraveller 3 unknown worlds would include three distinctly themed scenarios pursuit and rescue mysterious quest and classic science fiction it was also stated that this game would feature a new random world generator that guarantees no two universes are ever same however neither paragon software nor microprose released subsequent megatraveller games in november 1996 computer gaming worlds editors wrote that megatraveller 1s failure kept many other deserving paper rpgs from traveling to computer for nearly a decade notes references external links megatraveller 1 zhodani conspiracy at mobygames
