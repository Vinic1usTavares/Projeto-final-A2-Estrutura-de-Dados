working as a writer for television sitcom becker before writing pilot episode he studied american literature and cinema of 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on american culture during that period weiner sent script to sopranos creator david chase who recruited weiner to work with him on sopranos weiner shelved project for seven years to focus on chase s program interest for mad men did not surface until conclusion of sopranos final season according to nielsen media research episode attained a rating of 1 4 1 2 million households upon initial airing plot in 1960 in manhattan don draper jon hamm creative director for advertising agency sterling cooper is facing a professional dilemma how to sell cigarettes despite increased public awareness of their health risks he seeks input from customers and his girlfriend midge daniels rosemarie dewitt but is unable to find a solution he rejects academic research results provided by company s consulting psychologist that suggests some customers will be drawn to smoking despite health risks because of a collective death wish meanwhile peggy olson elisabeth moss starts work at sterling cooper as don s secretary where she experiences some sexual harassment she seems excited to be working in manhattan but perhaps overwhelmed by her new surroundings office manager joan holloway christina hendricks advises peggy on how to be appealing to men of office so as to achieve both success in her career and possibly an advantageous marriage junior account executive pete campbell vincent kartheiser makes boorish comments about peggy s appearance and clothing for which don rebukes him on her break peggy attends a doctor s appointment arranged by joan during which she undergoes a vaginal examination and is given a

rachel angry that men have not respected her plans for her business a later meeting with executives from lucky strike tobacco company also appears to go badly as don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising pete raises death wish idea put forth by company s research but executives reject this just when it seems that meeting is over don comes up with a new tagline it s toasted and a strategy that highlights their method of preparation which although it s no different from that of other cigarettes he proposes will make lucky strikes stand out in minds of public client is impressed but after meeting don expresses his fury with pete for having gone through his trash to steal research data don meets rachel for dinner to make amends for meeting during dinner don

conception creator matthew weiner conceived script for smoke gets in your eyes in 2000 while he was working as a writer for sitcom becker first draft of episode was written as a spec script and was titled division two years later weiner sent script to david chase creator of sopranos although weiner s agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans chase later recruited him upon first glance it was what you re always hoping to see he recalled it was lively and it had something new to say here was someone who had written a story about advertising in 1960s and was looking at recent american history through that prism weiner set pilot script aside for next seven years to focus on sopranos neither hbo nor showtime expressed interest in project until commencement of sopranos final season during that time amc began looking into television market for new programming network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series according to amc networks president ed carroll and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal prior to writing pilot episode weiner studied american culture during 1950s and 1960s analyzing literary works such as feminine mystique 1963 and sex and single girl 1962 while viewing such films as apartment 1960 and a guide for married man 1967 he continued his endeavors when series concept began to materialize as he received a copy of richard yates novel revolutionary road 1962 from executives of amc weiner discussed look of mad men with production designer bob shaw and cinematographer phil abraham whom weiner had previously collaborated with in sopranos abraham wanted to establish a more genuine approach to portraying society in 1960s rather than simply referencing period as seen in movies of that time we wanted to be more genuine than that movies were an influence in evoking historical accuracy of elements such as architecture and graphic design abraham sought inspiration from buildings designed by architecture firm skidmore owings and merrill he said we noticed that in all skidmore owings merrill designs of contemporary buildings ceiling overhead grid of lights was a strong graphic element in all office spaces in one design we loved whole ceiling was like a lightbox it was a time of high modernism and we embraced notion of presenting world in that way these were new work spaces sleek not stuffy casting thumb hamm pictured was chosen to portray don draper out of 80 other candidates jon hamm was cast as don draper central character of series hamm who was relatively unknown at time competed with 80 other actors in auditioning process weiner proclaimed that hamm accurately portrayed character saying that he was only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence both don and jon have an inner life so long as you have that kind of depth in a human being people will root for him jon walked out of room and i said that guy has lived hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed thomas jane would acquire role i started literally on very very bottom he iterated i couldn t have had less heat on me nobody knew who i was casting directors didn t know who i was i wasn t on anybody s lists funny thing was i think they went to thomas jane for it and they were told that thomas jane does not do television hamm went through seven auditions his last one took place at hotel gansevoort in meatpacking district of new york city when we were riding down on elevator woman in charge of whatever decision making process was told me you got job john slattery who was later cast as roger sterling originally auditioned to portray don draper slattery felt don was show s biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character s sparse screen time he recalled i really did prepare thing and went in and i worked hard on it and then read for don and they actually gave me adjustments and i went and i did it again and then they sort of said well look here s deal we have a guy reason we asked you to come in and read for draper is because we didn t think that you d come in a read for roger because there wasn t that much roger in script during production of smoke gets in your eyes slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on mad men i was on fence a little bit even while shooting it and i think matt finally was like look man we re not jerking you around here we re serious about this and i ve really thought this out i promise you this will be a great character and it will be a big part of show producers of mad men approached january jones to portray betty draper don s wife and mother of their two children jones avouched that portraying character would give audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature she initially auditioned for role of peggy olson which was later given to fellow cast member elisabeth moss it got down between elisabeth moss and myself and it was obviously more suited to her but matthew had said you know there s this other role of wife jones signed a seven year contract with show although her character originally had two lines in smoke gets in your eyes weiner eventually edited script to accommodate her desires it s such a testament to his ability jones stated he just took something out of thin air which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that wife was going to be part of show because i kind of took job with promise that betty would be a part of show when you sign a seven year contract you want to make sure you re in show christina hendricks was brought in to play joan holloway office manager and head of sterling cooper s secretarial pool while hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on er before being on mad men her acting career had been largely inactive and hendricks agent urged her not to participate in project they said to me amc doesn t have any other big shows why would you do this instead of taking something that s a better bet i said look i ve gone with one that s better bet in past let s go with really good script this time smoke gets in your eyes features guest appearances from several actors and actresses including rosemarie dewitt as midge and maggie siff as rachel menken dewitt was given a recurring role in season as don s mistress which lasted for six episodes she initially felt out of place while playing out her character dewitt stated they were at end of casting and hadn t found right midge yet originally they had a scene where she opens door wearing a red kimono and i remember thinking i m not that so i wasn t sure i was right for part maybe fact that i wasn t this vamp is what made matt weiner give me a shot prior to working on mad men siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts filming smoke gets in your eyes was budgeted at us 3 million slightly more than us 2 2 5 million budgeted in typical mad men episodes pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around new york city including silvercup studios where principal photography lasted for two days most of production crew were previously part of sopranos after filming concluded in new york production moved to los angeles center studios abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from one in new york according to abraham los angeles contained a continuity that was related to show once we moved to l a there was a continuity of style that came from alan and me and that was important to matt weiner in creating a practical effect a grid consisting of fluorescent lights was installed onto set that housed sterling cooper s main office show s art department bought several 2 by 2 four tube fixtures which was determined to be accurate relative to time period shipments arrived on first day of filming pilot however examination by set lighting crew revealed lightbulbs used were internally modernized having been designed to hold t 8 bulbs measuring two feet each getting more than 800 2 foot color corrected t 8 tubes became a major issue and none of regular suppliers had enough in stock recalled mike ambrose gaffer for production team in los angeles movietone stopped production of whatever bulbs it was making retooled plant and started manufacturing t 8s we needed last shipment arrived morning of our first day of shooting abraham created a light control system in an attempt to keep overhead from being unflattering however after unsuccessfully attempting to implement necessary wiring to control each light production team established controlling rows of light pat o mara key grip during production installed several and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets during a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light a panel or a frame was placed over fixture subsequently diffusing light onto their faces if somebody was walking through office in a wide shot i just turned overhead lights on but if don was talking to someone at his desk and office was backdrop i turned all lights on and then selectively removed some then i brought key around with kino flo image 80s through 4 by 8 frames of 250 or 216 or sourced my key with a larger fresnel through window set containing sterling cooper s corporate offices contained fitted with 5k bulbs onto centers which measured 8 inches apart ambrose collaborated with production team to institute twenty five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise with arri alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum i beams ambrose proclaimed that flexibility of trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on design of window he added we also had four and a few more t 12s on stands that could be rolled around office floor for tungsten close ups we often used six and three light units with chimeras soft cloth diaper baffles and 60 and 90 degree honeycomb grids for control in comparison ambrose used traditional lighting when creating housing for character as he favored color spectrum of a household lightbulb for example don s home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously we used a lot of batten strips with 100 watt household bulbs noted ambrose bulbs are so close they re almost touching so they create a single source that doesn t cast multiple shadows over time we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates we call them because guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in new york was named whitey i used them extensively on sopranos and felt they suited homes in mad men as well reception controversy in days leading to smoke gets in your eyes premiere watchdog group commercial alert filed a complaint against producers to distilled spirits council of united states commentators from group criticized distillery brand jack daniel s for its decision to sponsor mad men citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing as well depictions of irresponsible drinking overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images robert weissman director for commercial alert stated that based on amc s website it appears that sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of industry s self regulatory marketing code he continued there is no reason why a company should be able to escape normal enforcement and implementation of code simply because it chooses to violate code in such brazen manner that curing violation would cause non trivial complications for a major television series in association with complaint weissman urged in his letter that distilled spirits council of united states become more proactive in regulating distilleries initiatives in entertainment industry our complaint in this instance is not with portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption or even with glorification of such heavy consumption it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals quite different issues are raised where artists choose to depict such activities in absence of industry sponsorship ratings and critical response smoke gets in your eyes was originally broadcast on july 19 2007 in united states on amc upon airing episode acquired a 1 4 rating 1 2 million households according to nielsen media research total viewership was 75 percent higher than all television programming airing on thursdays on amc television commentators praised pilot episode heather havrilesky of salon declared that smoke gets in your eyes raised expectations for future competition at time and added that it emulated some of best episodes of sopranos chicago tribune journalist maureen ryan said that it was an intelligently made character drama in his four star review adam buckman of new york post described it as stunning and suggested that mad men just happens to be finest new tv series of summer and possibly entire year tim goodman of san francisco chronicle and brian lowry of variety lauded episode for its historical accuracy just because they re on cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around corner stated goodman that impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to series lowry addressed that despite subtle approach of mad men it managed to provoke a profound meaning in that context show illustrates that period s own form of excess without wagging fingers while reminding us that before sex drugs and rock n roll there was sexual harassment free flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads invariably sung by white guys usa today writer robert bianco echoed synonymous sentiment mad men is a joy to watch clothes clocks furniture it s like a mid century night s dream but this is no mere period piece it s a smart complex drama that attempts to get through facades that have always hidden truth troy patterson of slate drew comparisons to hbo comedy drama sex and city and affirmed that it introduced a lewd and cynical perspective of so called golden age of advertisement nancy franklin of new yorker concluded that smoke gets in your eyes was smart and tremendously attractive while seattle post intelligencer journalist melanie mcfarland felt that it was a rarity compared to other television installments writing for boston globe matthew gilbert remarked that setting and design were immediately distinguishable gilbert wrote this is a gorgeously fashioned period piece from its ibm typewriters and rotary phones to constant fog of cigarette smoke hanging over every scene show has a subtle color palette to match ivory metal venetian blinds at sterling cooper ad agency offices but it may sit in your memory as if it had been filmed in black and white citing its authenticity as an episode highlight randy cordova from arizona republic noted that smoke gets in your eyes was well constructed some critics were less enthusiastic than general consensus although new republic sacha zimmerman stated that episode s aesthetic features were comparable to cinematic works she affirmed that mad men lacked any substance ultimately criticizing cultural references and character development presented in episode mad men seems to be attempting satire without a plan zimmerman said mood is serious not campy and there aren t laugh out loud moments just a lot of at which point show simply becomes a reflection of its characters depressing it turns out that watching moody cruel men and unsatisfied put upon women for an hour just isn t that much fun similarly tim shale of washington post concluded that despite evocative nature of program smokes gets in your eyes fell flat people in and around them spoil show gum up works and shatter veracity to new york john leonard installment felt like a fifties leftover commentators praised performances of several cast members specifically hamm s portrayal of don draper goodman asserted that acting from cast members was one of aspects that carried show gilbert evaluated that hamm played his character to slick perfection accolades thumb right matthew weiner won
