for children by english romantic writers mary shelley and her husband percy bysshe shelley mary wrote blank verse drama and percy contributed two lyric poems composed in 1820 while shelleys were living in italy it is often considered a partner to shelleys play midas proserpine was first published in london periodical winter s wreath in 1832 whether drama was ever intended to be staged is a point of debate among scholars drama is based on ovid s tale of abduction of proserpine by pluto which itself was based on greek myth of demeter and persephone mary shelley s version focuses on female characters in a largely feminist retelling from ceres s point of view shelley emphasises separation of mother and daughter and strength offered by a community of women ceres represents life and love and pluto represents death and violence genres of text also reflect gender debates of time percy contributed in lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth century women s writing details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue proserpine is part of a female literary tradition which as feminist literary critic susan gubar describes it has used story of ceres and proserpine to re define to re affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself gubar 303 however play has been both neglected and marginalised by critics background thumb left alt first page of proserpine with title personages and beginning of play s text proserpine as it was first published in winter s wreath in 1832 in march 1818 shelleys moved to

florence later in 1819 pascoe 183 between 1818 and 1820 she absorbed a considerable amount of drama reading many of william shakespeare s plays some with percy percy believed that mary had a talent for dramatic writing and convinced her to study great english french latin and italian plays as well as dramatic theory he even sought her advice on his play cenci pascoe 183 84 and she transcribed manuscript of his drama prometheus unbound richardson 124 shelleys also attended operas ballets and plays percy also encouraged mary to translate vittorio alfieri s play 1785 a tragedy about father daughter incest which influenced her own novel mathilda purinton 389 mary shelley s studies were broad during these years she began to learn greek in 1820 and read widely she had also been reading ovid s metamorphoses since at least 1815 and continued to do so in 1820 morrison and stone ovid 316 her other reading included jean jacques rousseau s philosophical treatise emile 1762 and his

wollstonecraft mary shelley s mother seymour 242 that same year mary shelley wrote children s story maurice for laurette in 1824 mary shelley submitted proserpine for publication to browning box edited by bryan walter procter but it was rejected play was first published in 1832 in london periodical winter s wreath she cut one fifth of play about 120 lines for this version deleting some of stories from first act including percy s poem arethusa and rewrote individual lines pascoe 187 caretti 200 she included arethusa in her collection of posthumous poems of percy shelley in 1824 caretti

alt half length oval portrait of a man wearing a black jacket and a white shirt which is askew and open to his chest percy bysshe shelley wrote about proserpine in his poem prometheus unbound proserpine is a verse drama in blank verse by mary shelley which includes two lyric poems by percy shelley in early nineteenth century lyric poetry was associated with male poets and quotidian poetry i e poetry of everyday with female poets division of labour in proserpine reflects this trend richardson 125 percy s poems help emphasise mythic nature of proserpine s story he continued this transcendental description of proserpine in his prometheus unbound carlson 360 mary s drama consists of carefully described objects such as flowers furthermore her characters do not speak in soliloquy except in percy s poems rather nearly every speech is directed toward another character and is typically concerned with describing another s emotional state and or eliciting an emotional reaction richardson 125 26 dialogue in proserpine is founded on empathy not conflict more typical of drama richardson 126 mary shelley also refused to embrace visual sensationalism of early nineteenth century theatre focusing instead on scenes of heightened emotion pascoe 185 86 scholars have disputed whether or not mary shelley intended her play to be staged most concur that it was never meant for performance agreeing with romanticist alan richardson that play is lyrical drama or mental theater in style of romantic closet drama with its emphasis on character over plot on reaction over action and its turn away from theater richardson 125 see also carlson 362 however eighteenth century theatrical scholar judith pascoe challenges this conclusion pointing to detailed stage directions in manuscript ceres and her companions are ranged on one side in eager expectation from cave on other enter proserpine attended by various dark gloomy shapes bearing torches among which ascalaphus ceres persephone embrace her nymphs surround her qtd in pascoe 184 from this evidence she argues that shelley intended her play to be staged pascoe 184 literary scholar jeffrey cox has argued that proserpine along with midas prometheus unbound and other plays written by leigh hunt circle were not a rejection of stage but an attempt to remake it cox 246 turning from traditional genres of tragedy and comedy of manners these writers reinvented drama by writing masques and pastoral dramas he argues that midas and proserpine are a pair of mythological dramas that demonstrate forces of oppression cox 252 for him proserpine celebrates a pastoral world threatened by male sexual violence and tyranny of a sky god cox 253 themes thumb left alt half length portrait of a woman wearing a black dress sitting on a red sofa her dress is off shoulder exposing her shoulders brush strokes are broad mary shelley s version of proserpine myth is a feminist retelling gubar 303 305 mary shelley expanded and revised roman poet ovid s story of proserpine which is part of his larger metamorphoses tale is based on greek myth of demeter and persephone which explains change of seasons through persephone s visits to underworld when she is confined to hades s realm autumn and winter cover earth and when she returns to live with her mother spring and summer bloom myth depicts victory of male violence over female procreation smith 20 like percy shelley john keats and lord byron mary shelley was interested in rewriting classical myths however like other romantic women writers she was particularly interested in challenging their patriarchal themes richardson 127 in revising proserpine myth she placed women and their power at centre of narrative for example ovid represents proserpine as an child willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon while shelley portrays proserpine as a thoughtful empathetic adolescent who wants to find flowers for her mother ovid s version of myth focuses on violence particularly abduction and rape of proserpine while shelley s play focuses on suspenseful search for proserpine pascoe 186 caretti 202 her version highlights ceres and nymphs grief and proserpine s own desire to escape from underworld instead of rape rape happens offstage in contrast other nineteenth century adaptations often expanded rape scene romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship richardson 128 29 women and women s issues dominate mary shelley s drama no male characters appear with brief exception of ascalaphus carlson 355 however as romanticist marjean purinton argues there is a strong masculine presence in play even without male characters suggesting ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in domestic sphere purinton 394 although myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community these women are storytellers and who determine their own fate richardson 128 136 see also purinton 395 96 ceres s love a mother s love challenges power of gods caretti 204 shelley tells story almost entirely from ceres s point of view her play praises female creativity and fecundity as leaf and blade and bud and blossom shelley writes active rather than passive roles for proserpine and ceres for example it is ceres s anger not her grief that brings winter s blight gubar 306 richardson 129 however proserpine s abduction is prefigured in story of arethusa and as literary scholar julie carlson points out women can only join together after proserpine has been abducted carlson 356 in shelley s version of myth paradise is lost not through fault of women but through interference of men gubar 303 304 pluto s egotistical predatory violence is juxtaposed with ceres s loving kindness her willingness to sustain life and her unswerving devotion to her child gubar 304 sex in this myth is represented as a separation from feminine and a forced surrender to masculine gubar 305 pluto s domination of proserpine symbolises a culture based on acquisition and brutality a culture that covertly justifies when it does not overtly celebrate male mastery proserpine and midas are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays see for example purinton 395 proserpine is a play of female bonding while midas is a male dominated drama male poets participate in a contest in midas while in proserpine female characters participate in communal storytelling where midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at center of an all powerful court ceres laments leaving pastoral enclave she shares with proserpine for jove s court midas focuses on gold while women in proserpine enjoy flowers and where society of midas is marked by egotism greed and strife female society of proserpine values community gift giving and love legacy and reception as feminist literary critic susan gubar argues mary shelley s drama is part of a female literary tradition including elizabeth barrett browning h d toni morrison margaret atwood and doris lessing which has responded to story of ceres and proserpine these writers use myth as a way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood they use myth of demeter and persephone to re define to re affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself poets such as dorothy wellesley rachel taylor babette deutsch and helen wolfert as well as mary shelley portray procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge divisions between self and other that rest at centre of patriarchy feminist poet adrienne rich writes that loss of daughter to mother mother to daughter is essential female tragedy qtd in caretti 205 and it is this tragedy that mary shelley discusses in her play caretti 206 when a koszul first published a transcription of proserpine in 1922 he argued that little classical fancies which mrs shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works koszul introduction vii however his introduction to play speaks mostly of percy shelley and his contribution to mary shelley s works in fact as he explains he decided to publish to contribute to percy shelley centenary koszul introduction iii since their original publication neither midas nor proserpine has received much critical attention critics have either paid attention only to percy shelley s poems or have ignored plays altogether literary critic elizabeth nitchie writes that plays are distinguished only by lyrics that percy shelley wrote for them and sylvia norman contends that they do not really call for analytical and comparative study qtd in richardson 124 while frankenstein has remained a powerful cultural force since its publication mary shelley s other works have rarely been reprinted and scholars have focused almost exclusively on mary shelley author of frankenstein and mary shelley wife of percy bysshe shelley however with publication of works by mary poovey and anne k mellor in 1980s and other mary shelley in 1993 more attention has been paid to mary shelley s
