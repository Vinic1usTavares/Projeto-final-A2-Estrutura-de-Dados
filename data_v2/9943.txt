formed 2nd brigade 1st division battalion served during gallipoli campaign where it had distinction of having four of its members awarded victoria cross in 1916 it was transferred to europe fighting in trenches along western front for next two and a half years although disbanded in 1919 following end of hostilities it was re raised in 1921 in citizens force later known as militia as a part time infantry battalion based in victoria however due to lack of funding following great depression and a shortage of manpower following suspension of compulsory training scheme in 1929 battalion was amalgamated with 38th battalion as 7th 38th battalion although it was delinked again in 1936 when army was expanded due to rising tensions in europe during second world war 7th battalion served primarily in a garrison role firstly being used to defend australian mainland before deploying late in war to take part in bougainville campaign in 1944 1945 on bougainville as part of 23rd brigade they took part in fighting in central sector of island in last months of war following end of hostilities battalion was once again used in garrison role before being returned to australia and disbanding in early 1946 in 1948 battalion was re raised as an amalgamated unit with 8th battalion when citizens military force was reformed today it exists as 8th 7th battalion royal victoria regiment history first world war formation following outbreak of first world war australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service due to provisions of defence act 1903 which precluded sending militia outside of australian territory to fight while this force would draw from military forces that already existed part time citizens force and permanent military force it would be largely be made up from recruits not currently serving known as australian imperial force aif initially it was to consist of 20 000 men comprising one infantry division and a light horse brigade recruitment for first intake began on 10 august 1914 and 7th battalion was among first units raised forming less than a fortnight after declaration of war under command of lieutenant colonel harold elliot battalion was brigaded with 5th 6th and 8th battalions to form 2nd brigade under brigadier james whiteside mccay elliott took personal control over recruitment process selecting only those officers that he had known from his service in citizens forces as his company commanders who he in turn entrusted with choosing their own subordinates recruitment was conducted over a period of three weeks and by end of period process had been so successful that battalion was over establishment initially battalion was organised into eight companies designated a to h while recruitment and initial training was undertaken at broadmeadows however this was later reduced to new british standard four companies of double size designated a to d gallipoli in september battalion marched through city of melbourne and a fortnight later they embarked upon hmt bound for middle east they arrived in egypt on 2 december 1914 after which they undertook further training before being called to undertake defensive duties along suez canal following failed turkish first suez offensive in february 1915 however battalion did not take part in direct combat and during this time a number of its non commissioned officers were allowed to apply for commissions in british army units in early april battalion was moved to alexandria and from there on to lemnos island on morning of 25 april 1915 battalion took part in landing at anzac cove coming ashore as part of second wave over course of first week battalion was involved in establishing beachhead and suffered heavily losing five officers and 179 men killed or died of wounds this was higher than any other subsequent battle that battalion fought during war on 29 april 2nd brigade was relieved by 12th deal battalion and in early may battalion was able to reorganise itself after its baptism of fire respite did not last long however for only ten days after landing at anzac cove 2nd brigade was transferred to cape helles in order to take part in an attack on krithia on 8 may 1915 attack was a very costly failure with battalion losing a further six officers and 87 men killed nevertheless they were involved in what is believed to be first brigade level attack conducted by an australian force against an entrenched enemy and attack earned victorians many plaudits after attack battalion was given a weeks rest at cape helles where it received a number of reinforcements before being sent back to lodgement at anzac cove where a stalemate situation had developed in an effort to break this deadlock allies launched an offensive in august and battalion took part in battle of lone pine after taking over positions that had been captured by 1st brigade battalion defended trenches against repeated turkish counterattacks and in process four of its members performed acts of gallantry that later led to them receiving victoria cross vc nation s highest military decoration these men were corporal alexander stewart burton corporal william dunstan lieutenant william john symons and lieutenant frederick harold tubb sergeant ball and corporal h webb received distinguished conduct medal dcm according to ron austin during this fighting 7th battalion lost 87 men killed arthur dean and eric give total casualties as twelve out of fourteen officers and 680 other ranks despite battalion s success in holding trenches at lone pine august offensive failed to break deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate and for rest of campaign fighting was relatively static finally in december decision was made to evacuate allied force from peninsula during evacuation two of battalion s soldiers william scurry and alfred lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self firing rifle which assisted in making turks believe that there were still men manning trenches even as they were being evacuated western front after gallipoli 7th battalion was withdrawn to egypt where aif underwent a period of reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to europe 7th battalion was split to provide a cadre for 59th battalion which was being raised as part of doubling of australian forces in march 1916 they sailed to france where for next two and half years they would take part in fighting in trenches along western front upon arrival battalion was sent to somme where its first major action came in july during battle of pozieres throughout july and into august battalion was committed to fighting twice losing 55 men killed in first battle and another 83 in second in late august 7th battalion with a frontage equal to just over half its authorised strength was transferred to ypres in belgium where they manned trenches near ypres canal during this time they were not involved in any major attacks however each night they sent patrols out into no man s land and established listening posts to gather intelligence on 30 september 7th battalion along with its sister battalion 8th battalion mounted a raid on german line at hollebeke with a force roughly equivalent to two platoons raid was a great success with australians overwhelming defenders and capturing a section of german line and killing up to 13 germans before withdrawing in october battalion returned to somme where they spent winter months manning trenches and training in early 1917 precipitated by loss of high ground around pozieres germans withdrew back to hindenburg line in order to shorten their defensive line and to straighten a salient that had developed in february german withdrawal was discovered and allies finding an open battlefield for first time since 1914 and believing that german army was suffering from limited manpower began an advance to follow them up on night of 26 27 february 7th battalion launched what was meant to be a trench raid but turned into an open advance seeing them extend their lines by allied advance however was brief as germans had established themselves in strength and was halted before australians reached bullecourt in may battalion was withdrawn from front line for re organisation and training it did not return until third battle of ypres in september and october 1917 when they were committed to fighting first at menin road 7th battalion had 57 men killed in this phase and then later at broodseinde another 98 were killed following these battles 7th battalion was withdrawn from front line once more in december in march 1918 however following start of german spring offensive battalion was called back to help stem tide of german advance as german offensive ran out of momentum battalion kept up pressure on german line through a series of peaceful penetrations before subsequently taking part in allied hundred days offensive which was launched near amiens on 8 august 1918 as a part of this offensive battalion fought major actions at lihons on 9 11 august where they captured a number of german mortars and woods on 23 august they continued operations until late september 1918 when they were withdrawn with a strength of just 410 men and it was out of line when armistice came into effect in november shortly afterwards demobilisation process began and as battalion s numbers fell as men were repatriated back to australia it was amalgamated with 6th battalion this battalion was amalgamated with another formed from 5th and 8th battalions to form 2nd brigade battalion throughout their service during war battalion suffered 1 045 killed and 2 076 wounded members of battalion received following

during war inter war years in 1921 decision was made to perpetuate battle honours and traditions of aif battalions that had served during world war i by reorganising citizens force along aif lines with previously existing part time units adopting numerical designations of aif units that had been drawn from their traditional recruitment territories in may 1921 7th battalion was reformed in regional victoria around a headquarters in mildura with depots at wentworth and red cliffs at this time battalion drew its personnel from 2nd battalion 7th infantry regiment and 2nd battalion 21st infantry regiment through its link with these units battalion inherited battle honour of south africa 1899 102 in 1927 when territorial titles were introduced into militia battalion adopted title of mount alexander regiment it was also granted motto cede nullius at this time in 1929 however compulsory training scheme was suspended by newly elected scullin labor government in its place a voluntary system was established and citizens force renamed militia end of compulsory training coupled with low levels of defence spending and economic hardships brought about by great depression greatly reduced manpower available to many militia units at this time and as a result a number of units were disbanded or amalgamated at this time 7th battalion was also affected and on 1 july 1929 it was amalgamated with 38th battalion to form 7th 38th battalion two battalions remained linked until 9 november 1936 when following concerns about growing tensions in europe it was decided to them in order to double size of militia as prospect of another war became apparent in 1937 battalion s designation was changed to north murray borderers second world war following outbreak of second world war in september 1939 australian government once again decided to raise an all volunteer force for service overseas as legal restrictions on employing militia outside of australia still applied regardless a number of militia units attempted to join up en masse as already formed units and 7th battalion was one of these units however as they were required to remain in australia to provide home defence in case of war spreading to pacific this did not occur in october 1939 militia was mobilised in stages to undertake a short period of 30 days continuous training and this was undertaken again in 1940 but for a period of 90 days instead compulsory training scheme was also reintroduced and 7th battalion s ranks were filled out with national servicemen throughout 1940 and 1941 battalion undertook a number of training camps in victoria in december 1941 with japan s entry into war following attacks on malaya and pearl harbor battalion was mobilised for war service and tasked with defending dandenong area in 1942 however it received orders to move north to darwin where it carried out garrison duties to defend town and experienced a number air raids from japanese aircraft during this time also battalion was transferred to 23rd brigade originally 23rd brigade had been part of 8th division and made up of second australian imperial force 2nd aif battalions however after these units were captured or destroyed on rabaul ambon and timor it had been rebuilt using militia battalions and placed under command of brigadier arnold potts and assigned to 12th division they remained in darwin for 18 months before being relieved and sent back to melbourne in april 1943 after taking leave 7th battalion was sent to atherton tablelands in queensland for a period of intensive pre deployment training in november in 1944 23rd brigade had been attached to ii corps which was tasked with taking over from americans and launching a renewed offensive on bougainville 23rd brigade was given task of relieving garrisons in outer islands and 7th battalion was primarily responsible for mono island although one company was detached to munda arriving there in october 1944 tasked with defending airfield from a japanese attack that was at best remote some members of battalion sought to enliven their existence by acting as crews on us navy pt boats carrying out raids on new britain and new ireland in april 1945 after months of lobbying by potts who was keen to get back into action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during kokoda campaign 7th battalion was transferred to torokina on bougainville island where japanese garrison was still holding out in june they moved up numa numa trail to pearl ridge in central sector of island where they relieved 27th battalion almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with capture of several key positions including s hill base point 3 and and to establish a forward position in valley over course of next three months until end of war battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 japanese soldiers following end of hostilities battalion moved to island of to guard japanese prisoners of war as demobilisation process began members of battalion were slowly repatriated to australia while others were transferred to other units
