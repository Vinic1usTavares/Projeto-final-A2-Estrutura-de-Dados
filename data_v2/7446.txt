battle of bathys ryax was fought in 872 or 878 between byzantine empire and paulicians paulicians were a christian sect which persecuted by byzantine state had established a separate principality at tephrike on byzantium s eastern border and collaborated with muslim emirates of thughur abbasid caliphate s borderlands against empire battle was a decisive byzantine victory resulting in rout of paulician army and death of its leader chrysocheir this event destroyed power of paulician state and removed a major threat to byzantium heralding fall of tephrike itself and annexation of paulician principality shortly after background thumb 250px massacre of paulicians in 843 844 from madrid skylitzes paulicians were a christian sect whose precise origins and beliefs are somewhat obscure byzantine sources portray them as while armenian sources maintain that they were an sect paulicians were fiercely iconoclastic adhered to a very distinct christology and rejected authority and practices of official byzantine church following their own leaders consequently they were persecuted by byzantine state as early as 813 despite emperors official support for iconoclasm after definitive end of byzantine iconoclasm in 843 that persecution was intensified in an attempt unique in byzantine history to eradicate an entire heretical sect orders were sent out to kill anyone who would not recant according to chroniclers up to 100 000 paulicians were massacred while remnants fled from their strongholds in east central anatolia and found refuge among empire s muslim enemies arab emirates of thughur arab byzantine frontier zone along taurus antitaurus mountain ranges with support from emir of melitene umar al paulician leader karbeas founded a separate principality at tephrike and for next decades paulicians campaigned alongside arabs against byzantium chapter 1 arabs and paulicians suffered a critical blow in 863 with defeat and death of umar at battle of lalakaon and death of karbeas in same year but under their new leader chrysocheir paulicians resumed their raids deep into byzantine anatolia raiding as far as nicaea and sacking ephesus in 869 970 new byzantine emperor basil i macedonian sent an embassy for negotiations to tephrike after talks failed basil led a campaign against paulician state in spring of 871 but was defeated and only narrowly managed to escape himself battle thumb right 250px gold coin of emperor basil i victory of bathys ryax and subsequent dissolution of paulician state were among major triumphs of his reign encouraged by this success chrysocheir then staged another deep raid into anatolia reaching ancyra and ravaging southern galatia basil reacted by sending his relative domestic of schools christopher against them paulicians managed to avoid a clash and as campaigning season drew to a close they began retiring towards their own territory they encamped at modern in theme of charsianon with shadowing byzantine army making their camp at nearby siboron siboron modern to west from there paulicians marched northeast to pass of bathys ryax or deep stream modern pass west of sivas in turkey a location of strategic importance as indicated by fact that it served as a fortified assembly point for byzantine expeditions to east christopher sent strategoi of themes of and charsianon ahead with some four to five thousand men to make contact with paulician army shadow it as far as pass and report on its intentions i e whether it intended to double back westwards to resume raiding byzantine territory or whether it headed back to tephrike in which case they would have to rejoin domestic s forces when two generals with their men reached pass night had fallen and paulicians apparently unaware that they were being followed had made camp in valley of pass byzantines took up position in a wooded hill called that overlooked paulician encampment which further concealed them from their enemy at this point sources record that a dispute broke out between men of two thematic corps as to who was bravest two generals decided to take advantage of their troops high morale and impetuousness to attack despite their orders chapter 2 a picked detachment of 600 men from both divisions launched a surprise attack at dawn while rest of army remained behind and made loud clamour with trumpets and drums so as to suggest imminent arrival of entire byzantine field army under christopher ruse worked perfectly paulicians taken by surprise panicked and dispersed without offering any serious resistance paulician rout was completed as they fell upon main byzantine army while fleeing their remnants were pursued by victorious byzantines up to a distance of 50 km chrysocheir himself managed to escape with a small detachment of bodyguards but he was brought at bay at probably modern yildiz dagi in ensuing engagement he was wounded by a byzantine soldier who had been formerly a captive of paulicians and fell from his horse he was then captured and beheaded by advancing byzantines and his head was sent to emperor basil in constantinople aftermath defeat at bathys ryax signalled end of paulicians as a military power and a threat to byzantium basil followed this success by a series of campaigns in east against paulician strongholds and arab emirates tephrike itself was taken in 878 and razed to ground remaining paulicians were resettled in balkans while a large contingent was shipped off to southern italy to fight for empire under nikephoros phokas elder questions of chronology chronology and sequence of events regarding battle and fall of paulician state is unclear since byzantine sources are contradictory a number of scholars place battle in 872 others in 878 in both cases either before or after capture and razing of tephrike itself by byzantines thus alexander vasiliev proposed a first victorious battle for byzantines followed by sack of tephrike and final paulician defeat at bathys ryax all in 872 most recent historians place battle before sack of city but disagree in dates of two events some like nina garsoian or john haldon place both events in 878 french byzantinist paul lemerle followed by other scholars like mark whittow and warren treadgold placed battle in 872 and final subjugation of tephrike years later in 878 treadgold in 879 references sources bathys ryax
