captain fernao pires de andrade also spelled as fernao peres de andrade in contemporary sources perez de barros 3rd decada book ii died 1552 was a portuguese merchant pharmacist and official diplomat under explorer and portuguese malacca governor afonso de albuquerque his encounter with ming china in 1517 after initial contacts by jorge alvares and rafael perestrello in 1513 and 1516 respectively marked resumption of direct european commercial and diplomatic contact with china even though there were europeans in medieval china notably marco polo that period of contact had been interrupted by fall of yuan dynasty although de andrade s mission was initially a success that allowed a portuguese embassy to proceed all way to beijing relations were soon spoiled by culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of portuguese in china this included acts of his brother simao that enraged chinese false reports of portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped chinese children and true reports of their conquest of malacca a loyal ming tributary state normalized trade and relations between portugal and ming dynasty would not resume until late 1540s and 1557 establishment of portuguese rule over macau andrade was referred to as a folangji fo lang ji in ming dynastic archives folangji comes from or franks which was a generic name muslims called europeans since crusades and which spawned indian southeast asian term ferengi chinese adopted convention when they first thought portuguese were related to those muslim guides and interpreters during fernao s first encounter and before europeans directly convened with chinese voyages abroad india sumatra and malacca thumb right afonso de albuquerque who launched attack to conquer malacca sultanate and commissioned first direct european maritime contacts with china during ming dynasty fernao pires de andrade commanded a vessel in naval venture of portuguese explorer and conqueror afonso de albuquerque from cochin in india to conquer malacca sultanate in 1511 dion 135 portuguese historian joao de barros 1496 1570 wrote that when a violent storm arose as albuquerque s fleet entered vast waters between sri lanka and aceh a ship commanded by simao was sunk but his entire crew was rescued by fernao and taken aboard his ship to make up for this loss portuguese captured and commandeered five ships from gujarat that were sailing between malacca and sumatra small fleet of albuquerque engaged an enemy junk ship of malaccan moors near an island between and belawan dion 138 according to barros they fought against this ship for two days enemy crew employed tactics of lighting fire to its own ship as a means to burn albuquerque s ships as they employed ramming techniques and close range volleys of artillery dion 138 139 although ship surrendered portuguese gained such an admiration for junk and its crew that they nicknamed it o bravo brave junk dion 139 portuguese crew pleaded with fernao pires to convince albuquerque that crew should be spared and viewed vassals of portugal who were simply unaware of who they were actually fighting albuquerque eventually agreed to this while writing of afonso de albuquerque s ventures in sumatra joao de barros noted that chinese were first to control trade between sumatra and india and noted presence of chinese people living in sumatra dion 144 barros also noted that while fernao pires was loading southeast asian spices onto his ship in pacem a kingdom in sumatra in order to sell or present them as gifts in china two different kings were killed and their position usurped dion 146 apparently usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state as barros noted any leader there was believed by locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman historian mark dion notes that fernao related same story in his writing only adding that a muslim in their society was only acceptable replacement as ruler initial contact with china after conquest of malacca in 1511 not only did portuguese monopolize european spice trade but they also met and traded avidly with chinese merchants when portuguese under diogo lopes de sequeira had earlier arrived in malacca in 1509 to open trade relations he was supported by local chinese merchants there along with javanese and tamil merchants wolff 311 d albuquerque sent jorge alvares to explore northward his expedition sailed along coast of guangdong in 1513 and hoisted a flag on tuen mun island this mission was followed up later that year by rafael perestrello who later traded with chinese merchants of canton in 1516 he provided an enticing report to other portuguese on lucrative trade in china this prompted andrade to speed up course of his mission while stalled in malacca and debate with his crew on whether to go to china or bengal wills 336 dames 247 mission of manuel i to china choosing ambassadors thumb right 200px manuel i of portugal who commissioned andrade s mission to china king manuel i authorized a trade mission in 1517 when andrade set sail with 7 cannon armed merchant vessels with a muslim interpreter on june 17 1517 andrade had been chosen for this mission in lisbon back in 1515 so that as a pharmacist he could investigate types of pharmaceutical drugs used in east asia for benefit of portuguese and europe florentine merchant giovanni da empoli who had written a report about trade with china while stationed in india was also chosen for mission as chief commercial agent between portuguese and chinese however giovanni would die in china during early mission on october 15 1517 when ship he was on accidentally caught on fire dames 211 212 tome pires a royal apothecary who had also traveled to india and written a landmark work in 1515 on asian trade was chosen as chief ambassador for mission first contact although mission was stalled once they lost a ship in strait of malacca they nonetheless landed at pearl river estuary on august 15 with eight ships and negotiated with chinese officials for possible silk and porcelain trade at canton chinese naval commander of nantou under jurisdiction of zhongshan located at mouth of pearl river stalled andrade s small fleet of ships for an entire month while andrade waited for permission to sail upriver to canton wills 337 after andrade threatened to sail upriver without permission naval commander finally decided to let him pass granting him pilots to assist his travel once ships sailed into port at canton they alarmed chinese residents and officials there by discharging cannon fire what they believed was a friendly salute since chinese merchants had done so when portuguese earlier arrived in malacca chinese officials became even more cautious in dealing with portuguese since deposed king of malacca had been a loyal tributary to imperial ming court portuguese explained that in deposing malaccan king they were helping chinese merchants there who were being oppressed under his rule in eyes of canton officials this added further negative speculations about portuguese visitors because private chinese overseas trade was banned under current hai jin laws that stated only chinese government could conduct foreign trade thumb 300px ryukyu islands where jorge de mascarenhas was sent by andrade although local canton officials watched portuguese and their ships closely once provincial authorities arrived at canton they greeted portuguese with a warm reception providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore chinese became suspicious once again of andrade this time for being a spy when he sent a ship along fujian coast to look for further trade prospects but he left a good impression when he gave order that any locals who might be harmed by a portuguese should seek him for redress besides exploring fujian andrade sent one of his captains named jorge de mascarenhas to explore ryukyu islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in malacca nowell 8 andrade s brother and spoiled relations simao de andrade brother to fernao pires sailed from malacca to china with a small crew on three junks in august 1519 wills 337 338 simao immediately made a bad impression upon chinese when he built a fort at center of tuen mun an island designated for all foreigners to trade soon after simao ceremoniously executed a portuguese and barred other foreigners mostly siamese and other south east asians from trading on island which drew even more attention to him when a chinese official visited island and began reasserting ming authority over it simao became aggressive and hit him knocking official s hat off wills 338 greatest offense to chinese was supposed kidnapping of children by portuguese so they could eat them in reality simao had earned portuguese a bad reputation for buying young chinese slaves presumably some of whom were kidnapped after simao offered local chinese huge sums of money for child slaves in fact some boys and girls from wealthy chinese families were later found by portuguese authorities at diu in western india however there were no official reports of simao s abuses even though he stayed until september 1520 yet rumors of his behavior which became associated with all portuguese no doubt reached as far as court of beijing which would soon condemn portuguese for this and other reasons although he had left canton simao de andrade landed at xiamen and ningbo establishing settlements there douglas 11 simao continued to defy local chinese laws at ningbo and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a chinese man in 1545 simao sent a band of armed men into town pillaged it and took local women and young girls as their captives williams 76 outraged locals banded together and slaughtered portuguese under simao a similar episode occurred later when coelho de sousa seized house of a wealthy foreign resident in jinzhou of fujian which led authorities to cut off supplies to portuguese portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies which prompted chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to portuguese settlement at macau in 1549 douglas 11 12 end of mission thumb right zhengde emperor who accepted portuguese embassy but died before he could finalize relations with portugal hence dooming embassy as conservative factions at court in beijing were aligned against those who conquered ming s loyal tributary vassal in malacca embassy

may 1520 granting portuguese embassy a quick audience however further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once emperor returned to beijing hence portuguese embassy was sent there to wait for emperor s return although no chinese sources detail event portuguese sources tell of how portuguese were summoned on first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously prostrate themselves before a wall of forbidden city to seek another audience with emperor from beijing portuguese embassy heard reports that emperor reached tongzhou in january 1521 and had rebel prince of ning executed there portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from exiled king of malacca were sent to beijing seeking assistance from chinese emperor in expelling conquering portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there portuguese also knew of two officials in censorate qiu and he ao who sent memorials to throne that condemned portuguese conquest of malacca and that their embassy should be rejected wills 338 339 there were also reports sent to beijing by canton officials stating that portuguese were foreigners who sought to build their own trading post with death of zhengde emperor on april 19 1521 mourning ceremonies were initiated that cancelled all other ceremonies including reception of foreign embassies wills 339 newly appointed grand secretary yang tinghe soon turned against powerful eunuch influence at court which had grown even more powerful under zhengde emperor although ming officials were of opinion that only foreign tributary states listed during beginning of dynasty should be accepted at court it was eunuchs who wanted to expand commercial ties with new foreign countries these desires were given free rein under zhengde emperor who was intrigued with and desired to learn about foreign and exotic peoples however with his death eunuch influence at court was challenged by yang tinghe who announced rejection of portuguese embassy under pires and andrade day after emperor s death embassy was forced to leave and arrived back in canton in september open hostility to reopening of relations thumb right map of macau peninsula in 1639 long

begin trading but were ordered to leave once officials came to region to announce emperor s death portuguese refused this demand so chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out sinking one ship killing many and taking rest as prisoners first battle of tamao two more portuguese vessels arrived in june were attacked by chinese ships but were able to fend off chinese attack three more portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in september same month that fernao pires de andrade and tome pires arrived back at canton ming authorities would not permit fernao and pires to see prisoners captured in sea battles and made inventories of their goods and goods captured from portuguese ships in august 1522 martim afonso de melo coutinho arrived at tuen mun with three ships

conveying new ming emperor s message that portuguese should leave malacca and restore it to rightful rule of its deposed king by some accounts fernao pires de andrade simply died while imprisoned others say andrade was one of those beheaded when a crime of false credentials was placed upon him after a court examined if his embassy was legitimate or spurious due to negative accounts of portuguese i e acts committed by those such as fernao pires brother simao williams 76 77 douglas 10 11 tome pires died while living as a prisoner in china there is speculation on whether tome pires died in 1524 or 1540 madureira 150 151 two survivors of this embassy were still alive around 1536 when they sent letters to malacca and goa detailing plans for how portuguese could capture canton by force other survivors of these missions retired to nearby lampa in guangdong where a trade post would exist for several decades in 1537 there were written records of portuguese having three warehouses at lampa shangchuan island and macau and were initially allowed there with excuse of drying their goods in a storm despite initial hostilities good relations between portuguese and chinese would resume in 1549 with annual portuguese trade missions to shangchuan island following an event where portuguese helped ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates brook 124 wills 342 in 1554 leonel de
