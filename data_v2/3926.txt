positive reviews from critics ranging from largely positive to negative entertainment weekly gave episode an a calling it gorgeously shot citing lush smoky gaming sequences in particular television without pity ranked hell money eleventh most nightmare inducing episode of show noting if there s one thing you don t want to mess with it s chinese mafia especially branch that dresses up like slipknot and either a burns you alive if you re lucky or b forces you to participate in a haunted organ harvesting raffle only to slowly carve you up and sell your vital organs on black market whether you like it or not robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode four stars out of five and called it a hard episode to love but sincere and purposeful two praised conceit of episode arguing that by presenting situation from chinese immigrants members of an alien culture and chao s point of view mulder and scully seem clumsy and arrogant and by implication audience are made to feel just as arrogant shearman and pearson pp 74 75 other reviews were more mixed john keegan from critical myth gave episode 5 10 noting overall this episode attempted to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing agents to interact with an alien culture unfortunately structure of episode gave audience answers long before agents discovered them making bulk of episode an exercise by not taking theme far enough or deepening mystery writers ultimately fail to reach their goals reviewer emily vanderwerff from a v club gave entry a c and wrote that episode was also fairly bold for its time providing a whole subplot that s mostly told through subtitles but it feels like a series of shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup ultimately vanderwerff concluded that major problem with hell money is that it feels at times like a backdoor pilot for a new series starring b d wong as corrupt detective glen chao paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four she critiqued fact that episode lacked a paranormal mystery noting that theme of episode would fit nicely into any other police drama vitaris described three actors in black suits and ghost masks as not very convincing co producer paul rabwin was not a fan of hell money he believed that premise was not really an x file due to fact that nothing paranormal happened during episode he claimed that if mulder and scully were removed from story it would not have changed
