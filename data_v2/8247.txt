brody pitched a number of story ideas for third season of star trek original series he was unsure about how far these stories ideas were taken through production team and whether or not series creator gene roddenberry had ever seen them amongst ideas was plot that later became magicks of megas tu brody 2005 p 129 three years later in 1972 brody 2005 p 126 brody was invited by producer d c fontana to pitch ideas for an episode of star trek animated series when he arrived to pitch to fontana she instead ushered him into a room with roddenberry star trek creator was pleased with idea for magicks of megas tu saying that they had tried to do a magic based episode in second season of original series but he was unsatisfied with effects due to budgetary constraints at this point plot concerned crew of enterprise coming across god in space something which roddenberry had previously wanted to include in original series but it had been turned down by nbc primetime s executives he thought that such an idea might be palatable to daytime executives instead roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked brody to work up a full script brody returned home and started work on script immediately wanting to improve it far beyond point that he had developed when he pitched it for original series brody 2005 p 130 roddenberry took god idea to nbc executives who were concerned with blinding flash of light representing god they rejected inclusion of god and production crew realized that they needed to move episode in direction of magic rather than religion brody re wrote story to include devil instead of god script went through several re writes with fontana and brody meeting to discuss changes that roddenberry had requested brody later regretted not speaking to roddenberry directly as at times he didn t understand what changes he was being asked to make fontana was aware of controversial content of episode and later said that some people felt that magicks of megas tu dealt with devil sympathetically but believed that it was good following submission of script roddenberry re wrote dialogue to extent that brody didn t recognise any of it when he received final version however brody s name remained credited on it afterwards he was invited to attend cast recording session for episode where he met actors including shatner and nimoy
