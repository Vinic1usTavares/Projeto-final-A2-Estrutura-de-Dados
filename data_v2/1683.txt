achelousaurus or is a genus of centrosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during late cretaceous period of what is now north america about 74 2 million years ago first fossils of achelousaurus were collected in montana in 1987 by a team led by jack horner with more finds made in 1989 in 1994 achelousaurus horneri was described and named by scott d sampson generic name means achelous lizard in reference to a greek mythological figure and specific name refers to horner genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals ranging from juveniles to adults a large centrosaurine achelousaurus was about long with a weight of about as a ceratopsian it walked on all fours had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak it had a bony neck frill at rear of skull which sported a pair of long spikes which curved towards outside adult achelousaurus had rough bosses roundish protuberances above eyes and on snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in same positions these bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin but their exact shape in life is uncertain according to some scientists bosses were used in fights with animals butting each other s heads and for display within ceratopsia achelousaurus lies within clade pachyrostra or thick snouts it has been suggested that it was direct descendant of similar genus einiosaurus which has spikes but no bosses and direct ancestor of pachyrhinosaurus which has larger bosses first two genera would be transitional forms evolving through anagenesis from styracosaurus there has been debate about this theory with later discoveries showing that achelousaurus is closely related to pachyrhinosaurus in group pachyrhinosaurini achelousaurus is known from two medicine formation and lived in island continent of laramidia as a ceratopsian achelousaurus would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high metabolic rate though lower than that of modern mammals and birds history of discovery horner s expeditions to landslide butte thumb jack horner led team that discovered achelousaurus a horneri was named after him all known achelousaurus specimens were recovered from two medicine formation in glacier county montana during excavations conducted by museum of rockies which still houses specimens discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events in spring of 1985 paleontologist john jack r horner was informed that he would no longer be allowed to exploit willow creek site where he had studied maiasaura egg mountain nesting colony for six years having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site horner had always been intrigued by field diaries of charles whitney gilmore who had reported discovery of dinosaur eggs at landslide butte in 1928 but never published on them in this locality gilmore had employed george fryer sternberg to excavate skeletons of horned dinosaurs brachyceratops and styracosaurus ovatus that summer horner obtained permission of blackfeet indian tribal council to prospect for fossils on landslide butte which is part of blackfeet indian reservation it was first paleontological investigation there since 1920s in august 1985 horner s associate bob makela discovered a rich fossil site on land of farmer ricky reagan which was called dinosaur ridge quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs on 20 june 1986 horner and makela returned to blackfeet indian reservation and resumed work on dinosaur ridge quarry which proved to contain apart from eggs more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named einiosaurus in august 1986 at a nearby site canyon bone bed on land of gloria sundquist east of milk river horner s team discovered another einiosaurus bone bed part of discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull specimen mor 492 that later would be referred to i e formally assigned to rubeosaurus genus name in 2010 given to styracosaurus ovatus during field season of 1987 early july volunteer sidney m hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near canyon bone bed specimen mor 485 by end of august it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to museum of rockies in bozeman on 23 june 1988 another site was discovered in vicinity blacktail creek north in summer of 1989 graduate student scott d sampson joined team wanting to study function of frill display structures in horned dinosaurs at end of june 1989 horner his son jason and his head preparator carrie ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen mor 591 near blacktail creek interpretation of collected fossils thumb holotype skull mor 485 in front view it was initially assumed that all horned dinosaur material recovered by expeditions could be assigned to a single species distinct from styracosaurus albertensis as fossils represented a limited geological time period then estimated at about half a million years raymond robert rogers who was studying stratigraphy of bone beds referred to it as a styracosaurus sp of undetermined species in 1989 styracosaurus ovatus though sometimes considered an invalid nomen dubium had already been found in area by g f sternberg and was an obvious candidate but also possibility was taken into account that finds were of a species new to science this species was informally named styracosaurus in honor of bob makela who had died in a traffic accident just days before discovery of specimen mor 485 in 1990 this name as an invalid nomen nudum appeared in a photo caption in a book by stephen czerkas horner an expert on hadrosauridae family had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs in 1987 and 1989 horned dinosaur specialist peter dodson was invited to investigate new ceratopsian finds in 1990 fossil material was seen by dodson as strengthening case for validity of a separate styracosaurus ovatus to be distinguished from styracosaurus albertensis meanwhile horner had come to a more complex view of situation he still thought that fossil material had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa in 1992 horner david varricchio and mark goodwin published an article in nature based on six year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from montana they proposed that expeditions had uncovered three transitional taxa spanning gap between already known styracosaurus and pachyrhinosaurus for moment they declined to name these taxa oldest form was indicated as transitional taxon a mainly represented by skull mor 492 then came taxon b many skeletons of dinosaur ridge quarry and canyon bone bed youngest was taxon c represented by skull mor 485 and horned dinosaur fossils of blacktail creek sampson names achelousaurus thumb left achelous loses his horn to hercules on an attic krater sampson had continued his studies of material since 1989 in 1994 in a talk during annual meeting of society of vertebrate paleontology he named taxon c as a new genus and species achelousaurus horneri although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description it did not identify a holotype a name bearing specimen sampson s d 1994 two new horned dinosaurs ornithischia ceratopsidae from upper cretaceous two medicine formation montana usa journal of vertebrate paleontology 14 3 supplement 44a in 1995 in a subsequent article sampson indicated specimen mor 485 as holotype specimen of achelousaurus horneri generic name consists of words achelous name of a greek mythological figure and saurus which is latinized greek for lizard achelous is a greek river deity and a shapeshifter who was able to transform himself into anything during a fight with hercules mythical hero achelous took form of a bull but lost battle when one of his horns was removed this allusion is a reference to supposedly transitional traits of dinosaur and characteristic loss of horns through ontogenetic and phylogenetic development and thus through individual change and evolution dodson in 1996 praised generic name for being original and intelligent specific name honors jack horner for his research on dinosaurs of two medicine formation in montana sampson also named taxon b as genus einiosaurus in same article wherein achelousaurus was described he said paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation i e variation within a species might be mistaken for interspecific differences between species until 1995 only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since pachyrhinosaurus in 1950 namely in 1986 achelousaurus thus holds particular importance for being one of few ceratopsid genera named in late twentieth century holotype specimen mor 485 was collected by hostetter and ray rogers from landslide butte field area about northwest of cut bank in 1995 sampson described it as partial skull of an adult animal including nasal and supraorbital region above eye socket bosses roundish protuberances instead of horns and parietal bones additionally mor 485 preserves some bones of skull rear and sides which in 2009 were listed by tracy l ford as a right squamosal bone left squamosal both maxillae both lacrimal bones both quadrate bones both palatine bones braincase and basioccipital bone in 2015 leonardo reported that as part of same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as mor 485 7 12 87 4 a right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from same canyon bone bed site as mor 485 and catalogued under same number but only reported in 2010 two other specimens were collected on blacktail creek to south of cut bank and referred to achelousaurus by sampson in 1995 specimen mor 591 is a partial skull and an about 60 complete skeleton of a sub adult specimen that includes vertebral column pelvis sacrum and a femur it also includes lower jaws catalogued as mor 591 7 15 89 1 both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete lacking only braincase and occipital region mor 591 is smaller than holotype with a skull base length of about specimen mor 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult skull consists of only parietals and lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones and a fifth specimen is mor 456 1 a subadult none of specimens were of an advanced individual age according to andrew mcdonald and colleagues achelousaurus finds represented single individuals not bone beds possible achelousaurus finds thumb tmp 2002 76 1 which may be a specimen of achelousaurus pachyrhinosaurus or a new taxon in royal tyrrell museum in addition to fossils that have been unequivocally assigned to achelousaurus some other material has been found of which identity is uncertain a centrosaurine ceratopsid specimen with bosses from dinosaur park formation specimen tmp 2002 76 1 found in 1996 was suggested to belong to a new taxon in 2006 but may instead belong to achelousaurus or pachyrhinosaurus since it is missing parietal bones which are used to diagnose centrosaurines it is not possible to assign it to any genus with confidence in 2006 it was also proposed that monoclonius a dubious species based on a skull specimen cmn from dinosaur park formation could be a sub adult specimen of styracosaurus achelousaurus or einiosaurus with which it is roughly contemporaneous in addition some indeterminate specimens from two medicine formation such as fragmentary skull mor 464 or snout mor 449 may belong to achelousaurus or two other roughly contemporary ceratopsids einiosaurus and rubeosaurus description general build thumb left size compared to a human achelousaurus is estimated to have been long with a weight of skull of an adult individual holotype specimen mor 485 was estimated to have been long this puts it in same size range as other members of centrosaurinae subgroup of ceratopsians that lived during campanian age it was about as large as its close relative einiosaurus but with a much heavier build achelousaurus approached robustness of one of largest and most heavily built horned dinosaurs known triceratops as a ceratopsid achelousaurus would have been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened downwards swept tail its very large head which would have rested on a straight neck had a hooked upper beak very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth in tooth sockets new teeth grew under old ones each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla upper jaw bone distinguishing traits thumb restoration in 1995 when describing species sampson gave a formal list of four traits that distinguish achelousaurus from its centrosaurine relatives firstly adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that is relatively small and thin and heavily covered with pits secondly adult individuals do not have true horns above eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges thirdly not yet fully grown individuals or subadults have true horncores bony part of horns above eye sockets with inward facing surface being concave and fourthly parietal bones of neck shield have a single pair of curved spikes sticking out from rear margin to behind and to outside besides these unique characteristics sampson pointed out additional differences with two very closely related forms frill spikes of achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than spikes of einiosaurus which are medially curved spikes of achelousaurus are nevertheless less directed to outside than comparable spikes of pachyrhinosaurus achelousaurus also differs from pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach frontal bones at its rear apart from skull no features of skeleton are known that distinguish achelousaurus from other members of centrosaurinae skull left thumb holotype skull in right side view horned dinosaurs mainly differ from each other in their horns which are located on snout and above eyes and in large skull frill which covers neck like a shield achelousaurus exhibited build of derived advanced centrosaurines which are typified by short brow horns or bosses combined with elaborate frill spikes general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine with a wide rounded squamosal bone at side which expanded towards rear it also shares typical frill curvature with a top surface that is convex from side to side and concave from front to rear adult achelousaurus skulls had a rugose heavily pitted boss on snout or nasal region where many other ceratopsids had a horn such a boss is often called i e consisting of thickened bone but describing it as a thick boss can be misleading in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations though it is less depressed than with pachyrhinosaurus nasal boss covered about two thirds of top surface of nasal bones boss was similar to that seen in related genus pachyrhinosaurus though narrower shorter and less high it covered 27 of total skull length was 30 longer than nostril eye socket distance and was about twice as long as eye socket its rear edge did not reach level of eye socket nasal boss extended forward where it fused onto nasal and premaxilla bones of upper jaw at front of snout though nasal bone itself did not fuse with premaxilla boss of specimen mor 485 furthermore had an excavation or cavity at its front end horn core that formed boss may have developed by either becoming i e bent forward during growth like horn of related einiosaurus until it fused onto nasal bone or from a simple erect horn which later extended its base forward over snout region as in pachyrhinosaurus nasal bone formed top of a large bony nostril from rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to front snout was compared to that of einiosaurus relatively wide at level of rear nostrils lacrimal bone in front of eye socket was thickened mainly on inner surface while outer surface was featureless apart from a crater like excavation thumb 350px diagram of skull adult skulls also possess large rugose and oval bosses on supraorbital region above eyes instead of horns of other ceratopsids supraorbital bosses extended from postorbital bone forward to incorporate triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones and had high transverse ridges around middle which were thick at their base and thin towards their top palpebral bones strongly stood out forming an antorbital buttress fused did not reach nasal boss forming a distinctive transverse saddle shaped groove separating nasal boss from supraorbital bosses this groove extended backwards separating supraorbital bosses from each other and forming a t shape in top view these bosses were similar to those of pachyrhinosaurus but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities long and low supraorbital horncores of sub adult specimen mor 591 were similar to those of sub adult einiosaurus and pachyrhinosaurus they had a concave surface on inner side as with pachyrhinosaurus ridges on postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses skull roof of achelousaurus had a midline cavity with an opening at top called frontal fontanelle a feature found in all ceratopsids which have a double skull roof formed by frontal bones folding towards each other between brow horn bases this cavity formed sinuses that extended below supraorbital bosses which were therefore relatively thin internally being thick from outside to cavity roof this cavity appears to have partially closed over as an animal aged with only rear part of fontanelle being open in adult specimen mor 485 thumb left parietosquamosal frill bones of three skulls mor 485 571 and 591 like that of all other ceratopsids skull of achelousaurus had a parietosquamosal frill or neck shield which was formed by parietal bones at rear and squamosal bones at sides parietal is one of main bones used to distinguish centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them whereas squamosal is very similar across taxa in achelousaurus squamosal bone was much shorter than parietal of its inner margin rear portion formed a step in relation to front part with suture between squamosal and parietal showing a kink to behind at level of rear supratemporal fenestra a typical centrosaurine trait squamosal and jugal bone by touching each other excluded quadratojugal from edge of lateral temporal fenestra i e opening at rear of skull side frill of achelousaurus had two conspicuous large spikes that were directed backwards and curved to sides away from each other during 1990s it was increasingly understood that such spikes on parietals were not random growths but specific traits that could be used to determine evolution of horned dinosaurs if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species sampson in paper describing achelousaurus in 1995 therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes counting them from midline to side of frill this was applied to centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997 large spikes of achelousaurus correspond to process 3 spikes of other centrosaurines and were similar to those of einiosaurus though curved more to sides similar to pachyrhinosaurus they were shorter and thinner than corresponding spikes of styracosaurus between these spikes on both sides of central frill notch were two small tab like processes process 2 that were directed towards midline innermost process 1 spikes as present in centrosaurus are lacking with achelousaurus frill had two large paired openings parietal fenestrae with a midline parietal bar between them a linear row of rounded swellings ran along top of parietal bar which may be homologous to spikes and horns in same area of some pachyrhinosaurus specimens a row of relatively small processes ran along parietal shield margin from process 3 spikes outwards these lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals bones that lined frills of ceratopsids in achelousaurus these epoccipitals which start as separate skin ossifications or osteoderms fuse with underlying frill bone to form spikes at least in third position keratin sheaths thumb snout regions of mor 591 and 485 bosses on skull of achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life but their shape in a living animal is uncertain in 2009 paleontologist tobin l hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology horn and skin features of modern horned animals and examined skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for same correlates they proposed that rugose bosses of achelousaurus and pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of cornified or keratinized skin similar to boss of modern muskoxen moschatus nasal horncore of adult achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal outer layer of skin pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on sides a thick pad of epidermis may have grown from v shaped pitted notch at tip of nasal horncore growth direction of nasal pad would have been towards front supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis which grew at a sideways angle similar to curved horncores of as indicated by orientation of fins or ridges on bosses that supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus or furrow at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at wrinkled edges of bosses pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting hard inner bone with hard horn sheath in addition correlates for a rostral scale in front of nasal boss and scale rows along parietal midline and supraorbital squamosal region were identified evolution horner s hypothesis of anagenesis thumb left diagram showing evolutionary lineage proposed by horner et al 1992 in 1992 study by horner et al tried to account for fact that within a limited geological period of time about half a million years there had been a quick succession of animal communities in upper two medicine formation normally this would be interpreted as a series of invasions with new animal types replacing old ones but horner noted that newer forms often had a strong similarity to previous types this suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action later fauna was basically old one but at a more evolved stage various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis this conformed to assumption prevalent at time that a species should last about two to three million years a further indication according to horner was failure to identify true autapomorphies unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal or ancestral into more derived characters thumb frill of transitional taxon a later named rubeosaurus horned dinosaurs discovered by horner exemplified this phenomenon in lowest layers of two medicine formation below overlaying bearpaw formation transitional taxon a was present it seemed to be identical to styracosaurus albertensis differing from it only in possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes middle layers below bearpaw contained transitional taxon b that also had a single spike pair but differed in form of its nasal horn that curved to front over anterior branches of nasal bones in upper strata below bearpaw transitional taxon c had been excavated it too had a spike pair but now nasal horn was fused with front branches upper surface of horn was elevated and very rough orbital horns showed coarse ridges today taxon a has been named rubeosaurus taxon b has become einiosaurus while taxon c is achelousaurus in 1992 horner et al did not name these as species for explicit reason that entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between styracosaurus albertensis known from judith river formation and derived hornless pachyrhinosaurus from horseshoe canyon formation which had spike pair and bosses on nose and above eyes as well as additional frill ornamentation in 1997 horner referred to three taxa as centrosaurine 1 centrosaurine 2 and centrosaurine 3 horner thought he had found mechanism driving this evolution elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated landslide butte animals were living on a narrow strip on east coast of laramidia bordering western interior seaway and constrained in west by high proto rocky mountains during bearpaw transgression sea levels were rising steadily reducing width of their coastal habitat from about to this led to stronger selection pressures severest for achelousaurus which lived during phase that coastal strip was at its narrowest lower number of individuals that smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck making rapid evolution possible increased sexual selection would have induced changes in sexual ornamentation such as spikes horns and bosses a reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on other hand would be typified by adaptive radiation that sexual selection had indeed been main mechanism would be proven by fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar they all had two frill spikes a small nasal horn pointing to front and orbital horns in form of slightly elevated knobs only in adult phase did they begin to differ according to horner this also showed that populations were very closely related thumb reconstructed skull of einiosaurus direct ancestor of achelousaurus according to horner in natural history museum of los angeles horner did not perform an exact cladistic analysis determining relationship between three populations such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is most likely he assumed that this would result in a tree in which types were successive branches such a tree would as a consequence of method used never show a direct ancestor descendant relationship many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway horner disagreed he saw gradual morphological changes as clear proof that in this case evolution of one taxon into another without a splitting of populations could be directly observed evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this such a transition is called anagenesis he posited that if opposite cladogenesis could not be proven a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process basing himself on revised data sampson in 1995 estimated that layers investigated represented a longer period of time than initially assumed 500 000 years after deposition of gilmore s brachyceratops quarry 860 000 years would have passed and after einiosaurus beds 640 000 years until maximal extent of bearpaw transgression he did not adopt horner s hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place with populations splitting these time intervals were still short enough to indicate that rate of speciation must have been high which might have been true of all centrosaurines of late campanian thumb left skull cast of pachyrhinosaurus a descendant of achelousaurus according to horner at museum of natural sciences of belgium in 1996 dodson raised two objections to horner s hypothesis firstly possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than presence of three pairs as with styracosaurus albertensis this suggested to him that einiosaurus achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within centrosaurinae secondly he was concerned that einiosaurus and achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism one type being males other females this would be suggested by short geological time interval between layers their fossils had been found in which was estimated by him at about 250 000 years but if hypothesis were true it would be perhaps best example of fast evolution in dinosauria in 2010 horner admitted that specimen tmp 2002 76 1 seemed to indicate that achelousaurus was not descended from einiosaurus as it preceded both in age and yet had a nasal boss but he stressed that even if lineages split off its ancestor might have resembled einiosaurus furthermore it might still be possible that einiosaurus was a direct descendant of rubeosaurus also process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of bearpaw sea process of anagenesis was affirmed by john wilson and jack in 2016 who studied ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs they compared a small einiosaurus specimen mor 456 8 8 87 1 with achelousaurus specimen mor 591 both proved to be quite similar with main differences being a longer face in mor 456 8 8 87 1 and a sharper supraorbital horncore in mor 591 they concluded that achelousaurus was likely direct descendant of einiosaurus more adult einiosaurus individuals approached achelousaurus morphology differences between two taxa would have been caused by heterochrony differential changes in speed various traits developed during lifetime of an individual classification in 1995 sampson formally placed achelousaurus in ceratopsidae more precisely centrosaurinae in all analyses einiosaurus and achelousaurus are part of clade pachyrhinosaurini by definition achelousaurus is a member of clade pachyrostra or thick snouts in which it is united with pachyrhinosaurus in 2010 gregory s paul assigned a horneri to genus centrosaurus as c horneri this has found no acceptance among other researchers with subsequent taxonomic assessments invariably keeping generic name achelousaurus phylogeny thumb phylogenetic analyses have varied in closeness of relationship between achelousaurus and styracosaurus here a skull at american museum of natural history sampson felt in 1995 that there was not enough evidence to conclude that achelousaurus was a direct descendant of einiosaurus unlike horner he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny this showed an evolutionary tree wherein achelousaurus split off between einiosaurus and pachyrhinosaurus as horner had predicted contrary to horner s claim styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor as it was a sister species of centrosaurus in sampson s analysis subsequent studies have sought to determine precise relationships within this part of evolutionary tree with conflicting results regarding question whether styracosaurus albertensis rubeosaurus or einiosaurus might have been in direct line of ascent to achelousaurus in 2005 an analysis by michael ryan and anthony russell found styracosaurus more closely related to achelousaurus than to centrosaurus this was confirmed by analyses by ryan in 2007 nicholas longrich in 2010 and xu et al in 2010 but same year horner and andrew t mcdonald moved styracosaurus ovatus to its own genus rubeosaurus finding it a sister species of einiosaurus while styracosaurus albertensis was again located on centrosaurus branch in 2011 a subsequent study by andrew t mcdonald in this respect replicated outcome of his previous one as did a publication by andre farke et al in 2017 j p wilson and ryan further complicated issue concluding that mor 492 taxon a was not referable to rubeosaurus and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it before achelousaurus was described pachyrhinosaurus canadensis had been considered a solitary aberrant form among centrosaurines set apart from them by its unusual bosses achelousaurus gave evolutionary context to canadian species while expanding temporal and geographical range for what came to be seen as pachyrhinosaurs in all analyses achelousaurus and pachyrhinosaurus were sister groups in 2008 another closely related species was named pachyrhinosaurus in that study term pachyrhinosaurs was used for clade consisting of achelousaurus and pachyrhinosaurus when pachyrhinosaurus was described in 2012 clade name pachyrostra was coined uniting two genera achelousaurus is basalmost shared derived traits or synapomorphies of group are an enlarged nasal ornamentation and a change of nasal and brow horns into bosses at end of campanian there seems to have been a trend of replacing other centrosaurines also in 2012 clade pachyrhinosaurini was named consisting of species more closely related to pachyrhinosaurus or achelousaurus than to centrosaurus apart from einiosaurus and rubeosaurus this included sinoceratops and xenoceratops according to a 2013 study cladistic analyses develop gradually reflecting new discoveries and insights their results can be shown in a cladogram with relationships found ordered in an evolutionary tree cladogram below in which xenoceratops and sinoceratops are not shows phylogenetic position of achelousaurus in a cladogram from a study by chiba et al 2017 thumb ceratopsid skull casts positioned in a phylogenetic tree in

thumb laramidia where achelousaurus lived was a separate subcontinent during campanian age achelousaurus is known from two medicine formation which preserves coastal sediments dating from campanian stage of late cretaceous period between 83 and 74 million years ago achelousaurus specimens are found in highest levels of formation probably closer to end of that timeframe 74 million years ago two medicine formation is typified by a warm semiarid climate its layers were deposed on east coast of laramidia island continent which consisted of western north america high cordillera in west combined with predominantly western winds would have caused a rain shadow limiting annual rainfall rain would mainly have fallen during summer when convection storms flooded landscape climate would thus also have been very seasonal with a long dry season and a short wet season vegetation would have been sparse and little varied in such conditions horned dinosaurs would have been dependent on oxbow lakes for a continuous supply of water and food main river channels tending to run dry earlier and perished in them during severe droughts when animals concentrated around last watering holes causing bone beds to form brown in which horned dinosaurs were found a mixture of clay and wood fragments resembles that of modern seasonally dry swamps surrounding vegetation might have consisted of about high conifer trees achelousaurus ate much smaller plants though a 2013 study determined that ceratopsid herbivores on laramidia were restricted to feeding on vegetation with a height of or lower more or less contemporary dinosaur genera of area included scolosaurus hypacrosaurus einiosaurus and tyrannosaurids of uncertain classification as proven by tooth marks horned dinosaur fossils in landslide butte field area had been scavenged by a large theropod predator which rogers suggested were albertosaurus exact composition of fauna achelousaurus was part of is uncertain as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that achelousaurus shared its habitat with forms roughly found in middle or at end of time range of its formation as with horned dinosaurs horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of two medicine formation one of these was a form in between lambeosaurus and hypacrosaurus in 1994 he would name it hypacrosaurus stebingeri today hypacrosaurus stebingeri is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of species have been identified horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between stegoceras and pachycephalosaurus these have not been consistently referred to a new genus finally horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between daspletosaurus and tyrannosaurus in 2017 tyrannosaurid remains from two medicine formation were named as a new species of daspletosaurus daspletosaurus horneri 2017 study considered it plausible that d horneri was a direct descendant of d torosus in a process of anagenesis but rejected possibility that d horneri was ancestor of tyrannosaurus thumb biogeography of centrosaurine dinosaurs during campanian other ceratopsians from two medicine formation include einiosaurus and rubeosaurus in addition remains of other indeterminate and dubious centrosaurines including brachyceratops are known from formation and though they may represent younger stages of three valid genera this is not possible to demonstrate whereas horner assumed that einiosaurus and achelousaurus were separate in time in 2010 donald m henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning skull of achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance this might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition bite strength of achelousaurus measured as an ultimate tensile strength was 30 5 newtons per square millimeter n mm2 at maxillary tooth row and 18 n mm2 at beak indeterminate specimen tmp 2002 76 1 is from dinosaur park formation and if it belongs to achelousaurus genus would be stratigraphically oldest known taxon achelousaurus would then also be only campanian ceratopsid known from more than one formation both animals occur right below marine shales of bearpaw formation but due to longitudinal differences tmp 2002 76 1 is about 500 000 years older than achelousaurus fossils from two medicine formation function of skull ornamentation thumb left according to horner bosses of achelousaurus had an added display value in 1995 sampson noted that earlier studies had found that horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a function in intraspecific display and combat and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating likewise in 1997 horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits conferring a reproduction benefit dodson thought that in centrosaurinae in general display value of frill had been reduced compared to nasal and supraorbital ornamentation sampson in 1995 rejected possibility that difference in skull ornamentation between einiosaurus and achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism for three reasons firstly extensive einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses as would have been expected if one of sexes had them secondly einiosaurus and achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age thirdly in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters einiosaurus and achelousaurus however each have developed a distinct set of such traits hieronymus in 2009 concluded that nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming head or flank of a rival bone structure indicates that bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen suggesting dominance fights similar to those of members of caprinae subfamily in latter group an evolutionary transition can be observed where originally straight horns become more robust padded and increasingly curved downwards evolution from horncores into bosses in centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique from clashing to high energy head butting head butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior opponents would have engaged this way only after assessing each other s strengths visually for this reason hieronymus considered it unlikely that bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by innate species specific display rituals preceding a real instead of a ritual fight bosses would have evolved for actual combat part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates food and breeding grounds previously it had been suggested that fusion of first three neck vertebrae such as seen in mature specimen mor 571 might have been a paleopathology an instance of disease spondyloarthropathy but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal ontogenetic trait vertebrae growing together to form a so called to support heavy head all three main known specimens have consisting of three fused neck vertebrae trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition social behavior it has been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals due to large number of known bone beds containing multiple members of same ceratopsian species in 2010 hunt and farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians horner assumed that horned dinosaurs at landslide butte lived in herds which had been killed by drought or disease dodson concluded that fact that achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific containing only one species confirmed existence of herds metabolism there has long been debate about thermoregulation of dinosaurs centered around whether they were ectotherms cold blooded or endotherms warm blooded mammals and birds are homeothermic endotherms which generate their own body heat and have a high metabolism whereas reptiles are heterothermic ectotherms which receive their body heat from their surroundings a 1996 study examined oxygen isotopes from bone phosphates of animals from two medicine formation including juvenile achelousaurus specimen mor 591 d18o values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on d18o values in their body water and temperature when bones were deposited making it possible to measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited study analyzed seasonal variations in body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions to determine whether dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally a varanid lizard fossil sampled for study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic variation of dinosaurs including achelousaurus was consistent with them being homeothermic endotherms metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds and they may have been intermediate endotherms see also timeline of
