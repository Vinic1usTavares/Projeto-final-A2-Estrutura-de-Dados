downforce with little penalizing drag for his part andretti worked at setting up his cars for races exploiting subtle differences in tire size stagger and suspension set up cross weighting on each

hesitations ironically jones later decided to make a comeback to f1 in 1983 unlike andretti and had he taken seat at ferrari it is likely they would have kept former world champion for that year which
