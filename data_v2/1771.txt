in 1703 18 year old composer george frideric handel took up residence in hamburg germany where he remained until 1706 during this period he composed four operas only first of which almira has survived more or less intact of other three music for nero is lost while only short orchestral excerpts from florindo and daphne survive handel was born and grew up in halle where he received his early musical education and became an accomplished organist in hamburg he obtained employment as a violinist at oper am gansemarkt city s famous opera house here he learned rudiments of opera composition mainly under influences of reinhard keiser theatre s music director and johann mattheson its leading vocalist gansemarkt was largely dedicated to keiser s compositions his temporary absence in 1704 gave handel his chance and in quick succession he wrote almira and nero using librettos by friedrich christian feustking almira was successful nero less so and was never performed after its initial run of three performances handel s final hamburg operas florindo and daphne based on librettos by heinrich hinsch and originally conceived as a giant single entity were not produced at gansemarkt before handel left hamburg for italy in 1706 no music that can be definitively traced to nero has been identified although handel scholars have speculated that some of it may have been used in later works particularly agrippina which has a related storyline and some of same characters fragments of music from florindo and daphne have been preserved although without vocal parts and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012 background halle thumb upright left statue of handel in halle george frideric handel was born on 23 february 1685 in german city of halle it is unclear what initial musical education he received his father georg handel was not a music lover and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son s precocious talents nevertheless by age of ten handel had become an accomplished organist his playing in royal chapel at weissenfels where his half brother karl was in service of duke of saxe weissenfels impressed duke who persuaded handel senior that boy should have a proper musical education as a result handel began formal study under friedrich zachow organist of lutheran church at halle handel s biographer jonathan keates writes that from zachow handel learned not only a great deal about line and shape of an aria about strong adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style handel s musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with georg philipp telemann whom he met in 1700 in february 1702 handel enrolled at university of halle perhaps intending to study law in march he took up post of organist at halle s calvinist cathedral domkirche a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in city at some time possibly in late 1702 or early 1703 handel visited berlin where his father had held an honorary post as physician to elector who in 1701 had become prussian king frederick i in berlin handel first experienced italian opera and may have met italian composers giovanni and attilio ariosti who were writing operas for frederick s court king heard of handel s abilities and wanted him to train as a future court composer but handel s horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future he declined king s offer and returned to halle to fulfil his year s contract at domkirche with few career prospects available in his home city handel would have liked to go to italy but this he realised was not yet practicable since he lacked both cash and contacts instead in mid 1703 he left halle for hamburg a thriving free city which housed leading opera house in northern germany hamburg oper am gansemarkt thumb early 18th century engraving of hamburg oper am gansemarkt hamburg opera known as oper am gansemarkt was first public opera house to be established outside italy brainchild of exiled duke of schleswig and his kapellmeister johann theile it was designed by girolamo and modelled on teatro santi giovanni e paolo in venice its construction was opposed by clergy and cathedral hierarchy but enthusiastically supported by city s municipal authorities built in 1677 on a lavish scale with a reported capacity of 2 000 it boasted an exceptionally deep stage and was according to handel scholars winton dean and john merrill knapp one of best equipped theatres of its time dean and knapp write that theatre s history was enlivened and envenomed by a maelstrom of controversy pursued in pamphlets broadsheets sermons and prefaces to librettos and by financial crises which persisted on and off throughout sixty years of its existence a preponderance of biblically inspired works in earliest years was soon replaced by a range of more secular subjects often drawn from roman history and myth or from recent events such as 1683 siege of vienna performances tended to be of considerable length often extending to six hours 18 year old handel entered this hectic environment in mid 1703 to take up a place in theatre s orchestra as a ripieno ensemble second violin keiser and mattheson thumb upright left johann mattheson one of handel s hamburg mentors handel joined hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success this blossoming followed arrival of reinhard keiser who had become musical director at gansemarkt in about 1697 and in 1703 succeeded johann as theatre s manager born in 1674 keiser had studied under johann schelle and probably johann kuhnau at thomasschule zu leipzig in 1694 he was employed as a court composer at brunswick where in three years he composed seven operas at least one of which was performed in hamburg according to handel s biographer donald burrows keiser was a good judge of popular taste with a flair for writing italian style arias between 1697 and 1703 prior to handel s arrival about a dozen more keiser operas had been staged at gansemarkt despite his on stage successes keiser was an unreliable general manager with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen often at odds with his creditors it is possible that keiser who had connections in halle area had heard of handel and was directly instrumental in securing latter s post in gansemarkt orchestra certainly he was a considerable influence on younger man in three years that handel spent in hamburg another important gansemarkt colleague was house composer and singer johann mattheson who noted handel s rapid progress in orchestra from back desk violinist to harpsichord soloist a role in which said mattheson he showed himself a man a thing which no one had before suspected save i alone mattheson was less complimentary on handel s early efforts at composition he composed very long long arias and really interminable cantatas before it seems lofty schooling of opera trimmed him into other fashions almira in 1704 keiser seeking refuge from his creditors temporarily left hamburg for weissenfels in saxony near to his hometown he took with him his donkey and his most recent opera composition almira a setting of a libretto by friedrich christian feustking thus denying this work to gansemarkt keiser produced it in weissenfels in july 1704 in these circumstances temporary management turned to 19 year old handel and requested a fresh setting of feustking s libretto handel complied his version was premiered at gansemarkt on 8 january 1705 and ran for 20 performances a marked success fictional plot appears to have originated from giuseppe s opera l almira with a libretto by giulio performed in venice in 1691 relatively light hearted story typical of 17th century dramatic conventions is told in three acts and records machinations surrounding newly crowned queen almira s secret love for her secretary fernando in opposition to her dead father s dying wish that she marry someone from family of her guardian consalvo keates writes of work whole thing belongs very much to its venetian baroque world full of intrigue interlaced with comedy and ballet these features even mixture of languages between italian and german often recur in handel s later work music which has been preserved largely through a conducting score prepared by telemann reflects handel s debt to keiser and displays a variety of traditions a french style overture german influenced orchestration and italianate vocal writing dean and knapp summarise score as very uneven in style quality and technique with abundant promise but intermittent fulfilment lost works nero thumb portrait of nero 17th century general success of almira prompted gansemarkt management to follow it almost immediately with a second handel setting die durch blut und mord lieb oder nero love obtained through blood and murder or nero generally known as nero again based on a feustking libretto libretto survives intact but music is entirely lost dean and knapp record that a copy of handel s manuscript score was held in library of hamburg impresario j c westphal until 1830 when it was sold and thereafter disappeared whole work incorporates 20 ensembles and 57 arias libretto feustking s libretto was written entirely in german its probable sources being ancient histories of tacitus and suetonius text has been widely criticised for its low quality friedrich wrote of it there is no spirit in verse and one feels vexation in setting such stuff to music a later critic paul henry lang cites miserable quality of libretto as principal reason for opera s failure dean and knapp suggest that main fault is that feustking fatally over complicates main story by incorporating sub plots unnecessary extra characters and every stock device known to operatic repertory these intrusions include disguises mistaken identities a much ridiculed philosopher a comic servant and a play within play many of characters are historical including nero octavia poppea nero s mother agrippina and seneca philosopher several of these appear in handel s later 1709 opera agrippina another real life figure who appears in nero is anicetus who historically is held to have murdered agrippina on nero s behalf described in libretto as des mignon oder liebling emperor s little one or darling anicetus is handel s only openly gay operatic character characters as listed and described in burrows et al george frideric handel volume 1 1609 1725 collected documents 2011 nero roman emperor agrippina

schemes to replace his current queen octavia with his mistress poppea against urgings of his mother agrippina and philosopher seneca a sub plot introduces tiridates crown prince of armenia another historical figure who in opera is betrothed to fictional cassandra but is secretly pursuing poppea in rivalry with emperor octavia and cassandra provide each other with mutual support in their trials while agrippina allies with octavia and narrowly escapes death from a piece of falling masonry in turn she tries unsuccessfully to persuade seneca to kill nero as a stratagem to secure tiridates s

octavia incarceration of agrippina return of his senses to tiridates when he learns that cassandra is alive and a joyful and triumphant double coronation nero and poppea and tiridates and cassandra performance history nero opened on 25 february 1705 with mattheson in title role its staging so closely after almira s run indicates that it was probably composed in part or in whole during 1704 there are no surviving accounts of its public reception but it clearly proved less successful than its predecessor running for just three performances before theatre closed for lenten season when gansemarkt reopened opera was not revived and was never performed again music although there is no extant music that can be positively identified with nero there is a possibility that some of it may have been used in later works john e sawyer in his analysis of agrippina reveals that this work composed five years after nero with similar characters contains highest proportion of borrowed material of any of composer s major dramatic works and dean and knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from nero according to handel scholar charles cudworth suite of dances that follows overture to handel s 1707 opera rodrigo his first after leaving hamburg could very well have begun as ballet music in nero or another of lost hamburg operas musicologist bernd baselt has raised possibility that handel s harpsichord suite in g minor hwv 453 is an arrangement of overture to nero a version of this suite reconstructed for orchestra by peter holman is included in a selection of handel s hamburg music issued by hyperion records in january 2012 florindo and daphne general thumb left upright greek myth of apollo and daphne as told by roman poet ovid forms basis of double opera following its closure at start of 1705 lenten season gansemarkt did not reopen until august by which time keiser had returned from weissenfels to produce his opera octavia from this point handel s regular connection with theatre appears to have diminished although he remained in hamburg for a further year his main source of income was from private lessons as he saved for his long desired visit to italy he nevertheless accepted a commission from gansemarkt to compose a setting for a large scale opera based on greek myth of apollo and daphne with its rambling plot and an assortment of dances and other set pieces almost 100 musical numbers in all work was eventually divided into two separate operas for performance on successive nights two sections were given formal names der florindo florindo made happy and die daphne daphne metamorphosed but are generally known as florindo and daphne it is not known when handel wrote music he may have completed it in 1705 06 while still in hamburg or it may have been composed in italy after arriving there in latter part of 1706 libretto text is by heinrich sometimes rendered as hinrich hinsch an established gansemarkt librettist whose stated intention was adapting stories to provide a pleasurable poetic experience to titillate senses of its audience without attempting to address their reason or understanding in this case he took as his base material episode of phoebus apollo and daphne as told in book 1 of ovid s metamorphoses but added a plethora of new characters and incidents which move story significantly away from ovidian original main language is german but presence of several ensembles and arias in italian leads dean and knapp to speculate that hinsch may have used an italian libretto as his source florindo and daphne libretti were published in handel jahrbuch in 1984 and 1985 respectively and in facsimile form in 1989 as part of a 13 volume edited by ellen t harris preface to florinda libretto explains hinsch s choice of titles first of two parts presents festival instituted in honour of phoebus apollo and betrothal of florinda and daphne which took place on same day so it receives title florindo made happy other part represents daphne s stubborn resistance to phoebus s love also abhorrence she feels for all love and finally her metamorphosis into a laurel tree from which it receives title daphne

causes her to renounce all love she abandons wedding and announces that she will join goddess diana and become a huntress this sparks a series of schemes and counter schemes as both apollo and florindo continue to pursue daphne while other would be lovers manoeuvre for position lycoris assures apollo that daphne s abandonment of wedding was a signal that she favours him lycoris also steals

confirms story daphne bewildered pleads with her father peneus to prove her innocence he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree cupid blames apollo s pride for fiasco but gives him laurel as his special tree florindo now accepts alfirena and lycoris having confessed her scheming is united with damon only guiltless daphne ends up losing everything performance history dean and knapp record that in early 1707 keiser surrendered lease of gansemarkt to johann heinrich sauerbrey who thus became responsible for staging of double opera it may by this time have been in rehearsal and difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements consensus among experts is that two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in january 1708 as they are first works in mattheson s opera list for 1708 there are no surviving records of public s reception length of original run or of any revivals whether handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain he may have returned from italy fresh from opening of rodrigo in florence to supervise production of florindo and daphne in hamburg dean and knapp suggest works may have been directed from harpsichord by christoph although anthony hicks in his grove handel biography says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without composer s presence theatre s management was clearly concerned that public might find double opera too heavy in undiluted form accordingly a comic intermezzo in low german dialect platte deutsch was devised by sauerbrey to precede performance of daphne critic and essayist romain rolland in his life of handel termed this a mutilation carried out for fear that music may tire hearers music a few fragments of music from twin operas survive newman flower collection at manchester central library holds three arias and a chorus in full orchestral score but with vocal parts missing a blank stave with a soprano clef suggests that three arias were written for soprano voice chorus has been identified by baselt with o from act 1 of daphne two of arias are tentatively associated with mie from act 1 of florindo and piu from third act of daphne third aria has not been identified royal music collection at british library houses manuscripts of instrumental pieces mainly dances that belong to florindo and daphne a group of eight short pieces have been catalogued as two four movement suites hwv352 and british library collection includes a further group of four movements scored for string orchestra which has been catalogued as as with nero it is possible that music from florindo or daphne was recycled by handel for use in later works overture to opera rodrigo consists of eight french style dances which cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of lost hamburg operas in 1709 10 handel composed cantata apollo e dafne which has common ground with earlier operas harris makes point that when writing cantata handel would have recalled his earlier setting and perhaps borrowed from it dean and knapp provide further example of works in which florinda and daphne music may have re emerged oratorio il del tempo e del 1707 opera radamisto 1720 and overture in b flat which baselt conjectures might have been written as overture to florindo this last named has been combined with hwv352 354 and to form suite from operas florindo and daphne which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by parley of instruments under peter holman afterwards handel s hamburg years provided him with a composing apprenticeship particularly although not exclusively as a writer of opera influence of keiser which began during this period was significant throughout handel s career apart from his lifelong habit of borrowing fragments from keiser s operas for use in his own works he adopted and retained many of his mentor s compositional characteristics according to hicks handel never relinquished french forms for overtures and dance music and his use of orchestral colour particularly occasional instrumental doubling of voice colla parte was derived from german models loss of much of handel s early work was first noted by his earliest biographer mainwaring 1760 who refers to a great quantity of music from hamburg and italy adding that it was not known how much of it still existed on departing from hamburg handel spent a further three years in italy before settling in london where he remained dominant composer of italianate opera for following thirty years after his hamburg initiation handel composed more than forty operas beginning with rodrigo in 1707 and ending in 1740 with these works were quickly forgotten after handel s death modern revivals did not begin until 1920s dean and knapp believe that despite years of relative neglect handel s achievements as a composer of opera entitle him to rank alongside monteverdi mozart verdi and richard wagner as one
