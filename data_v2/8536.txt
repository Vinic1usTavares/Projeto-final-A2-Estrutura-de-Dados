rwandan civil war was a civil war in rwanda fought between rwandan armed forces representing government of rwanda and rebel rwandan patriotic front rpf from 1 october 1990 to 18 july 1994 war which lasted from 1990 to 1994 arose from long running dispute between hutu and tutsi groups within rwandan population a 1959 1962 revolution had replaced tutsi monarchy with a hutu led republic forcing more than 336 000 tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries a group of these refugees in uganda founded rpf which under leadership of fred rwigyema and paul kagame became a battle ready army by late 1980s war began on 1 october 1990 when rpf invaded north eastern rwanda advancing into country they suffered a major setback when rwigyema was killed in action on second day rwandan army assisted by troops from france gained upper hand and rpf were largely defeated by end of october kagame who had been in united states during invasion returned to take command he withdrew troops to virunga mountains for several months before attacking again rpf began a guerrilla war which continued until mid 1992 with neither side able to gain upper hand a series of protests forced rwandan president juvenal habyarimana to begin peace negotiations with rpf and domestic opposition parties despite disruption and killings by hutu power a group of extremists opposed to any deal and a fresh rpf offensive in early 1993 negotiations were successfully concluded with signing of arusha accords in august 1993 an uneasy peace followed during which terms of accords were gradually implemented rpf troops were deployed to a compound in kigali and peace keeping united nations assistance mission for rwanda unamir was sent to country but hutu power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a final solution to exterminate tutsi this plan was put into action following assassination of president habyarimana on 6 april 1994 over course of about 100 days between 500 000 and 1 000 000 tutsi and moderate hutu were killed in rwandan genocide rpf quickly resumed civil war they captured territory steadily encircling cities and cutting off supply routes by mid june they had surrounded capital kigali and on 4 july they seized it war ended later that month when rpf captured last territory held by interim government forcing government and genocidaires into zaire victorious rpf assumed control of country with paul kagame as de facto leader kagame served as vice president from 1994 and as president from 2000 rpf began a programme of rebuilding infrastructure and economy of country bringing genocide perpetrators to trial and promoting reconciliation between hutu and tutsi in 1996 rpf led rwandan government launched an offensive against refugee camps in zaire home to exiled leaders of former regime and millions of hutu refugees this action started first congo war which removed long time dictator president mobutu sese seko from power as of 2019 kagame and rpf remain dominant political force in rwanda background pre independence rwanda and origins of hutu tutsi and twa thumb a reconstruction of king of rwanda s palace at nyanza alt photograph of king s palace in nyanza rwanda depicting main entrance front and conical roof earliest inhabitants of what is now rwanda were twa aboriginal pygmy hunter gatherers who settled in area between 8000 bc and 3000 bc and remain in rwanda today between 700 bc and 1500 ad bantu groups migrated into region and began to clear forest land for agriculture forest dwelling twa lost much of their land and moved to slopes of mountains historians have several theories regarding bantu migrations one theory is that first settlers were hutu and tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group possibly originating from horn of africa an alternative theory is that migration was slow and steady with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering existing society under this theory hutu and tutsi are a later class rather than a racial distinction population coalesced first into clans and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms kingdom of rwanda ruled by tutsi clan became dominant from mid eighteenth century expanding through conquest and assimilation it achieved its greatest extent under reign of kigeli rwabugiri in 1853 1895 rwabugiri expanded kingdom west and north and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between hutu and tutsi populations these included a system of forced labour which hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them and under which tutsi patrons ceded cattle to hutu or tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service rwanda and neighbouring burundi were assigned to germany by berlin conference of 1884 and germany established a presence in 1897 with formation of an alliance with king german policy was to rule through rwandan monarchy enabling colonisation with fewer european troops colonists favoured tutsi over hutu when assigning administrative roles believing them to be migrants from ethiopia and racially superior rwandan king welcomed germans and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand kingdom belgian forces took control of rwanda and burundi during world war i and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule belgian administration in conjunction with catholic clerics modernised local economy they also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on population tutsi supremacy remained reinforced by belgium s enthusiastic support of monarchy leaving hutu disenfranchised in 1935 belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as tutsi hutu twa or naturalised it had previously been possible for wealthy hutu to become honorary tutsi but identity cards prevented further movement between groups revolution exile of tutsi and hutu republic after 1945 a hutu counter elite developed demanding transfer of power from tutsi to hutu tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found belgians no longer supported them there was a simultaneous shift in catholic church with prominent conservative figures in early rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working class origin of these a greater proportion were flemish rather than walloon belgians and sympathised with plight of hutu in november 1959 hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on tutsi homes following false rumours of death of a hutu sub chief in an assault by tutsi activists violence quickly spread across whole country beginning rwandan revolution king and tutsi politicians launched a counter attack in an attempt to seize power and hutu and belgians but were thwarted by belgian colonel guy logiest who was brought in by colonial governor logiest re established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of hutu elite he replaced many tutsi chiefs with hutu and effectively forced king kigeli v into exile logiest and hutu leader gregoire kayibanda declared country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962 more than 336 000 tutsi left rwanda by 1964 to escape hutu purges mostly to neighbouring countries of burundi uganda tanzania and zaire many of tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries and sought to return to rwanda some supported new rwandan government but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on rwanda largest of which advanced close to kigali in 1963 these groups were known in kinyarwanda as inyenzi cockroaches historians do not know origin of this term it is possible rebels coined it themselves name reflecting fact that they generally attacked at night inyenzi label resurfaced in 1990s as a highly derogatory term for tutsi used by hutu hardliners to dehumanise them inyenzi attacks of 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and government defeated them last significant attack was made in desperation from burundi in december 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment government responded to this attack with slaughter of an estimated 10 000 tutsi within rwanda kayibanda presided over a hutu republic for next decade imposing an autocratic rule similar to pre revolution feudal monarchy in 1973 hutu army officer juvenal habyarimana toppled kayibanda in a coup he founded national republican movement for democracy and development mrnd party in 1975 and promulgated a new constitution following a 1978 referendum making country a one party state in which every citizen had to belong to mrnd anti tutsi discrimination continued under habyarimana but country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti tutsi violence a coffee price collapse in late 1980s caused a loss of income for rwanda s wealthy elite precipitating a political fight for power and access to foreign aid receipts family of first lady agathe habyarimana known as akazu were principal winners in this fight family had a more respected lineage than that of president having ruled one of independent states near gisenyi in nineteenth century habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling population of north west akazu exploited this to their advantage and habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them economic situation forced habyarimana to greatly reduce national budget which led to civil unrest on advice of french president francois mitterrand habyarimana declared a commitment to multi party politics but took no action to bring this about student protests followed and by late 1990 country was in crisis formation of rpf and preparation for war organisation which became rwandan patriotic front rpf was founded in 1979 in uganda it was initially known as rwandan refugees welfare association and then from 1980 as rwandan alliance for national unity ranu it formed in response to persecution and discrimination against tutsi refugees by regime of ugandan president milton obote obote accused rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor idi amin including occupying homes and stealing cattle of ugandans who had fled from amin meanwhile tutsi refugees fred rwigyema and paul kagame had joined yoweri museveni s rebel front for national salvation museveni fought alongside obote to defeat amin in 1979 but withdrew from government following obote s disputed victory in 1980 general election with rwigyema and kagame he formed a new rebel army national resistance army nra nra s goal was to overthrow obote s government in what became known as ugandan bush war president obote remained hostile to rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and ranu was forced into exile in 1981 relocating to nairobi in kenya in 1982 with authority of obote local district councils in ankole region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps these evictions were violently implemented by ankole youth militia many displaced rwandans attempted to cross border to rwanda but habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed border to prevent further migration faced with threat of many more tutsi refugees in uganda chose to join museveni s nra thumb ugandan president yoweri museveni meeting with ronald reagan at white house in october 1987 in 1986 nra captured kampala with a force of 14 000 soldiers including 500 rwandans and formed a new government after museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed kagame and rwigyema as senior officers in new ugandan army experience of bush war inspired rwigyema and kagame to consider an attack against rwanda with goal of allowing refugees to return home as well as fulfilling their army duties pair began building a covert network of rwandan tutsi refugees within army s ranks intended as nucleus for such an attack with pro refugee museveni in power ranu was able to move back to kampala at its 1987 convention it renamed itself to rwandan patriotic front and it too committed to returning refugees to rwanda by any means possible in 1988 a leadership crisis within rpf prompted fred rwigyema to intervene in organisation and take control replacing peter bayingana as rpf president kagame and other senior members of rwigyema s rwandan entourage within nra also joined kagame assuming vice presidency bayingana remained as other vice president but resented loss of leadership bayingana and his supporters attempted to start war with an invasion in late 1989 without support of rwigyema but this was quickly repelled by rwandan army rwandan president habyarimana was aware of increasing number of tutsi exiles in ugandan army and made representations to president museveni on matter at same time many native ugandans and officers in nra began criticising museveni over his appointment of rwandan refugees to senior positions he therefore demoted kagame and rwigyema in 1989 they remained de facto senior officers but change in official status and possibility that they might lose access to resources of ugandan military caused them to accelerate their plans to invade rwanda in 1990 a dispute in south western uganda between ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land many of whom were rwandans led to a wider debate on and eventually to explicit labeling of all rwandan refugees as non citizens realising precariousness of their own positions opportunity afforded by both renewed drive of refugees to leave uganda and instability on rwandan domestic scene rwigyema and kagame decided in mid 1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately it is likely that president museveni knew of planned invasion but did not explicitly support it in mid 1990 museveni ordered rwigyema to attend an officer training course at command and general staff college in fort leavenworth in united states and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior rwandans in army this may have been a tactic to reduce threat of an rpf invasion of rwanda after two days of discussion rwigyema persuaded museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in uganda museveni then ordered kagame to attend instead rpf leadership allowed him to go to avoid suspicion even though it meant his missing beginning of war course of war 1990 invasion and death of rwigyema on 1 october 1990 fifty rpf rebels deserted their ugandan army posts and crossed border from uganda into rwanda killing a rwandan customs guard at kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee they were followed by hundreds more rebels dressed in uniforms of ugandan national army and carrying stolen ugandan weaponry including machine guns autocannons mortars and soviet bm 21 multiple rocket launchers according to rpf estimates around 2 500 of ugandan army s 4 000 rwandan soldiers took part in invasion accompanied by 800 civilians including medical staff and messengers both president yoweri museveni of uganda and president habyarimana of rwanda were in new york city attending united nations world summit for children in first few days of fighting rpf advanced south to gabiro their rwandan armed forces opponents fighting for habyarimana s government were numerically superior with 5 200 soldiers and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by france but rpf benefited from element of surprise ugandan government set up roadblocks across west of uganda to prevent further desertions and to block rebels from returning to uganda on 2 october rpf leader fred rwigyema was shot in head and killed exact circumstances of rwigyema s death are disputed official line of kagame s government and version mentioned by historian gerard prunier in his 1995 book on subject was that rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet in his 2009 book africa s world war prunier states that rwigyema was killed by his subcommander peter bayingana following an argument over tactics according to this account rwigyema was conscious of need to move slowly and attempt to win over hutu in rwanda before assaulting kigali whereas bayingana and fellow subcommander chris bunyenyezi wished to strike hard and fast to achieve power as soon as possible argument boiled over causing bayingana to shoot rwigyema dead another senior rpf officer stephen witnessed this shooting and informed president museveni museveni sent his brother salim saleh to investigate and saleh ordered bayingana and bunyenyezi s arrest and eventual execution when news of rpf offensive broke habyarimana requested assistance from france in fighting invasion french president s son jean christophe mitterrand was head of government s africa cell and promised to send troops on night of 4 october gunfire was heard in kigali in a mysterious attack which was attributed to rpf commandos attack was most likely staged by rwandan authorities seeking to convince french that regime was in imminent danger as a result 600 french soldiers arrived in rwanda following day twice as many as initially pledged french operation was code named noroit and its official purpose was to protect french nationals in reality mission was to support habyarimana s regime and french parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking rpf advance to capital and kigali international airport belgium and zaire also sent troops to kigali in early october belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend country s citizens living in rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger instead deployment created a political controversy as news reached brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with underlying causes of war faced with a growing domestic dispute over issue and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace belgian government withdrew its troops by beginning of november belgium provided no further military support to habyarimana government zairian president mobutu sese seko s contribution was to send several hundred troops of elite special presidential division dsp unlike french zairian troops went straight to front line and began fighting rpf but their discipline was poor zairian soldiers raped rwandan civilians in north of country and looted their homes prompting habyarimana to expel them back to zaire within a week of their arrival with french assistance and benefiting from loss of rpf morale after rwigyema s death rwandan army enjoyed a major tactical advantage by end of october they had regained all ground taken by rpf and pushed rebels all way back to ugandan border many soldiers deserted some crossed back into uganda and others went into hiding in akagera national park habyarimana accused ugandan government of supplying rpf establishing a rear command for group in kampala and flagging off invasion rwandan government announced on 30 october that war was over rwandan government used attack on kigali on 4 october as pretext for arbitrary arrest of more than 8 000 mostly tutsi political opponents tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion radio rwanda aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 october in a commune in gisenyi province killing 383 tutsi it was first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against tutsi were perpetrated as anti tutsi violence under habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point kagame s reorganisation of rpf thumb virunga mountains rpf base from 1990 to 1991 alt photograph of a lake with one of virunga mountains behind partially in cloud paul kagame was still in united states at time of outbreak of war attending military training course in fort leavenworth he and rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in kansas planning final details for october invasion at end of september kagame informed college that he was leaving course and was settling his affairs ready to return to africa as invasion began college allowed him to leave with several textbooks which he later used in planning tactics for war when kagame learned of rwigyema s death on 5 october he departed immediately to take command of rpf troops he flew through london and addis ababa to entebbe airport where he was given safe passage by a friend in ugandan secret service police considered arresting him but with museveni out of country and no specific orders they allowed him to pass ugandan associates drove kagame to border and he crossed into rwanda early on 15 october rpf were in disarray by time kagame arrived with troop morale very low he later described his arrival as one of worst experiences of his life troops lacked organisation following rwigyema s death and were demoralised after their losses in war kagame was well known to rpf troops many of whom had fought with him in ugandan army and they welcomed his arrival in field he spent following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers by end of october with rpf forced back to ugandan border kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting he therefore withdrew most of army from north eastern rwanda moving them to virunga mountains kagame knew that rugged terrain of virungas offered protection from attacks even if rpf s position was discovered march west took almost a week during which soldiers crossed border into uganda several times with permission of president museveni taking advantage of personal friendships between rpf soldiers and their ex colleagues in ugandan army meanwhile some rpf soldiers remained as a decoy to carry out small scale attacks on rwandan army who remained unaware of front s relocation reorientation towards guerrilla warfare began with a raid on a rwandan customs post across border from following attack rwandan government accused uganda of deliberately sheltering rpf rpf s new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on rwandan army which reacted by shelling ugandan territory ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred and there were reports of rwandan troops crossing border to loot and abduct locals conditions in virungas were very harsh for rpf at an altitude of almost there was no ready availability of food or supplies and lacking warm clothing several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in high altitude cold climate kagame spent next two months reorganising army without carrying out any military operations alexis a hutu colonel who had worked with habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile joined rpf and was appointed chairman of organisation another hutu seth sendashonga became rpf s liaison with rwandan opposition parties most of other senior recruits at time were ugandan based tutsi personnel numbers grew steadily volunteers coming from exile communities in burundi zaire and other countries kagame maintained tight discipline in his army enforcing a regimented training routine as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in community refrain from alcohol and drugs and to establish a good reputation for rpf amongst local population rpf punished personnel who broke these rules sometimes with beatings while more serious offences such as murder rape and desertion were punishable by death rpf carried out a major fundraising programme spearheaded by financial commissioner in kampala they received donations from tutsi exiles around world as well as from businessmen within rwanda who had fallen out with government sums involved were not enormous but with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives rpf was able to grow its operational capability it obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources including open market taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at end of cold war it is likely they also received weaponry from officers in ugandan army according to gerard prunier ugandans who had fought with kagame in bush war remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to rpf museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with international community museveni later said that faced with a fait accompli situation by our rwandan brothers uganda went to help rpf materially so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to tutsi people of rwanda and would not have been good for uganda s stability journalist justus reported that taking of military equipment by deserted tutsi members of ugandan army meant that national arsenal nearly got depleted he suspected that war must have had a tremendous financial impact on ugandan government especially uganda s military budget costing country trillions of shillings attack on ruhengeri january 1991 thumb town of ruhengeri with virunga mountains in background alt photograph of ruhengeri rwanda with buildings a street and people visible and mountains in background partially in cloud after three months of regrouping kagame decided in january 1991 that rpf was ready to fight again target for first attack was northern city of ruhengeri south of virunga mountains city was only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from virungas while maintaining an element of surprise kagame also favoured an attack on ruhengeri for cultural reasons president habyarimana as well as his wife and her powerful family came from north west of rwanda and most rwandans regarded region as heartland of regime an attack there guaranteed that population would become aware of rpf s presence and kagame hoped this would destabilise government during night of 22 january seven hundred rpf fighters descended from mountains into hidden locations around city assisted by rpf sympathisers living in area they attacked on morning of 23 january rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against invasion rwandan police and army succeeded in briefly repelling invasion in areas around their stations killing large numbers of rebel fighters in process it is likely rwandan army forces were assisted by french troops as french government later rewarded around fifteen french paratroopers for having taken part in rearguard by noon defending forces were defeated and rpf held whole city most of civilian population fled one of principal rpf targets in ruhengeri was prison which was rwanda s largest when he learnt of invasion warden telephoned government in kigali to request instructions he spoke to colonel elie sagatwa one of akazu who ordered him to kill every inmate in prison to avoid escape and defections during fighting he also wanted to prevent high profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with rpf refused to obey even after sagatwa called him and repeated order having confirmed it with president eventually rpf stormed buildings and prisoners were liberated several prisoners were recruited into rpf including theoneste a former close ally of president habyarimana who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980 rpf forces held ruhengeri through afternoon of 23 january before withdrawing into mountains for night raid undermined rwandan government s claims that rpf had been ejected from country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from uganda government sent troops to city following day and a state of emergency was declared with strict curfews in ruhengeri and surrounding area rpf raided city almost every night for several months fighting with rwandan army forces and country was back at war for first time since october invasion guerrilla war 1991 1992 following action in ruhengeri rpf again began to wage guerrilla war rwandan army massed troops across north of country occupying key positions and shelling rpf hideouts in virunga mountains but mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all out assault paul kagame s troops attacked rwandan army forces repeatedly and frequently keen to ensure that diplomatic and psychological effect of rpf s resurgence was not lost kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across north of country to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place this low intensity war continued for many months both sides launching successful attacks on other and neither able to gain upper hand in war rpf made some territorial gains including capturing border town of this was significant as it blocked rwanda s access to port of mombasa via northern corridor forcing all trade to go through tanzania via longer and costlier central corridor by late 1991 rpf controlled 5 of rwanda setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near byumba province many hutu civilians in areas captured by rpf fled to government held areas creating a large population of internally displaced persons in country renewed warfare had two effects in rwanda first was a resurgence of violence against tutsi still in country hutu activists killed up to 1 000 tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials starting with slaughter of 30 60 tutsi pastoralists near and then moving south and west to ruhengeri and gisenyi these attacks continued until june 1991 when government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as kigali akazu also began a major propaganda campaign broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade hutu population that tutsi were a separate and alien people non christians seeking to re establish old rwandan feudal monarchy with final goal of enslaving hutu this included hutu ten commandments a set of rules published in magazine mandating hutu supremacy in all aspects of rwandan life in response rpf opened its own propaganda radio station radio which broadcast from uganda into rwanda this was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993 second development was that president habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi party politics into country following intense pressure from international community including his most loyal ally france habyarimana had originally promised this in mid 1990 and opposition groups had formed in months since including republican democratic movement mdr social democratic party psd and liberal party pl but one party state law had remained in place in mid 1991 habyarimana officially allowed multi party politics to begin a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with rpf but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and country was notionally moving towards a multi party inclusive cabinet with proper representation but progress was continually hampered by regime last opposition party to form was coalition for defence of republic cdr which was more hardline hutu than habyarimana s own party and had close links to akazu progress remained slow in 1991 and 1992 a cabinet set up in october 1991 contained almost no opposition and administrative hierarchy across country only recognised authority of habyarimana s national republican movement for democracy and development party another one party cabinet was announced in january 1992 which prompted large scale protests in kigali forcing habyarimana to make real concessions he announced his intention to negotiate with rpf and formed a multi party cabinet in april this was still dominated by habyarimana s party but with opposition figures in some key positions opposition members of this cabinet met with rpf and negotiated a ceasefire in july 1992 rebels agreed to stop fighting and parties began peace negotiations in tanzanian city of arusha peace process 1992 1993 peace process was complicated by fact that four distinct groups were involved each with its own agenda hutu hardliners centred around family of agathe habyarimana were represented by cdr as well as extremists within president s own mrnd party second group was official opposition which excluded cdr they had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of rpf whom they saw as trying to upset democratic policy of hutu rule established in 1959 revolution third group was rpf paul kagame engaged with peace process against advice of some of his senior officers in knowledge that many of those on other side of table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations he feared that shunning opportunity for peace would weaken rpf politically and lose them international goodwill finally there was group representing president habyarimana himself who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could this meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution but privately obstructing process and trying to delay change to status quo for as long as possible habyarimana recognised danger posed to him by radical hutu faction and attempted in mid 1992 to remove them from senior army positions this effort was only partially successful akazu affiliates augustin and theoneste bagosora remained in influential posts providing them with a link to power delegates at negotiations in arusha made some progress in latter half of 1992 despite wrangling between habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised government officials negotiating power in august parties agreed a pluralistic transitional government which would include rpf cdr and hardline faction of mrnd reacted violently to this feeling sidelined by developing arusha process they began killing tutsi civilians in kibuye area 85 were killed and 500 homes burnt historian gerard prunier names late 1992 as time when idea of a genocidal final solution to kill every tutsi in rwanda was first mooted hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within official organs of state including army from which they hoped to effect a move away from more conciliatory tone adopted by habyarimana and moderate opposition their goal was to take over from habyarimana s government as perceived source of power in country amongst hutu masses to maintain line that rpf and tutsi more generally were a threat to hutu freedoms and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in arusha situation deteriorated in early 1993 when teams in arusha signed a full power sharing agreement dividing government positions between mrnd rpf and other major opposition parties but excluding cdr this government was supposed to rule country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held agreement reflected balance of power at time habyarimana mainstream opposition and rpf all accepted it but cdr and hardline mrnd officers were violently opposed mrnd national secretary mathieu announced that party would not respect agreement contradicting president and party s negotiators in arusha mrnd hardliners organised demonstrations across country and mobilised their supporters within army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred violence engulfed whole north west of rwanda and lasted for six days many houses were burned and hundreds of tutsi killed rpf offensive february 1993 thumb upright 1 5 partition of rwanda following rpf offensive in february 1993 for first time rwandan government acknowledged that it had lost part of country alt map showing partition of rwanda between government rpf and demilitarised zones paul kagame responded by pulling out of arusha process and resuming war ending six month cease fire rpf cited cdr and mrnd hardliner violence as its reason for this but according to foreign policy scholar bruce d jones offensive may actually have been intended primarily to increase rebels bargaining power at peace talks next subject for negotiations was proportion of troops and officers to be allocated to each side in new unified army by demonstrating its military power in field through a successful offensive against rwandan government forces rpf was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in agreement rpf began its offensive on 8 february fighting southwards from territory it already held in rwanda s northern border regions in contrast to october 1990 and 1991 1992 campaigns rpf advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from rwandan army forces likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within government forces impact of long running war on economy and a heavy devaluation of rwandan franc had left government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly armed forces had also expanded rapidly at one point growing from less than 10 000 troops to almost 30 000 in one year new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians rpf advance continued unchecked in february its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition they took ruhengeri on first day of fighting and later city of byumba local hutu civilians fled en masse from areas rpf were taking most of them ending up in refugee camps on outskirts of kigali civilian cost of offensive is unclear according to andre several thousand were killed while prunier labelled rpf killing as small scale this violence alienated rebels from their potential allies in democratic rwandan opposition parties when it became clear that rwandan army was losing ground to rpf habyarimana requested urgent assistance from france fearing that rpf could soon be in a position to seize kigali french immediately dispatched 150 troops to rwanda along with arms and ammunition to bolster rwandan army forces a further 250 french soldiers were sent on 20 february arrival of french troops in kigali significantly changed military situation on ground rpf now found themselves under attack french shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards by 20 february rpf had advanced to within of capital kigali and many observers believed an assault on city was imminent assault did not take place and rpf instead declared a cease fire whether or not rpf intended to advance on capital is unknown kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on rwandan army forces capture their weapons and gain ground slowly but not to attack capital or seek to end war with an outright rpf victory kagame told journalist and author stephen kinzer that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards rpf and led to charges that war had simply been a bid to replace hutu state with a tutsi one increased presence of french troops and fierce loyalty of hutu population to government meant that an invasion of kigali would not have been achieved with same ease that rpf had conquered north fighting for capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation several of kagame s senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them by end of february war over one million civilians mostly hutu had left their homes in country s largest exodus to date arusha accords and rise of hutu power 1993 1994 thumb arusha international conference centre venue for peace talks to end war alt photograph showing front entrance of arusha international conference centre rpf cease fire was followed by two days of negotiations in ugandan capital kampala attended by rpf leader paul kagame and involving president museveni and representatives of european nations europeans insisted that rpf forces withdraw to zone they had held before february offensive kagame responded that he would only agree to this if rwandan army were forbidden from re entering newly conquered territory following a threat by kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory two sides reached a compromise deal this entailed rpf withdrawing to its pre february territory but also mandated setting up of a demilitarised zone between rpf area and rest of country deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by habyarimana s regime of northern zone to rebels recognising rpf hold on that territory there were many within rpf senior command who felt that kagame had ceded too much because deal meant not only withdrawal to pre february boundaries but also a promise not to encroach on demilitarised zone this therefore ended rpf ambitions of capturing more territory kagame used authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of rpf to override these concerns and parties returned once more to negotiating table in arusha despite agreement and ongoing negotiations president habyarimana supported by french government spent subsequent months forging a common front against rpf this included members of his own party and cdr and also factions from each of other opposition parties in power sharing coalition at same time other members of same parties issued a statement in conjunction with rpf in which they condemned french involvement in country and called for arusha process to be respected in full hardline factions within parties became known as hutu power a movement which transcended party politics apart from cdr there was no party that was exclusively part of power movement instead almost every party was split into moderate and power wings with members of both camps claiming to represent legitimate leadership of that party even ruling party contained a power wing consisting of those who opposed habyarimana s intention to sign a peace deal several radical youth militia groups emerged attached to power wings of parties these included interahamwe which was attached to ruling party and cdr s youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across country army trained militias sometimes in conjunction with french who were unaware of fact that training they provided was being used to perpetrate mass killings by june president habyarimana had come to view hutu power rather than mainstream opposition as biggest threat to his leadership this led him to change tactics and engage fully with arusha peace process giving it impetus it needed to draw to a completion according to prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to opposition and rpf than he could if hutu power were allowed to disrupt peace process negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult twice talks almost collapsed rwandan government wanted to allocate only 15 of officer corps to rpf reflecting proportion of tutsi in country while rpf was arguing for a 50 50 split rpf were in a superior position following their successful february campaign and were backed in their demands by tanzania which was chairing talks government eventually agreed to their demands as well as 50 of officer corps rpf was allocated up to 40 of non command troops deal also mandated large scale demobilisation of 35 000 rwandan army and 20 000 rpf soldiers at time of accords only 19 000 would be drafted into new national army with all details agreed arusha accords were finally signed on 4 august 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by president habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries an uneasy peace was once again entered into which would last until 7 april of following year agreement called for a united nations peacekeeping force this was titled united nations assistance mission for rwanda unamir and was in place in rwanda by october 1993 under command of canadian general romeo dallaire another stipulation of agreement was that rpf would station diplomats in kigali at conseil national de cnd now known as chamber of deputies rwanda s parliament building these men were protected by 600 1 000 rpf soldiers who arrived in kigali through unamir s operation clean corridor in december 1993 meanwhile hutu power wings of various parties were beginning plans for a genocide president of burundi melchior who had been elected in june as country s first ever hutu president was assassinated by extremist tutsi army officers in october 1993 assassination reinforced notion among hutus that tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted cdr and power wings of other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage idea of a final solution which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint was now top of their agenda an informant from interahamwe told unamir officials that a group of hutu extremists were planning on disrupting peace process and killing tutsis in kigali military operations during 1994 genocide thumb upright 1 5 map showing advance of rpf during rwandan genocide of 1994 alt map showing advance of rpf during rwandan genocide of 1994 cease fire ended abruptly on 6 april 1994 when president habyarimana s plane was shot down near kigali airport killing both habyarimana and new president of burundi cyprien ntaryamira pair were returning home from a regional summit in dar es salaam at which leaders of kenya uganda and tanzania had urged habyarimana to stop delaying implementation of arusha accords attackers remain unknown prunier in his book written shortly after incident concluded that it was most likely a coup carried out by extreme hutu members of habyarimana s government this theory was disputed in 2006 by french judge jean louis bruguiere and in 2008 by spanish judge fernando andreu both alleged that kagame and rpf were responsible at end of 2010 french government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry which employed ballistics experts this report reaffirmed initial theory that hutu extremists assassinated habyarimana shooting down of plane served as catalyst for rwandan genocide which began within a few hours a crisis committee was formed by military headed by colonel theoneste bagosora which refused to recognise prime minister agathe uwilingiyimana as leader even though she was legally next in line of political succession un commander general dallaire labelled this a coup and insisted that uwilingiyimana be placed in charge but bagosora refused presidential guard killed uwilingiyimana and her husband during night along with ten belgian unamir soldiers charged with her protection and other prominent moderate politicians and journalists crisis committee appointed an interim government still effectively controlled by bagosora which began ordering systematic killing of huge numbers of tutsi as well as some politically moderate hutu through well planned attacks over course of approximately 100 days between 500 000 and 1 000 000 were killed on 7 april as genocide started rpf commander paul kagame warned interim government and united nations peacekeepers that he would resume civil war if killing did not stop next day rwandan army forces attacked national parliament building from several directions but rpf troops stationed there successfully fought back rpf then crossed demilitarised zone from their territory in north and began an attack on three fronts leaving their opponents unsure of their true intentions or whether an assault on kigali was imminent kagame refused to talk to interim government believing that it was just a cover for bagosora s rule and not committed to ending genocide over next few days rpf moved steadily south through eastern part of country capturing gabiro and large areas of countryside to north and east of kigali their unit stationed in kigali was isolated from rest of their forces but a unit of young soldiers successfully crossed government held territory to link up with them they avoided attacking kigali or byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle cities and cut off supply routes rpf also allowed tutsi refugees from uganda to settle behind front line in rpf controlled areas in april there were numerous attempts by united nations forces to establish a cease fire but kagame insisted each time that rpf would not stop fighting unless killings stopped in late april rpf secured whole of tanzanian border area and began to move west from kibungo to south of kigali they encountered little resistance except around kigali and ruhengeri by 16 may they had cut road between kigali and gitarama temporary home of interim government and by 13 june had taken gitarama itself taking of gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by rwandan army forces to reopen road interim government was forced to relocate to gisenyi in far north west as well as fighting war kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand rpf new recruits included tutsi survivors of genocide and rwandan tutsi refugees who had been living in burundi but they were less well trained and disciplined than earlier recruits in late june 1994 france launched operation turquoise a un mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for displaced persons refugees and civilians in danger from bases in zairian cities of goma and bukavu french entered south western rwanda and established turquoise zone within kibuye triangle an area occupying approximately a fifth of rwanda radio france international estimates that turquoise saved around 15 000 lives but with genocide coming to an end and rpf s ascendancy many rwandans interpreted turquoise as a mission to protect hutu from rpf including some who had participated in genocide french remained hostile to rpf and their presence held up rpf s advance in south west of country operation turquoise remained in rwanda until 21 august 1994 having completed encirclement of kigali rpf spent latter half of june fighting for capital rwandan army forces had superior manpower and weapons but rpf steadily gained territory and conducted raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines according to dallaire this success was due to kagame s being a master of psychological warfare he exploited fact that rwandan army were concentrating on genocide rather than fight for kigali and exploited government s loss of morale as it lost territory rpf finally defeated rwandan army in kigali on 4 july and on 18 july took gisenyi and rest of north west forcing interim government into zaire this rpf victory ended genocide as well as civil war at end of july 1994 kagame s forces held whole of rwanda except for turquoise zone in south west date of fall of kigali 4 july was later designated liberation day by rpf and is commemorated as a public holiday in rwanda un peacekeeping force unamir was in rwanda during genocide but its chapter vi mandate rendered it powerless to intervene militarily efforts by general dallaire to broker peace were unsuccessful and most of unamir s rwandan staff were killed in early days of genocide severely limiting its ability to operate its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of tutsi and moderate hutu at its headquarters in stadium as well as other secure un sites and to assist with evacuation of foreign nationals belgian government which had been one of largest troop contributors to unamir pulled out in mid april following deaths of its ten soldiers protecting prime minister in mid may un conceded that acts of genocide may have been committed and agreed to reinforcement new soldiers started arriving in june and following end of genocide in july they stayed to maintain security and stability until termination of their mission in 1996 fifteen un soldiers were killed in rwanda between april and july 1994 including ten belgians three an

allocated to it in accords military wing of rpf was renamed as rwandan patriotic army rpa and became national army paul kagame assumed dual roles of vice president of rwanda and minister of defence pasteur bizimungu a hutu who had been a civil servant under habyarimana before fleeing to join rpf was appointed president bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs but kagame remained commander in chief of army and de facto ruler of country domestic situation rwandan s infrastructure and economy suffered greatly during genocide many buildings were uninhabitable and former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled country human resources were severely depleted with over of population having fled or been killed many of remainder were traumatised most had lost relatives witnessed killings or participated in genocide long term effects of war rape included social isolation sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies and babies some women resorting to self induced abortions army led by paul kagame maintained law and order while government began work of rebuilding country s institutions and infrastructure non governmental organisations began to move back into country but international community did not provide significant assistance to new regime most international aid was routed to refugee camps which had formed in zaire following exodus of hutu from rwanda kagame strove to portray government as inclusive and not tutsi dominated he directed removal of ethnicity from citizens national identity cards and government began a policy of downplaying distinctions between hutu tutsi and twa during genocide and in months following rpf victory rpf soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting genocide many of these soldiers were recent tutsi recruits from within rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge scale scope and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed human rights watch as well as scholars such as prunier allege that death toll might be as high as 100 000 and that kagame and rpf elite either tolerated or organised killings in an interview with stephen kinzer kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control killings gained international attention after 1995 kibeho massacre in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in butare province australian soldiers serving as part of unamir estimated at least 4 000 people were killed rwandan government claimed that death toll was 338 paul kagame took over presidency from pasteur bizimungu in 2000 and began a large scale national development drive launching a programme to develop rwanda as a middle income country by 2020 country began developing strongly on key indicators including human development index health care and education annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year poverty rate reduced from 57 to 45 between 2006 and 2011 and life expectancy rose from 46 6 years in 2000 to 64 3 years in 2018 a period of reconciliation began as well as establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects these included international criminal tribunal for rwanda and gacaca a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle large involved refugee crisis insurgency and congo wars thumb refugee camp in zaire 1994 alt view of refugee camp on foggy day showing tents of various colours and refugees following rpf victory approximately two million hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries particularly zaire fearing rpf reprisals for rwandan genocide camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics including cholera and dysentery they were set up by united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr but were effectively controlled by army and government of former hutu regime including many leaders of genocide who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in rwanda by late 1996 hutu militants from camps were launching regular cross border incursions and rpf led rwandan government launched a counter offensive rwanda provided troops and military training to banyamulenge a tutsi group in zairian south kivu province helping them to defeat zairian security forces rwandan forces banyamulenge and other zairian tutsi then attacked refugee camps targeting hutu militia these attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee many returned to rwanda despite presence of rpf while others ventured further west into zaire refugees fleeing further into zaire were relentlessly pursued by rpa under cover of afdl rebellion killing an estimated 232 000 people defeated forces of former regime continued a cross border insurgency campaign supported initially by predominantly hutu population of rwanda s north western provinces by 1999 a programme of propaganda and hutu integration into national army succeeded in bringing hutu to government side and insurgency was defeated as well as dismantling refugee camps kagame began planning a war to remove mobutu mobutu had supported genocidaires based in camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on tutsi people within zaire rwandan and ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by laurent desire kabila which began waging first congo war rebels quickly took control of north and south kivu provinces and then advanced west gaining territory from poorly organised and demotivated zairian army with little fighting they controlled whole country by may 1997 mobutu fled into exile and country was renamed democratic republic of congo drc rwanda fell out with new congolese regime in 1998 and kagame supported a fresh rebellion leading to second congo war this lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage a 2010 united nations report accused rwandan patriotic army of
