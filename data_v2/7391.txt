typhoon sudal known in philippines as typhoon cosme was strongest typhoon to strike island of yap in federated states of micronesia fsm in about 50 years yap is one of four administrative divisions of fsm entire island only in length experienced typhoon force winds and 90 of structures were damaged or destroyed damage was most severe in southeastern yap where eyewall struck and winds exceeded 185 km h 115 mph but center of typhoon passed south of island typhoon sudal originally formed on april 2 2004 out of a persistent area of convection east of fsm it moved mostly westward for first week of its duration with brief northerly and southwesterly turns sudal attained tropical storm status on april 5 and it gradually intensified into a typhoon which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119 km h 74 mph and is equivalent of a hurricane in atlantic ocean on april 9 it passed just south of yap and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240 km h 150 mph later sudal moved to northwest and eventually to northeast becoming an extratropical cyclone on april 16 and dissipating two days later in addition to damage on yap typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in chuuk in federated states of micronesia where some minor crop damage occurred sudal also brushed united states islands of guam and rota with high waves and light rainfall and later moved very close to uninhabited japanese island of iwo jima overall damage was 14 million 2004 usd 16 1 million 2010 usd most of which was on yap although no fatalities or serious injuries were reported due to heavy damage name was retired and replaced with mirinae name sudal was contributed by south korea for pacific tropical cyclone list and is korean name for otter meteorological history origins of typhoon sudal were from a persistent area of convection or thunderstorms southeast of pohnpei in federated states of micronesia toward end of march 2004 initially it was in an area of high wind shear which is change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis unfavorable conditions gradually abated which allowed convection to increase over a broad developing circulation center on april 2 japan meteorological agency jma classified system as a weak tropical depression near chuuk in fsm it was later classified with international designation of 0401 meaning it was first tropical cyclone of 2004 slow development continued as system moved slowly westward and two days later it was classified as tropical depression 03w by joint typhoon warning center jtwc this was third tropical cyclone tracked by agency shortly thereafter jtwc upgraded depression to tropical storm status after convection increased over circulation while steadily intensifying system turned toward north on april 5 jma named system sudal after assessing its maximum sustained winds at 65 km h 40 mph 10 min sustained concurrently jtwc estimated winds of 100 km h 65 km h 1 min sustained after crossing over island of a building ridge to north caused sudal to turn west southwestward on april 6 an eye feature began forming and jtwc upgraded sudal to typhoon strength about southeast of guam a small island under possession of united states jma did not follow suit until late following day by which time eye had become more distinct around that time typhoon turned toward northwest and initially it was thought that sudal would pass safely north of yap in fsm instead it turned to west southwest toward island as ridge intensified on april 8 typhoon intensified rapidly jtwc reported winds of 215 km h 135 mph 1 min sustained or equivalent of a category 4 on saffir simpson hurricane scale weakening slightly as its forward motion slowed typhoon sudal passed about south of yap at 0000 utc on april 9 which was its closest approach to island intensification continued throughout day on april 9 with appearance of concentric eyewalls on satellite imagery such a feature is indicative of an intense tropical cyclone early on april 10 jtwc estimated that sudal attained peak winds of 240 km h 150 mph 1 min sustained making cyclone a super typhoon at same time jma estimated peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph 10 min sustained as well as a barometric pressure of 940 mbar 27 76 inhg also on that day sudal entered area of warning responsibility of philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa which provided name cosme for local advisories for several days typhoon continued to northwest fluctuating in intensity but remaining powerful on april 12 sudal turned toward north and northeast through a weakness in ridge and its eye increased to a diameter of about next day typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 230 km h 145 mph 1 min sustained although it gradually weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper level wind shear and cooler water temperatures right thumb eye of typhoon sudal striking yap on april 9 early on april 15 sudal passed very near uninhabited japanese island of iwo jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon at time its circulation center was exposed from deepest convection shortly thereafter both jtwc and jma downgraded sudal to tropical storm status late on april 15 jtwc assessed storm as becoming extratropical although jma maintained advisories until following day as an extratropical storm sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on april 18 well east of japan and far south of aleutian islands impact thumb left damage wrought by storm on yap early in its duration as a weak tropical storm sudal passed near chuuk state in federated states of micronesia fsm one station reported 17 cm 6 68 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period passage of storm left minor roof damage and some crop damage due to storm surge contaminating groundwater no deaths or injuries were reported in state storm briefly threatened guam and as it passed south of island sudal produced 5 5 m 18 ft waves and a 0 9 m 3 ft storm surge a station at apra harbor recorded a 69 km h 43 mph wind gust and light rainfall of around was reported although no damage was reported on island high waves also occurred on rota in northern mariana islands fsm is an independent nation in compact of free association with united states and latter nation is responsible for aid and protection further west typhoon sudal intensified quickly as it moved through caroline islands and later yap state on ulithi a wind gust of 132 km h 82 mph was reported and 6 34 inches of rainfall occurred in a 24 hour period high waves of over 5 m 18 ft struck island causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes on nearby and fais islands similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported small atoll received gale force winds and heavy rainfall which destroyed half of island s water storage tanks later in its duration sudal passed near iwo jima producing wind gusts of 141 km h 87 mph yap worst of damage occurred on island of yap initially typhoon was expected to pass north of island without affecting it significantly but instead island experienced brunt of storm typhoon affected island in previous year from which islanders were still recovering with last minute change in direction government officials rushed to complete preparations on island on day before typhoon struck storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand winds of sudal in anticipation of significant damage yap officials sent a request to fsm government for emergency aid to clean up after storm thumb right a home completely destroyed by sudal on yap on april 9 eye of sudal briefly passed over southern portion of island and winds of 185 km h 115 mph struck island for about four hours entire island only in length experienced typhoon force winds yap international airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181 km h 112 mph a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on island reached 226 km h 140 mph heavy rainfall occurred during sudal s passage including 20 0 cm 7 88 inches in a 48 hour period at airport lowest pressure on island was along coast typhoon produced waves of 6 7 m 22 ft in height along with a 3 7 m 12 ft storm surge combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged island s coral reefs latter which is one of yap s primary tourism attractions when typhoon sudal struck island there were about 8 000 people living on yap with about 1 700 houses typhoon destroyed 700 homes and left another 900 damaged many of destroyed homes were wooden damage was heaviest in southeastern portion of island including in and around colonia capital city strong winds downed trees across island over 90 of structures on island were damaged or destroyed including hospital airport most government facilities and water power and communications systems one of five hotels on island was also destroyed about 80 of residents lost power or water after storm in southeastern portion of island high waves wrecked most of coastal homes and also severely damaged seawall intrusion of salt water destroyed almost all of food crops on island following typhoon s passage about 1 000 people were left homeless and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters overall damage from typhoon sudal totaled about 14 million 2004 usd 16 1 million 2010 usd most of which on yap from property damage despite heavy damage there were no deaths although there were initial reports of one fatality only 8 people required hospital treatment due to injuries none of them serious typhoon sudal was strongest typhoon to strike yap in about 50 years aftermath thumb left emergency supplies from federal emergency management agency being unloaded from a truck to be deployed on yap following passage of sudal officials in yap declared a state of emergency and a day after typhoon struck united states president george w bush ordered federal disaster aid for fsm latter declaration provided funding for 75 of debris removal cost and emergency services less than a week after storm pacific islands forum provided 11 500 to yap for relief efforts over subsequent weeks fsm government established a typhoon relief fund of about 250 000 additionally united states government allocated 7 443 000 for relief efforts within a few days federal emergency management agency fema identified primary concerns for small island including fixing water supply distributing water clearing roads and fixing damaged shelters on island water supply was rapidly diminishing more than 80 of islanders were without clean water and water from treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time health issues included dehydration sickness and gastrointestinal problems without running water several people bathed in oil contaminated harbor where many boats sunk which caused skin initially telephone service onto island was disrupted and only method of outside contact was by radio to university of guam guam memorial hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to yap although planes containing aid flying onto island were disrupted by damaged runway about a day after sudal s passage runway was cleared and repaired which allowed a united states coast guard plane to provide relief supplies including building materials by april 12 or three days after typhoon communication links to island began to be restored by four days later water treatment plant was repaired one power station on island was repaired but since strong winds damaged most of power lines about 85 of population remained without electricity primary roadways were largely cleared and all bridges were reopened thumb right homes and businesses were destroyed across yap when typhoon sudal sent high winds and waters ashore about two weeks after typhoon s passage there were still 500 people in 18 shelters in colonia capital city as well as about 400 people in shelters elsewhere many others were either residing with relatives or staying at their damaged properties united states army corps of engineers arrived on yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators officials sent 23 flights of aid to island as well as one each to outlying islands of ulithi and fais about 76 000 litres 20 000 gallons of water were sent to island and five large water tanks were installed members of united states forest service arrived to coordinate receiving and distribution of relief supplies yap hospital was poorly suited to handle typhoon due to lack of medications or emergency medical equipment about 60 fema personnel worked at hospital who required additional items such as their own supply of water and food to prevent them from acquiring local diseases during their stay on island group assisted 163 people mostly for minor issues overall there were about 100 fema workers involved on island although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars by 26 days after storm more than half of island had power restored and cell phone system was fixed in weeks and months after passage of sudal water temperatures around yap decreased from to due to significant upwelling drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over island as well as significantly lower tides by september 2004 rebuilding was still underway and half of schools which had previously been used as shelters reopened to students power and water lines were completely restored hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof and although private businesses quickly re opened government buildings took longer to be rebuilt this was due to lengthy process of receiving aid from fema additionally officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt due to heavy damage on yap name sudal was retired during 38th session of economic and social commission for asia and pacific and world meteorological organization
