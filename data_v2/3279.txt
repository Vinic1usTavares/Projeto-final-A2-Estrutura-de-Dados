snowman is a literary fairy tale by hans christian andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove it was published by c a reitzel in copenhagen as sneemanden on 2 march 1861 andersen biographer jackie wullschlager describes tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to andersen s fir tree of december 1844 wullschlager believes snowman was product in part of andersen s pining and discontent over harald scharff a handsome young dancer at royal theatre in copenhagen according to wullschlager two men entered a relationship in early 1860s that brought poet some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness it was only homosexual affair during andersen s life that brought him happiness plot snowman begins with its eponymous hero standing in garden of a manor house watching sun set and moon rise he is only a day old and quite naive and inexperienced his sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that sun will make him run into ditch dog senses a change in

frosty weather dog warns snowman of an imminent change in weather a thaw descends and one morning snowman collapses dog finds a stove poker used to build snowman within his remains and then understands why snowman longed for stove that s what moved inside him now he is over that too girls in house sing a springtime carol and snowman is forgotten background scholars have noted andersen was attracted to both men and women during his middle years andersen biographer jackie wullschlager observes andersen s diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men andersen biographer alison prince comments it is obvious that andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others this was partly due to suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in safer and more conventional image of talented and hypersensitive poet both believe snowman has its source and inspiration in andersen s relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with royal theater in copenhagen andersen and harald scharff thumb upright left scharff as gennaro in bournonville s ballet napoli 1860 in 1857 in paris he made acquaintance of fellow dane harald scharff a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with copenhagen s royal theatre andersen was returning to copenhagen via paris following a visit to charles dickens in england and scharff was on holiday with his copenhagen housemate actor lauritz eckardt andersen and scharff toured notre dame together three years passed before andersen again met pair quite by accident in bavaria in july 1860 three men enjoyed a week together in munich and its environs it is probable that andersen fell in love with scharff at this time according to his diary andersen did not feel at all well when two young men left munich on 9 july 1860 for salzburg day after their departure andersen who usually thought of himself as ugly had his photograph taken by franz hanfstaengl and wrote i ve never seen such a lovely yet life like portrait of myself i was completely surprised astonished that sunlight could make such a beautiful figure of my face following departure of scharff and eckardt for salzburg andersen traveled to switzerland but grew despondent and then depressed in november he returned to copenhagen and spent christmas at basnaes estate of an aristocratic patron and friend on coast of zealand his spirits lifted with holiday festivities and snowman was composed on new year s eve 1860 it was published with several other new tales by andersen two months later on 2 march 1861 in new fairy tales and stories second series first collection 1861 by copenhagen publisher c a reitzel thumb basnaes estate where andersen wrote snowman andersen s relationship with scharff continued to develop and early in 1862 two entered a relationship that brought andersen joy some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness andersen referred to this time in his life as his erotic period but he was not discreet in his conduct with scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly onlookers regarded relationship as improper and ridiculous affair came to an end late in 1863 as scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with eckardt who had married an actress andersen noted in his diary 13 november 1863 scharff has not visited me in eight days with him it is over andersen took end of affair calmly and two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness andersen tried several times to lure scharff into another intimate relationship but without success while on holiday for example andersen and scharff were forced to spend night in helsingor andersen reserved a double room for them both but scharff insisted upon having his own andersen continued to follow scharff s career with interest but in 1871 an injury during rehearsal forced scharff permanently from ballet stage scharff tried acting without success married a ballerina in 1874 and died in st hans insane asylum in 1912 commentaries andersen retained story ideas in his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life and telling stories such as snowman was a compulsion with him tale has been described as poignant and lyrical and as a self mocking autobiographical revelation in which andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning unreciprocated pain and that he would end his life and alone light hearted snowman is a complement to andersen s tragic fir tree and in telling tale andersen returns to his earlier tragicomic mode of sketching fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form thumb left an illustration c 1870 from snowman he had been born amid triumphant shouts of boys and welcomed by jingling of sleigh bells and cracking of whips from passing sleighs snowman h c andersen translated by jean hersholt 1949 andersen referred to snowman as a simple fairy tale but story may be viewed as a metaphor for life snowman remains frozen to ground questioning fate existence and all that he sees and experiences in this respect snowman shares a common bond with hamlet both grope for what is hidden for real behind surface but there similarities end scholars jackie wullschlager and alison prince argue that andersen s tales are expressions of his homosexuality and graham robb author of strangers homosexual love in 19th century calls his work an aesop of 19th century homosexuality and many of his heroes victims of an unpopular sexual preference snowman is a tale about misguided love about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove and is andersen s best argument for price paid for falling in love with wrong type with stove representing danger in this wrong relationship andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only pain of unreciprocated love his diaries reveal andersen resorted to masturbation as a sexual outlet and one critic notes that andersen so fabulously struck out with ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets andersen biographer alison prince believes tale to be a parable representing different kinds of love when snowman asks dog why a young man and woman stroll about wintry garden hand in hand disillusioned old dog tells him two are engaged and will soon be moving into same kennel together and sharing each other s bones snowman has a different idea of love being enamored of stove prince considers image of poker found within snowman s remains a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems references notes
