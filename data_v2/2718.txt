pratt saldana gillan klementieff bautista debicki and russell promoting film at 2016 san diego comic con chris pratt as peter quill star lord half human half celestial leader of guardians of galaxy who was abducted from earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called ravagers pratt who returns as part of a multi film contract with marvel said quill is now famous throughout galaxy for having saved so many people he feels like he s part of this group a leader of this group he s a little more responsible and trying to stay out of trouble but not necessarily doing best job pratt stated that working on film forced him to come to terms with death of his own father wyatt once again portrays a young quill zoe saldana as gamora a member of guardians and an orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes she was trained by thanos to be his personal assassin saldana described gamora s role in team as voice of reason saying she s surrounded by all these dudes who are so stupid half time and added that she is mom of team saying that she is just a meticulous detailed professional individual regarding gamora s relationship with nebula saldana described it as volatile and added we re starting somewhere very crazy but appropriate given where we had ended things off in first installment dave bautista as drax destroyer a member of guardians and highly skilled warrior bautista waited for final version of script to not take away from magic which he felt had happened when he read early drafts of first film he added that i wasn t crazy about my part in vol 2 initially it went a different direction than what i thought they were going to go with drax noting he did not think drax was that significant in film part clicked for bautista after table read with other cast bautista called drax more funny driven than in first film and having a sense of innocence and heartbreak about him despite most people s first perception of drax that he s just a big muscly brute bautista s makeup took only 90 minutes to apply down from four hours for first film he would have to sit in a sauna at end of day to get makeup off after his makeup test was found to be too abrasive vin diesel as baby groot a member of guardians who is a tree like humanoid and accomplice of rocket character began growing from a sapling at end of first film with james gunn intending for him to be fully grown by sequel gunn eventually decided to keep him as baby groot which was one of reasons film is set only a few months after first gunn described baby groot as son of groot from first film with diesel explaining that we re going to see this goofy adorable baby groot just kinda learning as he goes prop master russell bobbitt created a 1 1 scale model of baby groot for filming to use as a lighting reference and sometimes as a puppet for actors to interact with as groot only communicates with phrase i am groot in different inflections gunn created a groot version of script for himself and diesel which contains each of groot s lines in english diesel used a higher register of his voice for baby groot which was pitched up by seven to nine semitones depending on take he also delivered lines slowly to avoid any time stretching issues diesel recorded groot s voice for sixteen foreign language releases of film up from six in first film sean gunn provided on set reference for adolescent groot in post credit sequence bradley cooper as rocket a member of guardians who is a genetically engineered raccoon based bounty hunter mercenary and master of weapons and battle tactics sean gunn once again served as stand in for character during filming with cooper s performance also referenced sean gunn said that rocket has same sort of crisis of faith that he had in first film about whether or not he belongs in this family with james gunn adding this is really about rocket coming to terms with accepting his place within a group of people which probably seemed like a good idea when they were heroes together at end of first film but now he s just not very comfortable with idea feige stated that relationship between rocket and groot has changed saying groot was rocket s protector in first movie and now rocket is groot s protector michael rooker as yondu udonta a blue skinned buccaneer of ravagers who is a fatherly figure to quill and member of guardians he is also former deputy to ayesha yondu has a larger head fin in film to look closer to his comic counterpart and rooker worked with prosthetic department to add gaps to his prosthetic teeth just like real teeth to aid him in whistling as character rooker explained that for sequel gunn wanted people to experience more in depth what yondu was thinking and how he s feeling a more serious yondu rooker noted complex relationship between yondu and quill where we don t agree on things they are constantly at each other s throats but yondu truly cares about this kid gunn initially refused to end film with yondu dying saying at end of day i knew that s where it needed to go this is a story about a father s love for his son his ultimate love so much love that he sacrifices himself for that and that s what yondu is he is 100 percent peter quill s father despite ego being quill s biological father before release of vol 2 rooker spent time on set of avengers infinity war 2018 to counteract rumors that reason his character would not appear in that film was that he would die in this one karen gillan as nebula an adopted daughter of thanos who was raised with gamora as sisters and reluctant member of guardians gillan stated film would further explore sisterly relationship between nebula and gamora including their backstory and what happened to these two girls growing up and actually how awful it was for them and how it has ruined their relationship adding we re also going to start to see how much pain thanos actually caused nebula we really start to see emotional crack in her character while gillan had to shave her head for first film she only had to shave half of her head for sequel taking away underneath part and leaving top gillan s makeup took two and a half hours to apply down from five hours for first film pom klementieff as mantis a member of guardians with empathic powers who lives with ego executive producer jonathan schwartz said character has never really experienced social interaction and learns about social intricacies from other guardians klementieff added she was really lonely and by herself so it s a completely new thing to meet these people and to discover new things comparing this to a child making awkward mistakes in social situations mantis and drax have an interesting relationship in film due to both being complete odd balls steve englehart mantis s co creator was disappointed with character s portrayal saying that character has nothing to do with mantis i really don t know why you would take a character who is as distinctive as mantis is and do a completely different character and still call her mantis elizabeth debicki as ayesha golden high priestess and leader of sovereign people a genetically engineered race who are gold and perfect and wanting to be physically and mentally impeccable gunn was very specific when writing character and after casting director sarah finn suggested debicki gunn knew right away that she was one gunn highlighted actress s beauty and height debicki wore platform shoes to increase her height to chris sullivan as taserface leader of a mutinous group of ravagers gunn originally posted a photo of comic book character on his social media after landing guardians of galaxy calling him dumbest character of all time and saying he would never feature character in a film after eventually deciding to use character in sequel gunn felt character had given himself name taserface and is a real dumbass sullivan s makeup took two and a half to three and a half hours to apply each day sean gunn as kraglin yondu s second in command in ravagers kraglin has an expanded role compared to previous film sean gunn explained in first film he did a lot of just saying yes and being at yondu s side but in this movie things take a little bit of a different turn as kraglin has a little bit of a crisis of conscience and has to decide whether he s going to stick with yondu or join forces with growing faction of mutineers sylvester stallone as stakar ogord a high ranking ravager who holds a grudge against yondu stallone likened his character s relationship with yondu to a father son relationship and called confrontation they have in film pretty intense for stakar s acceptance of yondu as a ravager at end of film gunn asked stallone to channel that ll do pig line from film babe gunn described stakar as very important to marvel universe and said that it s our plan to see more of stallone in future mcu films though he was not sure then if that would include vol 3 kurt russell as ego an ancient celestial who is quill s father pratt was first to suggest to gunn that he consider russell for role he portrays an avatar of ego who is more traditionally seen in comics in his living planet form russell appreciated why he was wanted for role after seeing pratt s performance in first film feeling that s my kinda guy i know where that kind of goof comes from he added i bring right things from previous roles i connected dots from some of things i ve done in past ego replaces quill s original comic father of j son and was allowed to be used in film after 20th century fox reached a deal with marvel studios to return film rights of ego for changing power set of teenage warhead whom fox wanted to use in deadpool 2016 gunn originally thought marvel held rights to character and stated that had deal with fox not been made there was no back up plan and it would have been nearly impossible to just drop another character in given extensive work done surrounding character for film s opening sequence set in 1980 missouri aaron schwartz served as facial reference for young ego additionally reprising their roles from first film are laura haddock as meredith quill gregg henry as her father seth green as voice of howard duck and canine actor fred as cosmo members of yondu s ravager crew appearing in film include evan jones as jimmy urine as half nut stephen as brahl steve agee as gef mike escamilla as joe fria as terence as and tommy flanagan as as well as charred walls of damned drummer and howard stern show personality richard christy in a cameo appearance other members of stakar and yondu s old team based on comic s original incarnation of guardians of galaxy include michael rosenbaum as ving rhames as charlie 27 and michelle yeoh as aleta ogord also included in team are cg characters and mainframe with latter voiced in an uncredited cameo by miley cyrus rosenbaum had previously auditioned to play peter quill in vol 1 gunn cast yeoh because of his love of 1990s hong kong films and cyrus after admiring tone of her voice while watching her as a judge on voice he added that team would return in future mcu films alongside stallone s stakar stan lee appears as an informant to watchers discussing previous adventures that include his cameos in other mcu films he specifically mentions his time as a fedex delivery man referring to lee s cameo in captain america civil war 2016 this acknowledged fan theory that lee may be portraying same character in all his cameos with gunn noting that people thought stan lee is a watcher and that all of these cameos are part of him being a watcher so stan lee as a guy who is working for watchers was something that i thought was fun for mcu feige added that lee clearly exists you know above and apart from reality of all films so notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during jump gate sequence in guardians really says so wait a minute he s this same character who s popped up in all these films lee filmed several different versions of scene including an alternative where he references his role in deadpool which would have been first acknowledgment of x men film series by an mcu film gunn later admitted that civil war reference is a continuity error given vol 2 is set before events of civil war saying i screwed up i wasn t thinking but i m going to say that probably stan lee used guise of a fed ex guy more than one time david hasselhoff makes a cameo appearance as himself when ego shape shifts to his likeness while rob zombie once again has a ravager voice cameo footage of jeff goldblum dancing as grandmaster from set of thor ragnarok 2017 is used briefly during end credits with feige explaining that marvel thought it would be fun to put it in there especially since comic version of grandmaster is brother of collector who appeared in first guardians film ben browder star of series of which gunn is an avid fan cameos as a sovereign admiral molly quinn appears as howard duck s date jim gunn sr and gunn parents of james and sean gunn also make cameo appearances in film as an elderly couple on earth jimmy kimmel live s guillermo rodriguez has an uncredited cameo appearance as a police officer on earth when seedling was terraforming production development in may 2014 disney ceo bob iger stated he felt first guardians of galaxy film had strong franchise potential he added that their goal was to create another avengers james gunn who directed and co wrote first film said that he would like to return for a sequel and that he was contractually obligated to if asked next month producer kevin feige said there are places we can take franchise and we have ideas of where we d like to go based on wide array of characters worlds and storylines from comics in july 2014 guardians of galaxy co screenwriter nicole perlman confirmed a sequel saying it was going to happen due to positive internal response to first film at disney and that gunn would write and direct at san diego comic con international soon after sequel was given a release date of july 28 2017 gunn had begun work on film within a month and said it would include at least one new guardian from comics in october gunn confirmed that all five original guardians would return for sequel along with other supporting characters and release date was moved up to may 5 2017 in following months michael rooker said he would return as yondu and was looking forward to exploring new areas of character chris pratt who played peter quill star lord in first film confirmed sequel would be one of his next projects bradley cooper expressed interest and excitement when asked if he would return as rocket vin diesel also confirmed he would return as groot in march 2015 gunn revealed that filming would take place in atlanta georgia with major crew changes from first film and that his brother sean gunn would return as kraglin alongside karen gillan as nebula he explained his relationship with marvel saying company let me go and do my thing and i truly listen to their notes and ideas i ve never been told to put in any character or plot element at all when they trust you they give you a wide berth we just fit in may gunn said sequel would feature fewer characters than first film and that he had planned to introduce two major new characters in script mantis and adam warlock talks had begun with an actor gunn had in mind to portray mantis while he had decided to remove warlock due to film getting too busy explaining one of main things with guardians of galaxy is not to add a bunch of characters not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with characters and getting to know them more emotionally everything is just getting too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies gunn added i adored what we had done with him i think we did something really creative and unique with adam warlock but it was one character too many and i didn t want to lose mantis and mantis was more organically part of movie anyway he noted that warlock could appear in future guardians films and is considered a pretty important part of cosmic side of marvel cinematic universe character s future introduction is hinted at in one of film s mid credits scenes gunn noted that marvel gave him some blowback for including warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe character would be appearing in avengers infinity war and avengers endgame which was not case by including scene gunn promised marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that character would not be seen in either of avengers films writing after film s announcement gunn said he knew a lot of where i want to go in sequel having written backstory of peter quill his father and his history with yondu during making of first film with intention of exploring them in a future film gunn wanted to give sequel a different structure from first film since one of reasons people like guardians is because it s fresh and different so second one will be fresh and different from first one before starting on script gunn hoped to further explore drax nebula kraglin and collector and expand on kree and ravager culture he also hoped to introduce more female characters in sequel though wanted to avoid including earthlings such as carol danvers as well as novas richard rider or sam alexander saying i think quill being only earthling is important that serves entire movie going audience and not just handful of nova and carol danvers fans feige said exploring quill s father would certainly be part of a next guardians adventure adding i think there s a reason we seeded it at very end of first film like that gunn also stated that he wanted to make sure yondu s place in everything made sense in regards to his relationship to quill and his father and also revealed quill s father would not be j son as in comics gunn was less confident marvel was going to buy in on baby groot than including ego since adult groot was most popular character from first film and i didn t think they d want to risk a good thing however by changing groot gunn felt it opened film up creatively allowing gunn to bring out new aspects of our other characters gunn said thanos would only appear in sequel if he helps our story and he will not show up at all if not thanos is not most important thing in guardians 2 that s for damn sure there s guardians themselves and other threats guardians are going to be facing that are not thanos feige later confirmed that thanos would not appear in sequel as he was being saved for a grander return when asked about how film would connect with other phase three films in marvel cinematic universe gunn said i don t feel beholden to that stuff at all i think it s really about guardians and what they are doing gunn set film two to three months after first film because he felt group are just such fragile egos and he didn t think this story could start years later major planets visited in film include sovereign berhart and contraxia feige also stated two or three other worlds would be seen as well as a little bit of earth in this film but it s not these characters going to earth in december 2014 gunn revealed story for film was written saying it s still constantly shifting but i feel like it s pretty strong i m excited about it by early february 2015 gunn was a few short weeks away from submitting a full story treatment to marvel and said that when he first presented his idea for sequel to company they thought it was risky he described it as not really based on anything from comics being mainly an original story gunn later referred to full treatment as a scriptment a 70 page combination of a script and a treatment and it goes through every beat of movie by april he was preparing to write screenplay and in may he was hoping to complete script before he began work on experiment in june 2015 pre production thumb left upright gunn promoting guardians of galaxy vol 2 at 2016 san diego comic con on june 2 2015 gunn announced on social media that he had completed first draft of screenplay and that film s title would not simply be guardians of galaxy 2 same week he confirmed return of zoe saldana dave bautista and cooper as gamora drax and rocket respectively at end of month gunn announced film would be titled guardians of galaxy vol 2 saying he came up with a lot of titles for vol 2 but because guardians of galaxy is already so wordy it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after it i liked vol 2 best so that s what i stuck on cover of screenplay and fortunately marvel liked it in september 2015 gunn said in a facebook post that he wanted to use sneepers an alien race that first appeared in marvel comics in 1964 as background characters in film but was advised against it by marvel s legal department because name was too similar to icelandic word for clitoris marvel legal department later cleared use of sneepers in film in part because of all media coverage gunn s initial post received at end of month feige stated casting announcements would be made before end of 2015 and by end of october pom klementieff was cast as mantis also it was reported that matthew mcconaughey had recently turned down role of villain in film in favor of dark tower 2017 mcconaughey felt he would have been an amendment in vol 2 in a colorful part made for another big name actor in december gunn said that he was corresponding with john c reilly about him reprising his role as nova corpsman dey while kurt russell entered early talks to play quill s father after death of david bowie in january 2016 gunn said that there had been discussions for bowie to appear in film as a member of yondu s original crew gunn also stated that he had completed final draft of script benicio del toro who portrayed collector in first film expressed interest in portraying character again despite marvel not contacting him about sequel gunn explained that collector just didn t fit into vol 2 in early february comedian steve agee was revealed to be in film prop master russell bobbitt had difficulty finding cassette decks that had been used in first film and all of sony walkman headsets they sourced for sequel were broken sony also did not have any headsets available for filming while three pairs bobbitt found on ebay cost around 1 800 and were not exact model bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for vol 2 other props he created for film included two sets of blasters for quill with removable blaster cartridges and steampunk looking weapons and belts for ravagers bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for latter group and then 15 20 versions of those were produced to be used by various ravager actors there could be up to 85 95 ravagers per scene for their belts props team cut leather themselves rather than buying existing belts and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt a unique piece of art prop department also made edible props for certain scenes a prop of a stinkbug inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and when he bit down honey poured out of his mouth similarly a yarrow root was designed based on enlarged images of pollen and then created with non dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen filming pre shooting began on february 11 2016 at pinewood atlanta studios in fayette county georgia under working title level up with henry braham serving as cinematographer and scott chambliss as production designer gunn noted that many of crew from first film such as cinematographer ben davis and production designer charles wood signed on to work on doctor strange and due to a late change in production schedule for that film were unable to work on vol 2 principal photography began on february 17 with marvel confirming that russell had joined cast and revealing that elizabeth debicki and chris sullivan had also been cast all in undisclosed roles production used all 18 stages at pinewood atlanta an increase in stage space from what was used for first film gunn said sequel required more sets than first and our sets are very large even though a lot of film is cgi i like to have as many practical sets as we can and make environments as real as possible so it balances out cgi elements despite this gunn noted that there were less locations featured in sequel with focus instead on being more specific and detailed with fewer places shown sets constructed for film included several for sovereign planet for which chambliss used a 1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic ravager s main ship in film eclector which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360 degree view of ship as well as ability to move sections around and portray different areas of ship and iron lotus establishment on pleasure planet of contraxia which chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren t of use anymore are just left to rot creating a kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow interiors for other ships were also constructed to limit amount of blue screen actors had to interact with this includes cockpit of quill s ship that had been built for first film before being stored in london which was transported to atlanta for sequel vol 2 was first film to be shot with an 8k resolution camera red weapon 8k braham had wanted to use a different camera than alexa 65 that had been used for several other marvel films because he found it to be a very big and heavy camera he wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to alexa 65 and tested multiple options he eventually met with red employees whom he had a positive experience with working on legend of tarzan and they introduced him to an early prototype for weapon 8k he gunn and marvel decided to use camera in september 2015 when only that single prototype existed and spent three months working with red to get camera ready for filming for sequence where rocket and yondu escape from ravagers a phantom camera was used to film scenes up to 2 000 frames per second with footage able to be moved from slow motion to high speed within a single shot each shot using camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed additional scenes were also shot in imax and its aspect ratio braham filmed almost 85 percent of film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called stabileye which he called a handheld dolly which allowed a spontaneity to way camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie for filming cockpits of spaceships braham surrounded practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter environment outside ship exteriors of ships were filmed with camera on a technocrane but any shots inside cockpits again used stabileye which is so small that you can get it in there next to actors in april 2016 gunn revealed that reilly would not be part of film and stated that there were many other characters he could not include in film due to rights issues saying that 20th century fox owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters that i d love to play around with such as and kang conqueror gunn also planned on filming scenes with glenn close reprising her role as nova prime irani rael from first film when filming stan lee s cameo gunn also filmed two other cameos with lee including one for doctor strange to limit amount of travel lee had to do additional filming for vol 2 took place in cartersville georgia a state park north of portland oregon and in st charles missouri georgia international convention center served as additional soundstage space after pre production on spider man homecoming 2017 began at several pinewood atlanta soundstages principal photography wrapped on june 16 2016 post production at san diego comic con 2016 russell and debicki were revealed to be playing ego quill s father and ayesha respectively sylvester stallone was also revealed to be in film with his role later revealed as stakar ogord gunn also introduced multiple actors who were playing ravager characters since ravagers have a larger presence in film on decision to reveal russell as ego and quill s father when he did gunn felt that since people were going to figure it out eventually it was better that we took reins in our own hands and make reveal gunn also felt that this would move focus of audiences from wanting to discover who quill s father is to story and relationship that these characters have in august 2016 gunn confirmed film would feature a post credits scene later stating there would be five in total with four mid credits scenes and one post credits gunn also planned a sixth scene where ravager gef is found mortally wounded on ship but it ended up being a little confusing in november gillan revealed that film was undergoing reshoots that february it was reported that film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings highest for any marvel studios film hollywood reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non marvel movies due to marvel s specific testing process that selects its audience from a more select pool of recruits what it terms friends and families screenings in march 2017 gunn revealed that michael rosenbaum would appear in film and that gunn would provide reference for baby groot s dancing in a much bigger way than first film i actually had to do like a full day s worth of dancing to get groot s dance down this time last time it was me in front of an iphone and this time it s me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles fred raskin and craig wood returned from first film to serve as editors on scenes that were cut from film gunn said nathan fillion who had had a voice cameo in first film was going to appear as simon williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring williams including films in which he portrays arkon and tony stark gunn chose williams for fillion s cameo because he wanted fillion to have a bigger role in mcu at some point and so did not want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later gunn still considered fillion s cameo canon to mcu despite it being cut he also confirmed that close s scenes had been cut from film because it felt like he was trying to cram nova prime into second movie as opposed to having it happen organically visual effects visual effects for film were created by framestore weta digital trixter method studios animal logic scanline vfx lola vfx luma and cantina creative previsualization was done by third floor framestore created 620 shots for film weta digital created 530 method studios more than 500 and animal logic created 147 framestore once again created rocket and groot with method studios weta digital and trixter also working on rocket framestore rebuilt rocket from ground up for vol 2 giving him an updated fur simulation new facial shapes and phonemes as well as a new eye rig which came from a rig used for character from fantastic beasts and where to find them 2016 trixter s work on rocket included when he sets off a trap for ravagers additionally working on sequence when rocket yondu and kraglin jump across space other work from framestore included creatures spaceships ayesha s lair space chase eclector scenes and adolescent groot post credit scene framestore also created film s opening sequence despite appearing as a single shot it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual effect shots gunn provided reference video for baby groot s dancing in sequence framestore animation supervisor arslan elver noted that majority of opening sequence includes cgi and digital doubles with three moments quill falling on ground near baby groot gamora talking to baby groot and drax rolling behind baby groot consisting of actual photography as with first film sarofsky created typography for opening using same style from guardians of galaxy for consistency this time in rusty gold and glowing blue neon executive creative director erin sarofsky noted challenge of placing credits while sequence was being refined by framestore sarofsky proposed several different options for credits including having a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on screen but gunn did not want another character in sequence to deal with a simpler 2d option was used instead sarofsky also worked on end credits first time for company integrating actual credits from company exceptional

rotten tomatoes reported an 84 approval rating with an average score of 7 26 10 based on 395 reviews website s critical consensus reads guardians of galaxy vol 2 action packed plot dazzling visuals and irreverent humor add up to a sequel that s almost as fun if not quite as thrillingly fresh as its predecessor on metacritic film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100 based on 47 critics indicating generally favorable reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale while posttrak reported filmgoers gave it a 93 overall positive score and a 77 definite recommend owen gleiberman of variety called film an extravagant and witty follow up made with same friendly virtuosic dazzle and just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing he cautioned that this time you can sense just how hard gunn is working to entertain you maybe a little too hard writing for rolling stone peter travers described film as a blast and gave it three stars out of four praising film for its tone and fun soundtrack and characters he noted that vol 2 can t match sneak attack surprise of its predecessor but followup while taking on some cgi bloat and sequel slickness hasn t lost its love for inspired lunacy chicago sun timess richard roeper also gave film three stars calling it not quite as much fun not quite as clever not quite as fresh as original but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch roeper continued that even with all silliness and all snarkiness guardians can put a lump in your throat and praised cast especially rooker with one of best roles in movie in his review for rogerebert com brian tallerico gave film three stars out of four describing it as a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster that does not take itself seriously avoiding many of flaws of first movie and doing several things notably better it s fun clever and a great kick off to summer movie season also giving film three out of four stars sara stewart at new york post felt film was overstuffed but that gunn s lighthearted approach makes this matter surprisingly little and at least it s stuffed with good cheer praising tone and 1980s references that gave film a sense fun stewart called vol 2 an antidote to somber superheroes at washington post michael o sullivan gave film four stars praising it as being funnier and more touching than first film o sullivan felt it avoided usual sequel problems by building on original film rather than repeating it and also noted use of music as well as dazzling visuals throughout describing film as a toe tapping eye popping indication that summer is here and that it might not be so bad after all brian lowry writing for cnn com criticized middle portion of film and its villain but felt film fared better than other marvel sequels with its strong beginning and end and good natured energy saying it ultimately shares just enough with its central quintet rather heroically getting job done even if trip from here to there can be a bit disjointed and messy for atlantic christopher orr felt film did not live up to original particularly due to its heavier themes and feeling that russell was badly miscast but rest of cast soundtrack and humor were enough for him to give an overall positive review at hollywood reporter todd mccarthy said guardians of galaxy vol 2 plays like a second ride on a roller coaster that was a real kick first time around but feels very been there done that now kenneth turan of los angeles times was positive of film s soundtrack and cast especially russell but felt gunn was trying too hard to re capture magic of first film and increased scope of effects and action becomes weary turan concluded there are enough reminders of first guardians to make sequel an acceptable experience but it s less like itself and more like a standard marvel production manohla dargis at new york times said film certainly has its attractions but most of them are visual rather than narrative she also felt gunn was trying too hard and found many elements of sequel to be too serious even with russell balancing that with a much needed unforced looseness anthony lane in his review for new yorker felt once ego was introduced film began to suffer from curse of backstory and that point that movie which has been motoring along nicely fuelled by silliness and pep begins to splutter was when ego s desire for larger meaning is revealed lane concluded let s hope that vol 3 recaptures fizz of original instead of slumping into most expensive group therapy session in universe accolades year award
