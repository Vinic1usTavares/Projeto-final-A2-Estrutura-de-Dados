jackman so he enjoyed working out their fight scenes michael james olsen as young victor creed danny huston as william stryker huston was originally in negotiations for part while brian cox who played character in x2 wanted to reprise role he believed computer generated imagery similar to program applied to patrick stewart and ian mckellen in opening flashback of x men last stand would allow him to

interpretation of deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask and also includes a mouth sewn shut and abilities of scott summers optic blasts john wraith s teleportation and katanas that come out of his fists from within his arms similarly to wolverine s claws reynolds portrays weapon xi for close ups standing shots and simple stunts while scott adkins is used for more complicated and dangerous stunts originally reynolds was only going to cameo as wilson but role grew after he was cast reynolds reprised his role in deadpool and deadpool 2 lynn collins as kayla silverfox wolverine s native american blackfoot mutant love interest and pawn of stryker she has powers of tactile telepathy and hypnosis which allows her to control or convince others to do things she wants them to by

agent zero a mutant member of weapon x program and a superhumanly accurate mercenary with enhanced agility and reflexes expert tracking abilities and lethal sniper skills producer lauren shuler donner says on dvd commentary that agent zero has no scent which makes him difficult for logan to be sensed an x men fan henney liked role of a villain because there are no restrictions playing it allowing you freely to express it so you can act how you want to he described film as more realistic and cruder than x men trilogy additionally tim pocock portrays young scott summers max cullen and julia blake portrayed travis hudson and heather hudson an elderly couple who take care of wolverine after his adamantium bonding hudsons are heavily adapted from comics james macdonald and heather hudson tozzi portrays emma a mutant with power to turn her skin into diamond who in film is silverfox s sister film depiction of emma was originally intended to be emma frost however it was noted that she

be seen in trailer but it was removed from released film patrick stewart digitally rejuvenated also makes an uncredited cameo as a younger charles xavier professor x who appeared to not yet lose use of his legs however with timeline and story inconsistencies within film series to tie all films together and fix continuity despite losing use of his legs at a much younger age before in x men first class an in universe explanation can be revealed in x men days of future past by either a special serum allowing use of legs or creating illusion that he is standing in various scenes via telepathic projection asher keddie played dr carol frost poker player daniel negreanu has a cameo phil hellmuth wanted to join him but was unable because he committed to an event in toronto x men co creator stan lee said he would cameo but lee ended up not appearing in film as he could not attend filming in australia production development david benioff a comic book fan pursued project for almost three years before he was hired to write script in october 2004 in preparing to write script he reread barry windsor smith s weapon x story as well as chris claremont and frank miller s 1982 limited series on character his favorite storyline also serving as inspiration was 2001 limited series origin which reveals wolverine s life before weapon x jackman collaborated on script which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with previous x men films skip woods who had written hitman for fox was later hired to revise and rewrite benioff s script benioff had aimed for a darker and a bit more brutal story writing it with an r rating in mind although he acknowledged film s final tone would rest with producers and director deadpool had been developed for his own film by reynolds and david s goyer at new line cinema in 2003 but project fell apart as they focused on blade trinity and an aborted spin off benioff wrote character into script in a manner jackman described as fun but would also deviate from some of his traits similarly gambit was a character who filmmakers had tried to put in previous x men films jackman liked gambit because he is a loose cannon like wolverine stating their relationship echoes that of wolverine and pyro in original trilogy david ayer contributed to script benioff finished his draft in october 2006 and jackman stated there would be a year before shooting as he was scheduled to start filming australia during 2007 before 2007 2008 writers guild of america strike began james vanderbilt and scott silver were hired for a last minute rewrite gavin hood was announced as director of project in july 2007 for a 2008 release previously x men and x2 director bryan singer and x men last stand director brett ratner were interested in returning to franchise while alexandre aja and len wiseman also wanted job zack snyder who was approached for last stand turned down this film because he was directing watchmen jackman saw parallels between logan and main character in hood s previous film tsotsi hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan he realized that character of wolverine i think his great appeal lies in fact that he s someone who in some ways is filled with a great deal of self loathing by his own nature and he s constantly at war with his own nature director described film s themes as focusing on wolverine s inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities hood enjoyed previous films but set out to give spin off a different feel hood also suggested to make implied blood relation of wolverine and sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers as it would help build up emotional power of film in october fox announced a may 1 2009 release date and x men origins prefix filming preliminary shooting took place at fox studios australia in sydney during late 2007 principal photography began on january 2008 in new zealand one of filming locations that was selected was dunedin controversy arose as queenstown lakes district council disputed department of labour s decision to allow fox to store explosives in local ice skating rink fox moved some of explosives to another area explosives were used for a shot of exploding hudson farm a scene which required thirteen cameras jackman and palermo s productions reached an agreement with council to allow recycling specialists on set to advise production on being environmentally friendly according to hood screenplay was still incomplete as filming begun with production in australia receiving regularly new script pages from los angeles at times in night before shooting filming continued at fox where most of shooting was done and new orleans louisiana cockatoo island was used for stryker s facility enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set production of film was predicted to generate a 60 million for sydney s economy principal photography ended by may 23 second unit continued filming in new zealand until march 23 and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following first unit s wrap this included a flashback to logan during normandy landings which was shot at blacksmiths new south wales hood and fox were in dispute on film s direction one of disputes involved depiction of wolverine as an army veteran with post traumatic stress disorder with executives arguing that audiences would not be interested in such heavy themes studio had two replacements lined up before richard donner husband of producer lauren shuler donner flew to australia to ease on set tensions hood remarked out of healthy and sometimes very rigorous debate things get better i hope film s better because of debates if nobody were talking about us we d be in trouble hood added he and thomas rothman were both forceful personalities in creative meetings but they had never had a stand up argument in january 2009 after delays due to weather and scheduling conflicts such as hugh jackman s publicity commitments for australia production moved to vancouver mostly at kitsilano secondary school and in university of british columbia work there included finishing scenes with ryan reynolds who had been working on two other films during principal photography gavin hood announced that multiple secret endings exist for film and that endings will differ from print to print of film one version shows wolverine drinking in a japanese bar bartender asks if he is drinking to forget to which logan replies that he is drinking to remember other ending shows weapon xi on rubble of destroyed tower trying to touch his severed head effects more than 1 000 shots of wolverine have visual effects in them which required three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies to work on film most prominent was who had also worked in x men trilogy and was responsible for battle in three mile island and gambit s powers many elements were totally generated through computer generated imagery such as adamantium injection machine scene with gambit s plane and wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws cg bone claws were also created for some scenes because props did not look good in close ups extensive usage of matte paintings was also made with matte world digital creating five different mattes for final scene of film a pullback depicting destroyed three mile island and

his visit burlingame noted that choir was singing stanzas from an ancient norse poem in old icelandic to underscore what would be first track logan through time director gavin hood commented on gregson williams style saying harry s challenge is to give us operatic scale but also keep it intimate and human harry s music has a kind of muscular confidence and strength that is very useful for action but he also has tremendous soul hood also called recording performance brilliant release leaked workprint on march 31 2009 a full length dvd quality workprint of film without a timecode or

approval rating of 37 based on 258 reviews with an average rating of 5 13 10 site s critical consensus reads though hugh jackman gives his all he can t help x men origins wolverine overcome a cliche ridden script and familiar narrative on metacritic film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on 39 critics indicating mixed or average reviews audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale richard corliss of time commented on film s standing among other marvel films saying that it is an o k not great marvel movie that tells early story of prime x man and attempts to make it climax in a perfect coupling with start of known trilogy he also said that superhero mythologies can be so complicated only a lonely comic book reading kid could make sense of it all james of gq also commented on structure of story in saying that film clumsily tries to explain origins of james howlett aka wolverine which had wisely only ever been briefly referred to in original x men saga in doing so it creates a fairly bland plot which is full of holes lou lumenick of new york post was generally more favorable towards origins stating fortunately jackman is well matched with schreiber who can sneer with best of them and wears fangs well two have three spectacular battles together before squaring off against a formidable enemy atop a nuclear reactor peter rainer of christian science monitor also praised jackman s performance saying that hugh jackman demonstrates that you can segue effortlessly from a song and dance man at oscars to a feral gent with adamantium claws and berserker rage claudia puig of usa today considered movie well acted with spectacular action and witty one liners roger ebert gave film two stars out of four and asked about title character why should i care about this guy he feels no pain and nothing can kill him so therefore he s essentially a story device for action sequences james berardinelli gave wolverine two and a half stars out of four calling action scenes competently executed but not memorable and considering that when dealing with wolverine s past there s little creativity evident in way those blanks are filled in and that revelations made wolverine less compelling comparatively bill gibron of amc s filmcritic com website gave film a positive 4 0 out of 5 stars saying that although hugh jackman is capable of carrying even most mediocre effort he singlehandedly makes x men origins wolverine an excellent start to summer 2009 season he predicted there will be purists who balk at how hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate mythology and further said that any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can t really seal full entertainment deal regarding wolverine within context of x men film series tom charity of cnn commented serviceable but inescapably redundant this wolverine movie does just enough to keep x men franchise on life support but filmmakers will have to come up with some evolutionary changes soon if it s going to escape x similarly a o scott of new york times expressed that x men origins wolverine will most likely manage to cash in on popularity of earlier episodes but it is latest evidence that superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue on a more negative note philip french of observer said that film s dull bone crushing special effects stuff is of interest only to hardcore fans who ve probably read it all in marvel comics sukhdev sandhu of daily telegraph stated that wolverine is an artificial stimulus package of most unsatisfying kind aggressively advertised and hyped to hills it will no doubt attract full houses at first after that though when word of mouth buzz kill goes into overdrive there s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned similarly orlando parfitt of ign uk praised performances of actors and action scenes but stated that film felt underdeveloped there s an enjoyable time to be had with wolverine but it s also somewhat unsatisfying furthermore scott mendelson of huffington post gave film a grade of d noting that wolverine was lead character of x men films and we ve already learned everything we need to know from films in said franchise adding that extra information given here actually serves to make character of logan wolverine less interesting steven rea also felt that film injured character by proving that how hero acquired his special powers turns out to be a whole lot less interesting than what he does with them while also being a mash up of meaningless combat sequences meaningless because logan wolverine is just about unstoppable sub par visual effects template backstory and some goofy liev schreiber as a villain hugh jackman later confessed being unhappy with final result of x men origins wolverine actor wanted primarily a film that would deepen wolverine character but somehow first wolverine movie ended up looking like fourth x men just with different characters he tried to avert same results while doing character s next solo film 2013 s wolverine two cases exist of adolescents injecting themselves with elemental mercury after having seen x men origins wolverine and incorrectly believing this would convert their bones to metal similar to wolverine future x men origins wolverine was set to be first of a series of x men origins prequels with other being focused on erik magneto however this entered development hell and was eventually canceled with x men first class 2011 recycling elements of this cancelled film a second wolverine film titled wolverine 2013 was set years after x men last stand 2006 as a stand alone sequel x men days of future past 2014 was confirmed to erase events of wolverine through retroactive continuity a third wolverine film titled logan was released on march 3 2017 as hugh jackman s last time portraying character and liev schreiber being in talks to reprise his role spin off film deadpool 2016 and its sequel deadpool 2 2018 feature ryan reynolds reprising his role as title character albeit more faithful to comics several jokes in deadpool are aimed at expense of wolverine due to negative reaction of weapon xi s portrayal a mid credits scene in deadpool 2 depicts title character traveling backwards in time to events of wolverine to kill
