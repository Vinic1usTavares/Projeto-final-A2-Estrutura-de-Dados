parker davis campaign poster as 1904 presidential election approached democrats began to search for a nominee to oppose popular incumbent republican president theodore roosevelt and parker s name arose as a possible candidate roosevelt s secretary of war elihu root said of parker that he has never opened his mouth on any national question but roosevelt feared that man s neutrality would prove a political advantage writing that neutral tinted individual is very apt to win against man of pronounced views and active life 1904 democratic national convention was held in july in st louis missouri then also hosting 1904 world s fair and 1904 summer olympics parker s mentor david b hill having attempted and failed to capture nomination himself at 1892 convention now led campaign for his protege s nomination william jennings bryan who had been nominated but defeated by william mckinley in both 1896 and 1900 was no longer considered by delegates to be a viable alternative radicals in party supported publisher william randolph hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure nomination due to opposition from bryan and tammany hall a powerful new york political machine small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates including missouri senator francis cockrell richard olney grover cleveland s secretary of state edward c wall a former wisconsin state representative and george gray a former senator from delaware other delegates spoke of nominating cleveland who had already served two nonconsecutive terms but cleveland was no longer popular outside party or even within it due to his rift with bryan parker s long service on bench proved to be an advantage in his nomination as he had avoided taking stands on issues that divided party particularly that of currency standards hill and other parker supporters remained deliberately silent on their candidate s beliefs by time convention cast their votes it was clear that no candidate but parker could unify party and he was selected on first ballot henry g davis an elderly west virginia millionaire and former senator was selected as vice presidential candidate in hope that he would partially finance parker s campaign convention was riven by debate over whether to include a free silver plank in campaign s platform opposing gold standard and calling for government to mint large numbers of silver dollars free silver movement a key plank for party in 1896 and 1900 was popular among indebted western farmers who felt that inflation would help them repay their debts business interests in contrast supported lower inflation of gold standard bryan famous for his 1896 cross of gold speech opposing gold standard fought bitterly to avoid inclusion of gold standard in party platform in 1904 ultimately convention agreed not to include a plank on subject however seeking to win support of eastern sound money faction parker sent a telegram to convention immediately upon hearing news of his nomination that he considered gold standard firmly and irrevocably established and would decline nomination if he could not state this in his campaign telegram sparked a new debate and fresh opposition from bryan but convention eventually replied to parker that he was free to speak on issue as he liked national support for parker began to rise and roosevelt praised his opponent s telegram in private as bold and skillful and most adroit campaign thumb 300px a parker 1904 button attacking republicans as tied to big business trusts after receiving nomination parker resigned from bench on august 10 he was formally visited at rosemount by a delegation of party elders to inform him of his nomination parker then delivered a speech criticizing roosevelt for his administration s involvement in turkish and moroccan affairs and having failed to give a date on which philippines would become independent of american control speech was considered even by supporters to be impersonal and uninspiring historian lewis l gould described speech as a fiasco for parker from which candidate did not recover after this initial speech parker retreated into a strategy of silence again avoiding comment on all major issues parker s campaign soon proved to be poorly run as well parker and his advisors opted for a front porch campaign in which delegations would be brought to rosemount to see parker speak on model of mckinley s successful 1896 campaign however due to esopus remote location and campaign s inefficient use of funds to bring in delegates parker received few visitors rather than introducing issues that would differentiate two parties democrats preferred to emphasize roosevelt s character portraying him as dangerously unstable parker s campaign also failed to reach out to traditional democratic voting blocs such as irish catholic immigrants in contrast roosevelt s campaign headed by george cortelyou organized committees to appeal specifically to demographics including jewish black and german american voters john hay roosevelt s secretary of state wrote of parker s poor showing to henry adams calling it most absurd political campaign of our time a month before election parker became aware of large amount of corporate donations cortelyou had solicited for roosevelt campaign and made a theme of his speeches accusing president of being insincere in previous trust busting efforts in late october he also went on a speaking tour in key states of new york and new jersey in which he reiterated president s shameless exhibition of a willingness to make compromise with dignity roosevelt enraged released a statement calling parker s criticisms monstrous and slanderous parker s attacks came too late to turn election however on november 8 roosevelt won in a landslide of 7 630 457 votes to parker s 5 083 880 roosevelt carried every northern and western state including missouri for a total of 336 electoral votes parker carried only traditionally democratic solid south accumulating 140 electoral votes parker telegraphed his congratulations to roosevelt that night and returned to private life in irving stone s 1943 book they also ran about
