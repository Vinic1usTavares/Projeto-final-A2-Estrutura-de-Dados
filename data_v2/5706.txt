loihi seamount also known as lo ihi is an active submarine volcano about off southeast coast of island of hawaii top of seamount is about below sea level this seamount is on flank of mauna loa largest shield volcano on earth loihi meaning long in hawaiian is newest volcano in hawaiian emperor seamount chain a string of volcanoes that stretches over northwest of lo ihi unlike most active volcanoes in pacific ocean that make up active plate margins on pacific ring of fire lo ihi and other volcanoes of hawaiian emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from nearest plate boundary volcanoes in hawaiian islands arise from hawaii hotspot and as youngest volcano in chain loihi is only hawaiian volcano in deep submarine preshield stage of development loihi began forming around 400 000 years ago and is expected to begin emerging above sea level about 10 000 100 000 years from now at its summit lo ihi seamount stands more than above seafloor making it taller than mount st helens was before its catastrophic 1980 eruption a diverse microbial community resides around loihi s many hydrothermal vents in summer of 1996 a swarm of 4 070 earthquakes was recorded at lo ihi at time this was most energetic earthquake swarm in hawaii recorded history swarm altered of seamount s summit one section pele s vents collapsed entirely upon itself and formed renamed pele s pit volcano has remained relatively active since 1996 swarm and is monitored by united states geological survey usgs hawaii undersea geological observatory hugo provided real time data on lo ihi between 1997 and 1998 lo ihi s last known eruption was in 1996 before earthquake swarm of that summer characteristics geology lo ihi is a seamount or underwater volcano on flank of mauna loa earth s largest shield volcano it is newest volcano created by hawai i hotspot in extensive hawaiian emperor seamount chain distance between summit of older mauna loa and summit of lo ihi is about which is coincidentally also approximate diameter of hawai i hotspot lo ihi consists of a summit area with three pit craters an long rift zone extending north from summit and a long rift zone extending south southeast from summit summit s pit craters are named west pit east pit and pele s pit pele s pit is youngest of this group and is located at southern part of summit walls of pele s pit stand high and were formed in july 1996 when its predecessor pele s vent a hydrothermal field near lo ihi s summit collapsed into a large depression thick crater walls of pele s pit averaging in width unusually thick for hawaiian volcanic craters suggest its craters have filled with lava multiple times in past thumb left bathymetric mapping of lo ihi arrow points to pele s pit alt map of a north south ridge trending slightly east of south draws lines through areas of a given water depth with an arrow pointing to pele s pit at its peak pele s pit is about 1 000 meters below sea level further south ridge gradually descends about 3 500 metres to sea floor loihi s north south trending rift zones create a distinctive elongated shape from which volcano s hawaiian name meaning long derives north rift zone consists of a longer western portion and a shorter eastern rift zone observations show that both north and south rift zones lack sediment cover indicating recent activity a bulge in western part of north rift zone contains three cone shaped prominences until 1970 loihi was thought to be an inactive volcano that had been transported to its current location by sea floor spreading seafloor under hawaii is years old and was created at east pacific rise an oceanic spreading center where new sea floor forms from magma that erupts from mantle new oceanic crust moves away from spreading center over a period of years sea floor under hawaii moved from east pacific rise to its present location west carrying ancient seamounts with it when scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off hawaii in 1970 they discovered that loihi was an active member of hawaiian emperor seamount chain thumb right three dimensional rendering of seamount alt 3d map of lo ihi lo ihi is built on seafloor with a slope of about five degrees its northern base on flank of mauna loa is below sea level but its southern base is a more substantial below surface thus summit is above seafloor as measured from base of its north flank but high when measured from base of its southern flank loihi is following pattern of development that is characteristic of all hawaiian volcanoes geochemical evidence from loihi lavas indicates that loihi is in transition between preshield and shield volcano stage providing valuable clues to early development of hawaiian volcanoes in preshield stage hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower level of activity producing an alkali basalt lava continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at loihi lo ihi experiences frequent landslides growth of volcano has destabilized its slopes and extensive areas of debris inhabit steep southeastern face similar deposits from other hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of early development of hawaiian volcanoes lo ihi is predicted to rise above surface in 10 000 to 100 000 years age and growth thumb right a sample of basalt pillow lava collected from lo ihi at 1 180 metres below sea level radiometric dating was used to determine age of rock samples from lo ihi hawaii center for volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions notably 1978 expedition which provided 17 dredge samples most of samples were found to be of recent origin oldest dated rock is around 300 000 years old following 1996 event some young breccia was also collected based on samples scientists estimate lo ihi is about 400 000 years old rock accumulates at an average rate of per year near base and near summit if data model from other volcanoes such as kilauea holds true for lo ihi 40 of volcano s mass formed within last 100 000 years assuming a linear growth rate loihi is 250 000 years old however as with all hotspot volcanoes loihi s level of activity has increased with time therefore it would take at least 400 000 years for such a volcano to reach loihi s mass as hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about a year lo ihi was southeast of its current position at time of its initial eruption activity loihi is a young and fairly active volcano although less active than nearby kilauea in past few decades several earthquake swarms have been attributed to loihi largest of which are summarized in table below volcano s activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity which commenced in 1959 most earthquake swarms at loihi have lasted less than two days two exceptions are 1990 1971 earthquake lasting several months and 1996 event which was shorter but much more pronounced 1996 event was directly observed by an ocean bottom seismometer obs allowing scientists to calculate depth of earthquakes as to below summit approximating to position of loihi s extremely shallow magma chamber this is evidence that lo ihi s seismicity is volcanic in origin low level seismic activity documented on loihi since 1959 has shown that between two and ten earthquakes per month are traceable to summit earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well loihi s rocks propagate seismic waves and to investigate relationship between earthquakes and eruptions this low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes each swarm composed of up to hundreds of earthquakes majority of earthquakes are not distributed close to summit though they follow a north south trend rather most of earthquakes occur in southwest portion of lo ihi largest recorded swarms took place on loihi in 1971 1972 1975 1991 92 and 1996 nearest seismic station is around from lo ihi on south coast of hawaii seismic events that have a magnitude under 2 are recorded often but their location cannot be determined precisely as it can for larger events in fact hugo hawaii undersea geological observatory positioned on loihi s flank detected ten times as many earthquakes as were recorded by hawaiian volcano observatory hvo seismic network 1996 earthquake swarm major events year s summary 1996 evidence of eruption in early 1996 and large well recorded earthquake swarm in summer started on february 25 1996 and lasted until august 9 1996 1991 an obo positioned on seamount to track a recent earthquake swarm collected evidence of deflation possibly due to magma withdrawal 1986 possible eruption occurred on september 20 1986 one day 1984 85 nine events of magnitude 3 or greater measuring between 3 0 and 4 2 were recorded from november 11 1984 to january 21 1985 eruption possible but uncertain 1975 prominent earthquake swarm from august 24 1975 to november 1975 1971 72 possible eruption from september 17 1971

thought extinct 50 bc 1000 confirmed ancient eruption bc 1000 confirmed ancient eruption 7050 bc 1000 confirmed ancient eruption most likely on east flank this table indexes only possible volcanic eruptions and major events lo ihi has also been site of multiple earthquake swarms occurring on a nearly semi annual basis largest amount of activity recorded for loihi seamount was a swarm of 4 070 earthquakes between july 16 and august 9 1996 this series of earthquakes was largest recorded for any hawaiian volcano to date in both amount and intensity most of earthquakes had moment magnitudes of less than 3 0 several hundred had a magnitude greater than 3 0 including more than 40 greater than 4 0 and a 5 0 tremor final two weeks of earthquake swarm were observed by a rapid response cruise launched in august 1996 national science foundation funded an expedition by university of hawaii scientists led by frederick duennebier that began investigating swarm and its origin in august 1996 scientists assessment laid groundwork for many of expeditions that followed follow up expeditions to lo ihi took place including a series of manned submersible dives in august and september these were supplemented by a great deal of shore based research fresh rock collected during expedition revealed that an eruption occurred before earthquake swarm submersible dives in august were followed by noaa funded research in september and october 1996 these more detailed studies showed southern portion of lo ihi s summit had collapsed a result of a swarm of earthquakes and rapid withdrawal of magma from volcano a crater across and deep formed out of rubble event involved movement of cubic meters of volcanic material a region of 10 to 13 km2 4 to 5 sq mi of summit was altered and populated by bus sized pillow lava blocks precariously perched along outer rim of newly formed crater pele s vents an area on southern side previously considered stable collapsed completely into a giant pit renamed pele s pit strong currents make submersible diving hazardous in region researchers were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate sudden collapse of pele s vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material presence of certain indicator minerals in mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250 degc a record for an underwater volcano composition of materials was similar to that of black smokers hydrothermal vent plumes located along mid ocean ridges samples from mounds built by discharges from hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers studies demonstrated that most volcanically and hydrothermally active area was along southern rift dives on less active northern rim indicated that terrain was more stable there and high lava columns were still standing upright a new hydrothermal vent field naha vents was located in upper south rift zone at a depth of recent activity lo ihi has remained largely quiet since 1996 event no activity was recorded from 2002 to 2004 seamount showed signs of life again in 2005 by generating an earthquake bigger than any previously recorded there usgs anss advanced national seismic system reported two earthquakes magnitudes 5 1 and 5 4 on may 13 and july 17 both originated from a depth of on april 23 a magnitude 4 3 earthquake was recorded at a depth of approximately between december 7 2005 and january 18 2006 a swarm of around 100 earthquakes occurred largest measuring 4 on moment magnitude scale and to deep another earthquake measuring 4 7 was later recorded approximately midway between loihi and pahala on south coast of

first brought attention to it in 1952 that same year geologist gordon a macdonald hypothesized that seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano similar to two active hawaiian volcanoes mauna loa and kilauea macdonald s hypothesis placed seamount as newest volcano in hawaiian emperor seamount chain created by hawai i hotspot however because earthquakes were oriented east west direction of volcanic fault and there was no volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from seamount macdonald attributed earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption thumb right 220px r v

ship via a crane is lowered into water geologists suspected seamount could be an active undersea volcano but without evidence idea remained speculative volcano was largely ignored after 1952 event and was often mislabeled as an older volcanic feature in subsequent charts geologist kenneth o emery is credited with naming seamount in 1955 describing long and narrow shape of volcano as loihi hawaiian word lo ihi means long lo ihi meaning length height distance long see in 1978 an expedition studied intense repeated seismic activity known as earthquake swarms in and around lo ihi area rather than finding an old extinct seamount data collected revealed lo ihi to be a young possibly active volcano observations showed volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found in 1978 a us geological survey research ship collected dredge samples and photographed lo ihi s summit with goal of studying whether lo ihi is active analysis of photos and testing of pillow lava rock samples appeared to show that material was fresh yielding more evidence that lo ihi is still active an expedition from october 1980 to january 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs providing additional confirmation studies indicated that eruptions came from southern part of rift crater this area is closest to hawai i hotspot which supplies lo ihi with magma following a 1986 seismic event a network of five ocean bottom observatories obos were deployed on lo ihi for a month lo ihi s frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through obos in 1987 submersible dsv alvin was used to survey lo ihi another autonomous observatory was positioned on lo ihi in 1991 to track earthquake swarms 1996 to present bulk of information about lo ihi comes from dives made in response to 1996 eruption in a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in water bacteria that feed on dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing new hydrothermal vents at pele s pit formed from collapse of old ones and may be indicators of kinds of material ejected from newly formed vents they were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory an obo briefly sat on summit

formally pele s vents and kapo s vents they are named after hawaiian deity pele and her sister kapo these vents were considered low temperature vents because their waters were only about 30 degc
