tet offensive or officially called general offensive and uprising of tet mau than 1968 by north vietnam and viet cong vc was one of largest military campaigns of vietnam war launched on january 30 1968 by forces of viet cong and north vietnamese people s army of vietnam pavn against forces of south vietnamese army of republic of vietnam arvn united states armed forces and their allies it was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout south vietnam ang p 351 two interpretations of north vietnamese goals have continued to dominate western historical debate first maintained that political consequences of winter spring offensive were an intended rather than an unintended consequence this view was supported by william westmoreland

prerequisite for an effort to influence american opinion james j wirtz in tet offensive ithaca ny cornell university press 1991 p 18 second thesis which was also supported by majority of contemporary captured vietcong documents was that goal of offensive was immediate toppling of saigon government or at very least destruction of government apparatus installation of a coalition government or

attacks took place offensive was launched prematurely in late night hours of 30 january in i and ii corps tactical zones of south vietnam this early attack allowed allied forces some time to prepare defensive measures when main operation began next morning offensive was countrywide and well coordinated eventually more than 80 000 pavn vc troops struck more than 100 towns and cities including 36 of 44 provincial capitals five of six autonomous cities 72 of 245 district towns and southern capital dougan and weiss p 8 offensive was largest military operation conducted by either side up to that point in war hanoi had launched offensive in belief that offensive would trigger a popular uprising leading to collapse of south vietnamese government although initial attacks stunned allies causing them to lose control of several cities temporarily they quickly regrouped beat back attacks and inflicted heavy casualties on pavn vc forces popular uprising anticipated by hanoi never happened during battle of hue intense fighting lasted for a month resulting in destruction of city during their occupation pavn vc executed thousands of people in massacre at hue around u s combat base at khe sanh fighting continued for two more months offensive was a military defeat for north vietnam though general westmoreland reported that defeating pavn vc would require 200 000 more american soldiers and activation of reserves prompting even loyal supporters of war to see that current war strategy required re evaluation offensive had a strong effect on u s government and shocked u s public which had been led to believe by its political and military leaders that north vietnamese were being defeated and incapable of launching such an ambitious military operation american public support for war soon declined and u s sought negotiations to end war term tet offensive usually refers to january february 1968 offensive but it can also include so called mini tet offensive that took place in may and phase iii offensive in august or 21 weeks of unusually intense combat which followed initial attacks in january background united states during fall of 1967 question whether u s strategy of attrition was working in south vietnam weighed heavily on minds of american public and administration of president lyndon b johnson general william c westmoreland commander of military assistance command vietnam macv believed that if a crossover point could be reached by which number of communist troops killed or captured during military operations exceeded those recruited or replaced americans would win war there was a discrepancy however between order of battle estimates of macv and central intelligence agency cia concerning strength of viet cong guerrilla forces within south vietnam dougan and weiss pp 22 23 in september members of macv intelligence services and cia met to prepare a special national intelligence estimate that would be used by administration to gauge u s success in conflict thumb general william c westmoreland comusmacv provided with an enemy intelligence windfall accrued during operations cedar falls and junction city cia members of group believed that number of vc guerrillas irregulars and cadre within south could be as high as 430 000 macv combined intelligence center on other hand maintained that number could be no more than 300 000 dougan and weiss p 22 westmoreland was deeply concerned about possible perceptions of american public to such an increased estimate since communist troop strength was routinely provided to reporters during press briefings hammond p 326 according to macv s chief of intelligence general joseph a new figures would create a political bombshell since they were positive proof that north vietnamese had capability and will to continue a protracted war of attrition in may macv attempted to obtain a compromise from cia by maintaining that vc militias did not constitute a fighting force but were essentially low level fifth columnists used for information collection dougan and weiss p 23 agency responded that such a notion was ridiculous since militias were directly responsible for half of casualties inflicted on u s forces with groups deadlocked george carver cia deputy director for vietnamese affairs was asked to mediate dispute in september carver devised a compromise cia would drop its insistence on including irregulars in final tally of forces and add a prose addendum to estimate that would explain agency s position hammond pp 326 327 george allen carver s deputy laid responsibility for agency s capitulation at feet of richard helms director of cia he believed that it was a political problem helms didn t want agency contravening policy interest of administration dougan and weiss p 23 this order of battle controversy resurfaced in 1982 when westmoreland filed a lawsuit against cbs news after airing of its program uncounted enemy a vietnam deception which aired had on 23 january 1982 during second half of 1967 administration had become alarmed by criticism both inside and outside government and by reports of declining public support for its vietnam policies those in administration and military who urged a change in strategy included secretary of defense robert s mcnamara undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach assistant secretary for far eastern affairs william bundy

and system analysis and had instead seized upon optimistic reports from general westmoreland neil sheehan et al pentagon papers as reported by new york times new york ballantine 1971 p 592 according to public opinion polls percentage of americans who believed that u s had made a mistake by sending troops to vietnam had risen from 25 percent in 1965 to 45 percent by december 1967 dougan and weiss p 68 this trend was fueled not by a belief that struggle was not worthwhile but by mounting casualty figures raising taxes and feeling that there was no end to war in sight karnow pp 545 546 a poll taken in november indicated that 55 percent wanted a tougher war policy exemplified by public belief that it was an error for us to have gotten involved in vietnam in first place but now that we re there let s win or get out karnow p 546 this prompted administration to launch a so called success offensive a concerted effort to alter widespread public perception that war had reached a stalemate and to convince american people that administration s policies were succeeding under leadership of national security advisor walt w rostow news media then was inundated by a wave of effusive optimism every statistical indicator of progress from kill ratios and body counts to village pacification was fed to press and to congress we are beginning to win this struggle asserted vice president hubert h humphrey on nbc s today show in mid november we are on offensive territory is being gained we are making steady progress dougan and weiss p 66 at end of november campaign reached its climax when johnson summoned westmoreland and new u s ambassador ellsworth bunker to washington d c for what was billed as a high level policy review upon their arrival two men bolstered administration s claims of success from saigon pacification chief robert asserted that cords pacification program in countryside was succeeding and that sixty eight percent of south vietnamese population was under control of saigon while only seventeen percent was under control of p 56 general bruce palmer jr one of westmoreland s three field force commanders claimed that viet cong has been defeated and that he can t get food and he can t recruit he has been forced to change his strategy from trying to control people on coast to try to survive in mountains schmitz p 58 westmoreland was even more emphatic in his assertions at an address at national press club on 21 november he reported that as of end of 1967 communists were unable to mount a major offensive i am absolutely certain that whereas in 1965 enemy was winning today he is certainly losing we have reached an important point when end begins to come into view by end of year administration s approval rating had indeed crept up by eight percent but an early january gallup poll indicated that forty seven percent of american public still disapproved of president s handling of war dougan and weiss p 69 american public more confused than convinced more doubtful than despairing adopted a wait and see attitude dougan and weiss p 67 during a discussion with an interviewer from time magazine westmoreland defied communists to launch an attack i hope they try something because we are looking for a fight karnow p 514 north vietnam party politics planning in hanoi for a winter spring offensive during 1968 had begun in early 1967 and continued until early following year according to american sources there has been an extreme reluctance among vietnamese historians to discuss decision making process that led to general offensive general uprising even decades after event elliot p 1055 in official vietnamese literature decision to launch tet offensive was usually presented as result of a perceived u s failure to win war quickly failure of

situation in south july 15 1967 decision signaled end of a bitter decade long debate within north vietnamese government between first two and then three factions moderates believed that economic viability of north vietnam should come before support of a massive and conventional southern war and they generally followed soviet line of peaceful coexistence by reunifying vietnam through political means heading this faction were party theoretician truong chinh and minister of defense vo nguyen giap militant faction on other hand tended to follow foreign policy line of people s republic of china

zedong nguyen p 20 see also wirtz pp 30 50 by 1966 1967 however after suffering massive casualties stalemate on battlefield and destruction of northern economy by u s aerial bombing there was a dawning realization that if current trends continued hanoi would eventually lack resources necessary to affect military situation in south wirtz p 20 as a result there were more strident calls by moderates for negotiations and a revision of strategy they felt that a return to guerrilla tactics was more appropriate since u s could not be defeated conventionally they also complained that policy of rejecting negotiations was in error doyle lipsman and maitland p 55 americans could only be worn down in a war of wills during a period of fighting while talking during 1967 things had become so bad on battlefield that le duan ordered thanh to incorporate aspects of protracted guerrilla warfare into his strategy nguyen p 22 during same period a counter attack was launched by a new third

1963 and took little part in day to day policy decisions of politburo or secretariat nguyen p 30 from october 1966 through april 1967 a very public debate over military strategy took place in print

doyle lipsman and maitland p 56 thanh s position was that giap and his adherents were centered on their experiences during first indochina war and that they were too conservative and captive to old methods and past experience mechanically repeating past hoang p 16 arguments over domestic and military strategy also carried a foreign policy element as north vietnam like south vietnam was largely dependent on outside military and economic aid vast majority of north vietnam s military equipment was provided by either soviet union or china beijing advocated that north vietnam conduct a protracted war on maoist model fearing that a conventional conflict might draw china in as had happened in korean war they also resisted idea of negotiating with allies moscow on other hand advocated negotiations but simultaneously armed hanoi s forces to conduct a conventional war on soviet model north vietnamese foreign policy therefore consisted of maintaining a critical balance between war policy internal and external policies domestic adversaries and foreign allies with self serving agendas nguyen pp 18 20 to break will of their domestic opponents and reaffirm their autonomy vis a vis their foreign allies hundreds of pro soviet party moderates military officers and intelligentsia were arrested on 27 july 1967 during what came to be called revisionist anti party affair nguyen p 24

planning for a major conventional offensive to break military deadlock they concluded that saigon government and u s presence were so unpopular with population of south that a broad based attack would spark a spontaneous uprising of population which if offensive was successful would enable north vietnamese to sweep to a quick decisive victory their basis for this conclusion included a belief that south vietnamese military was no longer combat effective results of september 1967 south vietnamese presidential election in which nguyen van thieu nguyen cao ky ticket had only received 24 percent of popular vote buddhist crises of 1963 and 1966 well publicized anti war demonstrations in saigon and continuous criticism of thieu government in southern press hoang p 24 launching such an offensive would also finally put an end to what have been described as dovish calls for talks criticism of military strategy chinese diatribes of soviet perfidy and soviet pressure to negotiate all of which needed to be silenced thumb left vc special forces are sworn into forces before tet offensive in october politburo decided on tet holiday as launch date and met again in december to reaffirm its

has to be one of few accurate statements in it is one quoted above rest is inaccurate gibberish since politburo had already approved offensive all he had to do was make it work he combined guerrilla operations into what was basically a conventional military offensive and shifted burden of sparking popular uprising to viet cong if it worked all would be well and good if it failed it would be a failure only for communist party militants for moderates and centrists it offered prospect of negotiations and a possible end to american bombing of north only in eyes of militants therefore did offensive become a go for broke effort others in politburo were willing to settle for a much less ambitious victory doyle lipsman and maitland pp 58 59 thumb vc special forces study maps of district 7

war equipment in order to prevent american forces from being able to carry out their political and military missions on basis crush american will to commit aggression and force united states to accept

preliminary phase during which diversionary attacks would be launched in border areas of south vietnam to draw american attention and forces away from cities general offensive general uprising would then commence with simultaneous actions on major allied bases and most urban areas and with particular emphasis on cities of saigon and hue concurrently a substantial threat would have to be made against u s khe sanh combat base khe sanh actions would draw pavn forces away from offensive into cities but giap considered them necessary in order to protect his supply lines and divert american attention duiker p 299 attacks on other u s forces were of secondary or even tertiary importance since giap considered his main objective to be weakening or destroying south vietnamese military and government through popular revolt hoang p 26 offensive therefore was aimed at influencing south vietnamese public not that of u s there is conflicting evidence as to whether or to what extent offensive was intended to influence either march primaries or november presidential election in u s hoang offered opposing viewpoints pp 22 23 while william duiker p 289 and clark clifford p 475 believed that it was so intended stanley karnow did not p 537 while william westmoreland never even mentioned prospect in his memoir a study of north vietnamese documentation by james wirtz led him to

government would be launched if outright victory was not achieved battle might still lead to creation of a coalition government and withdrawal of americans if general offensive failed to achieve these purposes follow up operations would be conducted to wear down enemy and lead to a negotiated settlement phase ii was scheduled to begin on 5 may and phase iii on 17 august tran van tra tet p 40

suspicions and diversions signs of impending communist action were noticed among allied intelligence collection apparatus in saigon during late summer and fall of 1967 both south vietnamese and u s intelligence agencies collected clues that indicated a significant shift in communist strategic planning by mid december mounting evidence convinced many in washington and saigon that something big was underway during last three months of year intelligence agencies had observed signs of a major north vietnamese military buildup in addition to captured documents a copy of resolution 13 for example was captured by early october observations of enemy logistical operations were also quite clear in october number of trucks observed heading south through laos on ho chi minh trail jumped from previous monthly average of 480 to 1 116 by november this total reached 3 823 and in december 6 315 hayward tet offensive dialogues on 20 december westmoreland cabled washington that he expected pavn

commander of ii field force vietnam despite all warning signs however allies were still surprised by scale and scope of offensive according to arvn colonel hoang ngoc lung answer lay with allied intelligence methodology itself which tended to estimate enemy s probable course of action based upon their capabilities not their intentions since in allied estimation communists hardly had capability to launch such an ambitious enterprise there was little possibility that enemy could initiate a general offensive regardless of his intentions hoang p 39 answer could also be partially explained by lack of coordination and cooperation between competing intelligence branches both south vietnamese and american situation from u s perspective was summed up by an macv intelligence analyst if we d gotten whole battle plan it wouldn t have been believed it wouldn t have been credible to us dougan and weiss p 11 tet offensive would later be utilized in a textbook at west point as

by possible motives of north vietnamese in prompting such large scale actions in remote regions where u s artillery and aerial firepower could be applied indiscriminately which meant that tactically and strategically these operations made no sense what north vietnamese had done was carry out first stage of their plan to fix attention of u s command on borders and draw bulk of u s forces away from heavily populated coastal lowlands and cities maitland and mcinerney pp 160 183 westmoreland was more concerned with situation at khe sanh where on 21 january 1968 a force estimated at 20 000 40 000

responsibility and notified westmoreland of his concerns on 10 january westmoreland agreed with his estimate and ordered 15 u s battalions to redeploy from positions near cambodian border back to

of allied forces was relatively relaxed hanoi had announced in october that it would observe a seven day truce from 27 january to 3 february for tet holiday and south vietnamese military made plans to allow recreational leave for approximately half of its forces general westmoreland who had already cancelled truce in i corps requested that south vietnam cancel upcoming cease fire but president thieu who had already reduced cease fire to 36 hours refused to do so claiming that it would damage troop morale and only benefit communist propagandists dougan and weiss p 12 on 28 january eleven vc

urgency on part of allies if westmoreland had a grasp of potential for danger he did not communicate it very well to others in their memoirs both johnson and westmoreland stated that they had

reassessment to evaluate westmoreland s request and its possible impact on domestic politics johnson convened clifford group on 28 february and tasked its members with a complete policy reassessment group included mcnamara general maxwell d taylor paul h nitze deputy secretary of defense henry h fowler secretary of treasury nicholas katzenbach undersecretary of state walt w rostow national security advisor richard helms director of cia william p bundy assistant secretary of state for far eastern affairs paul warnke pentagon s international security affairs and philip c habib bundy s deputy some of members argued that offensive represented an opportunity to defeat north vietnamese on american terms while others pointed out that neither side could win militarily that north vietnam could match any troop increase that bombing of north be halted and that a change in strategy was required that would seek not victory but staying power required to reach a negotiated settlement this would require a less aggressive strategy that was designed to protect population of south vietnam pentagon papers pp 601 604 divided group s final report issued on 4 march failed to seize opportunity to change directions and seemed to recommend that we continue rather haltingly down same road pentagon papers p 604 on 1 march clifford had succeeded mcnamara as secretary of defense during month clifford who had entered office as a staunch supporter of vietnam commitment and who had opposed mcnamara s de views turned against war according to clifford simple truth was that military failed to sustain a respectable argument for their position clifford p 402 between results of tet and meetings of group that bore his name he became convinced that deescalation was only solution for united states he believed that troop increase would lead only to a more violent stalemate and sought out others in administration to assist him in convincing president to reverse escalation to cap force levels at 550 000 men to seek negotiations with hanoi and turn responsibility for fighting over to south vietnamese major general phillip davidson westmoreland s chief of intelligence reflected how military men thought about clifford s conversion in his memoir clifford s use of wise men to serve his dovish ends was a consummate stroke by a master of intrigue what happened was that johnson had fired a doubting thomas mcnamara only to replace him with a judas phillip davidson vietnam at war novato ca presidio press 1988 p 525 clifford quietly sought allies and was assisted in his effort by so called 8 30 group nitze warnke phil g goulding assistant secretary of defense for public affairs george and air force colonel robert e on 27 february secretary of state dean rusk had proposed that a partial bombing halt be implemented in north vietnam and that an offer to negotiate be extended to hanoi johnson p 399 on 4 march rusk reiterated proposal explaining that during rainy season in north bombing was less effective and that no military sacrifice would thus occur this was purely a political ploy however since north vietnamese would probably again refuse to negotiate casting onus on them and thus freeing our hand after a short period putting monkey firmly upon hanoi s back for what was to follow johnson p 400 pentagon papers p 623 thumb upright 1 1 arvn rangers moving through western cholon saigon 10 may 1968 while this was being deliberated troop request was leaked to press and published in new york times on 10 march president johnson was convinced that source of leak was

begun a serious debate within administration according to it many high level officials believed that u s troop increase would be matched by communists and would simply maintain a stalemate at a higher level of violence it went on to state that officials were saying in private that widespread and deep changes in attitudes a sense that a watershed has been reached p 269 a great deal has been said by historians concerning how news media made tet turning point in public s perception of war popular cbs anchor walter cronkite stated during a news broadcast on february 27 we have been too often disappointed by optimism of american leaders both in vietnam and washington to have faith any longer in silver linings they find in darkest clouds and added that we are mired in a stalemate that could only be ended by negotiation not victory stephens bret american honor wall street journal january 22 2008 p 18 far from suffering a loss of morale however majority of americans had rallied to side of president a gallup poll in january 1968 revealed that 56 percent polled considered themselves hawks on war and 27 percent doves with 17 percent offering no opinion braestrup 1 by early february at height of first phase of offensive 61 percent declared themselves hawks 23 percent doves and 16 percent held no opinion johnson however made few comments to press during or immediately after offensive leaving an impression of indecision on public it was this lack of communication that caused a rising disapproval rating for his conduct of war by end of february his approval rating had fallen from 63 percent to 47 percent by end of march percentage of americans that expressed confidence in u s military policies in southeast asia had fallen from 74 to 54 percent braestrup 1 687 by 22 march president johnson had informed wheeler to forget 100 000 men president and his staff were refining a lesser version of troop increase a planned call up of 62 000 reservists 13 000 of whom would be

clifford final assessment of majority stupefied group karnow p 562 according to clifford few of them were thinking solely of vietnam anymore clifford p 516 all but four members called for disengagement from war leaving president deeply shaken four dissenters were bradley murphy fortas and taylor karnow p 562 pentagon papers p 610 according to pentagon papers advice of group was decisive in convincing johnson to reduce bombing of north vietnam pentagon papers p 609 johnson was depressed and despondent at course of recent events new york times article had been released just two days before democratic party s new hampshire primary where president suffered an unexpected setback in election finishing barely ahead of senator eugene mccarthy soon afterward senator robert f kennedy announced he would join contest for democratic nomination further emphasizing plummeting support for johnson s administration in wake of tet president was to make a televised address to nation on vietnam policy on 31 march and was deliberating on both troop request and his response to military situation by 28 march clifford was working hard to convince him to tone down his hard line speech maintaining force levels at their present size and instituting rusk s bombing negotiating proposal to clifford s surprise both rusk and rostow both of whom had previously been opposed to any form of deescalation offered no opposition to clifford s suggestions clifford p 520 on 31 march president johnson announced unilateral although still partial bombing halt during his television address he then stunned nation by declining to run for a second term in office to washington s surprise on 3 april hanoi announced that it would conduct negotiations which were scheduled to begin on 13 may in paris on 9 june president johnson replaced westmoreland as commander of macv with general creighton w abrams although decision had been made in december 1967 and westmoreland was made army chief of staff many saw his relief as punishment for entire tet debacle zaffiri pp 315 316 westmoreland was bitter and was upset that he had been made goat for war ibid see also westmoreland pp 361 362 abrams new strategy was quickly demonstrated by closure of strategic khe sanh base and ending of multi division search and destroy operations also gone were discussions of victory over north vietnam abrams new

political posture at paris talks which opened on 13 may north vietnamese opened second phase of general offensive in late april u s intelligence sources estimated between february and may north vietnamese dispatched 50 000 men down ho chi minh trail to replace losses incurred during earlier fighting dougan and weiss p 145 some of most prolonged and vicious combat of war opened on 29 april and lasted until 30 may when 8 000 men of pavn 320th division backed by artillery from across dmz threatened u s logistical base at dong ha in northwestern quang tri province in what became known as battle of dai do pavn clashed savagely with u s marine army and arvn forces before withdrawing pavn lost an estimated 2 100 men according to us arvn claims after inflicting casualties on allies of 290 killed and 946 wounded shulimson p 307 perhaps more indicative of pavn losses were 41 pavn prisoners taken and recovery of 500 weapons 132 of which were crew served thumb left upright u s marines move through ruins of hamlet of dai do after several days of intense fighting thumb left upright kham duc during evacuation during early morning hours of 4 may pavn vc units initiated second phase of offensive known by south vietnamese and americans as mini tet by striking 119 targets throughout south vietnam including saigon this time however allied intelligence was better prepared stripping away element of surprise most of communist forces were intercepted by allied screening elements before they reached their targets 13 vc battalions however managed to slip through cordon and once again plunged capital into chaos severe fighting occurred at phu lam where it took two days to root out vc 267th local force battalion around y bridge and at tan son nhut by 12 may however it was all over vc forces withdrew from area leaving behind over 3 000 dead hoang p 98 fighting had no sooner died down around saigon than u s forces in quang tin province suffered a defeat when pavn 2nd division attacked kham duc last special forces border surveillance camp in i corps 1 800 u s and arvn troops were isolated and under intense attack when macv made decision to avoid a situation reminiscent of that at khe sanh kham duc was evacuated by air while under fire and abandoned to north vietnamese spector p 166 75 thumb vietcong killed in mini tet pavn vc returned to saigon on 25 may and launched a second wave of attacks on city fighting during this phase differed from tet mau than and mini tet in that no u s installations were attacked during this series of actions vc forces occupied six buddhist pagodas in mistaken belief that they would be immune from artillery and air attack fiercest fighting once again took place in cholon one notable event occurred on 18 june when 152 members of vc quyet thang regiment surrendered to arvn forces largest communist surrender of war hoang p 101 actions also brought more death and suffering to city s inhabitants a further 87 000 were made homeless while more than 500 were killed and another 4 500 were wounded spector p 163 during part of second phase 5 may 30 may u s casualties amounted to 1 161 killed and 3 954 wounded spector p 319 phase iii phase iii of offensive began on 17 august and involved attacks in i ii and iii corps significantly during this series of actions only north vietnamese forces participated and targets were military in nature with less concise attacks against city targets main offensive was preceded by attacks on border towns of tay ninh an loc and loc ninh which were initiated in order to draw defensive forces from cities spector p 235 a thrust against da nang was preempted by u s marines operation allen brook continuing their border clearing operations three pavn regiments asserted heavy pressure on u s special forces camp at bu prang in quang duc province five kilometers from cambodian border fighting lasted for two days before pavn broke contact combat resulted in us arvn claiming 776 pavn vc casualties 114 south vietnamese and two americans hoang p 110 saigon was struck again during this phase but attacks were less sustained and once again repulsed as far as macv was concerned august offensive was a dismal failure spector p 240 in five weeks of fighting and after loss of 20 000 troops previous objectives of spurring an uprising and mass defection had not been attained during this final and decisive phase yet as historian ronald spector has pointed out communist failures were not final or decisive either horrendous casualties and suffering endured by pavn vc units during these sustained operations were beginning to tell fact that there were no apparent military gains made that could possibly justify all blood and effort just exacerbated situation during first half of 1969
