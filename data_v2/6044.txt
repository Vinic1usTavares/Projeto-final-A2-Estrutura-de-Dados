their own pockets committee was sharply criticised in local press for their handling of campaign arch is a grade i listed building and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of lutyens war memorials background thumb left sir edwin lutyens architect engaged for leicester s war memorial in aftermath of first world war and its unprecedented casualties thousands of war memorials were built across britain amongst most prominent designers of memorials was sir edwin lutyens described by historic england as leading english architect of his generation lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients but war had a profound effect on him following it he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties he became renowned for his commemorative works through his design for cenotaph on whitehall which became britain s national war memorial this along with his work for imperial war graves commission iwgc led to commissions for war memorials across britain and empire brown pp 174 175 victoria park is a area of open land to south east of leicester city centre formerly a racetrack it was laid out as a public park in late 19th century at beginning of first world war five part time territorial force units were based in leicester along with elements of regular leicestershire regiment special reserve battalion of leicestershire regiment was sent to man coastal defences near hull while all five territorial units were sent to front among them was city s former member of parliament mp eliot crawshay williams who served in middle east with 1st leicestershire royal horse artillery richardson pp 14 16 recruitment to army was lower in leicester than in other english industrial towns partly because of low unemployment in area town s major industries were textile and footwear manufacturing both of which were necessary for war effort richardson p 21 later in war many of town s factories were given over to munitions production leicester produced first batch of howitzer shells by a british company which was not making ammunition before war richardson p 63 local authorities held recruiting rallies as war progressed aided by william buckingham a local soldier who won victoria cross at battle of neuve chapelle in 1915 richardson p 61 leicester was granted city status by king george v in 1919 in recognition of its industries contribution to british war effort king and queen mary visited leicester that summer during which they called at several businesses in city in de montfort hall king presented gallantry

park as well as members of public parade was viewed by thousands of disabled veterans voluntary aid detachment nurses and war widows and orphans such was size of force on parade it took 45 minutes to proceed past royal pavilion beazley pp 174 175 richardson p 150 commissioning a temporary war memorial was placed outside leicester town hall in 1917 radford cawthorne p 70 a public meeting was held in leicester on 14 may 1919 fighting having ceased with armistice of 11 november 1918 leading to creation of a war memorial committee of 23 members to propose a suitable permanent memorial committee was chaired by henry manners 8th duke of rutland with sir jonathan north lord mayor of leicester as vice chair two sub committees were established one to look after finance and other to supervise design duke of rutland suggested siting permanent memorial outside town hall but this was rejected unanimously by city council and committee examined potential sites at leicester castle and victoria park skelton p 67 a suggestion from a member of public was examined by design sub committee but in october 1919 full committee resolved to appoint lutyens as architect and to build memorial in victoria park which had been in ownership of city council since 1860s and was laid out as a public park in 1883 lutyens visited on 20 october 1919 and was accompanied by duke and other committee members on an inspection of chosen site original plan involved crossing avenues of lime trees to create a tree cathedral with a cenotaph identical to one in london at western end and a stone of remembrance at crossing within a circular walled enclosure which would be inscribed with names of dead paths along plan of cathedral would be paved to accentuate purpose of structure this proposal was accepted and a model was made and displayed in city museum by march 1922 project had been scaled back due to a shortage of funds and lack of public enthusiasm for project costs were estimated at ps23 000 of which only around ps4 300 had been raised at a public meeting on 29 march committee agreed to abandon scheme and that a memorial worthy of city be erected on ground near main entrance gates two days later committee asked lutyens to design a memorial arch lutyens advised that such an arch would cost in region of ps25 000 he suggested they consider alternatives such as an obelisk which he estimated would be around half cost but committee decided to proceed with arch despite cost they presented new design to another public meeting in may 1923 lutyens told meeting that arch represented city s triumphal spirit and he announced name arch of remembrance cavanagh p 340 corke p 55 skelton p 66 name was chosen to avoid impression that memorial would be a triumphal arch something committee felt was incompatible with mood of mourning for dead skelton p 69 carden coyne p 127 new proposal was approved and construction started on revised memorial in 1923 and work was completed by 1925 structure was begun by nine elms stone and masonry works and completed by holloway brothers who built several other memorials for lutyens including southampton cenotaph due to a continuing shortfall of funding war memorial committee took out a bank loan to pay for works to be completed five committee members served as guarantors design memorial in portland stone is a square plan arch with four

memorial is encircled by iron railings which are pierced by four pairs of stone piers supporting gates opposite each arch arch was not intended to be passed through and gates are kept closed piers are decorated with meanders greek key patterns and swags and topped by stone urns similar to one on lutyens royal berkshire regiment war memorial in reading skelton p 170 arches are a relatively uncommon form of memorial particularly for first world war leicester s is one of three by lutyens and only one in britain other two being thiepval memorial on somme in france unveiled in 1932 and india gate originally named all india war memorial unveiled in 1931 in new delhi india gate in particular bears a close resemblance to arch of remembrance though it is nearly twice its height thiepval is a much more complex structure using multiple interlocking arches to form one much larger arch skelton p 100 borg p 130 king p 66 winter p 105 lutyens proposed an arch with a dome similar to leicester s for an iwgc memorial at saint quentin in france in 1924 though this was later abandoned in favour of thiepval memorial three arches that were built and abandoned proposal all share a strong visual resemblance amery et al pp 153 154 stamp p 132 pp 153 155 p 415 setting arch is situated on highest point of victoria park dominating its surroundings it is visible for a considerable distance down lancaster road which leads to park from city centre and from london road a6 and welford road two main routes out of leicester to south at time of memorial s construction area was much more open and arch would have visible from a greater distance including from railway to south west development in area through 20th century including buildings of university of leicester now partially obscure view radford cawthorne p 72 setting was enhanced when following death of his wife in 1930s north commissioned lutyens to design two processional entrances to victoria park leading to war memorial as a gift to city lutyens produced a pair of lodges and gates at granville road entrance to victoria park to north east of memorial and a set of gates and gate piers to north west leading out onto university road lodges are single storey rectangular pavilions which flank gates external walls are stuccoed giving effect of ashlar with quoins at angles and large sash windows both have architraves above doorways and a frieze below pyramidal slate roofs and large chimney stacks four gate piers are made of ashlar matching lodges they support ornate iron gates which feature an overthrow incorporating leicester s coat of arms gate piers at university road entrance are in portland stone matching memorial decorated with tuscan pilasters and topped with an entablature and tall urns they support two smaller pedestrian gates one each side of a central pair above central gates is an overthrow again featuring city s coat of arms a processional way leads from both entrances to war memorial where two paths meet long path from memorial to university road gates is known as peace walk formerly war memorial approach and is lined by shrub borders and formal flower beds peace walk was laid out in 2016

eight of butler s sons served in army during war of whom four were killed in action glover lost three sons along with two nephews and two brothers in law boorman 2005 p 143 memorial was dedicated by cyril bardsley bishop of peterborough to 12 000 men from leicester and leicestershire killed during first world war total cost of memorial was ps27 000 of which ps1 635 was lutyens fee and expenses at time of unveiling only ps16 000 had been raised and by end of 1925 committee still had a shortfall of ps5 500 which five guarantors repaid to bank out of their own pockets boorman 1988 pp 151 152 richardson p 155 sum spent was similar to that raised for rochdale cenotaph but committee in leicester decided to spend entire sum on a monument rather than a fund for wounded servicemen or war widows as in rochdale with result that leicester s is lutyens largest war memorial in britain skelton pp 65 94 it is described by historic england as most imposing of lutyens english war memorials and by lutyens biographer christopher hussey as one of lutyens most spectacular memorials in appearance and setting hussey p 474 another biographer tim skelton laments that memorial could have been yet more impressive had commissioning process been smoother skelton p 65 reporting on unveiling local newspaper leicester advertiser praised design but stridently criticised war memorial committee describing it as a disgrace that nearly seven years after cessation of hostilities we should be touting around to get money to pay for what should have been bought and paid for at least five years ago it could have been obtained then quite easily but on part of those who had control and a lack of tact in dealing with public caused whole thing to fall flat paper went on to compare scheme with carillon erected as a war memorial in nearby town of loughborough noting that leicester though some eight times as big as loughborough has had a struggle to raise as much money as loughborough has already spent a ceremony is held at memorial every year on remembrance sunday in 2017 memorial was twinned with india gate in new delhi to honour members of indian labour corps who served in first world war as part of ceremonies india s high commissioner to britain laid a wreath at arch of remembrance and britain s high commissioner to india laid one at india gate in 2018 leicester city council
