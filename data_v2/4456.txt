premier league and tenth largest in united kingdom built to host 2002 commonwealth games stadium has since staged 2008 uefa cup final england football internationals rugby league matches a boxing world title fight england rugby union team s last match of 2015 rugby world cup and summer music concerts during football off season stadium originally proposed as an athletics arena in manchester s bid for 2000 summer olympics was converted after 2002 commonwealth games from a 38 000 capacity arena to a 48 000 seat football stadium at a cost to city council of ps22 million and to manchester city of ps20 million manchester city f c agreed to lease stadium from manchester city council and moved there from maine road in summer of 2003 stadium was built by laing construction at a cost of ps112 million and was designed and engineered by whose design incorporated a cable stayed roof structure which is separated from main stadium bowl and suspended entirely by twelve exterior masts and attached cables stadium design has received much praise and many accolades including an award from royal institute of british architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design and a special award in 2003 from institution of structural engineers for its unique structural design in august 2015 a 7 000 seat third tier on south stand was completed in time for start of 2015 16 football season expansion was designed to be in keeping with existing roof design history background plans to build a new stadium in manchester were formulated before 1989 as part of city s bid to host 1996 summer olympics manchester city council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80 000 capacity stadium on a greenfield site west of manchester city centre bid failed and atlanta hosted games four years later city council bid to host 2000 summer olympics but this time focusing on a brownfield site east of city centre on derelict land that was site of bradford colliery known colloquially as eastlands council s shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation on urban renewal promising vital support funding for such projects government became involved in funding purchase and clearance of eastlands site in 1992 for february 1993 bid city council submitted another 80 000 capacity stadium design produced by design consultants arup associates firm that helped select eastlands site on 23 september 1993 games were awarded to sydney but following year manchester submitted same scheme design to millennium commission as a millennium stadium only to have this proposal rejected undeterred manchester city council subsequently bid to host 2002 commonwealth games once again proposing same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from 2000 olympics bid and this time were successful in 1996 this same planned stadium competed with wembley stadium to gain funding to become new national stadium but money was used to redevelop wembley after successful athletics events at commonwealth games conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as jonathan edwards and sebastian coe as at time united kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from designs for a rebuilt wembley stadium had either of two larger stadium proposals developed by arup been agreed for funding then manchester would have had a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large scale athletics events through use of movable seating sport england wished to avoid creating a white elephant so they insisted that city council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert coms from a track and field arena to a football stadium thereby ensuring its long term financial viability sport england hoped either manchester city council or manchester city f c would provide extra ps50 million required to convert stadium to a 65 000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating however manchester city council did not have money to facilitate movable seating and manchester city were lukewarm about idea stadium architects arup sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football and cited examples such as stadio delle alpi and olympic stadium with both juventus and bayern munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them 2002 commonwealth games thumb right model of 80 000 seat stadium used in 2000 olympic bid proposed stadium was a larger design of coms with more access ramps and masts stadium s foundation stone was laid by prime minister tony blair in december 1999 and construction began in january 2000 stadium was designed by arup associates and constructed by laing construction at a cost of approximately ps112 million ps77 million of which was provided by sport england with remainder funded by manchester city council for commonwealth games stadium featured a single lower tier of seating running around three sides of athletics track and second tiers to two sides with an open air temporary stand at northern end initially providing a seating capacity for games of 38 000 subsequently extended to 41 000 through installation of additional temporary trackside seating along east and south stands first public event at stadium was opening ceremony of 2002 commonwealth games on 25 july 2002 among dignitaries present was queen elizabeth ii who made a speech delivered to her in an electronic baton and declared commonwealth games open during following ten days of competition stadium hosted track and field events and all rugby sevens matches sixteen new commonwealth games track and term track and field normally excludes road race athletics events e g men s 50 km race walk women s marathon etc from other athletics sport events road race events may terminate in an athletics stadium but are not usually considered as having been staged there furthermore race walking events were removed from commonwealth games program after 2010 games although paraplegic athletics events are normally now included under term track and field two ead records have been excluded from tally of sixteen stated in article as they are often omitted from externally sourced lists of past games records and thus become a frequent cause of confusion when included in such totals records six men s and ten women s were set in stadium eight of which three men s and five women s records are still extant after three subsequent series of games in 2006 2010 and 2014 prior to 2012 summer olympics held in london 2002 games was largest multi sport event ever to be staged in united kingdom eclipsing earlier london 1948 summer olympics in numbers of teams and competing athletes 3 679 and it was world s first multi sport tournament to include a limited number of full medal events for elite athletes with a disability ead in terms of number of participating nations it is still largest commonwealth games in history featuring 72 nations competing in 281 events across seventeen fourteen individual and three team sports stadium conversion sections of track were removed and relaid at other athletics venues and internal ground level was lowered to make way for an additional tier of seating on terracing already constructed then buried for original configuration three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16 000 were dismantled and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to existing one at southern end this work took nearly a year to complete and added 23 000 permanent seats increasing capacity of converted stadium by 7 000note 7 000 capacity after conversion 48 000 less capacity for games officially 38 000 but expanded to 41 000 number of new permanent seats added 23 000 less number of temporary seats dismantled 16 000 all capacity numbers used are rounded to 2 s f to approximately 48 000 manchester city f c moved to ground in time for start of 2003 04 season total cost of this conversion was in excess of ps40 million with track pitch and seating conversion being funded by city council at a cost of ps22 million and installation of bars restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout stadium being funded by football club at a cost of ps20 million games had made a small operating surplus and sport england agreed that this could be reinvested in converting athletics warm up track adjacent to main stadium into 6 000 seat manchester regional arena at a cost of ps3 5 million stadium expansion thumb 200px right south stand after expansion in 2015 stadium is owned by manchester city council and leased by football club on a fully repairing basis all operating maintenance and future capital costs are borne by club who consequently receive all revenues from stadium users 2008 takeover made football club one of wealthiest in world prompting suggestions that it could consider buying stadium outright manchester city signed an agreement with manchester city council in march 2010 to allow a ps1 billion redevelopment led by architect rafael vinoly during 2010 closed season football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated with a ps1 million investment being made in playing surface so that it is better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage in october 2010 manchester city renegotiated stadium lease obtaining naming rights to stadium in return for agreeing to now pay city council an annual fixed sum of ps3 million where previously it had only paid half of ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35 000 this new agreement occurred as part of a standard five year review of original lease and it amounts to an approximate ps1 million annual increase in council revenues from stadium during 2011 14 club sold all 36 000 of its allocated season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance that is very close to its maximum seating capacity see table in previous section consequently during 2014 15 season an expansion of stadium was undertaken south stand was extended with addition of a third tier which in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating increased stadium capacity to approximately 55 000 construction commenced on south stand in april 2014 and was completed for start of 2015 16 season a final phase of expansion which received planning approval at same time as others but remains unscheduled would have added a matching third tier of seats to north stand in november 2018 club consulted with season ticket holders on possible alternative configurations for this expansion including proposals for a still larger two tier north stand without executive boxes or corporate hospitality lounges and possibly with areas convertible to safe standing full length of second tiers in east and west stands would then be reconfigured as premium seating associated with new hospitality bar areas depending on preferred design option this final phase could bring stadium s total seating capacity up to approximately 63 000 making etihad stadium
