providing game developers with various authoring tools target systems of crystal tools are playstation 3 xbox 360 microsoft windows and wii this was decided with intention of making cross platform production more feasible idea for engine sprang from square enix s desire to have a unified game development environment in order to effectively share technology and know how of company s individual teams crystal tools entered development in august 2005 under code name white engine it was intended for then playstation 3 exclusive role playing game final fantasy xiii decision to expand crystal tools compatibility to other game projects and systems marked official project start for a company wide engine development was carried out by research and development division headed by taku murata which was specifically established for this purpose as square enix s biggest project to date creation of crystal tools caused substantial problems in simultaneous production of several flagship titles

new functions and tools should need for them arise although crystal tools allows for easier cross platform development differences in target systems video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine tuning adjustments in games for example concerning texture sizes development origins as a video game company with different production teams square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know how and technology even before merger with its competitor enix desire for a common development infrastructure and engine dates back to 1997 role playing video game final fantasy tactics which was created in transitional period from 2d to 3d game production back then artists working on game asked programmer taku murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in final game as development was carried out on personal computers graphics were displayed on computer monitors this looked very different from playstation console s actual graphics displayed on a television screen initially a faithful preview of game s visuals was too time consuming because all data had to be transferred from pc to console first to evade this step murata created an instant preview tool with this he soon witnessed a boost in artists productivity and in quality of their work for 2000 s vagrant story developers opted to reuse this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to game s fully polygonal 3d graphics with 2001 s playonline service company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions after square enix merger however individual teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game which would eventually go to waste as only their respective creators knew how to use them with amount of assets and tools required by in development final fantasy xii and impending advent of seventh console generation a common data format for company was proposed in 2004 it was to be developed in house and replace general purpose formats such as and realizing goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of company as a whole select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on project on a voluntary basis but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results nevertheless murata considered this group effort a first step in right direction in 2005 he was appointed general manager of newly formed technology division although this enabled murata and his subordinates to talk about a company wide engine more extensively lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements version 1 0 following public s positive reaction to graphics of final fantasy vii technical demo for ps3 presented at electronic entertainment expo in 2005 it was decided to release role playing video game final fantasy xiii on playstation 3 rather than playstation 2 as originally planned in august 2005 technology division began working on white engine a playstation 3 engine that was supposed to be exclusively used for final fantasy xiii eight months later however it was decided to engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as action rpg final fantasy versus xiii later rebranded and repurposed into final fantasy xv and massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg final fantasy xiv in order for company to stay competitive in a multi platform environment support of engine was extended from playstation 3 to xbox 360 and microsoft windows both of which were successful in western markets this marked official development start of a company wide engine for whose purpose technology division was expanded into research and development division in september 2006 murata remained division s general manager with a full time staff at his disposal during development of crystal tools research and development division continually surveyed what types of tools were needed to create square enix s flagship titles among most frequently requested features was an extensive use of character close ups this made staff realize that final fantasy series put great emphasis on anime like coolness of its characters consequently engine s developers focused on attractive visuals rather than on accurate physics to achieve a stylized look a post processing filter for additional lighting blur and visual effects was implemented square enix s large teams were typically composed of a mix of industry veterans and rookie game developers to accommodate this graphical user interface of engine became another main feature and was designed to be as intuitive as possible large investments into technology and human resources quickly made white engine company s biggest project to date after one year of work version 1 0 of engine was completed in september 2007 version 1 1 and later right 300px thumb crystal tools in 2009 after version 1 0 had been finished engine s code name white engine was changed to official title crystal tools this was not only done to represent company and its works better but also due to refractive effects of real life crystals that were meant to symbolize flexibility of engine over next few months programmers advanced engine to version 1 1 and added preliminary support for wii in september 2011 final fantasy versus xiii director tetsuya nomura announced that his team had replaced crystal tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by lighting technology of company s new luminous studio engine other teams such as staff behind final fantasy xiii 2 kept using and refining crystal tools for lightning returns final fantasy xiii engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design problems while final fantasy xiii was in production development of crystal tools caused significant problems and delays programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account based on this feedback murata s team tried to adapt engine to needs of several game projects which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented engine s specifications from being finalized furthermore as separate groups were working on individual tools of engine there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance unable to wait any longer final fantasy xiii team had no choice but to begin creating assets to keep to game s production schedule however lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with engine in end it was decided that final fantasy xiii was to be principal focus of crystal tools and game s team began cooperating with research and development division more closely to receive required tools and specifications while preliminary support of crystal tools was developed for wii console did not fully support all components in 2008 murata said that square enix might license engine out to other companies at some point in future although limited documentation and impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so two years later final fantasy xiii producer yoshinori kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for long period between title s announcement and release reception at time of final fantasy xiiis release crystal tools was met with praise from critics eurogamers richard leadbetter described it as an excellent 3d engine nate of wired uk felt that it produced some of most breath taking cutscenes and 3d graphics seen on xbox 360 and that it made lengthy cutscenes more movie like than ever writing for rpgfan stephen harris called crystal tools an impressive software that powered jaw dropping visuals in final fantasy xiii as time passed on however various media outlets criticized square enix for building their own engine gamezone s james wynne saw crystal tools as a means of combusting money during its development and said it was fairly out of date by time it had matured enough to be used for company s projects gamesradar s ashley reed faulted crystal tools for leading to extended delays in company s release schedule and even lowering quality of some games she blamed engine for having caused a catastrophic meltdown for final fantasy xiv harris said that people had come to expect pretty graphics from crystal tools and that final fantasy xiv simultaneously met and completely shattered those expectations he felt that game was most visually astounding mmorpg ever created on pc platform however he called certain graphical features resource hogs and was disappointed with steep hardware requirements recommended by square enix to run game rpgfan s staff writer derek heemsbergen said that lightning returns final fantasy xiii could be seen as a desperate attempt to squeeze one last game out of aging graphical engine wynne equally panned square enix s alleged decision to drop crystal tools in favor of newly developed
