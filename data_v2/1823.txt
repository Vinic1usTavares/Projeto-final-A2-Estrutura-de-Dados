designate one wing of cushing as a co ed housing space for black students of all grades prior to plan s formulation upperclassmen black students could opt to live in a student community in kendrick house while underclassmen could live in an analogous community in main building cushing residents were not notified of plan until after its approval and a public meeting was held at which objections were raised by both cushing residents and black students that one wing of dorm might not be enough space to foster a black community and that kendrick house should instead be repurposed as elective all black housing after college s administration expressed possibility that this plan might be in violation of u s department of health education and welfare standards on segregation all but four
