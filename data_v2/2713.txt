battle of fort eben emael was a battle between belgian and german forces that took place between 10 may and 11 may 1940 and was part of battle of belgium and fall gelb german invasion of low countries and france an assault force of german paratroopers fallschirmjager was tasked with assaulting and capturing fort eben emael a belgian fortress whose strategic position and strong artillery emplacements dominated several important bridges over albert canal these carried roads which led into belgian heartland and were what german forces intended to use to advance as some of german airborne forces assaulted fortress and disabled garrison and artillery pieces inside it others simultaneously captured three bridges over canal having disabled fortress airborne troops were then ordered to protect bridges against belgian counter attacks until they linked up with ground forces from german 18th army battle was a strategic victory for german forces with airborne troops landing on top of fortress with gliders and using explosives and flamethrowers to disable outer defences of fortress fallschirmjager then entered fortress killing a number of defenders and containing rest in lower sections of fortress simultaneously rest of german assault force had landed near three bridges over canal destroyed a number of pillboxes and defensive positions and defeated belgian forces guarding bridges capturing them and bringing them under german control airborne troops suffered heavy casualties during operation but succeeded in holding bridges until arrival of german ground forces who then aided airborne troops in assaulting fortress a second time and forcing surrender of remaining members of garrison german forces were then able to use two bridges over canal to bypass a number of belgian defensive positions and advance into belgium to aid in invasion of country bridge at kanne was destroyed forcing german engineers to construct a new bridge background thumb left a retractable gun turret at fort eben emael on 10 may 1940 germany launched fall gelb i e plan yellow an invasion of low countries by attacking through netherlands luxembourg and belgium german oberkommando der wehrmacht believed that german forces could outflank maginot line and then advance through southern belgium and into northern france cutting off british expeditionary force and a large number of french forces and forcing french government to surrender harclerode p 46 to gain access to northern france german forces would have to defeat armed forces of low countries and either bypass or neutralize several defensive positions primarily in belgium and netherlands some of these defensive positions were only lightly defended and intended more as delaying positions than true defensive lines designed to stop an enemy attack however some defences were of a more permanent nature possessed considerable fortifications and were garrisoned by significant numbers of troops peel line in netherlands which stretched from southern shore of zuiderzee to belgian border near weert had a large number of fortifications combined with natural obstacles such as marsh lands and geld valley which could easily be flooded to impede an attack tugwell p 47 main belgian defensive line k w line also known as dyle or line along river dyle protected port of antwerp and belgian capital brussels between k w line and border was a delaying line along albert canal this delaying line was protected by forward positions manned by troops except in a single area where canal ran close to dutch border which was known as maastricht appendix due to proximity of dutch city of maastricht there belgian military could not build forward positions due to proximity of border and instead assigned an infantry division to guard three bridges over canal in area a brigade being assigned to each bridge harclerode p 47 bridges were defended by blockhouses equipped with machine guns artillery support was provided by fort eben emael whose artillery pieces covered two of bridges tugwell p 51 german high command became aware of defensive plan which called for belgian forces to briefly hold delaying positions along albert canal and then retreat to link up with british and french forces on k w line germans developed a strategy that would disrupt this plan by seizing three bridges in maastricht appendix as well as other bridges in belgium and netherlands this would allow their own forces to breach defensive positions and advance into netherlands harclerode p 48 prelude belgian preparation thumb right map of fort eben emael belgian 7th infantry division was assigned to guard three bridges over canal supplementing troops who garrisoned fort eben emael at time of battle defences for each bridge consisted of four large concrete pillboxes on western side of canal three equipped with machine guns and a fourth with an anti tank gun bunker containing anti tank gun was positioned close to road leading from bridge with one machinegun equipped bunker immediately behind bridge and two others flanking bridge a short distance either side a company position existed on western bank of canal by each of bridges with a small observation post on eastern side which could be quickly recalled and all three bridges could be destroyed with demolition charges set into their structures triggered by a firing mechanism situated in anti tank bunkers fort eben emael which measured had been built during 1930s and completed by 1935 by blasting required space out of marl it possessed walls and roofs composed of thick reinforced concrete as well as four retractable casemates and sixty four strongpoints kuhn p 29 fort was equipped with six 120mm artillery pieces with a range of ten miles two of which could traverse 360 degrees sixteen 75mm artillery pieces twelve 60mm high velocity anti tank guns twenty five twin mounted machine guns and some anti aircraft guns one side of fort faced canal whilst other three faced land and were defended by minefields deep ditches a high wall concrete pillboxes fitted with machine guns fifteen searchlights were emplaced on top of fort and 60mm anti tank guns harclerode pp 47 48 a large number of tunnels ran beneath fort connecting individual turrets to command centre and ammunition stores fort also possessed its own hospital and living quarters for garrison as well as a power station that provided electricity to power guns provide internal and external illumination and to power wireless network and air purifying system used by garrison lucas p 21 belgian plans did not call for garrison of fort and attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force it was assumed that sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that detachment on eastern side of canal could be withdrawn bridges destroyed and garrison ready to fight a delaying action defending force would then retire to main defensive positions along river dyle where they would link up with other allied forces german preparation airborne assault on fort eben emael and three bridges it helped protect was part of a much larger german airborne operation that involved 7th air division and 22nd airlanding division 7th air division comprising three parachute regiments and one infantry regiment was tasked with capturing a number of river and canal bridges that led to dutch defensive positions centered around rotterdam as well as an airfield at waalhaven 22nd airlanding division which was composed of two infantry regiments and a reinforced parachute battalion was tasked with capturing a number of airfields in vicinity of hague at valkenburg and once these airfields had been secured by parachute battalion rest of division would land with aim of occupying dutch capital and capturing entire dutch government royal family and high ranking members of dutch military division would also interdict all roads and railway lines in area to impede movement of dutch forces intention of german okw was to use two airborne divisions to create a corridor along which 18th army could advance into netherlands without being impeded by destroyed bridges general kurt student who proposed deployment of two airborne divisions argued that their presence would hold open southern approaches to rotterdam prevent movement of dutch reserves based in north west holland and any french forces sent to aid dutch defenders and deny use of airfields to allied aircraft all of which would aid a rapid advance by 18th army tugwell p 48 400 junkers ju 52 transport aircraft would be used to deploy parachute elements of airborne troops as well as transport elements of two airborne divisions not landing by parachute or glider force tasked with assaulting fort and capturing three bridges was formed from elements of 7th air division and 22nd airlanding division and was named sturmabteilung koch assault detachment koch after leader of force hauptmann walter koch harclerode p 51 force which had been assembled in november 1939 was primarily composed of parachutists from 1st parachute regiment and engineers from 7th air division as well as a small group of luftwaffe pilots tugwell p 52 although force was composed primarily of parachutists it was decided that first landings by force should be by glider adolf hitler who had taken a personal interest in arrangements for assault force had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot hanna reitsch that gliders in flight were nearly silent it was believed that since belgian anti aircraft defences used sound location arrays and not radar it would be possible to tow gliders near to dutch border and then release them achieving a surprise attack as belgian defenders would not be able to detect them fifty dfs 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by assault force and then a period of intensive training began a detailed study of fort bridges and local area was made and a replica of area was constructed for airborne troops to train in joint exercises between parachutists and glider pilots were carried out in early spring of 1940 and a number of refinements made to equipment and tactics to be used such as barbed wire being added to nose skids of gliders to reduce their landing run and airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in germany and not on fortifications in czechoslovakia similar to fort eben emael lucas p 20 secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways when exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans sub units of force were frequently renamed and moved from one location to another unit badges and insignia were removed and airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks or to take leave thumb left 250px german dfs 230 troop carrying glider hauptmann koch divided his force into four assault groups group granite under oberleutnant rudolf witzig composed of eighty five men in eleven gliders whose task would be to assault and capture fort eben emael group steel commanded by oberleutnant gustav altmann and formed of ninety two men and nine gliders would capture veldwezelt bridge group concrete commanded by leutnant gerhard schacht and composed of ninety six men in eleven gliders would capture vroenhoven bridge and group iron under leutnant martin schachter composed of ninety men in ten gliders who would capture kanne bridge crucial element for assault force particularly group granite was time it was believed that combination of a noiseless approach by gliders used by assault force and lack of a declaration of war by german government would give attackers element of surprise however german estimates were that this would last at most for sixty minutes after which superior numbers of belgian forces defending fort and bridges as well as any reinforcements sent to area would begin to come to bear against relatively small number of lightly armed airborne troops german plan therefore was to eliminate within those sixty minutes as many anti aircraft positions and individual cupolas and casemates as was possible and at all costs to put out of action long range artillery pieces which covered three bridges destruction of these guns was expected to be completed within ten minutes within this time airborne troops would have to break out of their gliders cover distance to guns fix explosive charges to barrels of guns and detonate them all while under enemy fire finalized plan for assault called for between nine and eleven gliders to land on western bank of albert canal by each of three bridges just prior to 05 30 on 10 may time scheduled for fall gelb to begin tugwell p 50 groups assigned to assault three bridges would overwhelm defending belgian troops remove any demolition charges and then prepare to defend bridges against an expected counter attack forty minutes later three ju 52 transport aircraft would fly over each position dropping a further twenty four airborne troops as reinforcements as well as machine guns and significant amounts of ammunition simultaneously force assigned to assault fort eben emael was to land on top of fort in eleven gliders eliminate any defenders attempting to repel them cripple what artillery they could with explosive charges and then prevent garrison from dislodging them having achieved their initial objectives of seizing bridges and eliminating long range artillery pieces possessed by fort airborne troops would then defend their positions until arrival of german ground forces battle thumb right albert canal as seen from a fort eben emael machine gun position 23 may 1940 for reasons of security sturmabteilung koch was dispersed around several locations in rhineland until it received orders for operation against fort eben emael and three bridges to begin preliminary orders were received on 9 may ordering separated detachments to move to a pre arranged concentration area and shortly afterwards a second order arrived informing assault force that fall gelb was to begin at 05 25 on 10 may at 04 30 forty two gliders carrying 493 airborne troops that formed assault force were lifted off from two airfields in cologne armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives aircraft maintained strict radio silence forcing pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards belgium radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of assault force could not be informed that tow ropes on one of gliders had snapped forcing glider to land inside germany pilot of a second glider released his tow rope prematurely and was unable to land near its objective harclerode p 53 both gliders were carrying troops assigned to group granite and were destined to assault fort eben emael thereby leaving group understrength it also left it under command of oberleutnant witzig s second in command oberfeldwebel helmut wenzel as witzig was in one of gliders forced to land remaining gliders were released from their tow ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of which was deemed high enough for gliders to land by three bridges and on top of fort and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly after ju 52 s released gliders and began turning away belgian anti aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire this alerted defences in area to presence of gliders bridges all nine gliders carrying troops assigned to group steel landed next to bridge at veldwezelt at 05 20 barbed wire wrapped around landing skids of gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt glider belonging to leutnant altmann had landed some distance from bridge and a second had landed directly in front of a belgian pillbox which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small arms fire non commissioned officer in charge of troops from second glider hurled grenades at pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at door and detonated it allowing bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle simultaneously altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to bridge until two men were able to reach canal bank and climb onto girders of bridge and disconnect demolition charges placed there by belgian garrison thus airborne troops prevented belgians from destroying bridge though they still faced rest of belgian defenders defenders held on until a platoon of german reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village however assaulting force s small arms fire could not overcome two field guns located five hundred metres from bridge thus forcing altmann to call for air support several junkers ju 87 stukas responded and knocked out guns kuhn p 30 group steel was to be relieved by 14 30 but belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21 30 during fighting attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded thumb left belgian soldiers surrender to german troops at bridge at veldwezelt 11 may 1940 ten of eleven gliders transporting group concrete landed next to vroenhoven bridge at 05 15 eleventh glider having been hit by anti aircraft fire en route to bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside dutch territory gliders were engaged by heavy anti aircraft fire as they landed causing one of gliders to stall in mid air resulting crash severely wounded three airborne troops rest of gliders landed without damage one of gliders landed near to fortification housing bridge detonators this allowed airborne troops to rapidly assault position they killed occupants and tore out wires connecting explosives to detonator set ensuring bridge could not be destroyed remaining belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter attacks in an attempt to recapture bridge they were repelled with aid of several machine guns dropped by parachute to airborne troops at 06 15 kuhn p 32 constant belgian attacks meant that group concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21 40 they suffered losses of seven dead and twenty four wounded all but one of ten gliders carrying airborne troops assigned to group iron were able to land next to their objective bridge at kanne due to a navigation error by pilots of transport aircraft towing gliders one of gliders was dropped in wrong area other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti aircraft fire and released at 05 35 as gliders began to descend towards their objective bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by belgian garrison unlike garrisons of other two bridges belgian defenders at kanne had been forewarned as german mechanized column heading for bridge to reinforce group iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave defenders sufficient time to destroy bridge as gliders came in to land one was hit by anti aircraft fire and crashed into ground killing most of occupants remaining eight landed successfully and airborne troops stormed belgian positions and eliminated defenders by 05 50 airborne troops had secured area as well as nearby village of kanne but they were then subjected to a strong counter attack which was only repulsed with aid of air support from stuka divebombers defenders launched several more counter attacks during night ensuring that airborne troops could not be relieved until morning of 11 may group iron suffered heaviest casualties of all three assault groups assigned to capture bridges with twenty two dead and twenty six wounded one of airborne troops assigned to group was taken prisoner by belgians he was later freed by german forces at a british prisoner of war camp at dunkirk fort eben emael thumb right bridge at kanne destroyed by belgian military 23 may 1940 nine remaining gliders transporting airborne troops assigned to group granite successfully landed on roof of fort eben emael using arrester parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt harclerode p 54 airborne troops rapidly emerged from gliders oberfeldwebel helmut wenzel assumed command in absence of witzig began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements on top of fort which housed artillery pieces that could target three captured bridges in southern part of fort objective no 18 an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge which collapsed casemate s observation dome and part of roof of fort itself lucas p 23 objective no 12 a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops who then moved to objective no 26 a turret holding another three 75mm weapons although explosives were detonated against this and airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off this proved to be premature as one of guns was rapidly brought to bear against attackers who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled as was a barracks known to house belgian troops however attempts to destroy objective no 24 proved to be less successful objective twin turrets with heavy calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own forcing troops from two gliders to be used primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to turrets and detonated but whilst they shook turrets they did not destroy them and other airborne troops were forced to climb turrets and smash gun barrels thumb left one of fort eben emael s casemates maastricht 2 in northern section of fort similar actions were taking place as airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable fortifications housing artillery pieces objective no 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine guns whose arcs of fire covered western side of fort to destroy casemate airborne troops used a flamethrower to force belgian soldiers manning weapons to retreat and then detonated shaped charges against fortification to disable it another observation cupola fitted with machine guns objective no 19 was destroyed but two further objectives nos 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations unexpected complications came from objective no 23 a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces kuhn p 34 it had been assumed that weapons in this fortification could not stop airborne assault but this assumption was found to be false when weapons opened fire forcing airborne troops in area to go to cover rapid fire of weapons led to air support being summoned and a stuka squadron bombed cupola although bombs did not destroy cupola explosions did force belgians to retract it throughout rest of fighting any exterior entrances and exits located by airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal garrison inside fort giving garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter attack airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling artillery pieces that fort could have used to bombard captured bridges but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled a number of these included anti aircraft weapons and machine guns thumb bullet damage on fortifications at eben emael as these secondary objectives were attacked a single glider landed on top of fort from which emerged oberleutnant rudolf witzig after his glider had unintentionally landed in german territory he had radioed for another tug and it landed in field with a replacement glider once airborne troops had broken down fences and hedges obstructing aircraft they boarded new glider and were towed through anti aircraft fire to fort vliegen 1988 p 42 having achieved their primary objectives of disabling artillery pieces possessed by fort airborne troops then held it against belgian counter attacks which began almost immediately these counter attacks were made by belgian infantry formations without artillery support and were uncoordinated this allowed airborne troops to repel them with machine gun fire lucas p 25 artillery from several smaller forts nearby and belgian field artillery units also targeted airborne troops but this too was uncoordinated and achieved nothing and often aided airborne troops in repelling counter attacks by belgian infantry units vliegen 1988 p 43 patrols were also used to ensure that garrison stayed in interior of fort and did not attempt to emerge and mount an attempt to retake fort any attempt by garrison to launch a counter attack would have been stymied by fact that only possible route for such an attack was up a single spiral staircase and any embrasures looking out onto fort had either been captured or disabled tugwell p 57 plan for assault had called for group granite to be relieved by 51st engineer battalion within a few hours of seizing fort but group was not actually relieved until 7 00 on 11 may heavy belgian resistance as well as several demolished bridges over river meuse had forced battalion to lay down new bridges delaying it significantly once airborne troops had been relieved battalion in conjunction with an infantry regiment that arrived shortly after engineers mounted an attack on main entrance to fort faced with this attack garrison surrendered at 12 30 suffering sixty men killed and forty wounded germans captured more than a thousand belgian soldiers group granite suffered six killed and nineteen wounded aftermath thumb right fallschirmjager of sturmabteilung koch airborne assault on three bridges and fort eben emael had been an overall success for fallschirmjager of sturmabteilung koch artillery pieces possessed by fort eben emael had been disabled and two of three bridges designated to be captured by sub units of sturmabteilung koch had been captured before they could be destroyed capture of bridges and neutralization of artillery pieces in fort allowed infantry and armour from 18th army to bypass other belgian defences and enter heart of belgium tugwell 58 in a post war publication general kurt student wrote of operation and efforts of group granite in particular that it was a deed of exemplary daring and decisive significance i have studied history of last war and battles on all fronts but i have not been able to find anything among host of brilliant actions undertaken by friend or foe that could be said to compare with success achieved by koch s assault group kuhn p 36 a number of officers and non commissioned officers were awarded knight s cross of iron cross for their participation in operation including oberfeldwebel helmut wenzel who led assault on fort eben emael in absence of lieutenant rudolf witzig sturmabteilung koch was promoted after end of fall gelb to become 1st battalion of newly formed 1st airlanding assault regiment which itself consisted of four battalions of fallschirmjaeger trained as a assault force hauptmann koch was promoted to rank of major for his part in operation and assumed command of 1st battalion
