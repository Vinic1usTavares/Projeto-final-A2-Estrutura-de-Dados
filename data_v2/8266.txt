stanislaus river is a tributary of san joaquin river in north central california in united states main stem of river is long and measured to its furthest headwaters it is about long originating as three forks in high sierra nevada river flows generally southwest through agricultural san joaquin valley to join san joaquin south of manteca draining parts of five california counties stanislaus is known for its swift rapids and scenic canyons in upper reaches and is heavily used for irrigation hydroelectricity and domestic water supply originally inhabited by miwok group of native americans stanislaus river was explored in early 1800s by spanish who conscripted indigenous people to work in colonial mission and presidio systems river is named for estanislao who led a native uprising in mexican controlled california in 1828 but was ultimately defeated on stanislaus river then known as rio de los laquisimes during california gold rush stanislaus river was destination of tens of thousands of gold seekers many of them reached california via sonora pass at headwaters of middle fork many miners and their families eventually settled along lower stanislaus river farms and ranches they established are now part of richest agricultural region in united states 2012 united states census of agriculture ranked eight central valley counties in top 10 for total agricultural sales san joaquin and stanislaus counties ranked 6th and 7th respectively early mining companies were formed to channel stanislaus river water to gold diggings via elaborate canal and flume systems which directly preceded irrigation districts formed by farmers who sought a greater degree of river control starting in early 1900s many dams were built to store and divert water these were often paired with hydro power systems whose revenues covered high cost of water projects in 1970s construction of federal new melones dam incited major opposition from recreation and environmental groups documented on stanislaus river archive who protested loss of one of last free flowing stretches of stanislaus although new melones was eventually built its completion is considered to have marked end of large dam building in united states water rights along stanislaus river are a controversial topic with senior rights of farmers coming into conflict with federal and state laws protecting endangered salmon and steelhead trout stanislaus irrigation districts contend that diverting water for fish damages local economy especially in years of drought water managers have struggled to find a balance between competing needs which also include groundwater recharge flood control and river based recreation such as fishing and whitewater rafting course stanislaus river headwaters consist of three forks in high sierra nevada in parts of alpine county calaveras county and tuolumne county middle fork long is largest tributary and is sometimes considered part of main stem it begins in emigrant wilderness of stanislaus national forest about west of sonora pass it flows northwest then west receiving clark fork below dardanelle before feeding donnell lake and beardsley lake both formed by hydroelectric power dams below beardsley dam it continues west to its confluence with north fork at camp nine a popular swimming and fishing area near hathaway pines long north fork rises in carson iceberg wilderness and flows in a generally southwest direction to its confluence with middle fork passing through several small hydropower dams for most of their lengths both forks flow in deep canyons through rugged heavily forested terrain total length of stanislaus river measured from its mouth to head of kennedy creek in emigrant wilderness is about thumb left stanislaus river at camp nine near confluence of north and middle forks confluence of middle and north forks marks start of stanislaus river proper it flows southwest through a canyon to new melones lake reservoir in sierra nevada foothills forming boundary between calaveras county west and tuolumne county east at reservoir it is joined by smaller south fork which descends for from sierra nevada to east much of state route 108 sonora pass highway runs parallel to south fork as well as upper part of middle fork linking a number of small communities in upper stanislaus basin at lower end of new melones lake is tall new melones dam sixth tallest dam in u s completed in 1979 for flood control irrigation hydropower generation and fisheries management below new melones river flows through smaller tulloch reservoir before reaching goodwin dam oldest dam on river completed 1913 where large volumes of water are diverted for irrigation reduced considerably in size stanislaus river leaves foothills and enters agricultural stanislaus county at historic gold rush town of knights ferry it is paralleled by state route 120 as it flows west into central valley through oakdale largest town on river and along northern edge of modesto metro area at riverbank it begins to form border of stanislaus county south and san joaquin county north at ripon it is crossed by highway 99 below ripon stanislaus flows west southwest through a low lying area known as river junction and past caswell memorial state park it joins san joaquin river at a point about northeast of and south of manteca upstream south of larger river s mouth at suisun bay discharge average unimpaired runoff of stanislaus river as estimated at new melones dam is per year or about about two thirds of stanislaus river flow originates as snowmelt between months of april and july although its highest peak flows tend to occur during winter rains water flow varies widely from year to year with a historic maximum of or in 1983 water year and a minimum of or in 1977 highest monthly flow is typically in may or june with peak of snowmelt and lowest in september or october before arrival of autumn storms since late 1800s timing of spring melt has shifted two to six weeks earlier due to warming temperatures in sierra nevada water diversions for irrigation and regulation by reservoirs have significantly lowered mean flow of lower stanislaus river smoothed out seasonal variations and increased dry season baseflow united states geological survey usgs stream gage at ripon from mouth recorded an annual flow of between 1941 and 1978 after new melones dam was built annual flow between 1978 and 2013 was highest peak before 1978 was on december 24 1955 and lowest monthly mean was in august 1977 after dam was built highest peak was on february 28 1997 and lowest monthly mean was in september 2016 watershed thumb right upright 1 25 kennedy lake near headwaters of middle fork seen from leavitt peak in emigrant wilderness stanislaus river watershed drains and is divided into two distinct sections mountainous upper watershed where vast majority of its flow originates and narrow heavily developed lower watershed where it flows across san joaquin valley goodwin dam has traditionally been considered dividing line between upper and lower watersheds elevations in watershed range from less than at confluence with san joaquin river to over in high sierra nevada annual precipitation varies from in valley regions to or more at higher elevations at elevations above most precipitation falls as snow upper watershed comprises 90 percent of total area and supplies a commensurate proportion of river flow stretching from foothill to alpine regions of sierra nevada it consists of rugged narrow canyons and ridges with an average local relief of or more from river to rim much of watershed is at high elevation with 40 percent of total area above winter snow line average precipitation in upper basin as a whole is vast majority of upper basin is either undeveloped or commercial timber land with very small areas of agriculture ranching and mountain meadows above tree line higher elevations are mostly federal forest service land and designated wilderness while middle elevations are a patchwork of state federal and privately owned land much of private timber land has been subject to checker board clearcutting which has greatly fragmented wildlife habitat lower stanislaus river watershed comprises only about one tenth of total area and is used mainly for agriculture 61 percent and urban development 34 percent with minimal open space major communities near lower river include from upstream to downstream knights ferry east oakdale oakdale riverbank escalon salida and ripon long lower river has been modified extensively not only by water diversions but by channelization and levee construction to drain wetlands and prevent floods most of natural floodplain no longer exists and about half of former riparian habitat has been lost river bed has been subjected to extensive gravel mining mostly for construction purposes with an estimated 6 3 million yd3 4 8 million m3 extracted between 1939 and 1999 geology stanislaus river is believed to have originally formed sometime during miocene period about 23 million years ago flowing down from an ancient mountain range in current location of sierra nevada that has since eroded away huge lava flows moved down ancestral canyon filling it with volcanic rock and sediment about 9 million years ago during pliocene most recent period of orogeny uplift occurred tilting predominantly granitic sierra nevada batholith to form a regional slope to west as mountains rose stanislaus river established its modern course carrying away volcanic material that had filled ancestral canyon this orogeny coincided with a second period of volcanic activity during which lava flows displaced stanislaus river course several times where it flows through foothills causing it to carve new canyons through underlying sedimentary rock lava flows are today known as stanislaus formation and are most visible as caprock layer of distinctive table mountains around present day new melones lake thumb left stanislaus river canyon at dardanelles area where donnells lake reservoir is today was formed by glaciation during ice ages as both uplift and erosion continued stanislaus river gradually carved rugged canyons it flows through today and contributed to vast alluvial deposits that make up flat floor of central valley some of these fluvial sediments originating from gold bearing veins in granite batholith were deposited as placer gold in river bed to be discovered later during california gold rush lower course of river is geologically young dating to no earlier than holocene river has continually cut new channels through its sediments and filled in older ones creating a sequence of river terraces most of erosion that shaped modern stanislaus river basin is believed to have occurred during glacial and interglacial periods in pleistocene starting about 1 million years ago during ice ages california had a much wetter climate average river flows in past may have been as high as what is considered flood stage today climate was also cold enough to support large glaciers in sierra nevada at elevations above these glaciers carved large u shaped valleys in high elevations and supplied vast volumes of meltwater which accelerated erosion along foothill canyons of stanislaus river during last glacial period main stanislaus glacier was up to long during previous ice ages it may have extended as far as although glaciation did not have as dramatic an impact on stanislaus river watershed as it did further south such as at hetch hetchy and yosemite many major features of upper stanislaus were sculpted by ice such as clark fork valley and middle fork valley at donnell lake history first peoples humans first arrived in sierra nevada of present day california more than 10 000 years ago remains of a native american dwelling near stanislaus river an oval shaped site about in width is estimated by archaeologists to be about 9 500 years old and is oldest known constructed dwelling though not archaeological site in north america for at least several centuries before arrival of spanish explorers stanislaus river basin was inhabited by central sierra miwok speakers of plains and sierra miwok miwok had a predominantly hunter gatherer lifestyle although they also practiced some primitive agriculture and controlled burning of grassland to enhance their hunting grounds miwok had their main settlements in lower elevations of foothills and central valley where they spent winters during summer they traveled into sierra nevada via stanislaus and other nearby rivers to harvest vegetable foods in high elevations and escape summer heat native americans of region did not form one large nation rather they lived in of between 100 and 500 people one group associated with stanislaus river was walla or wal li a native term meaning digger or toward earth who lived in hills between stanislaus and tuolumne rivers walla walla term was also associated with other peoples in region because of their practice of digging in earth for edible roots with its annual floods stanislaus river supported a wide area of perennial and seasonal wetlands including extensive tule marshes in area of san joaquin river which were host to an abundance of game animals birds and migratory fish that in turn supported particularly high native american populations fur trapper james warner who visited area in 1832 wrote of indian villages above mouth of stanislaus as also at or near junction with san joaquin and described region as thus on no part of continent over which i had been or since have traveled was so numerous an indian population subsisting upon natural products of soil and waters as in san joaquin valley european conquest and colonization although spanish empire claimed california in 1770s much of central valley then a huge expanse of swamps and rivers remained unexplored by spanish for several decades thereafter first spaniards to encounter stanislaus river were gabriel moraga s 1806 expedition who named river rio de nuestra senora de guadalupe river of our lady of guadalupe fray pedro munoz traveling with moraga wrote of immense quantities of wild grape vines along guadalupe river in 1808 moraga returned to area to search for suitable mission sites but was not successful river later became known as rio de los laquisimes possibly derived from a native american name for river or surrounding area although spanish ultimately did not establish any missions in central valley they forcibly took thousands of native americans to missions along coast where they were converted to catholicism and subjected to agricultural labor mission san jose was destination of many miwok from laquisimes river area american explorers also visited laquisimes river country starting in 1820s in search of beaver and otter pelts fur trappers included renowned mountain men jedediah smith william henry ashley and ewing young who explored area in period between 1825 and 1830 in spring of 1827 smith s party camped on laquisimes river near present day oakdale having reportedly cached of beaver pelts nearby smith called river on may 20 smith and two other men set out along laquisimes to attempt a crossing of sierra nevada about a week later after having made their way up rugged north fork canyon they crossed pass becoming first people of european descent to cross sierra thumb right stanislaus river at caswell memorial state park where estanislao is thought to have fought vallejo s troops there was considerable native resistance to spanish mission program which continued after mexico gained independence from spain in 1821 most escaped native americans fled to central valley which was difficult for heavily armed spanish soldiers to traverse due to its swampy terrain around november 1828 a yokuts man named estanislao christened after saint stanislaus his native name is believed to have been led a revolt at mission san jose and fled to laquisimes river country with many other natives there he raised an army of yokuts miwok and chumash who raided missions and large ranchos stealing horses and cattle and freeing native american laborers mexican army led by mariano vallejo moved to crush resistance but was initially defeated by natives on laquisimes river in a place believed to be near present day caswell memorial state park after initial defeat vallejo returned with a force of 107 soldiers some citizens and at least fifty mission indian militiamen armed with muskets and cannon but again fought to a draw vallejo set fire to vegetation along river banks to draw out opposition but estanislao and his fighters escaped and continued to raid mexican settlements through that winter according to popular legend estanislao would carve an s in a tree after his attacks and was an inspiration for fictional character zorro in june 1829 vallejo finally defeated him on laquisimes river vanquished estanislao ultimately returned to mission san jose where he confessed his sins and was pardoned by mexican government however mexicans never again attempted to control eastern part of san joaquin valley and laquisimes river was renamed stanislaus in estanislao s honor an unintended but destructive consequence of european arrival was introduction of foreign diseases it is believed that a hudson s bay company trapping expedition inadvertently introduced malaria into central valley in 1832 over next few years successive waves of malaria swept this region killing thousands of native americans in central valley who had no natural immunity to european diseases spread of disease was exacerbated by both massive numbers of mosquitoes in central valley wetlands and densely packed native american villages as many as 80 percent of plains miwok who had survived spanish colonization died in consequent epidemic a smallpox epidemic struck around 1837 claiming even more lives including that of estanislao who died at mission san jose in june 1838 american settlement and gold rush during 1840s many american settlers emigrated to central valley of what was still mexican controlled california seeking to claim area s fertile farmland first major american settlement along stanislaus river was founded in january 1847 by about 30 mormon colonists under direction of samuel brannan stanislaus city alternately called mormon ranch or new hope was established on north bank of river not far from its confluence with san joaquin settlers constructed a sawmill and began to plant area in wheat and vegetables brannan envisioned stanislaus city as center of lds church in california eventually to attract thousands of mormon emigrants however settlement did not grow significantly ultimately dissolving next year at least one factor in its decline was a massive flood that winter william stout one of town s founders wrote that stanislaus was three miles wide in january 1848 influence of american settlement ultimately led to bear flag revolt after which california became part of united states in 1848 in same year gold was discovered on american river starting california gold rush although gold mining was initially concentrated on american and other rivers to north attention was drawn to stanislaus in august 1848 after a native american party under charles weber discovered gold on river entire mining camp of dry diggings near today s placerville about 200 men in all packed up and headed south to stanislaus river and as news spread throughout gold country hundreds more arrived many miners traveling from eastern united states arrived in california via sonora pass at headwaters of middle fork of stanislaus river by 1849 as many as 10 000 miners had reached stanislaus river country stanislaus was as productive a gold bearing stream as any in california in early days of gold rush it was known as southern mines because it was at time southernmost extent of primary gold diggings in 1848 william r ryan wrote that mining camps along stanislaus river were all of poorest and most wretched description miners expected to profit within a short time and then leave these primitive conditions and return to their homes there were numerous tents good bad and indifferent stores and gambling booths shanties and open encampments and miners busy everywhere initially miners worked individual placer claims but as easily accessed gold played out they teamed up to build extensive dam ditch and flume systems that could more efficiently wash gold out of sediment as well as supply water to gold bearing areas without a water source and provide water for irrigation these represent some of earliest water rights claims along stanislaus river many mining camps were established on stanislaus river including also known as mormon camp some of first prospectors came from unsuccessful colony at stanislaus city and melones named for gold that was so coarse that it reminded miners of melon seeds thumb left knights ferry covered bridge and old tulloch mill date unknown in 1849 william knight a hunter and trapper established a ferry and trading post on stanislaus river to serve thousands of miners headed to diggings at sonora and other mining camps knight had previously accompanied john c fremont on expeditions in 1840s and foresaw that knights ferry via stanislaus was nature s pathway through mountains this was one of many ferries that operated on stanislaus river in following decades including others at byrne s ferry later replaced by a covered bridge and taylor s ferry near oakdale although knight was killed later that year reportedly in a gunfight settlement had already become principal supply point of region with daily stage coach service to stockton and was named knights ferry in his honor after knight s death lewis dent took over ferry operations in 1854 ferry was replaced by a wooden covered bridge within next few years knights ferry also became site of a hotel court house flour mill and tuolumne county jail settlement was largely destroyed during great flood of 1862 which washed away bridge but it and rest of town were soon rebuilt knights ferry became seat of stanislaus county that same year until modesto took its position in 1872 in 1851 tuolumne county water company was organized to divert water from south fork of stanislaus river by 1853 it consisted of of canals serving as many as 1 800 miners and their claims water was supplied as far as columbia and sonora to south columbia and stanislaus river company was formed in 1854 on main stem of stanislaus river in competition to high rates charged by tuolumne they built a ditch at a cost of 1 5 million five times original estimate went bankrupt shortly after and was ultimately sold to tuolumne county water company at a small fraction of original cost massive amounts of lumber were required to build mining flumes and aqueducts leading to widespread deforestation in lower elevations of stanislaus basin these early waterworks were crudely built and often failed sometimes with tragic results in 1857 a dam on south fork of stanislaus river collapsed flooding mining camps of pine log and italian bar killing sixteen people only a few years later most of mining claims and infrastructure were destroyed by 1862 flood late 19th and early 20th century after end of gold rush very few people visited rugged stanislaus river country above sierra foothills before turn of 20th century knights ferry declined in influence as many of departing miners settled around farming community of oakdale several miles downstream historic records show that majority of ranches and homesteads in stanislaus river area were established between 1850s and 1890s by former gold seekers southern pacific railroad arrived in oakdale in 1872 bypassing knights ferry and drawing valley s population to former town knights ferry flour mill moved its operations to oakdale in 1881 in 1895 charles tulloch acquired water rights to an old mining ditch near knights ferry and incorporated stanislaus milling and power company later stanislaus water power company tulloch converted old flour mill into first hydroelectric plant on stanislaus river during late 1800s and early 1900s development slowly moved higher into stanislaus watershed in large part due to improvement of sonora pass highway former wagon trail up stanislaus canyon had operated since 1864 as a toll road sonora mono toll road and was heavily traveled during 1870s during gold strike in bodie a number of trading posts and rest stops operated on both sides of sonora pass including sugar pine strawberry baker s station leavitt s station and big meadows in following decades travel over sonora pass declined heavily road became part of state highway system in 1901 and was improved in 1906 to service construction of relief dam in headwaters of stanislaus river today most of road has been replaced by newer alignment of highway 108 tourists began to visit high country with advent of automobile in early 20th century and a number of camps and resorts were established along river including douglas resort douglas station in 1920 and dardanelle resort in 1923 at confluence of eagle creek and stanislaus river dardanelle resort remained operational until 2018 new dardanelle bridge was built in 1933 to replace an older span constructed in 1864 and provide better access to tourist areas this bridge was believed to be last known timber scissors truss in united states both resort and bridge were destroyed in 2018 donnell fire guy mccarthy photograph historic dardanelles bridge burned and fell into middle fork stanislaus river earlier this week union democrat august 7 2018 there was also extensive logging done throughout foothill area of stanislaus watershed and several narrow gauge railroads penetrated into foothills including sugar pine railway or strawberry branch which followed stanislaus south fork another line sierra railway s angels branch connected jamestown to angels camp and required a series of switchbacks to traverse deep canyon of stanislaus river an area now flooded by new melones lake upper stanislaus watershed was also used as a filming location sierra railway was a popular filming location starting around 1917 due to rugged countryside and quaint ancient trains during 1930s scenes for robin hood of el dorado were filmed near old douglas resort in 1970s several episodes of little house on prairie tv series were filmed at donnell vista near donnell lake river development thumb right upright 1 5 map showing major dams diversions and power plants in stanislaus river basin stanislaus river is one of most heavily dammed and diverted rivers in california relative to its size there are a total of 28 major dams on stanislaus river and its tributaries with a combined storage capacity of more than 2 8 million acre feet 3 5 km3 river irrigates some of productive farmland most of it in stanislaus and san joaquin counties fourteen hydroelectric plants on river and its tributaries are operated by various local irrigation districts private power companies and federal agencies river provides domestic and industrial water supply to nearby cities including manteca lathrop escalon and tracy stanislaus river water flows are also a vital resource to maintain fisheries and recreational activities dilute pollution recharge groundwater and control saline intrusion in sacramento san joaquin river delta river is extremely over allocated meaning that claims to its water far exceed supply there are more than 160 separate water rights to stanislaus river totaling 19 7 million acre feet 24 3 km3 compared to river s normal flow of 1 1 million acre feet 1 4 km3 about 3 9 million acre feet 4 8 km3 are considered consumptive use water rights meaning that water would not be returned to river most of other rights are for non consumptive uses such as hydropower generation not all of these rights are in use today many belong to defunct mining or power companies water rights on stanislaus river have traditionally been and are still de jure subject to prior appropriation method where oldest rights holders get first priority however after completion of new melones dam in 1979 and especially due to drought in recent years federal and local agencies have often been forced to compromise in order to divide limited stanislaus river supplies between many demands irrigation farmers have been using water from stanislaus river since gold rush when water was diverted to small farms and vegetable gardens on homesteads as number of claimants on river grew farmers recognized they had to work together in order to effectively distribute water one of first irrigation cooperatives formed on stanislaus river was formed by tulloch family in 1858 who built a diversion dam to supply farms in area around knight s ferry stanislaus and san joaquin water company formed by h w cowell and n s harrold in 1895 improved on this system building of canals along north side of stanislaus river and supplying water to some in manteca and oakdale thumb right 1926 melones dam oakdale irrigation district oid and south san joaquin irrigation district ssjid were created in 1909 under wright act and together own oldest water rights on stanislaus river oid service area is located on both sides of stanislaus river in stanislaus county and ssjid is located on north side of river in stanislaus and san joaquin counties today districts irrigate a combined with major crops being grapes almonds corn rice fruit orchards and pasture today this area is one of most productive agricultural regions of united states in 2014 stanislaus and san joaquin counties produced a combined 7 6 billion of crops shortly after their formation districts issued 1 9 million in revenue bonds to finance dam and canal infrastructure that would supply land in 1913 districts built goodwin dam about upstream of knights ferry to divert water into their respective canals they filed claims for of stanislaus river water divided evenly between two districts in early years maintaining a sufficient water supply in summer was nearly impossible because sierra snowpack usually melts out by mid june agriculture relied heavily on wells in late summer when river was low and this could only support about of crops lower stanislaus river was often completely dry in summertime due to water diversions irrigation districts desperately needed water storage for dry season and a number of small off stream reservoirs were built including woodward reservoir in 1916 though their benefit was limited at best in 1925 districts issued 2 2 million of bonds to build a storage dam on stanislaus river original melones dam completed 1926 was a tall concrete arch structure capable of storing of water enough to irrigate of land for a single season but too small to provide carry over storage for drought years a severe drought in 1930s demonstrated that melones reservoir by itself was too small to meet all irrigation demands oid sank 25 deep wells between 1931 and 1938 to make up for shortfall but this depleted local groundwater at an unsustainable rate ssjid was better supplied throughout 1930s in part due to less water intensive crops but started experiencing shortages by early 1940s in 1948 districts joined to increase water storage on stanislaus river by constructing tri dam project consisting of donnells and beardsley dams on middle fork tulloch dam between existing goodwin and melones dams and columbia dam below junction of middle and north forks this fourth site was later dropped from proposal districts had also contemplated building a bigger 1 1 million acre foot 1 4 km3 reservoir to replace melones reservoir but this project also never made it past drawing board 52 million tri dam project would mainly be financed by leasing hydro power rights at these dams to pacific gas electric company pg e for a 50 year period like melones tri dam project would be jointly owned and operated by two districts after almost ten years of construction donnells and beardsley dam were completed in 1957 and tulloch dam completed in 1958 three dams combined could store more than tripling water storage capacity on stanislaus river and increased reliable annual supply to almost these were last major water projects completed on river until 1972 when work began on federal new melones dam which would replace and submerge original 1926 melones dam new melones project starting in 1940s federal government had also sought to build a high dam at melones site flood control act of 1944 authorized u s army corps of engineers to build a flood control structure with about four times capacity of irrigation districts dam however they were unable to provided a sound economic justification for project on flood control alone in 1950s u s bureau of reclamation proposed a much larger dam with a capacity of 2 4 million acre feet 3 0 km3 which would capture most of extra floodwaters that existing small irrigation dams could not hold it would be a multi purpose unit of central valley project providing irrigation flood control hydropower and fishery flows locals initially criticized project saying that it was too big a waste of federal money and reservoir would never fill there was also concern that bureau of reclamation was attempting a water grab that would take extra water to meet obligations outside stanislaus river basin however after christmas flood of 1964 caused massive destruction along stanislaus river new melones gained political support after federal funding was approved construction started in 1966 thumb left upright stanislaus river below new melones dam new melones project is well known for a legal battle between environmentalists state of california and federal government which began in 1970s as recreational whitewater rafting exploded in popularity stanislaus was for a time most popular run in western united states and was valued for spectacular scenery along its rugged limestone canyons friends of river was formed to push a statewide ballot measure prop 17 that would have designated stanislaus as a national wild and scenic river and forestalled construction of new melones prop 17 was defeated by a narrow margin of voters in part due to heavy lobbying by water agencies afterwards dam opponents focused on limiting level of new reservoir even as dam construction was completed in 1978 in may 1979 environmental activist mark dubois chained himself to a boulder in stanislaus canyon forcing federal authorities to either stop filling lake or drown him as a result state of california under governor jerry brown who also objected to new melones on economic grounds issued a temporary limit in november 1980 to keep lake level below parrott s ferry bridge which marked lower end of stanislaus whitewater california department of water resources questioned whether extra irrigation water was even necessary and studies by state department of fish and wildlife suggested that dam would harm fisheries it was intended to protect state and environmentalists agreed to compromise lake level at 26 percent of its design capacity which hydrological studies determined was optimal volume for fulfilling demands along stanislaus without losing too much water to evaporation and flood releases federal government and some agencies which stood to benefit from new dam derided decision arguing that to not fill already completed dam was a waste of money and water heated debate continued until 1982 1983 water years california s wettest back to back seasons on record when massive storms and snowpack swelled river and filled reservoir in under two years a process originally projected to take eight years in june 1983 new melones lake hit its highest level on record nearly flowing over emergency spillway floods demonstrated value of dam in preventing 50 million of property damage and capturing a huge volume of water that would otherwise have flowed into ocean prompting state of california to lift temporary limit since then new melones has struggled to fulfill its obligations to downstream water users during droughts irrigation districts and federal government have frequently fought over its water one of conditions of new melones construction was that oid and ssjid be guaranteed of water rights they had held since 1913 however bureau of reclamation has sometimes shorted irrigation districts in favor of releasing water to support ailing salmon and steelhead fisheries which is required by federal law such as 1972 endangered species act and 1991 central valley project improvement act in addition melones project is obligated to provide water to stockton east water district which irrigates an additional north of stanislaus river and central san joaquin water conservation district which irrigates in 21st century which has been subject to extended drought federal and local water agencies continue to seek a balanced solution new melones was a significant milestone in history of american dam building battle over stanislaus river greatly increased political influence of river conservation movement and public awareness of environmental impact of large dam projects since new melones completion in 1978 no structure as large or as significant has since been built on an american river and since this date virtually no structural modification to a river in this country has gone unopposed hydroelectricity thumb upright donnells dam hydropower generation has generally taken second priority behind agriculture in history of stanislaus river water development power facilities were attached to irrigation dams to take advantage of river s steep fall from sierra crest to central valley however other projects were also built purely to take advantage of river s great hydroelectric potential in a span of about stanislaus descends almost from headwaters of middle fork to valley floor at knight s ferry north and south forks of river also experience similarly swift drops although neither carry as much water as middle fork hydro plants on stanislaus river have a total capacity of more than 780 megawatts and generate 1 7 billion kilowatt hours per year with exception of small run of river projects such as charles tulloch s 1895 hydro plant first major hydroelectric project on stanislaus river was 1916 spring gap powerhouse near strawberry constructed by pacific gas electric pg e and still in operation today water diverted from south fork plunges more than down a mountainside to a seven megawatt power station on middle fork in 1939 pg e completed much larger stanislaus powerhouse near confluence of middle and north forks water was diverted from middle fork at sand bar dam and a long tunnel was drilled through mountains to carry it to powerhouse because water is diverted so far upstream it affords a head of over to stanislaus powerhouse much heavier flow of middle fork means that more power can be generated about 91 megawatts at full capacity pg e also built original 22 megawatt power station at old 1926 melones dam under a 40 year contract with oakdale and south san joaquin irrigation districts while power company would be allowed to market and earn revenue on hydroelectricity produced it had to pay royalties since dam was owned by irrigation districts this model proved useful for financing irrigation projects on stanislaus river hydropower sales contributed greatly to repaying bonds issued for construction irrigation districts again entered into a contract with pg e when they built much more ambitious tri dam project two of reservoirs donnells and beardsley were to be built at high elevations and respectively affording huge hydroelectric potential 72 megawatt donnell powerhouse and 11 megawatt beardsley powerhouse were built as part of tri dam project in addition to an 18 megawatt plant at tulloch dam further downstream an added benefit was that donnells and beardsley dams regulate water flow down middle fork allowing more consistent power generation at older stanislaus powerhouse thumb left 18 megawatt tulloch dam is lowermost hydroelectric plant on stanislaus river during spring snowmelt these high elevation hydro projects operate at full load around clock any river flow in excess of powerhouse capacity must be spilled bypassed and becomes wasted energy irrigation districts and pg e must coordinate operations at reservoirs and powerhouses to maximize both water storage and power production in late summer and autumn river flows are lower and power plants are typically only operated several hours a day on a peaking basis 300 megawatt new melones dam power station which replaced old melones powerhouse in 1978 is also operated on a peaking schedule result is often wildly fluctuating water levels along dam controlled segments of these rivers tulloch dam located directly below new melones serves to re regulate river flow and ensure a consistent water level in lower portion of stanislaus river last major hydroelectric project to be built on stanislaus river was north fork project officially known as north fork stanislaus river hydroelectric development project it was built by a partnership between calaveras county water district and northern california power agency for both hydropower and domestic water supply although proposed since 1950s project was not built until late 1980s primary features include new spicer meadow reservoir completed in 1989 mckays point diversion dam and tunnel on north fork and collierville powerhouse located near hathaway pines and older stanislaus powerhouse water falls from a height of more than at any other power station in stanislaus river system to powerhouse where it generates up to 253 megawatts in 2004 pg e s license for tri dam project expired and a new contract with irrigation districts had to be negotiated one of conditions was to increase in stream flows in portions of stanislaus river that were dried up by hydropower diversions similar conditions had been set during of spring gap stanislaus project in 1997 increased flows will benefit recreation along sierra portions of stanislaus river including whitewater boating and fishing for rainbow and brown trout irrigation districts now jointly own hydro facilities as tri dam power authority and sell power to pg e under contract

stanislaus river watershed is mostly forested with mixed coniferous communities ponderosa pine white fir jeffrey pine incense cedar and sugar pine along hills and ridges hardwood forests black oak canyon live oak and blue oak and gray pine are common along streams and canyon bottoms and in foothills other hardwoods such as chamise manzanita and mountain mahogany are present riparian zones which include white alder and willow are rare due to limited space along narrow rocky streambeds vernal pools or seasonal ponds are found in some of flatter areas and also support riparian vegetation although mostly taken over by agriculture today lower watershed once was home to grasslands oak woodland and chaparral which are still extant in some foothill areas river s annual floods once spread for miles over surrounding terrain there were extensive wetlands and riparian zones along waterways with a canopy of cottonwood sycamore and valley oak riparian zones have experienced further decline from development in floodplain and extensive mining for sand and gravel however some large areas of riparian habitat do remain such as around caswell memorial state park thumb right stanislaus river canyon at big dog rapid near head of new melones lake california department of fish and game has identified up to 35 amphibian and reptile species 57 mammal species and more than 200 bird species in stanislaus river watershed large mammals such as mule deer bighorn sheep and black bear are common in stanislaus national forest which encompasses high elevations of watershed stanislaus river is habitat for aquatic furbearers including beaver river otter and mink which were extensively trapped for their fur during 19th century at least 36 fish species are known to exist in lower stanislaus river including both native species such as salmon steelhead rainbow trout pacific lamprey hardhead and sacramento pikeminnow as well as introduced species such as carp sunfish and bass salmon and steelhead stanislaus river provides habitat for native anadromous fish particularly chinook king salmon and steelhead which spend their adult lives in ocean but must return to fresh water to spawn in its natural state stanislaus had a major spawning run in late spring april june and smaller runs in fall and winter construction of goodwin dam in 1913 blocked migration to about half of available spawning habitat in stanislaus river basin and populations have declined thereafter especially since construction of melones and tri dam projects which changed flow pattern in stanislaus river between 1952 and 2015 fall chinook population has ranged from a high of 35 000 in 1953 to zero in 1977 average fall chinook number in 21st century has been 3 558 fish water diversions have historically been considered major factor decreasing salmon and steelhead populations before construction of new melones dam river frequently ran dry starting in early summer especially in drought years due to farmers taking all water this prevented spring run from making their way down to sea little water left was usually too warm for fish to survive in 1992 federal dam operators began releasing large volumes of water or pulse flows into stanislaus river during critical spring and fall spawning seasons hoping to replicate natural conditions of snowmelt and autumn storms respectively in order to help fish reproduce between 2000 and 2009 about 55 percent of stanislaus river unimpaired flow was released from goodwin dam into lower river far more than historical average of 39 percent this is also considerably more than flows released into nearby tuolumne and merced rivers which are also historical salmon and steelhead habitat in fall 2015 higher flows on stanislaus river led to more than 11 000 chinook returning to river as compared to less than 1 000 fish in tuolumne and merced because fishery flows compete with irrigation needs for water program has been unpopular with local farmers and water districts as well as recreation dependent on stanislaus reservoirs also despite pulse flows salmon and steelhead have continued to decline from late 20th century into 21st century with occasional resurgences in flood years spring run chinook have since gone extinct in stanislaus watershed while spring and fall steelhead runs are considered threatened one of biggest factors is that temperatures must be lower than for optimal spawning conditions in years of drought releasing too much water for steelhead in spring leaves too cold water for salmon and steelhead in fall other influences such as decrease of riparian habitat gravel mining and introduced predatory fish have also heavily affected native fish populations river flow debate on april 8 2015 after four years of severe drought bureau of reclamation began releasing water from new melones for fish ignoring protest from farmers irrigation district managers ordered gates closed at tulloch dam to prevent water from flowing downstream after a brief standoff lasting several hours bureau of reclamation stopped flow districts objected because releasing water in spring would cut drastically into their supply as state regulations require that a certain volume of water be retained in new melones for fall fish releases due to drought new melones lake was already at a low level and there was not enough water to meet farmers demands in addition to spring and fall releases ultimately a temporary compromise was reached allowing lake to be drawn down to a lower level than environmental restrictions typically allow this met districts demands for year but also resulted in higher water temperatures thumb left low water on stanislaus river at knights ferry covered bridge effect of higher flows on anadromous fish has been difficult to quantify in part due to myriad of other factors such as pollution and non native predators a 2009 biological opinion from national marine fisheries service suggested that even higher flows would be required for fish populations to truly benefit in 2017 independent environmental consulting group fishbio released a study showing that number of fish may not be as strongly related to artificial pulse flows as previously thought data from 2005 2016 period indicated that fish migration responded same way to river flows of as they did to required flows of furthermore study found that most out migration occurred during natural rainfall events along lower river rather than artificial pulse flows from upstream dams california department of water resources has continued to push for higher flows in stanislaus tuolumne merced and san joaquin rivers with specific focus on volume of water released during spring runoff although over course of year over half of stanislaus river s runoff is allowed to flow unimpaired down river this proportion is much lower 20 percent or less during spring snowmelt when majority of water is being captured in reservoirs for later use state has recommended that 40 percent of spring runoff be allowed to flow down river some environmental groups have pushed for as much as 60 percent these amounts would be greater than what is already required leaving even less to support local farming economy south san joaquin irrigation district which under proposal stands to lose as much as two thirds of its surface water supply during dry years has pushed for all factors and potential solutions to be considered including better timing of releases habitat restoration hatchery management addressing predators water temperatures more restrained water releases and cool water pools behind reservoirs environmental program has also met with pushback from federal representatives including a bill introduced to congress by tom mcclintock r calif in 2015 which would have allowed conservation of reservoir storage during droughts rather than releasing it for environmental purposes due to stanislaus river s limited flow it has become clear that not all demands on river can be fully satisfied forcing federal state and local water managers to compromise an interim program started in 2016 allows stanislaus irrigation districts to sell some river water to san luis delta mendota water authority which represents federal contractors in southern san joaquin valley at premium prices because water must travel down stanislaus and san joaquin rivers to delta before it can be pumped south it can be used to fulfill stanislaus fishery flow requirements essentially performing double duty in 2016 this plan was able to conserve of water recreation whitewater thumb right rafting on north fork stanislaus river was california s first popular whitewater river in 1970s many commercial outfitters operated on river between camp nine and parrott s ferry bridge images and documents of rafting during this time can be found at stanislaus river archive although this section was flooded by new melones lake in 1983 rafting and kayaking remain popular on sections of middle fork and north fork as well as main stem below goodwin dam in addition camp nine run reappears when new melones lake is low allowing boaters to run this part of river although siltation of river bed due to reservoir impoundment makes access difficult as of 2016 bureau of reclamation is considering allowing commercial outfits to operate on camp nine run once more whenever river flows and water levels in melones reservoir make it possible north fork is highest elevation commercially run river in california and is also considered one of most difficult runs in state with thirteen rapids at class iv or above best flows are typically limited to a six week window in april and may during summer flows are regulated by new spicer meadow reservoir which most often releases water at night to generate hydropower forest service recommends taking a guided trip due to demanding and technical nature of river although private trips are also permitted goodwin to knight s ferry run though at a gentler gradient than north fork also offers class iv v rapids below knights ferry stanislaus becomes wider and smoother with class i ii rapids between there and orange blossom park further downstream many parts of river are suitable for flat water boating and swimming middle fork has largest flow but is subject to numerous hydro power diversions that often river bed in summer sand bar and mt knight runs in total rated difficult at class iv v are dependent on releases from sand bar dam which only occur when river flow exceeds capacity of stanislaus powerhouse average season for this run is only about 3 weeks long typically in early june reach between donnells dam and beardsley reservoir known as hell s half acre flows through a narrow granite gorge descending 183 feet per mile 35 m km including numerous class v unrunnable drops this reach only runs when water is released from donnells dam due to increasing popularity of whitewater boating pg e has been considering making higher dam releases during summer parks and public access thumb left relief reservoir is located at headwaters of middle fork stanislaus river in emigrant wilderness about of upper stanislaus basin is within stanislaus national forest which provides a wide range of outdoor recreation including fishing camping backpacking horseback riding mountain biking and snowmobiling highway 108 along south middle forks and highway 4 along north fork a designated national scenic byway provide access to forest from both sides of sierra nevada part of pacific crest trail which crosses sonora pass also runs through stanislaus river watershed upper stanislaus also includes parts of two major wilderness areas carson iceberg wilderness is located along north fork and clark fork name iceberg comes from a distinctive granite formation along clark fork emigrant wilderness encompassing encompasses upper middle fork and also borders on yosemite national park a short distance to south boating water skiing and camping are also popular on many reservoirs along stanislaus river largest new melones lake is visited by up to 800 000 people per year and includes a full service marina providing boat rentals and supplies new spicer meadow reservoir largest of stanislaus high sierra lakes and beardsley reservoir both include camping facilities and boat ramps managed by forest service donnell lake is also open to public but due to difficult access and rugged terrain it is much less crowded along lower stanislaus river most of land is privately owned however there are sixteen public access
