severe tropical storm koni known in philippines as tropical storm gilas caused moderate damage to areas of china and vietnam in july 2003 eighth tropical storm in western pacific that year koni originated from a disturbance situated within monsoon trough well east of philippines on july 15 tracking westward intensification was slow and system remained a tropical depression as it moved across central philippines on july 17 upon moving into south china sea however conditions allowed for quicker strengthening and as such cyclone reached tropical storm status on july 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar hpa 28 79 inhg making it a severe tropical storm however atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as koni made landfall on hainan on july 21 weakening system tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over gulf of tonkin prior to a final landfall near hanoi vietnam following day tracking inland combination of land interaction and wind shear caused koni to dissipate over laos on july 23 shortly after development koni tracked through philippines killing two people after moving into south china sea turbulence produced by storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off western philippines three of plane s occupants received minor injuries in hainan koni caused heavy rainfall peaking at 189 mm 7 44 in at a station on wuzhi mountain rains resulted in collapse of 1 400 homes and an estimated cny 140 27 million us 16 9 million in direct economic losses effects were worst in vietnam where three people were killed widespread power outages occurred and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage particularly in vietnam s northern provinces meteorological history precursor to koni developed as an area of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of guam on july 12 though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity late on july 14 however system developed organized rainbands this prompted japan meteorological agency jma to classify system as a tropical depression at 0000 utc on july 15 well north of palau shortly after storm entered area of responsibility of philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa immediately classifying system as a tropical depression and designating it with name gilas jtwc later classified system as such at 1200 utc that day a subtropical ridge to north steered depression westward for much of its initial stages on july 16 jtwc upgraded system to tropical storm strength while jma maintained system s tropical depression classification through july 17 tropical cyclone began to track across central philippines and concurrently entered hostile atmospheric conditions as wind shear and a suppressed outflow pattern began to impact storm however cyclone was only a slightly weakened system by time it emerged into south china sea following day at same time a shortwave trough began to force storm northwestward towards china at 0600 utc on july 18 jma upgraded cyclone to tropical storm status designating it with name koni though conditions were more favorable over south china sea than over philippines persistent moderate wind shear prevented much strengthening however a brief period of favorable conditions allowed for koni to strengthen and at 0000 utc on july 20 tropical storm was upgraded to severe tropical storm status by jma meanwhile jtwc upgraded system to typhoon intensity six hours later midday on july 20 koni began to develop a partial eye this indicated an increase in intensity and as such koni reached a peak in strength at 1800 utc that day with maximum sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar hpa 28 79 inhg this intensity was maintained for roughly six hours during which time koni began to curve westward however moderate wind shear conditions returned following day weakening tropical cyclone at around 1200 utc on july 21 koni made landfall on southeastern coast of hainan with winds of 95 km h 60 mph land interaction further weakened koni and restrengthening of subtropical ridge to cyclone s north resulted in a more westerly path after a brief reemergence into gulf of tonkin system made another landfall this time south of hanoi vietnam at 0800 utc on july 22 at this landfall koni was only estimated to have winds of 85 km h 50 mph upon tracking inland storm began to quickly weaken and was downgraded to tropical depression intensity at 1800 utc that day over northern laos six hours later jma declared koni to have dissipated over same general region preparations and impact thumb tropical storm koni approaching vietnam on july 22 four people were killed in philippines by koni and an additional person was injured damage reports from philippines remained scarce though pagasa indicated that damage costs totaled 67 250 million philippine pesos us 1 26 million on july 18 an airbus a330 242 carrying 242 passengers bound for hong kong encountered koni in south china sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather however plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence resulting in three minor injuries on board plane was later able to exit area of turbulence and land safely at hong kong international airport in hong kong nearby approach of tropical storm koni forced hong kong observatory to issue tropical cyclone warning signal no 1 signal of lowest urgency for special administrative region passing well south of hong kong strongest sustained wind associated with storm in region was an observation of winds in tai mo shan ultimately effects in hong kong area were limited to scattered squally weather producing isolated rainfall peaking at over 40 mm 1 6 in in some locations in hainan where storm made landfall 35 flights were delayed while 28 others were cancelled due to conditions onset by koni ferry service across qiongzhou strait was also halted stranding 3 000 vehicles as a result of koni heavy rainfall took place across hainan peaking at 189 mm 7 44 in at a station on wuzhi mountain in province alone at least 1 400 homes collapsed direct economic losses stemming from koni in hainan were estimated at cny 140 27 million us 16 9 million in order to counteract flight suspensions and cancellations caused by koni 198 flights from airport were scheduled after storm s passage vietnam was country with worst impacts from koni widespread power outages and failures were commonplace during storm s passage offshore northern coast of vietnam 19 fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by tropical storm one of these sinkings near do son resulted in death of a fisherman another person was killed in tam diep after being hit by a prostrated tree eighteen others in four of vietnam s northern provinces were injured by flying debris kicked up by koni s strong winds in thanh hoa province strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles roofs of 300 homes in thanh hoa were torn apart koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in city further north in thai binh gusts reaching as high as 90 km h 55 mph damaged 250 residences as well as 300 ha 740 acres of rice crops ten of eighteen people injured country wide were injured there in hanoi winds blew trees down overall 3 people were killed in vietnam approximately 1 000 homes were destroyed by koni resulting in significant impacts to agriculture despite significant impacts in vietnam rains brought by koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over vietnam s northern colonies though name koni was not retired by world meteorological organization name was corrected to goni for its 2009 usage see also typhoon betty 1987 tropical storm nock ten
