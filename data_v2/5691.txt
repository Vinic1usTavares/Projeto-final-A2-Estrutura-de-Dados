vulcanodon meaning volcano tooth is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaur from early jurassic of southern africa only known species is v karibaensis discovered in 1969 in rhodesia now known as zimbabwe it was regarded as earliest known sauropod for decades and is still one of most primitive sauropods that has been discovered as a quadrupedal ground dwelling herbivore vulcanodon already showed typical sauropod body plan with column like legs and a long neck and tail it was smaller than most other sauropods measuring approximately eleven metres 35 ft in length vulcanodon is known from a fragmentary skeleton including much of pelvic girdle hindlimbs forearms and tail but lacking trunk and neck vertebrae as well as skull originally this genus was believed to be a prosauropod because of knife shaped teeth found near its fossils which fit in with idea that prosauropods were omnivorous scientists now know that teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on vulcanodon carcass vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod upon discovery of related tazoudasaurus both animals were unified in family vulcanodontidae though this has not been universally accepted description thumb left size comparison vulcanodon was a small sauropod in 2010 gregory s paul estimated its length at eleven metres its weight at 3 5 tonnes paul g s 2010 princeton field guide to dinosaurs princeton university press p 172 some books mention lower estimates of approximately thighbone was 110 centimeters long as one of earliest and basalmost sauropods it is important for understanding early evolution of this group sauropods descend from basal sauropodomorphs informally called prosauropods which were primitively bipedal two legged while vulcanodon already was fully quadrupedal four legged its limb proportions were intermediate between those of its prosauropod ancestors and those of later more derived sauropods its forelimbs were much more similar to later sauropods than basal sauropodomorphs because they are straight much more gracile and proximal end of ulna is v shaped unfortunately no skull or neck of vulcanodon is known although it is otherwise very well known hindlimbs and pelvis thumb right plastic model of a herd in in kujawski poland vulcanodon s limbs were sturdy and column like and its forelimbs were already proportionally long reaching 76 of hindlimb length its lower leg metatarsus and toes were shortened in comparison to its bipedal ancestors but still not as short as in later sauropods sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae prosauropods possessed only three sacrals tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their lateral sides saving weight and giving them a waisted appearance when viewed from below in later sauropods this excavations were enlarged to form extensive perforated pockets called pleurocoels contrasting many sauropod like features of skeleton pelvis was relatively primitive reminiscent of its prosauropod ancestors one such feature is that brevis shelf of ilium has a fossa which is not found in any more derived sauropods hallux first toe of foot showed a large claw that was flattened laterally as seen in prosauropods however claws of second and third toe were unusual in being nail like and broader than deep this feature was also found in probably closely related tazoudasaurus but is absent in all other sauropods feet of vulcanodon were semiplantigrade as in later sauropods where both digits and part of metatarsals contact ground a derived feature not found in more basal sauropods like isanosaurus however they also retained primitive features like fact that phalanges were not reduced many of features found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack are related to change in body size greatest regions affected by this are hind limbs and pelvis for example an elongating of ilium size reduction of lesser trochanter shelf and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified vulcanodon possessed these features latter of which is seen earliest in it however vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges which are seen in shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods this means that while muscle positioning of its legs were changing they had not yet reduced in distal region of limb is known only from a single locality on an island in lake kariba largest artificial lake in world in northern zimbabwe formerly rhodesia island located west of bumi hills is called island 126 127 after early unpublished lake charts but has no formal name first bone was found by b a gibson of town of kariba in july 1969 and an excavation team collected specimen in october 1969 march 1970 and may 1970 in later half of 1970 new find was presented at a scientific symposium in cape town and a brief note was published find was formally named and described in july 1972 by palaeontologist michael raath name vulcanodon lat roman god of fire gr odon tooth points to fact that skeleton was found in sandstone that was at time misinterpreted to be part of batoka formation but is actually part of forest sandstone lays a few metres below lava flows of batoka formation and emphasizes peculiar knife shaped teeth that are now known to belong to a theropod specific name karibaensis refers to place of discovery on a small island in lake kariba it was one of first dinosaurs found in zimbabwe skeleton catalogue number has been found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface and plant roots it includes pelvis and sacrum most of left hind limb and foot a right thigh bone and twelve anterior tail vertebrae these remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated still connected together additionally several disarticulated bones were found including right forearm and some and phalanges from both right and left forefeet probably also pertaining to this individual later site was revisited by scientists geoffrey bond and michael cooper who were able to collect additional remains including a scapula specimen a shoulder blade and a fragment of a neck vertebra these remains show that more than one individual was present and it is possible that they do not pertain to vulcanodon at all today vulcanodon remains are stored in natural history museum of zimbabwe in bulawayo raath 1972 noted discovery of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near pelvic region of skeleton he argued that vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with head and neck bended backwards above pelvis a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons teeth would have been only preserved elements of skull however as shown by cooper 1984 these teeth do not pertain to vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on vulcanodon carcass classification basal sauropod phylogeny simplified after allain and 2008 originally michael raath 1972 described vulcanodon not as a sauropod but as an advanced specialized prosauropod possibly of family according to raath sauropod like limb proportions in vulcanodon evolved independently from those of true sauropods through convergent evolution he argued that primitive features of pelvis as well as knife shaped teeth preclude a classification within sauropoda teeth however are now known to belong to a theropod arthur cruickshank 1975 was first to show that vulcanodon was indeed a sauropod arguing that fifth metatarsal bone was equally long as remaining metatarsals a condition seen in other sauropods but not in prosauropods today vulcanodon is universally accepted to be one of most basal primitive members of sauropoda michael cooper 1984 erected a new family vulcanodontidae which he regarded as rootstock for later sauropod families originally vulcanodontidae included vulcanodon and indian barapasaurus but subsequent studies attributed a number of other much more fragmentary early sauropod genera to this family including and paul upchurch 1995 showed that barapasaurus was more closely related to later more advanced sauropods than to vulcanodon rendering vulcanodontidae polyphyletic and therefore invalid exact relationships with other basal sauropod genera remain unclear ronan allain and colleagues 2004 2008 found that vulcanodon is most closely related to tazoudasaurus a newly discovered sauropod genus from morocco these researchers suggested reintroducing name vulcanodontidae to name clade containing vulcanodon and tazoudasaurus however this sibling relationship between tazoudasaurus and vulcanodon could not be confirmed by other analyses adam yates 2004 described a single sauropod tail vertebra from upper elliot formation of south africa that may belong to a genus closely related to vulcanodon upper elliot formation is famous for its abundant fossils of prosauropod massospondylus paleoecology thumb left artist s impression of an individual during later part of lower jurassic southern africa was scene of massive volcanism resulting in extensive lava flows so called flood basalts that covered much of southern africa and antarctica these basalt formations are known as karoo ferrar large igneous province vulcanodon comes from vulcanodon beds a fossil bearing sediment unit within batoka formation which is composed primarily of flood basalts skeleton was found near top of a 30 m 98 5 ft thick bedded layer of sand and siltstone that is over and underlain by flood basalts it was long assumed that vulcanodon lived during lowermost earliest part of jurassic hettangian stage or at triassic jurassic boundary approximately 200 million years ago therefore it was regarded as earliest sauropod known until discovery of even older late triassic isanosaurus was announced in 2000 adam yates 2004 has recently shown that vulcanodon is actually much younger than previously thought dating to uppermost latest part of lower jurassic during toarcian stage approximately 175 183 million years ago thus it is contemporary to closely related tazoudasaurus although locality of vulcanodon itself cannot be dated radiometrically because of weathering of lavas it would roughly be a contemporary to karoo lavas from other localities as entire sequence of volcanic eruptions was finished within one million years thumb model in poznan plaza is only named dinosaur from vulcanodon beds cooper 1984 noted that habitat was desert like as indicated by aeolian wind blown sands of forest sandstone formation which underlies vulcanodon beds sediments in which vulcanodon was found may represent distal alluvial fan deposits which levelled off into a desert landscape which may have contained lakes during wet season individual may have roamed shores of wadis that cut into alluvial fan deposits unless carcass was transported to locality it was found by flooding initially sauropods were thought to be mainly aquatic inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to buoyancy of water to support their giant body weights in 1984 cooper pointed out that vulcanodon most primitive sauropod known at that time lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial this indicated that large body size of sauropods as already seen in vulcanodon had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style references category sauropods category early jurassic dinosaurs of africa category fossils of zimbabwe category fossil taxa described in 1972
