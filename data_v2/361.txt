new york cosmos simply cosmos in 1977 1978 was an american professional soccer club based in new york city and its suburbs team played home games in three stadiums around new york before moving in 1977 to giants stadium east rutherford new jersey where it remained for rest of its history founded in december 1970 team competed in north american soccer league nasl until 1984 and was strongest franchise in that league both competitively and financially based largely around its backing by warner communications president steve ross which enabled it to sign internationally famous stars such as brazilian forward pele italian striker giorgio chinaglia and west german sweeper franz beckenbauer acquisition of these foreign players particularly pele made cosmos into what gavin newsham called most glamorous team in world football and contributed to development of soccer across united states a country where it had previously been largely ignored as cosmos declined following pele s retirement so did nasl attendances fell league s television deal was lost and it finally folded in 1985 after playing its last season in 1984 cosmos attempted to continue operations in major indoor soccer league but attendances were so low that club withdrew without completing a season team attempted an independent schedule in 1985 but also cancelled that because of low attendance cosmos folded though team s youth camps continued to operate under cosmos name and label run by franchise s former general manager g peppe pinton cosmos name remained very well known even after it stopped competing numerous attempts were made to revive it during 1990s and 2000s most notably as a major league soccer mls club seeking to retain cosmos heritage pinton refused to sell name and image rights believing that mls would not honor them following a change of attitude by mls towards nasl s legacy and revival of several former nasl names pinton sold rights to an international english based consortium in august 2009 a new cosmos team was announced in august 2010 by group s honorary president pele new team started play in second tier north american soccer league which held its first season in 2011

reasoned that he could outdo metropolitans label referenced by then nine year old new york mets baseball team by calling his team cosmos shortened from cosmopolitans however owners preferred other possible names wished to use name originally suggested by nesuhi new york blues and another part of ownership group wanted to adopt name new york lovers to ensure that his own preferred name was

soccer league nasl in 1970 and made their field debut in league s fourth season in 1971 first roster signing of club was gordon bradley an english professional who had moved to north america in 1963 and played for new york generals in 1968 he was made player coach a position he would hold until 1975 bradley s team finished second in its division in its first year playing at yankee stadium home of new york yankees baseball team randy horton from bermuda was named league s rookie of year after scoring 16 goals and 37 points most by any new york player north american soccer league operated a points system whereby a goal earned two points and an assist one in 1972 team moved to hofstra stadium where they won their first league title with a 2 1 victory over st louis stars horton was league s top scorer and most valuable player with 9 goals and 22 points from 14 regular season games and two post season matches cosmos reached play offs once more in 1973 but were knocked out at semi final stage bradley coached united states national team for six games during 1973 picking himself in one despite not being an american citizen but lost them all bradley became a citizen of united states in 1974 before 1974 season cosmos moved again settling at downing stadium in their first year at their new base they finished bottom of their division horton top scored for cosmos in every season before he was traded in 1975 to washington diplomats arrival of pele and cosmos peak it was during 1975 season that cosmos acquired brazilian star pele whom they had been attempting to sign since team was created ross had apparently not heard of him before getting involved in soccer but agreed to finance transfer when toye compared brazilian s popularity to that of pope pele joined cosmos on june 10 1975 on a salary of 1 4 million per year an enormous wage for an athlete at that time a number of contracts only one of which mentioned soccer were set up for pele to ensure that he paid lowest amount of tax possible including one as a recording artist with warner subsidiary atlantic records we owned him lock stock and barrel toye retrospectively boasted they also signed mike dillon in 1975 pele deal was later described by gavin newsham an english writer as transfer coup of century his arrival turned cosmos from a motley crew of foreigners semi professionals and students into a huge commercial presence club s groundsman on hearing that brazilian s debut for new york was to be broadcast on cbs spray painted pitch green to disguise how little grass was on it match against dallas tornado was broadcast to 22 countries and covered by more than 300 journalists from all over world although new york finished third at season end it was still too low a placing to reach post season bradley was replaced for 1976 season by another englishman ken furphy who paired pele up front with italian international forward giorgio chinaglia a new arrival from s s lazio he had been so popular at lazio that when his move to new york was announced supporters threatened to throw themselves beneath wheels of plane by contrast to most of overseas stars bought by nasl teams chinaglia was signed in his prime he played for cosmos for rest of their history scoring a record number of goals and points not only for cosmos but for entire league he shared an unusual personal bond with club s ultimate controller ross and was therefore treated differently from other players including pele thumb 180px pele crying while teammate carlos alberto consoles him at end of his speech during pele s farewell match october 1977 crowds rose with arrival of these and other european and south american international players resulting in a move back to yankee stadium for 1976 season with numerous foreign stars arriving at cosmos team s competitive performance improved as new york reached play offs at end of season but lost in divisional championship match to tampa bay rowdies cosmos relocated again before 1977 season to newly constructed giants stadium in new jersey and at same time dropped prefix new york and played simply as cosmos without a geographical name city name was restored in 1979 bradley returned as coach for 1977 season in place of dismissed furphy but was removed after half of season to become club s vice president of player personnel south african born former italy international eddie firmani took his place pele played his last professional match on october 1 1977 in front of a capacity crowd at giants stadium in an exhibition match between new york and his former club santos pele appeared for both sides playing one half for each cosmos won game 2 1 pele s compatriot former brazil captain carlos alberto was signed in 1977 at same time as franz beckenbauer who had captained 1974 fifa world cup winning west german national team on field new york won three out of four championships in 1977 1978 and 1980 a playoff game against fort lauderdale strikers in 1977 drew a crowd of 77 691 a record for american club soccer team s average attendances regularly over 40 000 during late 1970s were biggest in league this helped it to become regarded as league s marquee club both commercially and competitively firmani was fired in 1979 he claimed after falling out with chinaglia his assistant ray klivecka replaced him becoming team s first american born coach he lasted a season before himself being replaced by julio mazzei on pele s farewell tour in 1977 cosmos made history by becoming first western professional soccer team to play in china they drew their opening match with chinese national team 1 1 and lost second game 2 1 despite pele scoring a free kick decline of cosmos and nasl after retirement of pele in 1977 much of progress that american soccer had made during his stay was lost there was no star at same level to replace him as nasl s headline act after enduring briefly during late 1970s attendances dropped after 1980 sport s popularity fell and media lost interest deal with broadcaster abc to broadcast nasl matches was also lost in 1980 and 1981 soccer bowl was only shown on tape delay all of franchises quickly became unprofitable and a salary cap enforced before 1984 season only delayed inevitable league folded at end of 1984 following loss of most of its franchises cosmos had financial problems of their own on top of those affecting league in general much of cosmos ability to attract well known overseas players it had acquired was due to financial resources of parent company warner communications in early 1980s warner was target of a hostile takeover bid by australian media magnate rupert murdoch although this attempt did not succeed warner sold off several of its assets among them atari and global soccer inc subsidiary that operated cosmos chinaglia bought global soccer and thus controlled team his group did not have capital necessary to keep all of players signed on expensive contracts by warner which resulted in many of stars being sold club won its last title in 1982 and by last season of nasl 1984 had missed play offs for first time since 1975 precipitous decline of cosmos after 1983 season became for many fans and media proof positive of grave condition of whole nasl major indoor soccer league demise and youth soccer following collapse of nasl team competed in major indoor soccer league during 1984 85 season with klivecka briefly returning as coach but withdrew after 33 games due to low attendances although organization did not field a team following that season except for an aborted independent schedule in 1985 cosmos youth soccer camps which team had started in 1977 remained in operation camps were run by former cosmos general manager g peppe pinton who retained ownership of cosmos name logo and records pinton continued youth programs at ramapo college in mahwah new jersey summer camps program existed since 1978 after one year pele s retirement then pinton took over with cosmos camps and became team s soccer coach from 1989 to 2003 replacing ken and peter valente pele and giorgio chinaglia soccer camps were located at manhattanville college in purchase new york new cosmos team since original new york cosmos club stopped competing in 1985 there have been frequent attempts to revive it with rise of major league soccer mls various new york area entities including past and present owners of new york red bulls lobbied pinton for acquisition of cosmos name pinton refused to allow an mls team to use it believing that league would not acknowledge cosmos legacy however when old nasl names such as san jose earthquakes seattle sounders portland timbers and vancouver whitecaps were revived as mls franchises he reconsidered he sold cosmos name and brand to english businessman paul kemsley in 2009 whose group fronted by pele and including many well known soccer figures announced a new team with cosmos name in august 2010 new cosmos initially attempted to become an mls expansion franchise but in 2012 joined new second tier incarnation of north american soccer league which began play in autumn of 2013 cultural impact and influence on u s soccer when pele arrived at cosmos in 1975 american soccer was in newsham s phrase dying a slow painful and largely unnoticed death sport was not taken seriously by bulk of american media and was of little interest to public matches were often played in front of almost empty stands receiving modest press coverage signing of pele by cosmos transformed soccer across country almost immediately lending credibility not only to cosmos but also to nasl and soccer in general within days of brazilian s arrival increased media attention had caused cosmos office staff to increase from five people to more than 50 soccer became seen as a viable alternative to more traditional american sports such as basketball baseball and american football cosmos in particular became an internationally famous club most glamorous team in world football in newsham s words or soccer demigods in those of espn writer david hirshey cosmos as flagship team of nasl embodied what hirshey labelled nexus of soccer and showbiz and became warner communications most culturally visible asset after pele signed for new york many other european and south american stars joined nasl teams los angeles aztecs for example signed george best and johan cruyff in 1976 and 1979 respectively cosmos road trips described by traveling secretary steve marshall as like traveling with rolling stones saw team pack out each stadium it visited while at home team attracted numerous high profile supporters while soccer had previously been largely ignored by american press cosmos and other nasl teams now became regular fixtures on back pages however just as pele had kick started development of soccer in u s his retirement in 1977 would mark start of a decline with nobody of same stature to personify sport popularity that had been built up nosedived just as quickly as it had appeared league s television deal with abc was lost at end of 1980 and a salary cap enforced before 1984 season caused many of remaining overseas stars lured to america by fat pay packets to return to european and south american leagues nasl collapsed abruptly in late 1984 and was not replaced by a new professional soccer league until major league soccer s first season in 1996 a feature length documentary about cosmos called once in a lifetime extraordinary story of new york cosmos was released in theaters in 2006 film narrated by matt dillon featured interviews with many of players and personalities involved with team uniforms and crest after team name cosmos was chosen from a fan submission competition on february 4 1971 cosmos
