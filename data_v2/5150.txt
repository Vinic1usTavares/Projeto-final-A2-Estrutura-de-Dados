interstate 84 i 84 is a part of interstate highway system that links portland oregon to i 80 near echo utah segment in u s state of utah is shortest of any of three states western i 84 passes through and contains eastern terminus of highway i 84 enters box elder county near snowville before becoming concurrent with i 15 in tremonton concurrent highways travel south through brigham city and ogden and separate near ogden hinckley airport turing east along davis county border i 84 intersects u s route 89 us 89 and enters weber canyon as well as morgan county while in morgan county i 84 passes devil s gate weber hydroelectric power plant and devil s slide rock formation past morgan highway crosses into summit county past thousand mile tree before reaching its eastern terminus at i 80 near echo construction of controlled access highway was scheduled in late 1957 under designations interstate 82s and interstate 80n i 82s designation was only applied on paper for about a year but i 80n designation was highway s official designation until 1977 when it was renumbered i 84 by american association of state highway and transportation officials by 1986 construction of freeway had been completed across three states average traffic in 2012 along non concurrent parts of i 84 ranged from as few as 6 655 vehicles traveling along i 84 at interchange with sr 86 in henefer and as many as 18 945 vehicles used highway at sr 26 interchange in riverdale route description out of three states that western portion of i 84 passes through segment in utah is shortest by comparison longest stretch of western i 84 through a single state is segment in oregon i 84 also has a eastern segment that passes through pennsylvania new york connecticut and massachusetts all four of these segments are shorter than utah segment every year utah department of transportation udot conducts a series of surveys on its highways in state to measure traffic volume this is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic aadt a measure of traffic volume for any average day of year in 2012 udot calculated that as few as 6 655 vehicles traveled i 84 at interchange with sr 86 in henefer and as many as 18 945 vehicles used highway at sr 26 interchange in riverdale between 27 and 57 percent of traffic recorded consisted of trucks these counts are of portion of freeway in utah and are not reflective of entire interstate or of its concurrency with i 15 as part of interstate highway system entire route is listed on national highway system a system of roads that are important to nation s economy defense and mobility western segment crossing idaho utah state line i 84 enters box elder county and curlew valley near farmland that utilizes center pivot irrigation before intersecting sr 30 at a diamond interchange town of snowville is crossed before passing to north of hansel mountains and north promontory mountains town of howell accessible from an interchange with sr 83 lays to southeast of blue creek reservoir in blue creek valley access to golden spike national historic site is provided by sr 83 south of howell blue spring hills form southern border of howell as i 84 continues southeast additional center irrigation farmland is passed before giving way to more traditional farmland outside of city of tremonton where a trumpet interchange marks where i 15 turns north towards malad city and pocatello heading southeast from this interchange i 84 and i 15 are concurrent for just over concurrency with i 15 thumb right northbound along i 15 84 in ogden concurrent highways i 15 84 continue south parallel to rail belonging to union pacific railroad up past mountain wilderness to an interchange at 1100 west in brigham city also known as us 91 which once in brigham city becomes concurrent with us 89 and two highways travel northeast from brigham city into box elder canyon towards logan in heart of cache valley us 89 closely parallels i 15 84 east as highways pass willard bay willard bay state park and bear river migratory bird refuge before crossing into weber county upon entering weber county rail line that highway has paralleled since tremonton splits off eastwards near defense depot ogden as concurrent highways continue south past farr west and slaterville before a southern pacific railroad rail line which traverses great salt lake on a causeway crosses under freeway city of ogden is bypassed by interstates with us 89 serving downtown us 89 is accessible via interchanges with sr 39 sr 79 and sr 104 in addition to i 84 further

county and wasatch cache national forest once in canyon carriageways of highway split to accommodate devil s gate weber hydroelectric power plant following river south i 84 exits forest and enters county seat of morgan leaving city highway turns back east passing devil s slide an unusual rock formation just off freeway upon entering summit county i 84 passes thousand mile tree planted by union pacific railroad workers to mark construction of of rail from its origin in omaha nebraska tree was said to be only pine tree between omaha and salt lake city another tree was planted as original tree had died in 1900 and was removed in 1926 to during conversion from single track to double track through canyon past tree freeway passes through town of henefer before terminating at a directional t interchange with i 80 just south of census designated place of echo immediately south of interchange is echo reservoir and echo dam history thumb right i 84 approaching its eastern terminus earlier roads most of original routing of what is now i 84 existed as early as 1923 however portion of now i 84 into idaho was not yet constructed in 1926 much of route was signed as us 30s from now eastern terminus at i 80 us 530 then northwest into ogden between ogden and brigham city highway was to be concurrent with us 91 then us 30s split off northwest to idaho border entire western branch of us 30s was an unimproved road however concurrency into ogden was paved remainder of route to its now terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections and by 1937 entire route was paved current road first utah state route to have number 84 is what is now known as sr 126 sr 126 was originally numbered sr 84 until 1977 renumbering of utah state highways previously freeway s legislative designation

highway loosely follows path of first transcontinental railroad original routing of us 30s had highway passing into idaho west of black pine peak however new i 84 was constructed to east original roadways are now numbered sr 30 sr 42 and idaho state highway 2847 passage of federal aid highway act of 1956 formed interstate highway system however only western segment of now i 84 was approved at this time and a designation of i 82s was assigned to a then unconstructed controlled access highway across box elder county in 1957 eastern segment of highway was added later in 1957 and route was numbered i 80n by 1958 by 1968 portions of western half of freeway had been completed along with segment between tremonton and brigham city a portion of freeway was completed around morgan as well by 1971 most of western portions of freeway had been constructed with two sections remaining that had at grade intersections along concurrency there were gaps between brigham city and pleasant view and one small gap near devil s slide i 80n designation was changed to i 84 in 1977 by american association of state highway and transportation officials over objections from washington state department of transportation and idaho transportation department and with support of udot and oregon department of transportation by 1978 construction of i 84 was complete across most of three states in september 1986 final section of highway was opened on between tremonton to blue creek summit following three years of construction that cost 21 million in 1994 i 84 was planned to be used to transport low level radioactive waste from idaho national engineering laboratory to waste isolation pilot plant in carlsbad new mexico via wyoming this did not start until 1999 however due to delay in opening of new mexican plant a 20 million equivalent to in reconstruction of us 89 interchange at mouth of weber canyon was financed partly by funding obtained by state in preparation for 2002 winter olympics in
