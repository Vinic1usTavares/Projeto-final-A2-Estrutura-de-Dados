robert fox bacher august 31 1905 november 18 2004 was an american nuclear physicist and one of leaders of manhattan project born in loudonville ohio bacher obtained his undergraduate degree and doctorate from university of michigan writing his 1930 doctoral thesis under supervision of samuel goudsmit on zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels after graduate work at california institute of technology caltech and massachusetts institute of technology mit he accepted a job at columbia university in 1935 he accepted an offer from hans bethe to work with him at cornell university in ithaca new york it was there that bacher collaborated with bethe on his book nuclear physics a stationary states of nuclei 1936 first of three books that would become known as bethe bible in december 1940 bacher joined radiation laboratory at mit although he did not immediately cease his research at cornell into neutron cross section of cadmium radiation laboratory was organized into two sections one for incoming radar signals and one for outgoing radar signals bacher was appointed to handle incoming signals section here he gained valuable experience in administration coordinating not just efforts of his scientists but also those of general electric and rca in 1942 bacher was approached by robert oppenheimer to join manhattan project at its new laboratory in los alamos new mexico it was at bacher s insistence that los alamos became a civilian rather than a military laboratory at los alamos bacher headed project s p physics division and later its g gadget division bacher worked closely with oppenheimer and two men discussed project s progress on a daily basis after war bacher became director of laboratory of nuclear studies at cornell he also served on u s atomic energy commission civilian agency that replaced wartime manhattan project and in 1947 he became one of its inaugural commissioners he left in 1949 to become head division of physics mathematics and astronomy at caltech he was appointed a member of president s science advisory committee psac in 1958 in 1962 he became caltech s vice president and provost he stepped down from post of provost in 1970 and became a professor emeritus in 1976 he died in 2004 at age of 99 early life and career bacher was born in loudonville ohio on august 31 1905 only child of harry and byrl fox bacher in 1908 family moved to ann arbor michigan where harry worked as a banker and byrl as a voice teacher on university of michigan faculty bacher attended w s perry school and later ann arbor high school while there he met professor harrison m randall head of physics department at university of michigan who encouraged him to study physics bacher entered university of michigan where he joined kappa sigma fraternity and lived in frat house he became house manager in his sophomore year but moved back home in his junior year to concentrate on physics at randall s suggestion he applied to harvard graduate school of arts and sciences which he entered in 1926 to study for his doctorate his fees were paid by his family but his father had a heart attack and could no longer afford them so in 1927 bacher moved back to ann arbor where he lived at home and attended university of michigan he received a charles a coffin foundation fellowship from general electric to build up theoretical physics department at university of michigan randall recruited four distinguished young physicists to work at ann arbor in 1927 otto laporte george uhlenbeck samuel goudsmit and david m dennison university of michigan was no longer a backwater in theoretical physics bacher immediately signed up for goudsmit s course on atomic structure with goudsmit he investigated zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels which became subject of his 1930 phd thesis on may 30 1930 bacher married jean dow his mother gave them a ford model a and use of family s lakeside holiday house where they entertained guests including paul ehrenfest and enrico fermi in 1931 with a national research council fellowship he spent a year at california institute of technology caltech because ira bowen taught there at caltech bacher attended lectures by robert oppenheimer but spent most of his time at mt wilson observatory which had a better library bacher decided to create a work listing energy coupling constant parity and electron configurations of all known atoms and ions working with goudsmit back in ann arbor result was a book atomic energy states as derived from analysis of optical spectra 1932 which they dedicated to randall in second year of his national research council fellowship bacher moved across country to massachusetts institute of technology to work with john c slater who had taught bacher at harvard while there slater asked him to conduct a seminar on john chadwick s recent discovery of neutron reading chadwick s paper he realized that anomalies in then current theory would be resolved if spin of neutron was 1 2 this became subject of a letter he submitted to physical review with visiting scholar edward condon a year later bacher became first to suggest neutron had a magnetic moment equal to about minus one nuclear magneton based on unusually small magnetic moment of nitrogen determined from its hyperfine structure afterwards bacher returned to university of michigan on an alfred h lloyd fellowship jobs were hard to find at this time due to great depression and in 1934 he accepted a job at columbia university where he worked with isidor isaac rabi jerrold zacharias jerome kellogg and sid millman however it was difficult living in new york on his salary and jean gave birth to their first child martha in december 1935 a second child andrew was born in 1938 bacher therefore accepted an offer from hans bethe to work with him at cornell university in ithaca new york ithaca was a university town similar to ann arbor where bacher and jean had been raised at cornell bacher worked with bethe on his book nuclear physics a stationary states of nuclei 1936 first of three books that would become known as bethe bible world war ii radiation laboratory in december 1940 bacher joined radiation laboratory at mit but did not immediately cease his research he reached an arrangement with its director lee alvin dubridge to return to cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed he was researching neutron cross section of cadmium a topic of interest to enrico fermi who was attempting to build a nuclear reactor but whose figures did not agree with bacher s bacher carefully checked his results and fermi convinced of their correctness urged bacher to publish them bacher submitted a paper to physical review with instructions to withhold publication until after war and paper was not published until 1946 dubridge organized radiation laboratory into two sections one for incoming radar signals and one for outgoing radar signals bacher was appointed to handle incoming signals section here he gained valuable experience in administration coordinating not just efforts of his scientists but also those of general electric and rca he later recalled manhattan project in 1942 bacher and rabi radiation laboratory s assistant director were approached by oppenheimer to join manhattan project at its new laboratory in los alamos new mexico they convinced oppenheimer that plan for a military laboratory would not work since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair plan was modified and new laboratory would be a civilian one run by university of california under contract from war department bacher felt that this was his first contribution to success of project he met with oppenheimer at los alamos in april 1943 but was not convinced that he was needed oppenheimer wrote to him that thumb left bacher is awarded medal for merit by major general leslie r groves jr alt two men in suits with medals pinned on left breast one shakes hands with a fat man in an army uniform bacher then accepted job at los alamos moving there in may 1943 with his family to become head of experimental physics division p division his wife jean was also hired to work as a human computer in theoretical division t division for his seven group leaders he had john h williams robert r wilson john h manley darol k froman emilio g segre bruno b rossi and donald w kerst bacher worked closely with oppenheimer and two men discussed project s progress on a daily basis in july 1944 oppenheimer reorganized laboratory to focus on problem of building an implosion type nuclear weapon which was necessary because gun type design would not work with plutonium p division was broken up and bacher became head of g for gadget division this much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included william higinbotham seth neddermeyer edwin mcmillan luis alvarez and otto frisch while george kistiakowsky s explosives division x division developed explosive lenses g division designed rest of weapon there were numerous difficulties to overcome not least of which was devising a means of detonating lenses with required speed robert f christy s solid core design was chosen as most likely design to succeed to coordinate efforts of laboratory oppenheimer created committee so called because they were to ride herd on implosion effort and coordinate all efforts of laboratory it included bacher along with samuel allison george kistiakowsky deak parsons charles lauritsen and hartley rowe three days before day bomb was to be test detonated in new mexico desert bacher was part of pit assembly team which assembled nuclear capsule a cylindrical section of uranium tamper containing plutonium core and initiator in an old farmhouse near alamogordo testing site when capsule was driven to shot tower and inserted into spherical tamper inside explosive assembly it stuck bacher recognized that expansion of capsule due to heat given off by plutonium core was causing jam and that leaving two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow capsule to be inserted fully after watching test his reaction was merely well it works bacher was packaging third core for shipment to tinian on august 12 at ice house at los alamos when he received word that japanese had initiated surrender negotiations he had already set g division task of designing and building new types of cores and assemblies and he co authored a report with robert wilson urging development of edward teller s super bomb he served on a committee chaired by richard tolman that looked into documents produced by manhattan project and one chaired by manson benedict that investigated technical feasibility of international control of nuclear energy for his services to manhattan project bacher was awarded medal for merit on january 12 1946 post world war ii atomic energy commission after war bacher returned to ithaca to head cornell s laboratory for nuclear studies he agreed with bethe that what cornell needed to become a major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron but first he needed to find somewhere to put it however in 1946 bacher was appointed to scientific and technical subcommittee of new united nations atomic energy commission along with fellow united states representatives tolman and oppenheimer bacher therefore had to divide his time between ithaca and new york city thumb right five atomic energy commissioners at los alamos left to right bacher david e lilienthal sumner pike william w and lewis l strauss alt five men in suits with hats and coats in october 1946 david lilienthal asked bacher to become one of inaugural commissioners of united states atomic energy commission civilian agency that was being formed to replace wartime manhattan project as a republican bacher was easily confirmed by senate members of united states congress joint committee on atomic energy by an 8 0 vote as he was only one of five commissioners who was a scientist an important factor in his decision to accept post he played a leading role in selection of atomic energy commission s influential general advisory committee to which nine scientists were appointed james conant lee dubridge enrico fermi robert oppenheimer isidor isaac rabi hartley rowe glenn seaborg cyril smith and hood worthington bacher and fellow commissioner sumner pike began with an inspection of los alamos and hanford site and conducted an inventory of fissionable material at los alamos with norris bradbury who had succeeded oppenheimer as its director he found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946 only four would be in 1947 primarily due to production problems with reactors at hanford these problems were on their way to resolution when bacher observed operation sandstone nuclear tests at enewetak atoll in 1948 as atomic energy commission s representative bacher s original two year term would have expired on january 1 1949 but president harry truman convinced him to stay on bacher resigned in may 1949 and this time president was unable to dissuade him bacher wished to return to academia but robert wilson was now head of cornell s laboratory for nuclear studies and bacher felt that it would be awkward working for someone who was one of his group leaders at los alamos he therefore accepted an offer from lee dubridge of chair of division of physics mathematics and astronomy at caltech however work at atomic energy commission was not so easily left behind senator bourke hickenlooper charged commission with mismanagement specifically cost overruns at hanford awarding a scholarship to a communist and loss of of uranium from argonne national laboratory bacher felt obligated to return to washington to testify on lilienthal s behalf before joint committee on atomic energy another crisis broke in september 1949 when air force picked up signs of soviet union s rds 1 nuclear test bacher joined oppenheimer parsons general hoyt vandenberg atomic energy commissioners and a british delegation under william penney to discuss what to do recent devaluation of british pound had already triggered a financial crisis and there was concern about how markets would react to news oppenheimer and bacher saw evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive and bacher in particular came down strongly on side of making a public announcement as number of people who already knew made a leak almost inevitable truman made announcement a few days later caltech division chair that bacher now occupied at caltech had been vacant since robert a millikan had retired in 1945 although nominally a professorship it was primarily an administrative post in 1949 there were 17 professors in department of whom nine were physicists two were astrophysicists and remaining six were mathematicians there were two world class research laboratories funded by office of naval research cosmic ray laboratory that had been founded by millikan which was now directed by carl anderson and w k kellogg radiation laboratory which was directed by charles lauritsen but there were no facilities for high energy physics these would have to be created from scratch in moving into high energy physics bacher had full support not just of dubridge but of anderson and lauritsen as well lauritsen had already hired robert langmuir to begin designing a new 600 mev synchrotron and bacher found a large building to house it that had originally been used for grinding and polishing palomar observatory s mirror but which had been empty since 1948 he arranged for atomic energy commission and office of naval research grants worth 1 million to build it and other required facilities and 300 000 a year to run it facilities were not enough bacher needed physicists lauritsen had made a start on this too by hiring robert christy bacher hired experimental physicists alvin v robert m walker and matthew sands physicist that bacher decided he wanted most though was richard feynman to get him bacher offered a large salary and agreed to pay for feynman s 1950 1951 sabbatical in brazil feynman would go on to win nobel prize in physics in 1965 in 1955 bacher hired murray gell mann who would win nobel prize in 1969 relatively new field of radio astronomy sparked bacher s interest and he hired john bolton and gordon stanley from australian commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation in 1955 a grant from office of naval research allowed bolton to build owens valley radio observatory which became an important center for study of quasars caltech did not spell an end to bacher s service in washington he served two terms as a member of president s science advisory committee psac under president dwight d eisenhower from november 18 1953 to june 30 1955 and from december 9 1957 to december 31 1959 during his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 during his second he worked with james l fisk and ernest lawrence to examine how a partial nuclear test ban treaty could be monitored bacher remained chair of division of physics mathematics and astronomy at caltech until 1962 when he was appointed as vice president and provost he stepped down from post of provost in 1970 at age of 65 and became a professor emeritus in 1976 he still did some research at jet propulsion laboratory and visited caltech from time to time in 1983 he was master of ceremonies at los alamos for events commemorating 40th anniversary of founding of laboratory in 1943 bacher died on november 18 2004 at a retirement home in montecito california he was survived by his daughter martha bacher eaton and son andrew dow bacher
