jennifer syme as junkie girl marilyn manson as porn actor twiggy ramirez as porn actor production development right thumb author barry gifford co wrote screenplay with lynch lost highway was directed by david lynch as his first feature film since twin peaks fire walk with me which was released in 1992 as a prequel to television series twin peaks he came across phrase lost highway in book night people by barry gifford because lynch knew gifford very well and had previously adapted his novel wild at heart into a film by same name he told writer that he loved it as a title and two agreed to write a screenplay together originally both men had their own different ideas of what lost highway should be and ended up rejecting each other s and also their own lynch then told him that during last night of shooting fire walk with me he had a thought about videotapes and a couple in crisis this idea would develop into first part of film until fred madison is put on death row lynch and gifford then realized that a transformation had to occur and another story which would have several links to first one but also differ developed it took them one month to finish script lost highway was partially inspired by o j simpson murder case which involved arrest of a man who denied murder film s opening scene where fred madison hears words dick laurent is dead over his intercom was inspired by an analogous incident that happened to lynch at his own house because his house was next to actor david lander s house and both men have same first name lynch thought stranger must have been wrong about address idea of mystery man came out of a feeling of a man who whether real or not gave impression that he was supernatural lynch explained film was financed by french production company ciby 2000 lynch s asymmetrical productions whose offices are near his house in hollywood hills was also involved in film s production casting lynch cast bill pullman a friend and neighbor of his as film s central character actress patricia arquette agreed to be cast as renee and alice because she was interested in portraying a sexually desirable and dangerous woman a role she had never done before she had also been a fan of lynch for a long time and felt that it would be an honor to work with him actor balthazar getty was chosen for role of pete dayton after lynch saw a picture of him in a magazine and said that he was guy for job because script was so open to interpretation getty and arquette did not know what kind of film lost highway was supposed to be according to getty part of david s technique is to keep his actors guessing because it creates a certain atmosphere on set actor robert blake was cast as mystery man because lynch liked his previous work and was always interested in working with him although blake did not understand script at all he was responsible for look and style of his character when lynch told him to use his imagination blake decided to cut his hair short part it in middle and apply white kabuki make up on his face he then put on a black outfit and approached lynch who loved what he had done actor robert loggia who had previously expressed interest in playing role of frank booth in lynch s 1986 mystery film blue velvet was cast as mr eddy and dick laurent lynch recalled that upon learning of dennis hopper s casting as booth loggia launched a profanity laden rant at him which would eventually become mr eddy s road rage scene lost highway also features final motion picture performance of richard pryor filming and editing right thumb lynch originally intended to shoot lost highway in black and white lost highway was shot in los angeles california in about 54 days from november 29 1995 to february 22 1996 some of film s exterior and driving scenes were shot in griffith park while scenes of lost highway hotel were filmed at amargosa opera house and hotel in death valley lynch owns property that was used for fred and renee s mansion which is located on same street as his own house in hollywood hills house was configured in a particular way to meet requirements of film a corridor that leads to bedroom was added and facade was remodeled with slot windows to make fred s point of view very limited paintings that are on wall above couch were done by lynch s ex wife and producer mary sweeney scenes that involved nudity and sexual contact proved to be very difficult for arquette because she considers herself a very modest and shy person nevertheless she felt very protected by lynch and film crew who would always give her robes at any time love scene between her and getty in desert which was shot on a dry lake bed 20 miles outside baker was a closed set and only key crew were allowed on it sequence where fred transforms into pete was not computer generated but rather accomplished with in camera techniques a makeup expert constructed a fake head that was covered with artificial brain matter which was then intercut with shots of pullman final car chase was shot with two different cameras running at different frame rates footage was then sped up to make scene more aggressive lynch worked with cinematographer peter deming to give film a surreal look because script did not include many descriptions film s visual approach evolved as filming progressed deming would occasionally pull out lenses of his camera to a particular scene while lynch would often listen to music in his headset and to a scene at same time to visualize screenplay according to him sound and picture working together is what films are so every single sound has to be supporting that scene and enlarging it a room is say nine by twelve but when you re introducing sound to it you can create a space that s giant notion of a psychogenic fugue was incorporated into film after unit publicist read it up on a book about mental illnesses lynch felt it was a musical term stating that a fugue starts off one way takes up on another direction and then comes back to original so it relates to form of film originally lynch wanted to shoot lost highway in black and white but idea was discarded due to financial risks it could cause nevertheless film was shot in varying levels of darkness and features few daylight scenes some sequences became so dark that it was difficult for viewers to see what was happening according to deming thing i wanted to achieve was giving feeling that anything could come out of background and to leave a certain question about what you re looking at film is working under surface while you re watching it film s darkness was intentionally not adjusted during post production first cut of film ran two and a half hours and a test audience of 50 people was given a preview to give lynch an idea of what needed to be cut film was ultimately cut down to two hours and ten minutes most of deleted scenes were about pete s life including a scene where pete would go out with his friends to a drive in before going to bowling alley soundtrack film s original score was composed by angelo badalamenti and barry adamson badalamenti had previously worked with lynch on blue velvet and twin peaks although most of score was recorded in prague additional compositions were done in london in new orleans lynch collaborated with musician trent reznor of nine inch nails to provide additional music together they created music that accompanied scenes in which fred and renee watch mysterious vhs tapes two songs by reznor and nine inch nails perfect drug and driver down were specifically composed for film reznor then produced a soundtrack album that includes film s score and songs by artists such as david bowie lou reed marilyn manson smashing pumpkins and rammstein marilyn manson s contributions include their cover of screamin jay hawkins i put a spell on you which was previously released on their 1995 ep smells like children and apple of sodom which was specifically written for film smashing pumpkins frontman billy corgan wrote eye after lynch rejected an early version of tear from band s 1998 album adore two songs by rammstein rammstein and mich were included after lynch listened to their 1995 debut album herzeleid while exploring locations for film track an instrumental version of bossa nova song how insensitive by antonio carlos jobim was also included as part of film s soundtrack album which was released on november 26 1996 reached no 7 on billboard 200 chart and was certified gold status in us themes although lost highway is generally classified as a neo noir film film borrows elements from other genres including german expressionism and french new wave terms psychological thriller and horror film have also been used to describe its narrative elements writing for australian metro magazine thomas caldwell described fred madison as a typical film noir hero inhabiting a doomed and desolate world characterised by an excess of sexuality darkness and violence another film noir feature that is present in film is femme fatale alice wakefield who misleads pete dayton into dangerous situations film was also noted for its graphic violence and sexual themes lynch defended these images stating that he was simply being honest with his own ideas for film some of film s themes and ideas had been explored before 1945 film detour also focuses on a disturbed male nightclub musician film s setting and mysterious recorded messages were seen as a reference to 1955 film kiss me deadly while its nightmarish atmosphere has been compared to maya deren s 1943 short film meshes of afternoon like alfred hitchcock s 1958 film vertigo film examines male obsessions with women who merely represent emotions that relate to them lynch has described film as a psychogenic fugue and insisted that while lost highway is about identity film is very abstract and can be interpreted in different ways he does not favor advancing a specific interpretation and said that film leaves viewers to interpret events as they choose gifford however thinks that film offers a rational explanation to its surreal events according to him fred madison is experiencing a psychogenic fugue which is manifested when he transforms into pete film s circular narrative has been likened to a mobius strip cultural critic slavoj zizek felt that this circularity is analogous to a psychoanalytic process according to him there is a symptomatic key phrase as in all of lynch s films that always returns as an insistent traumatic and indecipherable message real and there is a temporal loop as with analysis where protagonist at first fails to encounter self but in end is able to pronounce symptom consciously as his own this implies that fred s madness is so powerful that even fantasy where he sees himself as pete ultimately dissolves and ends in a nightmare he also interprets film s bipartite structure as exploiting opposition of two horrors horror of nightmarish noir universe of perverse sex betrayal and murder and perhaps much more unsettling despair of our drab alienated daily life of impotence and distrust release box office right thumb lost highway premiered

mixed reviews from critics both gene siskel and roger ebert gave film two thumbs down a rating lynch would later tout as two more great reasons to see lost highway ebert argued that while lynch effectively puts images on screen and uses a strong soundtrack to create mood film does not make sense concluding that lost highway is about design not cinema similarly kenneth turan of los angeles times wrote that lost highway is a beautifully made but emotionally empty film that exists only for sensation of its provocative moments both stephanie zacharek of salon and owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly felt that film was very superficial especially when compared to blue velvet zacharek said that lynch traded some of his disturbing originality for noir formula and weirdness while gleiberman compared film s sex scenes to those of mediocre hollywood thrillers in a more positive review new york times journalist janet maslin felt that while film s perversity is unoriginal and resembles that of blue velvet lost highway still holds sinister interest of its own and invites its audience to ponder metro editor richard von praised lost highway as a true horror film due to its confusing and unpleasant screenplay he explained that horror ought to transcend logic and ordinary reality and unlike with popular horror films like scream where difference between screen violence and real violence is obvious lynch present s horror as horror willing to baffle us willing to wound us in another positive review andy klein of dallas observer felt that lost highway was a return to form for lynch and considered it his best work since blue velvet klein compared film s unanswerable concerns to star gate sequence from 2001 a space odyssey stating that lost highway is better absorbed and experienced than analyzed writing for chicago reader critic jonathan rosenbaum felt that lost highway was an audacious move away from conventional narrative and back toward formal beauty of eraserhead he credited lynch s masterful and often powerful fusions of sound and image as they give film a very expressionist style however he criticized noir iconography for its lack of historical context for example he explained that while arquette s clothes fit in a noir setting mystery man s video camera is very contemporary and feels out of place todd mccarthy of variety concluded that although lost highway is uneven and too deliberately obscure in meaning to be entirely satisfying result remains sufficiently intriguing and startling to bring many of lynch s old fans back on board at 1997

kipp of slant magazine claimed that film was not an artistic failure stating that in many ways it s lynch at his most daring emotional and personal writing for little white lies william carroll considered film a prelude to mulholland drive due to its los angeles iconic topography and felt that it deserves to be regarded as one of director s best works similarly daily vanguard editor victoria castellanos remarked that film serves as a wonderful companion to mulholland drive and inland empire and in many ways is more surreal and emotional than some of lynch s other films as a cult film lost highway was included in a v clubs new cult canon section editor scott tobias viewed it as more cohesive than it might appear at first blush and argued that lynch goes digging for truths that people don t know or won t acknowledge about themselves within dreams within subconscious within those impossibly dark hallways where we fear to tread lucia of allmovie online database claimed that after
