thumb africa hiv aids 500px prevalence of hiv aids in adult ages 15 49 populations 1999 2002 approximately 1 100 000 people in malawi are hiv positive which represents 10 8 of country s population because malawian government was initially slow to respond to epidemic under leadership of hastings banda 1966 1994 prevalence of hiv aids increased drastically between 1985 when disease was first identified in malawi and 1993 when hiv prevalence rates were estimated to be as high as 30 among pregnant women malawian food crisis in 2002 resulted at least in part from a loss of agricultural productivity due to prevalence of hiv aids various degrees of government involvement under leadership of bakili muluzi 1994 2004 and bingu wa mutharika 2004 2012 resulted in a gradual decline in hiv prevalence and in 2003 many people living in malawi gained access to antiretroviral therapy condoms have become more widely available to public through non governmental organizations and more malawians are taking advantage of hiv testing services due to several successful television and radio campaigns by malawian government and non governmental organizations in malawi levels of awareness regarding hiv aids are high among general population however many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes in response to epidemic convincing themselves that death from aids is inevitable on other hand some have implemented preventive techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from hiv women are more likely to be hiv positive than men in malawi epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners who must cooperate to protect themselves from disease in addition many teachers exclude hiv aids from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about issue and therefore many children are not exposed to information about hiv aids at school finally epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in malawi leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation history thumb 175px lula mutharika cropped bingu wa mutharika third president of malawi 2004 2012 first case of hiv aids in malawi was reported at lilongwe s kamuzu central hospital in 1985 president hastings banda who was in power at time responded with several small scale prevention initiatives and created national aids control programme a division of ministry of health to manage growing epidemic banda believed that issues relating to sex including hiv transmission should not be addressed in public sphere during this time it was illegal for malawian citizens to discuss epidemic openly in 1989 banda introduced a five year world bank medium term plan to combat epidemic but hiv prevalence had already increased drastically at this point in 1994 when bakili muluzi became president he addressed nation s need for a coordinated response to hiv aids epidemic in 2000 muluzi introduced another five year policy known as national strategic framework but like banda s five year world bank medium term plan this plan was largely ineffective in 2001 in response to problems within national aids control programme established by banda muluzi created national aids commission unlike banda who prevented public from accessing information about epidemic muluzi ensured that information about hiv aids was available on radio and television in newspapers and on billboards however despite muluzi s efforts hiv prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period and malawi experienced an aids related nationwide famine in 2002 malawians gained access to antiretroviral drugs in 2003 and with a donation from global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria and election of new president bingu wa mutharika in 2004 government interventions increased substantially however soon after his election mutharika experienced tensions with muluzi after implementing an anti corruption program which distracted government from addressing nation s food and hiv aids related crises despite these obstacles mutharika successfully developed a national aids policy and appointed a principal secretary for hiv aids during his presidency awareness and risk perception thumb 200px partners in health worker with disease treatment literature in malawi despite malawi s limited health and educational infrastructure knowledge regarding hiv aids is high among many people living in both urban and rural malawi according to a 2004 study by barden o fallon et al involving 100 households women in malawi are most likely to learn about hiv aids through radio and television health workers at local clinics and female members of their social networks men are also likely to access information about hiv aids through radio and television however unlike women they are not likely to gain information about hiv aids from their male friends when 57 malawian men were interviewed in 2003 100 of them said they had heard about hiv aids epidemic on radio and 84 2 of them said they had learned about hiv aids during their visits to local health facilities this supports fact that many people in malawi have access to information about epidemic both through radio and other sources personal traits such as age gender location and education correlate either positively or negatively with hiv aids awareness levels for example older women have demonstrated higher levels of knowledge regarding hiv aids than younger women in malawi because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources they are often more knowledgeable about hiv prevention and transmission than women while men are on average able to list 2 2 ways to prevent hiv transmission women are only able to list 1 5 ways only 38 of women surveyed in 2003 2004 understood that their husbands would be less likely to contract hiv if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high risk groups in addition men who are raised in urban environments are on average more informed about hiv aids than men who are raised in rural environments presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children among both men and women higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about hiv aids men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of disease such as fact that people who appear healthy can still be hiv positive than those who have not finally people who have lost friends or family members to disease are likely to have greater knowledge about hiv aids due to their personal firsthand exposure to problem aforementioned study by barden o fallon et al which surveyed 940 women and 661 men indicated that despite their knowledge and awareness many people in malawi do not feel personally susceptible to hiv infection on average only 23 of adults who were surveyed during this study both male and female believed that they were likely to contract hiv and die of aids greater hiv aids awareness among men does not seem to correspond with increased perceived risk on other hand increased levels of knowledge about hiv aids do correlate positively to perceived risk among women another study conducted in rural malawi between 1998 and 2001 by kirsten p smith et al indicated that concerns about personal vulnerability to hiv aids declined during this four year time frame probably because increased use of preventive strategies gave people a sense of control in fact many participants in this study claimed that they were not at all worried about hiv aids unless they had simply adopted a fatalistic standpoint towards epidemic these respondents probably felt that they had successfully reduced their risk of exposure through personal behavioral changes education thumb 275px health education center in blantyre malawi students in malawi have expressed high levels of dissatisfaction regarding hiv aids related education and support they receive at school according to a survey of students in malawi most secondary students do not believe that hiv aids curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of disease although malawian government and non governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about hiv aids in schools there is still a significant shortage of age appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to hiv aids available to instructors particularly in rural areas in addition most teachers cannot identify students in their classes who have been personally affected by epidemic either through friends or relatives which suggests that school based support for hiv aids is minimal however despite this lack of support surveys indicate that children who have been affected by epidemic do not usually experience hiv aids based discrimination at school most teachers are required to address hiv aids in their curricula although instructors are for most part committed to helping their students understand and avoid disease they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about hiv aids in productive ways for example some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students and some believe that due to their limited training they are not knowledgeable enough about hiv aids to direct classroom discussions about disease in addition many teachers feel unsupported by community members who often either deny extent of epidemic or believe that hiv aids should not be addressed in classroom affected groups although hiv aids epidemic has affected men women and children in malawi certain factors such as sexual orientation gender and age influence infection patterns in malawi hiv aids is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex but epidemic has also significantly impacted homosexual male population in malawi in addition women in malawi are more likely to be hiv positive than men suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to hiv aids finally disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly 170 000 malawian children were hiv positive in 2011 and number of orphans in malawi has increased dramatically since epidemic began in 1985 men due to vast scope of hiv aids epidemic many malawian men believe that hiv contraction and death from aids are inevitable older men in particular often claim that hiv aids epidemic is a punishment issued by god or other supernatural forces other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from aids is inevitable these men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural and therefore necessary and good when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners finally some men identify as hiv positive without having undergone testing for hiv preferring to believe that they have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventive measures such as condom use or strict fidelity because of these fatalistic beliefs many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite prevalence of hiv aids in malawi however despite these widespread feelings of fatalism some men believe that they can avoid hiv contraction by modifying their personal behaviors men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently particularly during marital intercourse instead they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations but alter ways in which they choose their sexual partners for example before selecting extramarital sexual partners men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to virus men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by for example wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry hiv while young girls who are perceived as sexually inexperienced are considered pure because of this perception many people are concerned that schoolchildren in malawi particularly girls are becoming exposed to virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors women according to traditional gender roles in malawi men operate primarily in formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor whereas women who are valued for their domestic skills are responsible for agricultural labor and care work this gender based division of labor decreases women s autonomy thereby increasing their vulnerability to hiv aids even within home women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education formal employment and other resources that could give them a sense of financial and personal independence women who are able to work in formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men even when they are completing same tasks making it difficult for them to elevate their status many women are convinced that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection however because of their secondary status they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about hiv aids in home most women in malawi do not view divorce as a viable option even when their husbands are hiv positive and refuse to protect them from virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse because they lack education and training needed to seek gainful employment women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money however despite their vulnerability some women in rural malawi believe that they do to a certain extent have control over their own health and well being they tell their husbands that hiv aids epidemic has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact in addition many women are convinced that by appealing to vulnerability of their children who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract hiv they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk finally as a last resort women might warn their husbands that they will visit or traditional marriage counselor and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent transmission of disease children thumb 250px aids orphans in lilongwe malawi number of orphaned children in malawi has increased dramatically since hiv aids epidemic began in 1985 with certain surveys indicating that more than 35 of schoolchildren have experienced death of at least one parent due to hiv aids because hiv is transmitted sexually married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans or children who have lost both parents to hiv aids older children who have lost both parents to hiv aids often become responsible for care of their younger siblings and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings girls who have been orphaned by hiv aids have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in malawi when parents die of hiv aids extended family members usually become children s primary caregivers in malawi 44 of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives extended family members often provide crucial support to hiv aids orphans however some sources indicate that extended family members mistreat orphans whose parents have died from hiv aids for example family members who are unable to support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse evidence suggests that schoolchildren in malawi are at risk of being exposed to hiv by their teachers who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to virus children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex because they are often unable to afford basic necessities they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in malawi often misinterpret definition of sexual assault as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as children have consented although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate truth behind accusations marriage and relationships although couples are starting to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many malawians in 2000 only 2 3 of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high risk partners such as sex workers and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity others believe that marital condom use violates religious purposes of marriage sexual pleasure and reproduction in a study published in 2007 by agnes m men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies on other hand they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners many different sources of information can motivate discussion about hiv aids among married couples after hearing information about hiv aids at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members people are more likely to address risk of hiv contraction with their spouses in addition women are more likely than men to mention dangers of hiv aids when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations according to a 2003 study by eliya zulu and gloria although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about hiv aids education levels do not significantly impact likelihood that couples will discuss hiv related prevention strategies economic impact thumb 190px farmers with composting materials in malawi a 2002 study conducted by care international across three districts in central region of malawi considers how hiv aids has affected economic well being in rural malawi when skilled laborers are infected with hiv they are usually unable to work therefore they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor intensive crops sacrificing opportunity to grow more profitable labor intensive crops such as tobacco when family members fall ill with hiv aids their relatives invest time in their treatment and care further reducing household productivity in addition when family members are infected with hiv households often use money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses further decreasing economic stability at household level finally when adults contract hiv their children often remain home from school to work in fields threatening long term productivity and economic advancement in malawi care international proposes several strategies that might reduce destructive economic impact of hiv aids on rural households they recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by hiv aids to continue supporting themselves through agriculture women in patrilineal villages are often unable to support themselves and their children when their husbands die of hiv aids therefore helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at household and community levels care international recommends increasing cooperation at community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by hiv aids epidemic finally care international highlights importance of increasing access to information about hiv aids in malawi to help families prepare for and cope with economic burdens associated with epidemic impact on health services hiv aids epidemic in malawi has been characterized by drastic declines in number of health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services more than half of all hospital admissions in malawi are related to hiv aids however malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources only 159 doctors were practicing in malawi in 2007 world health organization s essential health package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in country but vast majority of malawi s health facilities fail to meet this standard while migration to more developed countries in search of better opportunities also known as brain drain is partially responsible for shortage of health care workers in malawi many health care workers have been personally affected by hiv aids epidemic in fact an average of 48 nurses die of hiv aids in malawi every year hiv aids epidemic has resulted in high levels of absenteeism among health workers in malawi who often leave work to spend time with hiv positive friends or relatives and malawian government has failed to respond to declining number of full time employees working in health sector health workers who are not chronically absent frequently abandon their jobs because they are unable to cope with heavy patient loads or because they are afraid that working in a medical environment will increase their risk of becoming infected with hiv malawi has adopted task shifting strategies to overcome shortage of workers available for hiv aids treatment and care task shifting which has been successful in many other regions involves training less specialized health workers to perform health related tasks that do not require professional training such as initiation of antiretroviral therapy for example at thyolo district hospital health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting after completing this course they are legally under ministry of health guidelines allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy another form of task shifting involves training health oriented counselors in hiv testing and counseling which relieves nurses of this additional task interventions malawi has taken many steps towards slowing spread of hiv aids such as increasing access to condoms and improving testing services and treatment options many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including world bank global fund world health organization president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar and joint united nations programme on hiv and aids unaids world bank has lent 407 9 million to malawi global fund has agreed to give 390 million and pepfar has donated 25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns antiretroviral therapy number of people using antiretroviral therapy in malawi has increased dramatically in past decade between 2004 and 2011 an estimated 300 000 people gained access to antiretroviral treatment in addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy in 2008 malawi introduced world health organization s treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy which improved quality of treatment available to malawians however malawi s proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011 which would have cost 105 million per year was rejected by global fund threatening malawi s ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment in 2000 malawi s ministry of health and population began developing a plan to distribute antiretroviral drugs to population and as of 2003 there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in malawi lighthouse a trust in lilongwe that fights hiv aids provides antiretroviral drugs at a cost of 2 500 kwacha per month queen elizabeth central hospital in blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department and medecins sans frontieres distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in chiradzulu and thyolo districts many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs particularly in cities however very few patients can afford to receive drugs from private sector in malawi in addition private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs and therefore this practice is not closely monitored finally some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through health insurance policies provided by their employers but this practice is not widespread due to advent of antiretroviral drugs hiv aids has become a manageable disease for people who can access and afford treatment however antiretroviral therapy remains largely unaffordable and inaccessible to most people in malawi for example south east region of malawi has disproportionately low access to antiretroviral drugs in many rural areas poor health infrastructure combined with widespread famine have made sustained high quality antiretroviral therapy difficult or impossible in addition donations from global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria were used to fund antiretroviral therapy programs that distributed medication on a first come first served basis making drugs more accessible to male urban educated population because there are no explicit policies regarding fair distribution of antiretroviral drugs in malawi individual health care workers often become responsible for deciding who will receive treatment which inevitably leads to inequitable distribution condom distribution although condoms effectively prevent sexual transmission of hiv several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in malawi people living in non urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms and condoms are not typically available at bars and other social locations where they could have a significant impact on hiv prevention many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent transmission of hiv however despite these factors many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about hiv aids epidemic have increased non governmental organizations such as population services international malawi an organization that strives to improve health of malawians and banja la mtsogolo an organization that distributes information and resources related to family planning have conducted campaigns advertising condom use as an effective form of protection against hiv aids banja la mtsogolo provides condoms to both men and women and has significantly improved availability of condoms for women in particular because of efforts by population services international banja la mtsogolo and many other organizations condoms have become more widely available to many people in malawi voluntary counseling and testing people living in areas with high rates of hiv aids face several psychological barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for hiv for example people may prefer not to know if they are hiv positive because due to obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs many view hiv aids diagnoses as death sentences others may simply believe that they are hiv negative either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about prevalence of disease however despite these barriers both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in malawi recently 1 392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011 certain non governmental organization such as malawi aids counseling and resource organisation macro provide door to door counseling and testing services which have drastically improved accessibility of hiv testing see also sub saharan
