inaccessible island rail atlantisia rogersi is a small bird of rail family rallidae it is only species in genus atlantisia endemic to inaccessible island in tristan archipelago in isolated south atlantic it is smallest extant flightless bird in world species was described by physician percy lowe in 1923 but had first come to attention of scientists 50 years earlier inaccessible island rail s affinities were a long standing mystery in 2018 its closest relative was identified as south american dot winged crake both of which are nested within genus laterallus a small species inaccessible island rail has brown plumage black bill and feet and adults have a red eye it occupies most habitats on inaccessible island from beaches to central plateau feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and also some plant matter pairs are territorial and monogamous with both parents being responsible for incubating eggs and raising chicks its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates small clutch sizes and flightlessness unlike many other oceanic islands inaccessible island has remained free from introduced predators allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds particularly flightless rails have gone extinct species is nevertheless considered vulnerable by international union for conservation of nature iucn due to its single small population which would be threatened by accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats discovery although inaccessible island rail may have been known to tristan islanders who visited island annually to hunt seals species first came to attention of scientists during challenger expedition of 1872 1876 when expedition visited island in october 1873 sir charles wyville thomson learned of species and recorded observations made by two german brothers who had been living on island for last two years thomson was unable to collect a specimen much to his regret another attempt was made to collect a specimen by lord crawford on his yacht valhalla in 1905 a final attempt was made during shackleton rowett expedition which passed by in april 1922 on its way back to britain this visit also failed but members of expedition left collecting material with a rev h m c rogers then chaplain on tristan da cunha following year two study skins arrived in natural history museum london followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits physician percy lowe was then able to use skins to describe species he did so briefly at a meeting of british ornithologists club in 1923 evolution and taxonomy thumb alt a small black rail stands upright in front of grasses inaccessible island rail prior to its collection it had been assumed by thomson that species was close to other island hens known in atlantic possibly a gallinule but on examination lowe felt compelled to refer it to a new genus lowe 1928 p 103 generic name atlantisia was named for mythical island of atlantis destroyed by a volcano specific name rogersi honours rev rogers who collected and sent first specimens of species to lowe in his 1928 paper on species lowe thought inaccessible island rail was descendant of flightless ancestors which had reached inaccessible island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as lemuria land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before development and acceptance of plate tectonics by 1955 it was understood that rail was descendant of ancestors that had flown to inaccessible island it was also presumed that like most other land birds of tristan archipelago except tristan moorhen gallinula and gough moorhen g it had probably reached island from ancestors in south america position of inaccessible island rail in larger rail family rallidae has long been a source of uncertainty lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of africa or perhaps an early offshoot of genus porphyrio swamphens a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage he did concede that it was difficult to assign rail to any relatives american paleontologist storrs olson suggested in 1973 that it was related to rallus assemblage which included genera rallus and now lumped with gallirallus based on structure of skeleton in particular he suggested it was part of a pro rallus group that included indian ocean genus dryolimnas and australasian olson suggested pro rallus rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in africa and south america where ancestors of inaccessible island rail came from most recent comparative morphological study to include genus in 1998 placed it in a subtribe of crakes its exact position could not be determined but it was suggested to perhaps be sister taxon to genus laterallus a genus of small crakes found mostly in south america two extinct flightless species of rail were at one time placed in genus atlantisia with inaccessible island rail ascension crake mundia and saint helena swamphen aphanocrex podarces were once considered congeners of a rogersi ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist peter mundy in 1656 saint helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 and has never been encountered alive by scientists in 1973 olson synonymised genus aphanocrex with genus atlantisia and described ascension crake as being congeneric today they are considered to have evolved independently with a podarces probably not even being closely related and in 2003 genus mundia was erected and saint helena swamphen moved back to aphanocrex leaving inaccessible island rail only species in genus atlantisia both ascension crake and saint helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species mainly cats and rats et al 2018 resolved taxonomic affinity and evolutionary history of inaccessible island rail by phylogenetic analyses of dna sequence of its full mitochondrial genome and a handful mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers according to this study inaccessible island rail belongs to a clade comprising its sister species dot winged crake black rail laterallus jamaicensis in america and most likely galapagos crake laterallus therefore suggested referring inaccessible island rail to genus laterallus it colonized inaccessible island from south america c 1 5 million years ago morphology thumb alt a small black rail is held in a hand with a small round wing displayed inaccessible island rail showing small flightless wings inaccessible island rail is smallest living flightless bird in world measuring males are larger and heavier than females weighing average compared to average in females it is dark chestnut brown above and dark grey on head and below with degraded white barring on flanks and belly and adults have a red eye female is similar to male but with paler grey and a faint brown wash on underparts it has a black bill which is shorter than head feathers of inaccessible island rail are almost hair like and in particular flight feathers are degenerate as barbules on many of feathers but not all as has sometimes been reported fail to interlock giving feathers a ragged appearance wings are reduced and weak and smaller than same sized flying relatives as is sternum tail is short in length and and are nearly as long as tail inaccessible island rail has a low basal metabolic rate bmr measured in 1989 at around 60 68 rate expected for a bird of its weight scientists responsible for study speculated that low bmr was not as a result of flightlessness which does not have this effect in other bird species but was instead result of rail s island lifestyle island lacks predators and other competitors and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails this in turn would favour energy conservation by rails resulting in small body size low bmr and flightlessness a comparison of flighted and flightless rails including inaccessible island rail found that rails that lose ability to fly also have low distribution and habitat thumb alt steep green cliffs with a small shoreline with low vegetation tussock grass lowlands and steep cliffs from shore of inaccessible island inaccessible rail is endemic to uninhabited inaccessible island in tristan da cunha group in mid atlantic ocean island is in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds rail is found in almost all habitats on island and at all altitudes from sea level to it reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass spartina with 10 birds per hectare and in tussock grass mixed with ferns blechnum penna marina and sedges with 15 birds per hectare this habitat is found close to shore and surrounds most of island on steep cliffs inaccessible island rail can also be found in upland fern bush heath dominated by wind stunted tree ferns blechnum palmiforme and in island forest in central plateau which is dominated by island cape myrtle arborea which can reach where sheltered and blechnum palmiforme in both these habitats population is estimated to be two birds per hectare it will also forage among boulders on beaches but has not been found in short dry grasses on cinder cones scientists making observations cautioned that this does not mean that they never use habitat it frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed behaviour inaccessible island rail is territorial and territories they defend are tiny territories in tussock grass habitats around hall where population densities are highest extend to small size of territories makes encounters between families and individuals frequent and confrontations and territorial calling are common on meeting confrontations start with loud trills or twittering then birds may face off standing very close to each other and displaying ritually with their heads lowered and their bills pointed towards ground they may circle and continue displaying until one bird slowly retreats or a quick skirmish ensues and one bird is driven off diet and feeding thumb alt small dark rail hidden by shadows behind grass inaccessible island rails forage under tussock grass foraging method used by inaccessible island rail is slow and deliberate and has been compared to that of a mouse and bird occupies a similar ecological niche they feed on a range of invertebrates including earthworms amphipods isopods mites and a range of insects such as beetles flies moths and caterpillars centipedes are taken as well and an introduced species of centipede forms an important part of their diet along with animal prey they will take berries of and as well as seeds of dock rumex unlike tristan thrush they do not feed on carrion or dead fish calls inaccessible island rail is a highly vocal species calling frequently this may be because of dense vegetation species lives in making calls best way to communicate and pairs and families frequently while feeding calls used include a long trill used when pairs meet and when confronting a rival rivals also make a long twitter which can be long and short and end in a after skirmishes between rivals victorious bird may make a weechup weechup call birds may make a monotonous tchik tchik tchik while hunting for prey and alarm call when predators are around is a short and hard chip they also make a variety of trilling calls while incubating particularly when pairs swap places during incubation before changing places incubating bird may make a chip chip chip but they fall silent when tristan thrushes approach nest breeding thumb left alt dark rail standing on old fishing nets hidden by grass inaccessible island rails often nest in tussock grass inaccessible island rail is a seasonal breeder laying between october and january they are monogamous forming permanent pair bonds nests are situated at base of ferns with tussock grass tussock grass clumps or in tufts of sedges nests are domed and oval or pear shaped with entrances near narrow end of nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away nests are typically built entirely of same material nest is found in for example tussock grass or sedges where construction material is tussock grass larger leaves are used on outside and finer material lines nest there are a few reports of other material being used as lining such as leaves of introduced domestica apple or salix willow clutch size is two eggs which is low for such small rails eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown rufous spots and lavender mauve spots that are concentrated around apex of egg they are large for size of mother compared to other rails and resemble eggs of corn crake incubation period for species is not known but both sexes incubate clutch although males incubated for longer in observations that have been made both sexes bring food to their partner that is incubating which is either consumed on nest or close to nest of incubation details are preceded by chip chip chip calls which become louder and more frequent longer its takes partner to respond eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 hours of each other and can be preceded by chick in egg calling for up to 45 hours before hatching one hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage legs feet and bill are black and mouth is silvery ecology thumb alt a small thrush stands on a beach with a party of researchers landing on boats behind tristan thrushes prey on rail chicks lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that in absence of mammalian predators on island brown skua would be inaccessible island rail s only predator a study of diet of brown skuas on inaccessible island confirmed this but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species rail and other landbirds formed only a small part of diet of that seabird especially compared to their abundance on island they noted that landbirds alarm called when brown skuas were seen after hearing another rail make an alarm call adult inaccessible island rails become alert while chicks fall silent adults are rarely preyed upon but mortality of chicks is high and predation by tristan thrushes is a major cause of death two species of chewing lice have been found on inaccessible island rails scopulacorne and zumpti r zumpti has not been described on any other species of bird from inaccessible island p scopulacorne found on inaccessible island rail were originally described as a new species p 1951 but were later lumped into widespread species in 1974 threats and conservation alt a museum skin of a small dark rail lies on a table with a label attached thumb a study skin of inaccessible island rail inaccessible island rail has a tiny global range with a single population though still common within its tiny range with around 5 600 adult birds in world species is considered to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach inaccessible island insular rails particularly flightless species are vulnerable to extinction house mice feral cats and brown rats all of which would be a serious threat to this species are not present on island nor have they ever been but are present on nearby tristan da cunha and could reach islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting island mice have been found on boats visiting neighbouring nightingale island because of this vulnerability this species is rated as vulnerable by iucn red list fires of tussock grass which were recorded in 1872 and 1909 are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails but have not occurred since in 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections but permits to do so were rarely granted several conservation measures have been undertaken or proposed to protect this species inaccessible island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for tristan islanders which would have reduced habitat and risked introduction of invasive species however island was declared a nature reserve by tristan da cunha island council in 1994 access to island is restricted now although tristan islanders are still permitted to visit island to collect firewood and guano introduced new zealand flax has been removed from island and island now has a management plan other suggestions for securing this species future include increased education on biosecurity for local community and potentially setting up a captive population it has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands for example nightingale island in case predators reached inaccessible island but this may have negative impacts on endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands references external links inaccessible island rail
