zooropa is eighth studio album by irish rock band u2 produced by flood brian eno and edge it was released on 5 july 1993 on island records inspired by band s experiences on zoo tv tour zooropa expanded on many of tour s themes of technology and media oversaturation record was a continuation of group s experimentation with alternative rock electronic dance music and electronic sound effects that began with their previous album achtung baby in 1991 u2 began writing and recording zooropa in dublin in february 1993 during a six month break between legs of zoo tv tour record was originally intended as an ep to promote zooropa leg of tour that was to begin in may 1993 but during sessions group decided to extend record to a full length album pressed for time u2 wrote and recorded at a rapid pace with songs originating from many sources including leftover material from achtung baby sessions album was not completed in time for tour s resumption forcing band to travel between dublin and their tour destinations in may to complete mixing and recording zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics despite none of its three singles numb lemon and stay faraway so close being hits consistently across regions record sold well upon release and peaked at number one in multiple countries album s charting duration and lifetime sales of 7 million copies however were less than those of achtung baby in 1994 zooropa won grammy award for best alternative music album although record was a success and music journalists view it as one of group s most creative works band regard it with mixed feelings background thumb left alt an elaborate concert stage set bearing a logo that reads zoo tv set in a dark stadium towers reach into night sky illuminated in blue with red warning lights on top zooropa was inspired by life on multimedia intensive zoo tv tour u2 regained critical favour with their commercially successful 1991 album achtung baby and supporting zoo tv tour in 1992 record was a musical reinvention for group incorporating influences from alternative rock industrial music and electronic dance music into their sound tour was an elaborately staged multimedia event that satirised television and viewing public s over stimulation by attempting to instill sensory overload in its audience band finished 1992 with one of their most successful years selling 2 9 million concert tickets and reaching 10 million copies sold for achtung baby flanagan 1996 p 133 their 73 north american concerts from year grossed us 67 million easily highest amount for any touring artist in 1992 group concluded north american outside broadcast leg of tour on 25 november 1992 leaving them with a six month break before tour resumed in europe in may 1993 with zooropa leg mccormick 2006 p 247 rather than use time to rest lead vocalist bono and guitarist edge were keen to record new material following a hectic year of touring two did not want to settle back into domestic life bono said we thought we could live a normal life and then go back on road in may 1993 but it turns out that your whole way of thinking your whole body has been geared toward madness of zoo tv so we decided to put madness on a record everybody s head was spinning so we thought why not keep that momentum going edge also wished to distract himself from emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during achtung baby sessions in 1991 other members bassist adam clayton and drummer larry mullen jr ultimately agreed to join them for recording flanagan 1996 p 183 recording and production after handling audio engineering for recording of achtung baby robbie adams was invited by u2 to manage sound mixing on zoo tv tour adams also recorded group s tour soundchecks in january 1993 band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops of interesting parts that they could play to in studio after adams spent a few weeks assembling loops group entered factory in dublin that february to begin composing rough demos mcgee 2008 p 158 bono and edge were most involved during this initial demoing process which lasted six weeks thumb right alt a headshot of brian eno zooropa was co produced by brian eno pictured in 2008 producer of 3 previous u2 albums group employed brian eno and his assisting partner mark flood ellis both of whom worked on achtung baby to produce sessions long time eno collaborator daniel lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable graham 2004 p 51 similar to achtung baby sessions eno worked two week shifts group often gave him in progress songs to adjust and to which he could add his own personality initially band did not have a clear plan for how they would release material being written at time clayton said i don t know if what we re doing here is next u2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into demos for next u2 album edge was a proponent of making an ep of new material to promote upcoming leg of tour describing his mentality as thus we ve got a bit of time off we ve got some ideas hanging around from last record let s do an ep maybe four new songs to spice next phase of tour up a bit it ll be a fan thing it ll be cool soon after sessions commenced bono pushed for band to work towards a full length album edge was initially hesitant but saw opportunity as a challenge to quickly record an album before returning to tour and prove band had not become spoiled by luxury of ample recording time additionally bono and band manager paul mcguinness had discussed possibility of releasing a one two punch of records since beginning of achtung baby sessions in early march u2 reached a consensus to work towards a full length album mcgee 2008 p 159 much like they had for achtung baby sessions band split work between two studios at once adams operated a mixing console at factory while flood used an ssl console at newly relocated windmill lane studios due to time limit u2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace they continued their long time practice of jamming in studio eno and flood edited together song sections they liked and then discussed arrangements with group u2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies before performing to edited arrangements eno used an whiteboard to give instructions and cues to band while they jammed he pointed at chords and various commands such as hold stop change and change back to direct their performances flanagan 1996 pp 183 190 to record all of band s material and test different arrangements engineers utilised a technique they called which allowed them to achieve more than 48 tracks of audio by using a 24 track analogue recording a dat machine and a production crew faced issues with audio spill at factory as all group members recorded in same room as mixing desk and bono frequently sang in progress lyrics that would need to be replaced gobos and wood booths were built to separate performers sounds as much as possible songs originated from and were inspired by a variety of sources zooropa was result of combining two separate pieces of music together one of which band discovered while reviewing recordings of tour soundchecks verse melody to stay faraway so close and an instrumental backing track that became numb were originally from achtung baby sessions babyface dirty day lemon and wanderer were written during zooropa sessions country singer johnny cash recorded vocals for wanderer during a visit to dublin and although bono recorded his own vocals for song he preferred cash s version production crew and band debated which version to include on record flanagan 1996 pp 223 224 throughout sessions u2 were undecided on a unifying musical style for release and as a result they maintained three potential track listings one for best songs one for vibes and one for a soundtrack album bono suggested editing best segments of songs together to create a montage flanagan 1996 p 195 as may s zooropa tour leg approached u2 continued to record while simultaneously rehearsing for tour their time limit prevented them from working on live arrangements for any of new songs flanagan 1996 pp 227 228 despite sessions rapid pace album was not completed by time they had to resume touring moreover flood and eno had to begin work on other projects edge remembers everyone was telling group well it s an ep you did good but there s a lot more work needed to finish some of these songs however band did not want to shelve project as they believed they were on a creative roll and that they would be in a completely different frame of mind if they revisited material six months later group s solution was to fly back and forth between dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off days clayton called process about craziest thing you could do to yourself while mullen said of it it was mad but it was mad good as opposed to mad bad mcguinness later said band had nearly wrecked themselves in process group simultaneously used three separate rooms at windmill lane to mix overdub and edit adams said hectic approach meant there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing flood called period one of absolute lunacy stokes 2005 p 116 eschewing console automation engineers adopted a live performance attitude to mixing based on past experiences with lanois band and production crew sat in on mixing and offered encouragement creating as adams put it a kind of cheerleader thing it all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure and gives whole thing a performance feel recording concluded on 14 may 1993 in final weeks band decided to exclude traditional rock songs and guitar driven tracks they had written in favour of an album of disjointed experimental pop edge received a production credit his first on a u2 record for extra level of responsibility he assumed for album flanagan 1996 p 230 twenty songs were recorded during sessions but ultimately 10 were chosen for final track listing one piece that was left off record was in cold blood which featured somber lyrics written by bono in response to bosnian war and was previewed prior to album s release flanagan 1996 pp 201 203 other tracks that were left off album included hold me thrill me kiss me kill me if god will send his angels if you wear that velvet dress and wake up dead man first was later released as a single from batman forever soundtrack in 1995 and latter three were included on band s following studio album pop in 1997 composition music with an even more european musical aesthetic than achtung baby zooropa is a further departure from group s rootsy sound of late 1980s much like how group embraced technology for zoo tv tour they utilized technology as a musical resource to a greater extent on zooropa record exhibits additional influences from alternative rock electronic dance music and industrial music it is more synthesised than u2 s past work featuring various sound effects audio loops and use of synthesisers in addition to edge playing synthesiser brian eno received credit for instrument on six tracks edge s guitar playing on zooropa marks a further shift away from his trademark style highlighted by a heavier reliance on guitar effects and songs reduced emphasis on his guitar parts danceable lemon called a space age german disco by stephen thomas erlewine features a gated guitar part distorted daddy s gonna pay for your crashed car was described by bono as industrial blues instrumentation of closing song wanderer consists primarily of a synthesised bassline and was described by group as resembling ultimate holiday inn band from hell song was sequenced as final track because u2 wanted to end album on a musical joke similar to how zoo tv tour display screens sampled video footage from television programming a number of songs from zooropa sample audio introduction to title track zooropa contains a noisy collage of indecipherable human voices from radio signals credited to advertising world played over sustained synthesiser chords industrial influenced numb features a noisy backdrop of sampled rhythmic noises including arcade sounds a walkman rewinding and a hitler youth boy banging a bass drum in 1935 propaganda film triumph of will daddy s gonna pay for your crashed car begins with a snippet of fanfare from lenin s favourite songs and samples mc 900 ft jesus song city sleeps stokes 2005 p 118 vocals on zooropa are a further departure from u2 s previous style as jon pareles described bono underplays his lung power throughout record in contrast to his impassioned belting vocals from past work additionally in songs such as lemon and numb bono sings in an operatic falsetto he calls fat lady voice two tracks feature other people on lead vocals for numb edge provides lead vocals in form of a droning monotonous list of don t commands for wanderer country musician johnny cash sings lead vocals juxtaposing electronic nature of song with his haggard voice stokes 2005 p 122 lyrics bono is credited as sole lyricist for eight of ten songs while edge received sole credit for numb duo share credits for lyrics to dirty day technology is a common theme on zooropa inspired by group s experiences on zoo tv tour jon pareles wrote that songs are about how media messages infect characters souls while music journalist david browne said songs are concerned with emotional fracturing in techno age critic robert hilburn interpreted album as u2 probing into what they saw as disillusionment of modern age zooropa is set amongst neon signs of a brightly lit futuristic city stokes 2005 pp 111 112 in song s introduction background voices ask what do you want in response to question lyrics in first three verses consist of various advertising slogans including better by design be all that you can be and durch technik critic parry gettelman interpreted these lines as meaning to signify emptiness of modern godless life in song s second half theme of moral confusion and uncertainty is introduced particularly in lines i have no compass and i have no map mccormick 2006 p 249 babyface is about a man practicing his obsessive love for a celebrity by manipulating her image on a tv recording lemon inspired by an old video of bono s late mother in a lemon coloured dress describes man s attempts to preserve time through technology this is reflected in lines such as a man makes a picture a moving picture through light projected he can see himself up close lyrics to numb are a series of don t commands amidst a noisy backdrop of sounds edge notes that song was inspired by one of themes of zoo tv that sense that you were getting bombarded with so much that you actually were finding yourself shutting down and unable to respond because there was so much imagery and information being thrown at you mccormick 2006 p 248 in contrast to technology inspired lyrics of many songs others had more domestic themes first time was bono s interpretation of story of prodigal son stokes 2005 p 120 but in his version son decides not to return home similarly dirty day was written about a character who abandons his family and returns years later to meet his son many of track s lyrics are taken from phrases that bono s father commonly used such as no blood is thicker than ink and it won t last kissing time stokes 2005 p 121 stay faraway so close is a love song written for an abused woman bono based his lyrics to wanderer on old testament s book of ecclesiastes and he modeled song s character after book s narrator preacher in song narrator wanders through a post apocalyptic world in search of experience sampling all facets of human culture and hoping to find meaning in life stockman 2005 p 115 bono described song as an antidote to zooropa manifesto of uncertainty and he believes it presents a possible solution to uncertainty expressed earlier on album packaging and title sleeve was designed by works associates of dublin under direction of steve averill who had created majority of u2 s album covers brian williams was graphic designer and created digital images and layout inspired by zoo tv tour s highly charged electronic tv images in all of their saturated colours and fizz works associates conceived a kind of electronic flag for zooropa cover features a sketch of circle of stars from flag of europe with an drawing in center de la parra 2003 pp 160 161 illustration created by shaughn mcgrath was an alteration of graffiti babyface by charlie whisker that was originally on face of achtung baby compact disc vinyl record cover s drawing was meant to represent an urban legend of a soviet cosmonaut supposedly left floating in orbit for weeks after collapse of soviet union flanagan 1996 p 265 in background is a montage of blurred images similar to arrangement of images on achtung babys sleeve cogan 2008 p 191 images include shots of a woman s face and mouth as well as photographs of european leaders including vladimir lenin benito mussolini and nicolae ceausescu these images are obscured by distorted purple text comprising names of songs planned for record that were provided to works associates during sleeve design process however album s track listing was eventually changed and titles of several songs withheld from album were accidentally left in cover image songs include wake up dead man hold me thrill me kiss me kill me and if you wear that velvet dress author cogan described this text as giving impression of a torn veil zooropa was named for zooropa leg of zoo tv tour which began in may 1993 while band completed record name is a portmanteau of zoo from zoo tv tour and zoo station and europa during album s production one of proposed titles was squeaky release zooropa completed u2 s contractual obligation to island records and to polygram flanagan 1996 pp 232 233 239 multinational that purchased island in 1989 although group were free to sign a new contract elsewhere their strong relationship with label and its founder chris blackwell prompted band to remain with island polygram by signing a long term six album deal in june 1993 los angeles times estimated that deal was worth us 60 million to u2 making them highest paid rock group ever mcgee 2008 pp 161 162 at time group were cognizant of several emerging technologies that would potentially impact delivery and transmission of music to consumers in following years author bill flanagan speculated record stores could become obsolete as music is delivered over cable telephone wires or satellite transmissions directly into consumers homes with uncertainty over future of these technologies and implications of entertainment and telecommunications companies merging band negotiated with island that division of their earnings from future transmission systems would be flexible and decided upon at a relevant time u2 toyed with idea of releasing zooropa as an interactive audio video presentation in lieu of conventional physical formats but deadline imposed by zoo tv tour prevented band from realising this idea flanagan 1996 pp 235 237 u2 s delivery of zooropa in late may caught polygram somewhat off guard because they were not expecting a new album by group for several years with achtung baby polygram had approximately six months to market record and plan its release strategy but sudden completion of zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan polygram president ceo rick explained for last one we prepared for six months it was like a marathon but this is like a sprint and that is spirit it was made in band was so excited about it they sprinted to complete album before tour we want to bring it to street with that same spirit island polygram s and u2 s marketing for zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on record as a whole and ultimately only three singles were released compared to achtung babys five singles first single numb was released in june 1993 exclusively on vhs as a video single music video was directed by kevin godley flanagan 1996 p 254 song peaked at number seven in australia and number nine in canada while reaching number two on us billboard modern rock tracks chart however it failed to chart on singles charts in uk or us zooropa was released on 5 july 1993 during zooropa leg of zoo tv tour an initial shipment of 1 6 million copies was made available in stores at time of release

critical reception zooropa received generally favourable reviews from critics anthony decurtis of rolling stone wrote in his four star review that album was a daring imaginative coda to achtung baby and that it is varied and vigorously experimental but its charged mood of giddy anarchy suffused with barely suppressed dread provides a compelling unifying thread spin wrote a positive review commenting that record sounds mostly like a band shedding its skin trying on different selves for size review said album has feel of real collectivity praising cohesiveness of individual band members playing review concluded by saying zooropa indicates u2 might be worthy of whatever absurd mutations 90s throw our way jon pareles of new york times praised group for transforming themselves and becoming raucous playful and ready to kick its old habits pareles enjoyed sonics and electronic effects that made sound of a straightforward four man band hard to find and he commented that new songs seem destined not for stadiums but for late night radio shows and private listenings through earphones orlando sentinel gave record a rating of three out of five stars commenting although u2 leans heavily on electronic sound of contemporary dance music rhythm tracks on zooropa are less than propulsive review said that eno s production and electronic flourishes made album interesting but that ultimately there s nothing especially hummable and songs are not very memorable david browne of entertainment weekly gave zooropa an a calling it harried spontaneous sounding and ultimately exhilarating album browne judged it to sound messy and disconnected but clarified that sense of incoherence is point in context of record s technology themes he concluded for an album that wasn t meant to be an album it s quite an album robert hilburn of los angeles times gave record a maximum score of four stars in two separate articles he said that it captured anxious even paranoid tone of zoo tv tour so much so that it stands as first tour album that doesn t include any of songs from tour and yet sounds like a souvenir of zoo tv in a positive review jim sullivan of boston globe called album a creative stretch noting that band experimented more yet retained their recognizable sound he commented that group s yearning anthemic reach and obvious slinky pop charm were replaced with darker corners more disruptive interjections more moodiness paul du noyer of q gave zooropa a score of four out of five stars finding a freewheeling feel of going with flow throughout album and calling it rootless and loose restless and unsettled for du noyer u2 sounded monstrously tight as a performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers so results transcend merely experimental a review from new zealand herald was more critical saying that album started as an ep and just got longer but not necessarily better publication called it more perplexing than challenging and commented that it sounds like biggest band in world having one of biggest strangest mid life crises jim derogatis of chicago sun times gave record a three and a half star review calling it inconsistent but admitting it s satisfying and surprising to hear a band of u2 s status being so playful experimental and downright weird robert christgau gave album a b calling it half an eno album in same manner that david bowie s eno produced albums low and heroes were but saying difference is that bowie and eno were fresher in 1977 than bono and eno are today irish media were more critical in their reviews of album george byrne of irish independent said songs sound like they were knocked up in double quick time and with about as much thought put into lyrics as goes into a dj s byrne remarked that record resembles a lot of mickey taking over a variety of drum patterns mcgee 2008 p 163 in a retrospective four star review stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic stated that most of record is far more daring than its predecessor for him although there were moments that album was unfocused and meandering best moments of zooropa rank among u2 s most inspired and rewarding music zooropa finished in 9th place on best albums list from village voices 1993 pazz jop critics poll at 36th annual grammy awards it won award for best alternative music album in his acceptance speech bono sarcastically mocked alternative characterisation album received and used a profanity on live television i think i d like to give a message to young people of america and that is we shall continue to abuse our position and fuck up mainstream flanagan 1996 p 498 zoo tv tour thumb alt an elaborate concert stage at night three cars hang at stage s rear shining lights towards performance video screens are located behind and to sides of stage band finished album during zooropa leg of zoo tv tour and began playing new songs later on tour band began zoo tv tour in february 1992 in support of achtung baby in contrast to austere stage setups of previous u2 tours zoo tv was an elaborate multimedia event it satirised television and viewing public s over stimulation by attempting to instill sensory overload in its audience stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects random video clips from pop culture and flashing text phrases live satellite link ups channel surfing crank calls and video confessionals were incorporated into shows zooropa album was released in july 1993 halfway through zooropa leg of tour of 157 shows band played during zoo tv tour approximately 30 of them were after release of zooropa many of album s songs found permanent places in shows set lists lemon and daddy s gonna pay for your crashed car were performed with bono in his macphisto persona during encores of zoomerang leg of tour dirty day was also played on this leg after acoustic set numb was performed with edge playing guitar and on lead vocals with mullen performing backing vocals while drumming zooropa was played only three times and babyface twice more at same shows on zooropa leg but they were cut out of set list after band were displeased with how they sounded live stay faraway so close was performed acoustically for zooropa and zoomerang legs legacy zooropa is certified 2x platinum in us by recording industry association of america 3x platinum in australia platinum in uk and 4x platinum in both new zealand and canada to date it has sold more than 7 million copies bordowitz 2003 p 289 after release of record david bowie praised band writing u2 might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some but i feel that they are one of few rock bands even attempting to hint at a world which will continue past next great wall year 2000 flanagan 1996 p 321 although record was a success in years following its release group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances bono said i thought of zooropa at time as a work of genius i really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our sgt pepper i was a little wrong about that truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down we didn t create hits we didn t quite deliver songs and what would sgt pepper be without pop songs mccormick 2006 pp 249 252 edge said that he did not think songs were potent further stating i never thought of zooropa as anything more than an interlude but a great one as interludes go by far our most interesting clayton said it s an odd record and a favourite of mine neil mccormick wrote about zooropa it feels like a minor work and generally u2 don t do minor but if you re not going to make big statement you re maybe going to come up with something that has oxygen of pop music in 1997 spin wrote zooropa took u2 as far from monastic mysticism of joshua tree as they could go it freed u2 from itself edna gundersen of usa today said in 2002 alien territory of achtung baby and zooropa cemented u2 s relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers in 2011 rolling stone ranked record at number 61 on its list of 100 best albums of nineties track listing note after wanderer fades out a hidden track consisting of a
