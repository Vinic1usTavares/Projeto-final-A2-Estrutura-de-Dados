chorus is repetitive with gaga singing words why did you do that do that do that do that do that to me against a house beat warren clarified that intention was not to write a bad pop song but something that was fun and less serious showing ally s change into a pop artist she added i love that ally defended her music it doesn t have to be what he thinks music should be music can be everything it can be a serious song it can be a pop song it can be a song about an ass blair also defended lyrics in an interview with washington post saying that it was written to specifically portray ally s career taking off and hence it had to be more bubbly and mainstream he felt whatever song jackson would have resented it since he was upset at ally s success and his failing career gaga on other hand was vague about whether why did you do that is a bad song saying when we see her on saturday night live and she s singing a song about why do you look so good in those jeans it s almost antithesis of where we started gaga said that is relatively shallow use in film in a star is born why did you do that is performed by lady gaga s character ally on an alec baldwin hosted episode of saturday night live performance represents ally s transformation from a simple singer songwriter into a full fledged radio pop star cooper s character ally s husband rock musician jackson maine watches her perform it this drives him to start drinking again according to refinery29 jackson s disbelief and disappointment stems from his feeling that ally is selling out later when ally receives a grammy award nomination a drunken jackson berates her for letting go of person he thought she was happiest being ally defends song and they quarrel for dance sequence during song gaga enlisted her long time choreographer richy jackson who choreographed all performances in film singer wanted choreography to be jerky jackson described choreography he created for song as having pop r b style with a 90s feel to it since ally s style and movements are not supposed to be like gaga s jackson created an individual aesthetic for ally as she performs why did you do that and other uptempo songs like heal me and hair body face critical response and analysis after soundtrack was released why did you do that divided critics many reviewers assumed it was purposefully written with trite lyrics to underscore jackson s point of view about pop music compared to his country rock songs critics found jackson s dismissal of pop music to be caused by character s short sightedness and inability to go beyond his own rock music others believed that bad song led character reverting to his rampant alcoholism brittany spanos of rolling stone felt that first time gaga performs song in film it is meant to be jarring on many levels since it is first time audience sees ally as a pop star spanos believes why did you do that presents an argument against pop which inherently feels like an argument against lady gaga herself one of biggest advocates for delectably catchy dance pop ally embodies however she does find song intoxicating and actually pretty great comparing it to gaga s early work from fame 2008 era a vampy flirt with a penchant for a hook you won t forget for years alejandra salazar of refinery29 described track as a campy over top pop track with ridiculous lyrics about texting and praying and also about butts salazar wondered whether song was purposely engineered to be not so good to portray rock music as a more authentic genre in film writing for daily dot gallagher noted that why did you do that was not submitted by warner bros for academy award for best original song although it was popular among fans for its lyrics gallagher listed a number of internet memes based on song hazel of jezebel contends that although shallow and i ll never love again might be oscar bait of cooper s movie why did you do that is a mindless pop song that embodies all that ally has become in movie nate jones of new york magazine characterized why did you do that as song about butts noting how song s opening line had become a central point of discussion of film s portrayal of pop music against rock jones felt general perception about track often boils down to how you feel about it is it terrible is it a bop or is it a terrible song that s also a bop he found a number of ear candy elements in composition which grabbed audience s attention especially after line about buttocks writing for new york times kyle buchanan confessed to having lyrics stuck in his head he added that track can sound shocking initially since it forgoes timelessness of shallow and its ilk in favor of what feels like pop but noted its rising popularity on social media dianne warren noted track has its revenge because it sticks in your brain and then you end up saying why did you do that do that do that credits and personnel management recorded at saturday night live set in nbc
