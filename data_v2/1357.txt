wladyslaw hugo steinhaus january 14 1887 february 25 1972 was a jewish polish mathematician and educator steinhaus obtained his phd under david hilbert at gottingen university in 1911 and later became a professor at jan kazimierz university in lwow now lviv ukraine where he helped establish what later became known as lwow school of mathematics he is credited with discovering mathematician stefan banach with whom he gave a notable contribution to functional analysis through banach steinhaus theorem after world war ii steinhaus played an important part in establishment of mathematics department at wroclaw university and in revival of polish mathematics from destruction of war author of around 170 scientific articles and books steinhaus has left his legacy and contribution in many branches of mathematics such as functional analysis geometry mathematical logic and trigonometry notably he is regarded as one of early founders of game theory and probability theory which led to later development of more comprehensive approaches by other scholars early life and studies steinhaus was born on january 14 1887 in jaslo austria hungary to a family with jewish roots his father boguslaw was a local industrialist owner of a brick factory and a merchant his mother was ewelina nee lipschitz hugo s uncle ignacy steinhaus was a lawyer and an activist in kolo polskie polish circle and a deputy to galician diet regional assembly of kingdom of galicia and lodomeria hugo finished his studies at gymnasium in jaslo in 1905 his family wanted him to become an engineer but he was drawn to abstract mathematics and began to study works of famous contemporary mathematicians on his own in same year he began studying philosophy and mathematics at university of lemberg in 1906 he transferred to gottingen university at that university he received his ph d in 1911 having written his doctoral dissertation under supervision of david hilbert title of his thesis was neue anwendungen des dirichlet schen new applications to dirichlet s principle at start of world war i steinhaus returned to poland and served in jozef pilsudski s polish legion after which he lived in krakow he was an atheist academic career interwar poland during 1916 1917 period and before poland had regained its full independence which occurred in 1918 steinhaus worked in krakow for ministry of interior in ephemeral puppet state of kingdom of poland in 1917 he started to work at university of lemberg later jan kazimierz university in poland and acquired his habilitation qualification in 1920 in 1921 he became a profesor associate professor and in 1925 profesor full professor at same university during this time he taught a course on then cutting edge theory of lebesgue integration one of first such courses offered outside france while in lwow steinhaus co founded lwow school of mathematics and was active in circle of mathematicians associated with scottish cafe although according to stanislaw ulam for circle s gatherings steinhaus would have generally preferred a more upscale tea shop down street world war ii thumb left 200px scottish book from lwow school of mathematics which steinhaus contributed to and probably saved during world war ii in september 1939 after nazi germany and soviet union both invaded and occupied poland as a fulfillment of molotov ribbentrop pact they had signed earlier lwow initially came under soviet occupation steinhaus considered escaping to hungary but ultimately decided to remain in lwow soviets reorganized university to give it a more ukrainian character but they did appoint stefan banach steinhaus s student as dean of mathematics department and steinhaus resumed teaching there faculty of department at school were also strengthened by several polish refugees from german occupied poland according to steinhaus during experience of this period he acquired an insurmountable physical disgust in regard to all sorts of soviet administrators politicians and commissars during interwar period and time of soviet occupation steinhaus contributed ten problems to famous scottish book including last one recorded shortly before lwow was captured by nazis in 1941 during operation barbarossa steinhaus because of his jewish background spent nazi occupation in hiding first among friends in lwow then in small towns of near zamosc and near krakow polish anti nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier by name of grzegorz under this name he taught clandestine classes higher education was forbidden for poles under german occupation worried about possibility of imminent death if captured by germans steinhaus without access to any scholarly material reconstructed from memory and recorded all mathematics he knew in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs of which only a little part has been published also while in hiding and cut off from reliable news on course of war steinhaus devised a statistical means of estimating for himself german casualties at front based on sporadic obituaries published in local press method relied on relative frequency with which obituaries stated that soldier who died was someone s son someone s second son someone s third son and so on according to his student and biographer mark kac steinhaus told him that happiest day of his life were twenty four hours between time that germans left occupied poland and soviets had not yet arrived they had left and they had not yet come after world war ii right thumb 250px commemorative plaque wroclaw poland in last days of world war ii steinhaus still in hiding heard a rumor that university of lwow was to be transferred to city of breslau wroclaw which poland was to acquire as a result of potsdam agreement lwow became part of soviet ukraine although initially he had doubts he turned down offers for faculty positions in lodz and lublin and made his way to city where he began teaching at university of wroclaw while there he revived idea behind scottish book from lwow where prominent and aspiring mathematicians would write down problems of interest along with prizes to be awarded for their solution by starting new scottish book it was also most likely steinhaus who preserved original scottish book from lwow throughout war and subsequently sent it to stanislaw ulam who translated it into english with steinhaus help wroclaw university became renowned for mathematics much as university of lwow had been later in 1960s steinhaus served as a visiting professor at university of notre dame 1961 62 and university of sussex 1966 mathematical contributions steinhaus authored over 170 works unlike his student stefan banach who tended to specialize narrowly in field of functional analysis steinhaus made contributions to a wide range of mathematical sub disciplines including geometry probability theory functional analysis theory of trigonometric and fourier series as well as mathematical logic he also wrote in area of applied mathematics and enthusiastically collaborated with engineers geologists economists physicians biologists and in kac s words even lawyers probably his most notable contribution to functional analysis was 1927 proof of banach steinhaus theorem given along with stefan banach which is now one of fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics his interest in games led him to propose an early formal definition of a strategy anticipating john von neumann s more complete treatment of a few years later consequently he is considered an early founder of modern game theory as a result of his work on infinite games steinhaus together with another of his students jan mycielski proposed axiom of steinhaus was also an early contributor to and co founder of probability theory which at time was in its infancy and not even considered an actual part of mathematics he provided first axiomatic measure theoretic description of coin tossing which was to influence full of probability by russian mathematician andrey kolmogorov a decade later steinhaus was also first to offer precise definitions of what it means for two events to be independent as well as for what it means for a random variable to be uniformly distributed while in hiding during world war ii steinhaus worked on fair cake cutting problem how to divide a heterogeneous resource among several people with different preferences such that every person believes he received a proportional share steinhaus work has initiated modern research of fair cake cutting problem steinhaus was also first person to conjecture ham sandwich theorem and one of first to propose method of k means clustering legacy left thumb 150px honorary doctorate bestowed on steinhaus by poznan university steinhaus is said to have discovered polish mathematician stefan banach in 1916 after he overheard someone utter words lebesgue integral while in a krakow park steinhaus referred to banach as his greatest mathematical discovery together with banach and other participant of park discussion otto nikodym steinhaus started mathematical society of krakow which later evolved into polish mathematical society he was a member of pau polish academy of learning and pan polish academy of sciences polish mathematical society towarzystwo naukowe wroclaw scientific society as well as many international scientific societies and science academies steinhaus also published one of first articles in mathematicae in 1921 he also co founded studia mathematica along with stefan banach 1929 and applications of mathematics 1953 colloquium and mathematical monographs he received honorary doctorate degrees from warsaw university 1958 wroclaw medical academy 1961 poznan university 1963 and wroclaw university 1965 steinhaus had full command of several foreign languages and was known for his aphorisms to point that a booklet of his most famous ones in polish french and latin has been published posthumously in 2002 polish academy of sciences and wroclaw university sponsored 2002 year of hugo steinhaus to celebrate his contributions to polish and world science notable
