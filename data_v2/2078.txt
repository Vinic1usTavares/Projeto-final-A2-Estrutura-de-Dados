antonov an 70 70 is a four engine medium range transport aircraft and first aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines it was developed in late 1980s by antonov design bureau to replace obsolete an 12 military transport aircraft maiden flight of first prototype took place in december 1994 in kiev now independent ukraine within months prototype had suffered a mid air collision a second airframe was produced to allow flight test programme to proceed both prototypes were produced by kiev aircraft production plant following dissolution of soviet union in early 1990s programme became a joint development between russia and ukraine former compounded issue of a reduced market with its intermittent commitment to project repeated attempts to start production have had limited success western european countries including germany at one stage assessed aircraft for procurement but many later decided against it development origins and early testing history origins of an 70 can be traced back to mid 1970s when antonov design bureau began preliminary design work on a successor for an 12 four engine turboprop aircraft soviet armed forces by 1980s were looking for a replacement for an 12 and a complement to ilyushin il 76 four engine jet transporter in 1987 ministry of defence with a new emphasis on air mobility specified an aircraft with a quick loading time ability to operate from short unprepared airfields could carry up to 300 troops and have good operating economy initial contract for work on an 70 was concluded in may 1989 antonov began advanced design work on new aircraft during same year after collapse of soviet union in june 1993 russian and ukrainian governments agreed to jointly develop an 70 with 80 percent of funding expected to come from russia following year twenty companies and organisations from former soviet union agreed to jointly develop market and support aircraft there were plans to establish mass serial production of model at kiev aircraft production plant later renamed as antonov serial production plant which was associated with but separate from antonov design bureau and at samara aircraft production plant later reorganised as aviakor in samara russia at one stage during early development russia was showing reluctance at supporting development of an 70 and so uzbekistan sought unsuccessfully to establish a final assembly plant in capital at tashkent aircraft production plant where production of an 70 s wings and il 76 were taking place construction of first prototype had started in kiev in 1991 maiden flight of aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992 however due to financing and design issues this was pushed back until 1994 in particular weakened national currency diminished firm s ability to pay for aircraft s components especially those sourced from russia and workers salaries in addition engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during final ground checks majority of which were non critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections in end aircraft made its maiden flight on 16 december 1994 thumb first an 70 prototype in november 1994 crewed by a seven man team first aircraft performed a short take off from svyatoshino airfield kiev this was first flight of an aircraft that was powered only by propfans due to worsening weather conditions over antonov s headquarters and flight test area in kiev flight was cut short and flight ceiling was capped at 2 000 m 6 500 ft crew took aircraft to a height of 450 m 1 475 ft while performing basic checkouts of prototype s systems after having been airborne for less than half an hour aircraft landed at antonov s flight test facility at gostomel during flight engineers identified problems with engine gearboxes and so aircraft was grounded for eight weeks while issues were fixed originally aircraft was to conduct flight tests at gostomel for three months before transferring to gromov flight research institute in zhukovsky near moscow however first prototype was lost when it was making its fourth flight on 10 february 1995 during flight aircraft suffered a sudden deviation from its intended flightpath and collided with an 72 chase plane before spiralling into ground erupting into flames test crew of seven were killed although there were initial allegations of technical issues with aircraft it was later determined that crash had been caused by human error antonov subsequently converted static test prototype into a flying prototype equipped with a modified flight control system second airframe was rolled out in december 1996 in kiev before making its first flight on 24 april 1997 from svyatoshino airfield during which aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes according to jane s however aircraft had taken off from gostomel for a 26 minute flight by this time more than us 2 5 billion had been spent on programme with a further 200 million to be spent to prepare aircraft for production which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20 25 aircraft produced annually russian and ukrainian air forces reportedly had long term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft respectively second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 january 2001 in a crash landing after take off western evaluation in early 1990s an 70 was unsuccessfully considered as a platform to meet european staff requirement esr for future large aircraft fla programme programme envisaged development of a transport aircraft that is midway in size and capability between lockheed martin c 130j and mcdonnell douglas c 17 to replace c 130 hercules in october 1997 however german defence minister volker ruhe announced his intention to study whether an 70 could be basis for fla decision arose out of german government s objective of providing industrial aid to and thus enhancing political ties with eastern europe in december 1997 france germany russia and ukraine agreed to evaluate an 70 as a candidate for fla programme antonov proposed a westernised version of an 70 an 7x german government tasked aerospace dasa with responsibility of evaluating an 70 and assessing whether it would fulfill esr for a common tactical airlifter airbus provided data of aircraft to dasa who confirmed data with its own wind tunnel tests according to dasa study from 1999 an 70 fulfilled esr and that westernisation is possible but work in key areas would have been necessary and risks existed areas identified include introduction of full authority digital engine control a completely new cockpit a new flight control system computer addition of in flight refuelling capability as well as modifications to allow paratroopers to be dropped from rear cargo door dasa recommended a change in manufacturing method of carbon fiber reinforced polymer components also fuselage manufacturing method was considered uneconomical german ukrainian and russian companies had formed joint venture airtruck to plan and manage modifications needed to westernise an 70 german government for political reasons preferred an 70 during a separate german ministry of defence evaluation of an 7x aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to a400m designed by military branch of airbus according to airtruck defence ministry estimated an 7x to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival would provide industrial benefits as germany would receive substantial workshare and was deemed to be technically superior due mainly to its new propfan technology however a defence ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached on other hand dasa preferred a400m and refused to be prime contractor for an 70 if it was to be chosen in meantime belgium france italy portugal spain turkey and uk were tentative members of fla programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft russia and ukraine themselves were looking to acquire 210 an 70s other contenders for fla were c 17 and c 130j in april 2000 german government strongest supporter of an 70 stated that it was committed to buying same aircraft as other countries in end a400m was chosen for fla project had an 70 been chosen fifty percent of aircraft would have been manufactured by airbus 2001 incident and later disputes in december 1999 russian government outlined that it planned to purchase 164 aircraft by 2018 ukrainian government in october 2000 estimated that country had a requirement for 65 aircraft by then russian government had awarded polyot plant which was based in omsk right to produce aircraft ahead of aviakor and of samara and ulyanovsk respectively kiev aircraft production plant was expected to produce first aircraft in 2003 and polyot in 2004 as an 70 flight test programme had reached its final stages by end of 2000 it was expected that russian and ukraine defence ministries would approve of mass production at start of 2001 on 27 january 2001 however second an 70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take off during cold weather testing in omsk and was severely damaged four of 33 people on board were injured it looked as though a400m was now going to have market all to itself antonov recovered crashed aircraft and repaired it but project still lacked funding thumb an 70 in flight in january 2002 preparations started on mass production as russian government affirmed that aircraft was in country s nine year military budget by now ukraine had already placed an order for five aircraft despite affirmation that country was committed to project there were other indications that russia had lost considerable interest in an 70 in february 2002 for example defence ministry did not contribute towards an 70 s development costs for period and at same time military experts were withdrawn from test programme following year senior russian air force officials publicly discredited project commander in chief of russian air force general vladimir mikhaylov labelled it as undeveloped and aircraft as dangerous too heavy and too expensive indeed there were rumours that russia would soon abandon project however in may 2003 russian president vladimir putin reassured his ukrainian counterpart that russia was committed to project nevertheless antonov looked elsewhere for an industrial partner in september that year company signed a memorandum of understanding mou with china aviation industry corporation ii that covered possible joint development of transport aircraft russian ambivalence towards an 70 was made evident when russian defence ministry did not allocate any funds in near future towards procurement of aircraft for its air force instead resources were dedicated towards upgraded il 76mf after orange revolution in late 2004 and with ukraine openly aiming for nato membership political will for project evaporated in april 2006 general mikhaylov announced that russia was withdrawing from project although at time there was no official confirmation from russian government itself mikhaylov had reportedly been a staunch opponent of an 70 claiming that d 27 engine was unreliable and had advocated for adoption of il 76mf which was estimated to cost half that of an 70 up until then russia had provided around 60 percent of estimated 5 billion invested in project subsequent development intermittent commitment from russian side plagued project as russia owed programme an outstanding debt for three years through 2009 according to various reports russia s conflict with georgia in august 2008 highlighted need for an airlifter in class of an 70 one that had a spacious cargo bay and ability to operate from unpaved airstrips consequently in august 2009 both countries agreed to resume development of an 70 ukraine continued to pursue flight testing of sole prototype while making upgrades to aircraft s avionics sensors and propulsion system it was reported that ukrainian air force would take delivery of its first two an 70s in 2011 and 2012 volga dnepr airlines had also signed an mou with antonov for five commercial standard an a requirement for 60 an 70s was included in russia s 2011 2020 national armament programme when it was issued in december 2010 in late july 2010 antonov suspended flight test programme to update aircraft after an extensive series of modifications including revised avionics which reduced flight crew from five to four and changes to aircraft s propellers to improve reliability and decrease noise second prototype an 70 flew again on 27 september 2012 and took part in xxi airshow in kiev during same year russian and ukrainian authorities agreed on basic workshare of production programme antonov in kiev would now produce wings tail surfaces and engine nacelles kapo factory in kazan russia would be responsible for manufacture of fuselage final assembly of aircraft and flight testing other major components would come from novosibirsk ulyanovsk and voronezh construction of fuselage of first production aircraft was reportedly complete in december 2012 test programme would last from september 2012 until april 2014 when aircraft passed state acceptance trials during that time an 70 conducted approximately 120 flights totalling 220 hours with much of certification effort carried out by ukrainian specialists and officials this is because despite aircraft s inclusion in russia s state rearmament programme russia had withdrawn from project in november 2012 reportedly due to slow progress a fact that was disclosed only in april 2013 according to a report withdrawal of russia from project was apart from a response to ukrainian government s eu choices result of political manoeuvring by russian government officials with links to ilyushin to pressure government to purchase il 476 a re winged variant of il 76 in total an 70 had conducted some 735 flights and had accumulated 930 hours during state tests as a result of crimean crisis ukrainian government in april 2014 announced that it would halt all military technical cooperation with russia in august 2014 a ukrainian court ordered russian defence ministry to make outstanding payments to antonov in march 2015 russia defence ministry declared that it is ruling out an 70 for state procurement it also declared that as in their opinion ukraine has withdrawn from military and defence agreements signed before crisis between them by completing aircraft without russian involvement it would request return of 2 95 billion rubles that russian government had spent on an 70 project design an 70 is a monoplane with a high mounted wing design that features four distinctive propfan engines designed by progress design bureau each of d 27 engines is rated at 13 800 shp which can be uprated to 16 000 shp which is used to drive sv 27 contra rotating scimitar propellers designed by eight on front propeller and six on aft propeller propfan engines deliver slipstream to supercritical wings that feature double slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds modernisation of aircraft during 2010 12 saw upgrades to engines including incorporation of and further separation of two propellers aircraft s cruise speed is 750 km h 405 kt at an operational altitude of antonov claimed in 1997 that aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850 km h 460 kt or mach 0 8 which would have compared favourably with mach 0 77 of larger turbofan powered c 17 according to dasa s evaluation propfan engines were 10 percent more efficient than conventional turboprops thumbnail left d 27 propfan similar to many aircraft designs of soviet union an 70 was designed as an airlifter that could operate from unprepared fields in short take off and landing stol configuration aircraft could lift off from a dirt strip with of cargo and fly for alternatively it could fly same distance with of cargo if it took off from a paved runway for a payload heavy mission an 70 can haul of cargo for a range of but if range was essential aircraft can carry a load of over in exceptional circumstances an 70 subjected to lower g take offs can airlift a t main battle tank and fly it for fully pressurised internal cabin measures wide and high and has a length of from front to ramp with ramp included total cabin length is in comparison turbofan powered il 76 has a lower cross sectional cargo area but exceeds an 70 in payload capability and ramp length an 70 s cargo hold is serviced by four electrical hoists that facilitate autonomous cargo loading a central floor can be rapidly installed for accommodation of 300 soldiers or 200 injured personnel over two decks similar to an 124 an 70 design makes extensive use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance approximately 25 percent of airframe is made of carbon fibre composites which are primarily used on control surfaces and tail assembly while aluminium and steel alloys are used for rest of structure an 70 has a designed life of 45 000 hours over 15 000 flights prototypes had a fly by wire flight control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels it was expected that production aircraft would have a four channel digital fly by wire system aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to pilot and co pilot via six large multi function crt displays with secondary electro mechanical instruments and head up displays a flight engineer position is also present on prototypes variants thumb right proposed an 112kc variant an 70t a version of an 70 sans suffix adopted for civilian market an 70t 100 a proposed lighter version of an 70t with two d
