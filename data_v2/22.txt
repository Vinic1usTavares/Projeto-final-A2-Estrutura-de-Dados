thumb right a 17th century icelandic manuscript depicting ratatoskr although unexplained in manuscript and not otherwise attested in this image ratatoskr bears a horn or tusk in norse mythology ratatoskr old norse generally considered to mean drill tooth orchard 1997 129 simek 2007 261 and byock 2005 173 or bore tooth lindow 2001 259 is a squirrel who runs up and down world tree yggdrasil to carry messages between eagle perched atop yggdrasil and serpent nidhoggr who dwells beneath one of three roots of tree ratatoskr is attested in poetic edda compiled in 13th century from earlier traditional sources and prose edda written in 13th century by snorri sturluson etymology name ratatoskr contains two elements rata and toskr element toskr is generally held to mean tusk gudbrandur vigfusson theorized that rati element means traveller he says that name of legendary drill rati may feature same term according to vigfusson ratatoskr means tusk traveller or climber tusk gudbrandur 1874 483 sophus bugge theorized that name ratatoskr is a loanword from old english meaning rat tooth bugge s basis hinges on fact that toskr element of compound does not appear anywhere else in old norse bugge proposed that toskr element is a reformation of old english word old frisian tusk and in turn that element rata represents old english raet rat sturtevant 1956 111 according to albert sturtevant as far as element rata is concerned bugge s hypothesis has no valid foundation in view of fact that old norse word rata gen form of rati is used in hav amal 106 1 to signify instrument which odin employed for boring his way through rocks in quest of poet s mead and that rati must then be considered a native old norse word meaning borer gnawer sturtevant says that bugge s theory regarding element toskr may appear to be supported by fact that word does not appear elsewhere in old norse sturtevant however disagrees sturtevant says that old norse proper name derived from proto norse refers to a person who is characterized as having some peculiar sort of tooth and theorizes a proto germanic form of toskr sturtevant concludes that fact that old norse word occurs only in name rata toskr is no valid evidence against this assumption for there are many old norse hapax legomena of native origin as is attested by equivalents in mod ern scandinavian dialects sturtevant 1956 111 112 modern scholars have accepted this etymology listing name ratatoskr as meaning drill tooth jesse byock andy orchard rudolf simek or bore tooth john lindow attestations thumb a red squirrel in an

translation ratatosk is squirrel who there shall run on ash tree yggdrasil from above words of eagle he bears and tells them to beneath bellows 1936 97 ratatoskr is described in prose gylfaginning chapter 16 in which high states that an eagle sits at top of ash and it has knowledge of many things between its eyes sits hawk called squirrel called ratatosk runs up and down ash he tells slanderous gossip provoking eagle and nidhogg byock 2005 26 theories according to rudolf simek squirrel probably only represents an embellishing detail to mythological picture of world ash in grimnismal simek 2007 261 hilda ellis davidson describing world tree states squirrel is said to gnaw at it furthering a continual destruction and re growth cycle and posits tree symbolizes ever changing existence davidson 1993 68 69 john lindow points out that yggdrasil is described as rotting on one side and as being chewed on by four harts and nidhoggr and that according to account in gylfaginning it also bears verbal hostility in fauna it supports lindow adds that in sagas a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between participants is seldom one of high status which may explain assignment of this role in mythology to a relatively insignificant animal richard w thorington jr and katie ferrell theorize that role of ratatosk probably derived from habit of european tree squirrels sciurus vulgaris to give a scolding alarm call in response to danger it takes little imagination for you to think that squirrel is saying nasty things about you thorington jr and ferrel
