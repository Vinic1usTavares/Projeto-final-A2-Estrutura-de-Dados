balfour declaration was a public statement issued by british government in 1917 during first world war announcing support for establishment of a national home for jewish people in palestine then an ottoman region with a small minority jewish population it read declaration was contained in a letter dated 2november 1917 from united kingdom s foreign secretary arthur balfour to lord rothschild a leader of british jewish community for transmission to zionist federation of great britain and ireland text of declaration was published in press on 9november 1917 immediately following their declaration of war on ottoman empire in november 1914 british war cabinet began to consider future of palestine within two months a memorandum was circulated to cabinet by a zionist cabinet member herbert samuel proposing support of zionist ambitions in order to enlist support of jews in wider war a committee was established in april 1915 by british prime minister h h asquith to determine their policy toward ottoman empire including palestine asquith who had favoured post war reform of ottoman empire resigned in december 1916 his replacement david lloyd george favoured partition of empire first negotiations between british and zionists took place at a conference on 7 february 1917 that included sir mark sykes and zionist leadership subsequent discussions led to balfour s request on 19 june that rothschild and chaim weizmann submit a draft of a public declaration further drafts were discussed by british cabinet during september and october with input from zionist and anti zionist jews but with no representation from local population in palestine by late 1917 in lead up to balfour declaration wider war had reached a stalemate with two of britain s allies not fully engaged united states had yet to suffer a casualty and russians were in midst of a revolution with bolsheviks taking over government a stalemate in southern palestine was broken by battle of beersheba on 31 october 1917 release of final declaration was authorised on 31 october preceding cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst worldwide jewish community for allied war effort opening words of declaration represented first public expression of support for zionism by a major political power term national home had no precedent in international law and was intentionally vague as to whether a jewish state was contemplated intended boundaries of palestine were not specified and british government later confirmed that words in palestine meant that jewish national home was not intended to cover all of palestine second half of declaration was added to satisfy opponents of policy who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice position of local population of palestine and encourage antisemitism worldwide by stamping jews as strangers in their native lands declaration called for safeguarding civil and religious rights for palestinian arabs who composed vast majority of local population and also rights and political status of jewish communities in other countries outside of palestine british government acknowledged in 1939 that local population s views should have been taken into account and recognised in 2017 that declaration should have called for protection of palestinian arabs political rights declaration had many long lasting consequences it greatly increased popular support for zionism within jewish communities worldwide and became a core component of british mandate for palestine founding document of mandatory palestine which later became israel and palestinian territories as a result it is considered a principal cause of ongoing israeli palestinian conflict often described as world s most intractable conflict controversy remains over a number of areas such as whether declaration contradicted earlier promises british made to sharif of mecca in mcmahon hussein correspondence background early british support thumb lord shaftesbury s memorandum to protestant monarchs of europe for restoration of jews to palestine as published in colonial times in 1841 early british political support for an increased jewish presence in region of palestine was based upon geopolitical calculations this support began in early 1840s and was led by lord palmerston following occupation of syria and palestine by separatist ottoman governor muhammad ali of egypt french influence had grown in palestine and wider middle east and its role as protector of catholic communities began to grow just as russian influence had grown as protector of eastern orthodox in same regions this left britain without a sphere of influence and thus a need to find or create their own regional proteges these political considerations were supported by a sympathetic evangelical christian sentiment towards restoration of jews to palestine among elements of mid 19th century british political elite most notably lord shaftesbury british foreign office actively encouraged jewish emigration to palestine exemplified by charles henry churchill s 1841 1842 exhortations to moses montefiore leader of british jewish community such efforts were premature and did not succeed only 24 000 jews were living in palestine on eve of emergence of zionism within world s jewish communities in last two decades of 19th century with geopolitical shakeup occasioned by outbreak of first world war earlier calculations which had lapsed for some time led to a renewal of strategic assessments and political bargaining over middle and far east early zionism zionism arose in late 19th century in reaction to anti semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in europe romantic nationalism in central and eastern europe had helped to set off or jewish enlightenment creating a split in jewish community between those who saw judaism as their religion and those who saw it as their ethnicity or nation 1881 1884 anti jewish pogroms in russian empire encouraged growth of latter identity resulting in formation of zion pioneer organizations publication of leon pinsker s and first major wave of jewish immigration to palestine retrospectively named first aliyah thumb left basel program approved at 1897 first zionist congress first line states zionism seeks to establish a home for jewish people in palestine secured under public law in 1896 theodor herzl a jewish journalist living in austria hungary published foundational text of political zionism der jews state or state of jews in which he asserted that only solution to jewish question in europe including growing anti semitism was establishment of a state for jews a year later herzl founded zionist organization which at its first congress called for establishment of a home for jewish people in palestine secured under public law proposed measures to attain that goal included promotion of jewish settlement there organisation of jews in diaspora strengthening of jewish feeling and consciousness and preparatory steps to attain necessary governmental grants herzl died in 1904 44 years before establishment of state of israel jewish state that he proposed without having gained political standing required to carry out his agenda zionist leader chaim weizmann later president of world zionist organisation and first president of israel moved from switzerland to uk in 1904 and met arthur balfour who had just launched his 1905 1906 election campaign after resigning as prime minister in a session arranged by charles dreyfus his jewish constituency representative earlier that year balfour had successfully driven aliens act through parliament with impassioned speeches regarding need to restrict wave of immigration into britain from jews fleeing russian empire hansard aliens bill hc deb 02 may 1905 vol 145 808 and aliens bill hc deb 10 july 1905 vol 149 62 during this meeting he asked what weizmann s objections had been to 1903 uganda scheme that herzl had supported to provide a portion of british east africa to jewish people as a homeland scheme which had been proposed to herzl by joseph chamberlain colonial secretary in balfour s cabinet following his trip to east africa earlier in year had been subsequently voted down following herzl s death by seventh zionist congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in zionist organization weizmann responded that he believed english are to london as jews are to jerusalem in january 1914 weizmann first met baron edmond de rothschild a member of french branch of rothschild family and a leading proponent of zionist movement in relation to a project to build a hebrew university in jerusalem baron was not part of world zionist organization but had funded jewish agricultural colonies of first aliyah and transferred them to jewish colonization association in 1899 this connection was to bear fruit later that year when baron s son james requested a meeting with weizmann on 25november 1914 to enlist him in influencing those deemed to be receptive within british government to their agenda of a jewish state in palestine through james s wife dorothy weizmann was to meet rothschild who introduced him to english branch of particular her husband charles and his older brother walter a zoologist and former member of parliament mp their father nathan rothschild 1st baron rothschild head of english branch of family had a guarded attitude towards zionism but he died in march 1915 and his title was inherited by walter prior to declaration about 8 000 of britain s 300 000 jews belonged to a zionist organisation globally as of 1913 latest known date prior to declaration equivalent figure was approximately 1 ottoman palestine year 1916 marked four centuries since palestine had become part of ottoman empire also known as turkish empire for most of this period jewish population represented a small minority approximately 3 of total with muslims representing largest segment of population and christians second and ottoman government in constantinople began to apply restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine in late 1882 in response to start of first aliyah earlier that year although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with local population mainly among merchant and notable classes in 1901 sublime porte ottoman central government gave jews same rights as arabs to buy land in palestine and percentage of jews in population rose to 7 by 1914 at same time with growing distrust of young turks turkish nationalists who had taken control of empire in 1908 and second aliyah arab nationalism was on rise and in palestine anti zionism was a unifying characteristic historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in absence of balfour declaration first world war 1914 16 initial zionist british government discussions in july 1914 war broke out in europe between triple entente britain france and russian empire and central powers germany austria hungary and later that year ottoman empire british cabinet first discussed palestine at a meeting on 9november 1914 four days after britain s declaration of war on ottoman empire of which mutasarrifate of referred to as a component at meeting david lloyd george then chancellor of exchequer referred to ultimate destiny of palestine chancellor whose law firm lloyd george roberts and co had been engaged a decade before by zionist federation of great britain and ireland to work on uganda scheme was to become prime minister by time of declaration and was ultimately responsible for it thumb left herbert samuel s cabinet memorandum future of palestine as published in british cabinet papers cab 37 123 43 as at 1915 weizmann s political efforts picked up speed and on 10december 1914 he met with herbert samuel a british cabinet member and a secular jew who had studied zionism samuel believed weizmann s demands were too modest two days later weizmann met balfour again for first time since their initial meeting in 1905 balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906 but remained a senior member of conservative party in their role as official opposition a month later samuel circulated a memorandum entitled future of palestine to his cabinet colleagues memorandum stated i am assured that solution of problem of palestine which would be much most welcome to leaders and supporters of zionist movement throughout world would be annexation of country to british empire samuel discussed a copy of his memorandum with nathan rothschild in february 1915 a month before latter s death it was first time in an official record that enlisting support of jews as a war measure had been proposed many further discussions followed including initial meetings in 1915 16 between lloyd george who had been appointed minister of munitions in may 1915 and weizmann who was appointed as a scientific advisor to ministry in september 1915 seventeen years later in his war memoirs lloyd george described these meetings as being fount and origin of declaration historians have rejected this claim 1915 16 prior british commitments over palestine in late 1915 british high commissioner to egypt henry mcmahon exchanged ten letters with hussein bin ali sharif of mecca in which he promised hussein to recognize arab independence in limits and boundaries proposed by sherif of mecca in return for hussein launching a revolt against ottoman empire pledge excluded portions of syria lying to west of districts of damascus homs hama and aleppo in decades after war extent of this coastal exclusion was hotly disputed since palestine lay to southwest of damascus and was not explicitly mentioned arab revolt was launched on 1916 on basis of quid pro quo agreement in correspondence however less than three weeks earlier governments of united kingdom france and russia secretly concluded sykes picot agreement which balfour described later as a wholly new method for dividing region after 1915 agreement seems to have been forgotten this anglo french treaty was negotiated in late 1915 and early 1916 between sir mark sykes and francois georges picot with primary arrangements being set out in draft form in a joint memorandum on 5 january 1916 sykes was a british conservative mp who had risen to a position of significant influence on britain s middle east policy beginning with his seat on 1915 de bunsen committee and his initiative to create arab bureau picot was a french diplomat and former consul general in beirut their agreement defined proposed spheres of influence and control in western asia should triple entente succeed in defeating ottoman empire during world wari dividing many arab territories into british and french administered areas in palestine was proposed with form of administration to be confirmed after consultation with both russia and hussein january draft noted christian and muslim interests and that members of jewish community throughout world have a conscientious and sentimental interest in future of country prior to this point no active negotiations with zionists had taken place but sykes had been aware of zionism was in contact with moses gaster a former president of english zionist federation and may have seen samuel s 1915 memorandum on 3 march while sykes and picot were still in petrograd lucien wolf secretary of foreign conjoint committee set up by jewish organizations to further interests of foreign jews submitted to foreign office draft of an assurance formula that could be issued by allies in support of jewish aspirations in event of palestine coming within spheres of influence of great britain or france at close of war governments of those powers will not fail to take account of historic interest that country possesses for jewish community jewish population will be secured in enjoyment of civil and religious liberty equal political rights with rest of population reasonable facilities for immigration and colonisation and such municipal privileges in towns and colonies inhabited by them as may be shown to be necessary on 11 march telegrams were sent in grey s name to britain s russian and french ambassadors for transmission to russian and french authorities including formula as well as scheme might be made far more attractive to majority of jews if it held out to them prospect that when in course of time jewish colonists in palestine grow strong enough to cope with arab population they may be allowed to take management of internal affairs of palestine with exception of jerusalem and holy places into their own hands sykes having seen telegram had discussions with picot and proposed making reference to samuel s memorandum creation of an arab sultanate under french and british protection some means of administering holy places along with establishment of a company to purchase land for jewish colonists who would then become citizens with equal rights to arabs shortly after returning from petrograd sykes briefed samuel who then briefed a meeting of gaster weizmann and sokolow gaster recorded in his diary on 16 april 1916 we are offered french english condominium in palest ine arab prince to conciliate arab sentiment and as part of constitution a charter to zionists for which england would stand guarantee and which would stand by us in every case of friction it practically comes to a complete realisation of our zionist programme however we insisted on national character of charter freedom of immigration and internal autonomy and at same time full rights of citizenship to illegible and jews in palestine in sykes mind agreement which bore his name was outdated even before it was signed in march 1916 he wrote in a private letter to my mind zionists are now key of situation in event neither french nor russians were enthusiastic about proposed formulation and eventually on 4 july wolf was informed that present moment is inopportune for making any announcement these wartime initiatives inclusive of declaration are frequently considered together by historians because of potential real or imagined for incompatibility between them particularly in regard to disposition of palestine in words of professor albert hourani founder of middle east centre at st antony s college oxford argument about interpretation of these agreements is one which is impossible to end because they were intended to bear more than one interpretation 1916 17 change in british government in terms of british politics declaration resulted from coming into power of lloyd george and his cabinet which had replaced h h asquith led cabinet in december 1916 whilst both prime ministers were liberals and both governments were wartime coalitions lloyd george and balfour appointed as his foreign secretary favoured a post war partition of ottoman empire as a major british war aim whereas asquith and his foreign secretary sir edward grey had favoured its reform two days after taking office lloyd george told general robertson chief of imperial general staff that he wanted a major victory preferably capture of jerusalem to impress british public opinion and immediately consulted his war cabinet about a further campaign into palestine when el arish had been secured subsequent pressure from lloyd george over reservations of robertson resulted in recapture of sinai for british controlled egypt and with capture of el arish in december 1916 and rafah in january 1917 arrival of british forces at southern borders of ottoman empire following two unsuccessful attempts to capture gaza between 26 march and 19 april a six month stalemate in southern palestine began sinai and palestine campaign would not make any progress into palestine until 31october 1917 1917 british zionist formal negotiations following change in government sykes was promoted into war cabinet secretariat with responsibility for middle eastern affairs in january 1917 despite having previously built a relationship with moses gaster he began looking to meet other zionist leaders by end of month he had been introduced to weizmann and his associate nahum sokolow a journalist and executive of world zionist organization who had moved to britain at beginning of war on 1917 sykes claiming to be acting in a private capacity entered into substantive discussions with zionist leadership previous british correspondence with arabs was discussed at meeting sokolow s notes record sykes description that arabs professed that language must be measure by which control of palestine should be determined and by that measure could claim all syria and palestine still arabs could be managed particularly if they received jewish support in other matters at this point zionists were still unaware of sykes picot agreement although they had their suspicions one of sykes goals was mobilization of zionism to cause of british suzerainty in palestine so as to have arguments to put to france in support of that objective late 1917 progress of wider war thumb military situation at 18 00 on 1 nov 1917 immediately prior to release of balfour declaration during period of british war cabinet discussions leading up to declaration war had reached a period of stalemate on western front tide would first turn in favour of central powers in spring 1918 before decisively turning in favour of allies from july 1918 onwards although united states declared war on germany in spring of 1917 it did not suffer its first casualties until 2 november 1917 at which point president woodrow wilson still hoped to avoid dispatching large contingents of troops into war russian forces were known to be distracted by ongoing russian revolution and growing support for bolshevik faction but alexander kerensky s provisional government had remained in war russia only withdrew after final stage of revolution on 7november 1917 approvals april to june allied discussions balfour met weizmann at foreign office on 22 march 1917 two days later weizmann described meeting as being first time i had a real business talk with him weizmann explained at meeting that zionists had a preference for a british protectorate over palestine as opposed to an american french or international arrangement balfour agreed but warned that there may be difficulties with france and italy french position in regard to palestine and wider syria region during lead up to balfour declaration was largely dictated by terms of sykes picot agreement and was complicated from 23 november 1915 by increasing french awareness of british discussions with sherif of mecca prior to 1917 british had led fighting on southern border of ottoman empire alone given their neighbouring egyptian colony and french preoccupation with fighting on western front that was taking place on their own soil italy s participation in war which began following april 1915 treaty of london did not include involvement in middle eastern sphere until april 1917 agreement of saint jean de maurienne at this conference lloyd george had raised question of a british protectorate of palestine and idea had been very coldly received by french and italians in may and june 1917 french and italians sent detachments to support british as they built their reinforcements in preparation for a renewed attack on palestine in early april sykes and picot were appointed to act as chief negotiators once more this time on a month long mission to middle east for further discussions with sherif of mecca and other arab leaders on 3 april 1917 sykes met with lloyd george curzon and hankey to receive his instructions in this regard namely to keep french onside while not prejudicing zionist movement and possibility of its development under british auspices and not enter into any political pledges to arabs and particularly none in regard to palestine before travelling to middle east picot via sykes invited nahum sokolow to paris to educate french government on zionism sykes who had prepared way in correspondence with picot arrived a few days after sokolow in meantime sokolow had met picot and other french officials and convinced french foreign office to accept for study a statement of zionist aims in regard to facilities of colonization communal autonomy rights of language and establishment of a jewish chartered company sykes went on ahead to italy and had meetings with british ambassador and british vatican representative to prepare way for sokolow once again sokolow was granted an audience with pope benedict xv on 6 may 1917 sokolow s notes of meeting only meeting records known to historians stated that pope expressed general sympathy and support for zionist project on 21 may 1917 angelo president of committee of jewish communities presented sokolow to sidney sonnino italian minister of foreign affairs he was also received by paolo italian prime minister sonnino arranged for secretary general of ministry to send a letter to effect that although he could not express himself on merits of a program which concerned all allies generally speaking he was not opposed to legitimate claims of jews on his return journey sokolow met with french leaders again and secured a letter dated 4 june 1917 giving assurances of sympathy towards zionist cause by jules cambon head of political section of french foreign ministry this letter was not published but was deposited at british foreign office following united states entry into war on 6 april british foreign secretary led balfour mission to washington d c and new york where he spent a month between mid april and mid may during trip he spent significant time discussing zionism with louis brandeis a leading zionist and a close ally of wilson who had been appointed as a supreme court justice a year previously june and july decision to prepare a declaration thumb left a copy of lord rothschild s initial draft declaration together with its covering letter 18 july 1917 from british war cabinet archives by 13 june 1917 it was acknowledged by ronald graham head of foreign office s middle eastern affairs department that three most relevant prime minister foreign secretary and parliamentary under secretary of state for foreign affairs lord robert all in favour of britain supporting zionist movement on same day weizmann had written to graham to advocate for a public declaration palestine and balfour declaration cabinet paper january 1923 six days later at a meeting on balfour asked lord rothschild and weizmann to submit a formula for a declaration over next few weeks a 143 word draft was prepared by zionist negotiating committee but it was considered too specific on sensitive areas by sykes graham and rothschild separately a very different draft had been prepared by foreign office described in 1961 by harold nicolson who had been involved in preparing draft as proposing a sanctuary for jewish victims of persecution foreign office draft was strongly opposed by zionists and was discarded no copy of draft has been found in foreign office archives following further discussion a revised and at just 46 words in length much shorter draft declaration was prepared and sent by lord rothschild to balfour on 18 july it was received by foreign office and matter was brought to cabinet for formal consideration september and october american consent and war cabinet approval thumb as part of war cabinet discussions views were sought from ten representative jewish leaders those in favour comprised four members of zionist negotiating team rothschild weizmann sokolow and samuel stuart samuel herbert samuel s elder brother and chief rabbi joseph hertz those against comprised edwin montagu philip magnus claude montefiore and lionel cohen decision to release declaration was taken by british war cabinet on 31 october 1917 this followed discussion at four war cabinet meetings including 31 october meeting over space of previous two months in order to aid discussions war cabinet secretariat led by maurice hankey and supported by his assistant war cabinet hc deb 14 march 1917 vol 91 9w primarily sykes and his fellow conservative mp and pro zionist leo amery solicited outside perspectives to put before cabinet these included views of government ministers war allies notably from president woodrow wilson and in october formal submissions from six zionist leaders and four non zionist jews british officials asked president wilson for his consent on matter on two occasions first on 3 september when he replied time was not ripe and later on 6 october when he agreed with release of declaration excerpts from minutes of these four war cabinet meetings provide a description of primary factors that ministers considered 3 september 1917 with reference to a suggestion that matter might be postponed balfour pointed out that this was a question on which foreign office had been very strongly pressed for a long time past there was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation more particularly in united states who were zealous in this matter and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to allies to have earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted on our side to do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them and it was necessary to face this situation 4 october 1917 balfour stated that german government were making great efforts to capture sympathy of zionist movement this movement though opposed by a number of wealthy jews in this country had behind it support of a majority of jews at all events in russia and america and possibly in other countries mr balfour then read a very sympathetic declaration by french government which had been conveyed to zionists and he stated that he knew that president wilson was extremely favourable to movement 25 october 1917 secretary mentioned that he was being pressed by foreign office to bring forward question of zionism an early settlement of which was regarded as of great importance thumb british war cabinet minutes approving release of declaration 31october 1917 31 october 1917 balfour stated that he gathered that everyone was now agreed that from a purely diplomatic and political point of view it was desirable that some declaration favourable to aspirations of jewish nationalists should now be made vast majority of jews in russia and america as indeed all over world now appeared to be favourable to zionism if we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in russia and america drafting declassification of british government archives has allowed scholars to piece together choreography of drafting of declaration in his widely cited 1961 book leonard stein published four previous drafts of declaration appendix successive drafts and final text of balfour declaration drafting began with weizmann s guidance to zionist drafting team on its objectives in a letter dated 20 june 1917 one day following his meeting with rothschild and balfour he proposed that declaration from british government should state its conviction its desire or its intention to support zionist aims for creation of a jewish national home in palestine no reference must be made i think to question of suzerain power because that would land british into difficulties with french it must be a zionist declaration a month after receipt of much reduced 12 july draft from rothschild balfour proposed a number of mainly technical amendments two subsequent drafts included much more substantial amendments first in a late august draft by lord milner one of original five members of lloyd george s war cabinet as a minister without portfolio which reduced geographic scope from all of palestine to in palestine and second from milner and amery in early october which added two safeguard clauses list of known drafts of balfour declaration showing changes between each draft draft text changes

history professor carroll quigley explained his view that lord milner was primary author of declaration and more recently william d rubinstein professor of modern history at aberystwyth university wales proposed amery instead huneidi wrote that ormsby gore in a report he prepared for shuckburgh claimed authorship together with amery of final draft form key issues agreed version of declaration a single sentence of just 67 words was sent on 2november 1917 in a short letter from balfour to walter rothschild for transmission to zionist federation of great britain and ireland declaration contained four clauses of which first two promised to support establishment in palestine of a national home for jewish people followed by two safeguard clauses with respect to civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine and rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country national home for jewish people vs jewish state term national home was intentionally ambiguous having no legal value or precedent in international law such that its meaning was unclear when compared to other terms such as state term was intentionally used instead of state because of opposition to zionist program within british cabinet according to historian norman rose chief architects of declaration contemplated that a jewish state would emerge in time while palestine royal commission concluded that wording was outcome of a compromise between those ministers who contemplated ultimate establishment of a jewish state and those who did not thumb left lord curzon s 26 october 1917 cabinet memorandum circulated one week prior to declaration addressed meaning of phrase a national home for jewish race in palestine noting range of different opinions interpretation of wording has been sought in correspondence leading to final version of declaration an official report to war cabinet sent by sykes on 22 september said that zionists did not want to set up a jewish republic or any other form of state in palestine or in any part of palestine but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in palestine mandate a month later curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 october 1917 where he addressed two questions first concerning meaning of phrase a national home for jewish race in palestine he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely spiritual centre for jews sections of british press assumed that a jewish state was intended even before declaration was finalized in united states press began using terms jewish national home jewish state jewish republic and jewish commonwealth interchangeably american emergency committee for zionist affairs balfour declaration and

under control of league of nations indeed inquiry spoke positively about possibility of a jewish state eventually being created in palestine if necessary demographics for this were to exist historian matthew jacobs later wrote that us approach was hampered by general absence of specialist knowledge about region and that like much of inquiry s work on middle east reports on palestine were deeply flawed and presupposed a particular outcome of conflict he quotes miller writing about one report on history and impact of zionism absolutely inadequate from any standpoint and must be regarded as nothing more than material for a future report lord robert cecil on 2 december 1917 assured an audience that government fully intended that judea was for jews yair auron opines that cecil then a deputy foreign secretary representing british government at a celebratory gathering of english zionist federation possibly went beyond his official brief in saying he cites stein our wish is that arabian countries shall be for arabs armenia for armenians and judaea for jews following october neville chamberlain while chairing a zionist meeting discussed a new jewish state at time chamberlain was a member of parliament for ladywood birmingham recalling event in 1939 just after chamberlain had approved 1939 white paper jewish telegraph agency noted that prime minister had experienced a pronounced change of mind in 21 years intervening a year later on declaration s second anniversary general jan smuts said that britain would redeem her pledge and a great jewish state would ultimately rise in similar vein churchill a few months later stated at 22 june 1921 meeting of imperial cabinet churchill was asked by arthur meighen canadian prime minister about meaning of national home churchill said if in course of many years they become a majority in country they naturally would take it over pro rata with arab we made an equal pledge that we would not turn arab off his land or invade his political and social rights responding to curzon in january 1919 balfour wrote weizmann has never put forward a claim for jewish government of palestine such a claim in my opinion is clearly inadmissible and personally i do not think we should go further than original declaration which i made to lord rothschild in february 1919 france issued a statement that it would not oppose putting palestine under british trusteeship and formation of a jewish state friedman further notes that france s attitude went on to change yehuda blum while discussing france s unfriendly attitude towards jewish national movement notes content of a report made by robert vansittart a leading member of british delegation to paris peace conference to curzon in november 1920 which said greece s foreign minister told editor of salonica jewish organ pro israel that establishment of a jewish state meets in greece with full and sincere sympathy a jewish palestine would become an ally of greece in switzerland a number of noted historians including professors forel and supported idea of establishing a jewish state with one referring to it as a sacred right of jews while in germany officials and most of press took declaration to mean a british sponsored state for jews british government including churchill made it clear that declaration did not intend for whole of palestine to be converted into a jewish national home but that such a home should be founded in palestine emir faisal king of syria and iraq made a formal written agreement with zionist leader chaim weizmann which was drafted by t e lawrence whereby they would try to establish a peaceful relationship between arabs and jews in palestine sekulow jay unholy alliance agenda iran russia and jihadists share for conquering world simon and schuster 2016 pp 29 30 3 january 1919 faisal weizmann agreement was a short lived agreement for arab jewish cooperation on development of a jewish homeland in palestine faisal did treat palestine differently in his presentation to peace conference on 6 february 1919 saying palestine for its universal character should be left on one side for mutual consideration of all parties concerned agreement was never implemented in a subsequent letter written in english by lawrence for faisal s signature he explained when letter was tabled at shaw commission in 1929 rustam haidar spoke to faisal in baghdad and cabled that faisal had no recollection that he wrote anything of sort in january 1930 haidar wrote to a newspaper in baghdad that faisal finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an arab country awni abd al hadi faisal s secretary wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between frankfurter and faisal took place and that i believe that this letter assuming that it is authentic was written by lawrence and that lawrence signed it in english on behalf of faisal i believe this letter is part of false claims made by chaim weizmann and lawrence to lead astray public opinion according to most likely explanation for frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place a letter was drafted in english by lawrence but that its contents were not entirely made clear to faisal he then may or may not have been induced to sign it since it ran counter to faisal s other public and private statements at time a 1 march interview by le matin quoted faisal as saying this feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about palestine our neighbor that unhappy jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country our humanity rejoices given that they are placed under a muslim or christian government mandated by league of nations if they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region i foresee very serious dangers it is to be feared that there will be a conflict between them and other races referring to his 1922 white paper churchill later wrote that there is nothing in it to prohibit ultimate establishment of a jewish state and in private many british officials agreed with zionists interpretation that a state would be established when a jewish majority was achieved when chaim weizmann met with churchill lloyd george and balfour at balfour s home in london on 21 july 1921 lloyd george and balfour assured weizmann that by declaration they had always meant an eventual jewish state according to weizmann minutes of that meeting lloyd george stated in 1937 that it was intended that palestine would become a jewish commonwealth if and when jews had become a definite majority of inhabitants and leo amery echoed same position in 1946 in report of 1947 issue of home versus state was subjected to scrutiny arriving at a similar conclusion to that of lloyd george scope of national home in palestine statement that such a homeland would be found in palestine rather than of palestine was also deliberate proposed draft of declaration contained in rothschild s 12 july letter to balfour referred to principle that palestine should be reconstituted as national home of jewish people in final text following lord milner s amendment word reconstituted was removed and word that was replaced with in this text thereby avoided committing entirety of palestine as national home of jewish people resulting in controversy in future years over intended scope especially revisionist zionism sector which claimed entirety of mandatory palestine and emirate of transjordan as jewish homeland this was clarified by 1922 churchill white paper which wrote that terms of declaration referred to do not contemplate that palestine as a whole should be converted into a jewish national home but that such a home should be founded in palestine declaration did not include any geographical boundaries for palestine following end of war three documents declaration hussein mcmahon correspondence and sykes picot agreement became basis for negotiations to set boundaries of palestine civil and religious rights of non jewish communities in palestine declaration s first safeguard clause referred to protecting civil and religious rights of non jews in palestine clause had been drafted together with second safeguard by leo amery in consultation with lord milner with intention to go a reasonable distance to meeting objectors both jewish and pro arab without impairing substance of proposed declaration non jews constituted 90 of population of palestine in words of ronald storrs britain s military governor of jerusalem between 1917 and 1920 community observed that they had been not so much as named either as arabs moslems or christians but were lumped together under negative and humiliating definition of non jewish communities and relegated to subordinate provisos community also noted that there was no reference to protecting their political status or political rights as there was in subsequent safeguard relating to jews in other countries this protection was frequently contrasted against commitment to jewish community and over years a variety of terms were used to refer to these two obligations as a pair a particularly heated question was whether these two obligations had equal weight and in 1930 this equal status was confirmed by permanent mandates commission and by british government in passfield white paper balfour stated in february 1919 that palestine was considered an exceptional case in which referring to local population we deliberately and rightly decline to accept principle of self determination although he considered that policy provided self determination to jews avi shlaim considers this declaration s greatest contradiction this principle of self determination had been declared on numerous occasions subsequent to wilson s january 1918 fourteen points mcmahon s declaration to seven in june 1918 november 1918 anglo french declaration and june 1919 covenant of league of nations that had established mandate system in an august 1919 memo balfour acknowledged inconsistency among these statements and further explained that british had no intention of consulting existing population of palestine results of ongoing american king crane commission of enquiry consultation of local population from which british had withdrawn were suppressed for three years until report was leaked in 1922 subsequent british governments have acknowledged this deficiency in particular 1939 committee led by lord chancellor frederic maugham which concluded that government had not been free to dispose of palestine without regard for wishes and interests of inhabitants of palestine and april 2017 statement by british foreign office minister of state baroness that government acknowledged that declaration should have called for protection of political rights of non jewish communities in palestine particularly their right to self determination rights and political status of jews in other countries thumb edwin montagu only jew in a senior british government position wrote a 23 august 1917 memorandum stating his belief that policy of his majesty s government is anti semitic in result and will prove a rallying ground for anti semites in every country of world second safeguard clause was a commitment that nothing should be done which might prejudice rights of jewish communities in other countries outside of palestine original drafts of rothschild balfour and milner did not include this safeguard which was drafted together with preceding safeguard in early october in order to reflect opposition from influential members of anglo jewish community lord rothschild took exception to proviso on basis that it presupposed possibility of a danger to non zionists which he denied conjoint foreign committee of board of deputies of british jews and anglo jewish association had published a letter in times on 24 may 1917 entitled views of anglo jewry signed by two organisations presidents david lindo alexander and claude montefiore stating their view that establishment of a jewish nationality in palestine founded on this theory of homelessness must have effect throughout world of stamping jews as strangers in their native lands and of undermining their hard won position as citizens and nationals of these lands this was followed in late august by edwin montagu an influential anti zionist jew and secretary of state for india and only jewish member of british cabinet who wrote in a cabinet memorandum that policy of his majesty s government is anti semitic in result and will prove a rallying ground for anti semites in every country of world reaction text of declaration was published in press one week after it was signed on 9november 1917 other related events took place within a short timeframe two most relevant being almost immediate british military capture of palestine and leaking of previously secret sykes picot agreement on military side both gaza and jaffa fell within several days and jerusalem was surrendered to british on 9 december publication of sykes picot agreement following russian revolution in bolshevik izvestia and pravda on 23 november 1917 and in british manchester guardian on 26 november 1917 represented a dramatic moment for allies eastern campaign british were embarrassed arabs dismayed and turks delighted peter mansfield british empire magazine no 75 time life books 1973 zionists had been aware of outlines of agreement since april and specifically part relevant to palestine following a meeting between weizmann and cecil where weizmann made very clear his objections to proposed scheme zionist reaction thumb left balfour declaration as published in times 9november 1917 declaration represented first public support for zionism by a major political power its publication galvanized zionism which finally had obtained an official charter in addition to its publication in major newspapers leaflets were circulated throughout jewish communities these leaflets were airdropped over jewish communities in germany and austria as well as pale of settlement which had been given to central powers following russian withdrawal weizmann had argued that declaration would have three effects it would swing russia to maintain pressure on germany s eastern front since jews had been prominent in march revolution of 1917 it would rally large jewish community in united states to press for greater funding for american war effort underway since april of that year and lastly that it would undermine german jewish support for kaiser wilhelm ii declaration spurred an unintended and extraordinary increase in number of adherents of american zionism in 1914 200 american zionist societies comprised a total of 7 500 members which grew to 30 000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149 000 members in 1919 whilst british had considered that declaration reflected a previously established dominance of zionist position in jewish thought it was declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for zionism s legitimacy and leadership exactly one month after declaration was issued a large scale celebration took place at royal opera house speeches were given by leading zionists as well as members of british administration including sykes and cecil from 1918 until second world war jews in mandatory palestine celebrated balfour day as an annual national holiday on 2november celebrations included ceremonies in schools and other public institutions and festive articles in hebrew press in august 1919 balfour approved weizmann s request to name first post war settlement in mandatory palestine in his honour it was intended to be a model settlement for future american jewish activity in palestine herbert samuel zionist mp whose 1915 memorandum had framed start of discussions in british cabinet was asked by lloyd george on 1920 to act as first civil governor of british palestine replacing previous military administration that had ruled area since war shortly after beginning role in july 1920 he was invited to read from isaiah 40 at hurva synagogue in jerusalem which according to his memoirs led congregation of older settlers to feel that fulfilment of ancient prophecy might at last be at hand opposition in palestine thumb right most popular palestinian arab newspaper filastin la palestine published a four page editorial addressed to lord balfour in march 1925 local christian and muslim community of palestine who constituted almost 90 of population strongly opposed declaration as described by palestinian american philosopher edward said in 1979 it was perceived as being made a by a european power b about a non european territory c in a flat disregard of both presence and wishes of native majority resident in that territory and d it took form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group according to 1919 king crane commission no british officer consulted by commissioners believed that zionist programme could be carried out except by force of arms a delegation of muslim christian association headed by musa al husayni expressed public disapproval on 3november 1918 one day after zionist commission parade marking first anniversary of balfour declaration they handed a petition signed by more than 100 notables to ronald storrs british military governor group also protested carrying of new white and blue banners with two inverted triangles in middle drawing attention of british authorities to serious consequences of any political implications in raising banners later that month on first anniversary of occupation of jaffa by british muslim christian association sent a lengthy memorandum and petition to military governor protesting once more any formation of a jewish state broader arab response in broader arab world declaration was seen as a betrayal of british wartime understandings with arabs sharif of mecca and other arab leaders considered declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in mcmahon hussein correspondence in exchange for launching arab revolt following publication of declaration british dispatched commander david george hogarth to see hussein in january 1918 bearing message that political and economic freedom of palestinian population was not in question hogarth reported that hussein would not accept an independent jewish state in palestine nor was i instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by great britain hussein had also learned of sykes picot agreement when it was leaked by new soviet government in december 1917 but was satisfied by two disingenuous messages from sir reginald wingate who had replaced mcmahon as high commissioner of egypt assuring him that british commitments to arabs were still valid and that sykes picot agreement was not a formal treaty continuing arab disquiet over allied intentions also led during 1918 to british declaration to seven and anglo french declaration latter promising complete and final liberation of peoples who have for so long been oppressed by turks and setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from free exercise of initiative and choice of indigenous populations report of a committee set up to consider certain correspondence between sir henry mcmahon and sharif of mecca in 1915 and 1916 unispal annex a paragraph 19 in 1919 king hussein refused to ratify treaty of versailles after february 1920 british ceased to pay subsidy to him in august 1920 five days after signing of treaty of sevres which formally recognized kingdom of hejaz curzon asked cairo to procure hussein s signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of ps30 000 conditional on signature hussein declined and in 1921 stated that he could not be expected to affix his name to a document assigning palestine to zionists and syria to foreigners following 1921 cairo conference lawrence was sent to try and obtain king s signature to a treaty as well as to versailles and sevres a ps60 000 annual subsidy being proposed this attempt also failed during 1923 british made one further attempt to settle outstanding issues with hussein and once again attempt foundered hussein continued in his refusal to recognize balfour declaration or any of mandates that he perceived as being his domain in march 1924 having briefly considered possibility of removing offending article from treaty government suspended any further negotiations within six months they withdrew their support in favour of their central arabian ally ibn saud who proceeded to conquer hussein s kingdom allies and associated powers declaration was first endorsed by a foreign government on 27 december 1917 when serbian zionist leader and diplomat david albala announced support of serbia s government in exile during a mission to united states french and italian governments offered their endorsements on 14 february and 9 may 1918 respectively at a private meeting in london on 1 december 1918 lloyd george and french prime minister georges clemenceau agreed to certain modifications to sykes picot agreement including british control of palestine on 25 april 1920 san remo conference an outgrowth of paris peace conference attended by prime ministers of britain france and italy japanese ambassador to france and united states ambassador to italy established basic terms for three league of nations mandates a french mandate for syria and british mandates for mesopotamia and palestine with respect to palestine resolution stated that british were responsible for putting into effect terms of balfour declaration french and italians made clear their dislike of zionist cast of palestinian mandate and objected especially to language that did not safeguard political rights of non jews accepting curzon s claim that in british language all ordinary rights were included in civil rights at request of france it was agreed that an undertaking was to be inserted in mandate s proces verbal that this would not involve surrender of rights hitherto enjoyed by non jewish communities in palestine italian endorsement of declaration had included condition on understanding that there is no prejudice against legal and political status of already existing religious communities in italian che non ne nessun allo stato e politico delle gia religiose boundaries of palestine were left unspecified to be determined by principal allied powers three months later in july 1920 french defeat of faisal s arab kingdom of syria precipitated british need to know what is syria for which french received a mandate at san remo and does it include it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating transjordan with mandated area of palestine without adding it to area of jewish national home in 1922 congress officially endorsed america s support for balfour declaration through passage of lodge fish resolution 67th congress pdf notwithstanding opposition from state department professor lawrence davidson of west chester university whose research focuses on american relations with middle east argues that president wilson and congress ignored democratic values in favour of biblical romanticism when they endorsed declaration he points to an organized pro zionist lobby in united states which was active at a time when country s small arab american community had little political power central powers publication of balfour declaration was met with tactical responses from central powers two weeks following declaration ottokar czernin austrian foreign minister gave an interview to arthur president of zionist federation of germany promising that his government would influence turks once war was over on 12december ottoman grand vizier talaat pasha gave an interview to german newspaper zeitung that was published on 31december and subsequently released in german jewish periodical rundschau on 4january 1918 in which he referred to declaration as une a deception and promised that under ottoman rule all justifiable wishes of jews in palestine would be able to find their fulfilment subject to absorptive capacity of country this turkish statement was endorsed by german foreign office on 5january 1918 on 1918 a german jewish society union of german jewish organizations for protection of rights of jews of east was formed to advocate for further progress for jews in palestine following war treaty of sevres was signed by ottoman empire on 10august 1920 treaty dissolved ottoman empire requiring turkey to renounce sovereignty over much of middle east of treaty incorporated terms of balfour declaration with respect to administration of palestine within such boundaries as may be determined by principal allied powers since incorporation of declaration into treaty of sevres did not affect legal status of either declaration or mandate there was also no effect when sevres was superseded by treaty of lausanne 1923 which did not include any reference to declaration in 1922 german anti semitic theorist alfred rosenberg in his primary contribution to nazi theory on zionism der zionism enemy of state accused german zionists of working for a german defeat and supporting britain and implementation of balfour declaration in a version of stab in back myth adolf hitler took a similar approach in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards holy see with advent of declaration and british entry into jerusalem on 9 december vatican reversed its earlier sympathetic attitude to zionism and adopted an oppositional stance that was to continue until early 1990s evolution of british opinion british policy as stated in declaration was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in following years first of these was indirect peace negotiations which took place between britain and ottomans in december 1917 and january 1918 during a pause in hostilities for rainy season although these peace talks were unsuccessful archival records suggest that key members of war cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving palestine under nominal turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal in october 1919 almost a year after end of war lord curzon succeeded balfour as foreign secretary curzon had been a member of 1917 cabinet that had approved declaration and according to british historian sir david gilmour curzon had been only senior figure in british government at time who foresaw that its policy would lead to decades of arab jewish hostility he therefore determined to pursue a policy in line with its narrower and more prudent rather than wider interpretation following bonar law s appointment as prime minister in late 1922 curzon wrote to law that he regarded declaration as worst of britain s middle east commitments and a striking contradiction of our publicly declared principles gilmour quotes curzon to bonar law 14 december 1922 bonar law papers 111 12 46 in august 1920 report of palin commission first in a long line of british commissions of inquiry on question of palestine during mandate period noted that balfour declaration is undoubtedly starting point of whole trouble conclusion of report which was not published mentioned balfour declaration three times stating that causes of alienation and exasperation of feelings of population of palestine included inability to reconcile allies declared policy of self determination with balfour declaration giving rise to a sense of betrayal and intense anxiety for their future misapprehension of true meaning of balfour declaration and forgetfulness of guarantees determined therein due to loose rhetoric of politicians and exaggerated statements and writings of interested persons chiefly zionists and zionist indiscretion and aggression since balfour declaration aggravating such fears british public and government opinion became increasingly unfavourable to state support for zionism even sykes had begun to change his views in late 1918 in february 1922 churchill telegraphed samuel who had begun his role as high commissioner for palestine 18 months earlier asking for cuts in expenditure and noting following issuance of churchill white paper in june 1922 house of lords rejected a palestine mandate that incorporated balfour declaration by 60 votes to 25 following a motion issued by lord islington hansard palestine mandate hl deb 21 june 1922 vol 50 cc994 1033 outcome of vote on next page vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by a vote in house of commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by churchill in february 1923 following change in government cavendish in a lengthy memorandum for cabinet laid foundation for a secret review of palestine policy his covering note asked for a statement of policy to be made as soon as possible and that cabinet ought to focus on three questions 1 whether or not pledges to arabs conflict with balfour declaration 2 if not whether new government should continue policy set down by old government in 1922 white paper and 3 if not what alternative policy should be adopted stanley baldwin replacing bonar law in june 1923 set up a cabinet subcommittee whose terms of reference were cabinet approved report of this committee on 31 july 1923 describing it as nothing short of remarkable quigley noted that government was admitting to itself that its support for zionism had been prompted by considerations having nothing to do with merits of zionism or its consequences for palestine as huneidi noted wise or unwise it is well nigh impossible for any government to extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice of consistency and self respect if not honour wording of declaration was thus incorporated into british mandate for palestine a legal instrument that created mandatory palestine with an explicit purpose of putting declaration into effect and was finally formalized in september 1923 unlike declaration itself mandate was legally binding on british government in june 1924 britain made its report to permanent mandates commission for period july 1920 to end of 1923 containing nothing of candor reflected in internal documents documents relating to 1923 reappraisal stayed secret until early 1970s historiography lloyd george and balfour remained in government until collapse of coalition in october 1922 under new conservative government attempts were made to identify background to and motivations for declaration a private cabinet memorandum was produced in january 1923 providing a summary of then known foreign office and war cabinet records leading up to declaration an accompanying foreign office note asserted that primary authors of declaration were balfour sykes weizmann and sokolow with perhaps lord rothschild as a figure in background and that negotiations seem to have been mainly oral and by means of private notes and memoranda of which only records seem to be available following 1936 general strike that was to degenerate into 1936 1939 arab revolt in palestine most significant outbreak of violence since mandate began a british royal commission a high profile public inquiry was appointed to investigate causes of unrest palestine royal commission appointed with significantly broader terms of reference than previous british inquiries into palestine completed its 404 page report after six months of work in june 1937 publishing it a month later report began by describing history of problem including a detailed summary of origins of balfour declaration much of this summary relied on lloyd george s personal testimony balfour had died in 1930 and sykes in 1919 he told commission that declaration was made due to propagandist reasons in particular jewish sympathy would confirm support of american jewry and would make it more difficult for germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on eastern front two years later in his memoirs of peace conference lloyd george described a total of nine factors motivating his decision as prime minister to release declaration including additional reasons that a jewish presence in palestine would strengthen britain s position on suez canal and reinforce route to their imperial dominion in india these geopolitical calculations were debated and discussed in following years historians agree that british believed that expressing support would appeal to jews in germany and united states given two of woodrow wilson s closest advisors were known to be avid zionists they also hoped to encourage support from large jewish population in russia in addition british intended to pre empt expected french pressure for an international administration in palestine some historians argue that british government s decision reflected what james gelvin professor of middle eastern history at ucla calls patrician anti semitism in overestimation of jewish power in both united states and russia american zionism was still in its infancy in 1914 zionist federation had a small budget of about 5 000 and only 12 000 members despite an american jewish population of three million but zionist organizations had recently succeeded following a show of force within american jewish community in arranging a jewish congress to debate jewish problem as a whole this impacted british and french government estimates of balance of power within american jewish public avi shlaim emeritus professor of international relations in university of oxford asserts that two main schools of thought have been developed on question of primary driving force behind declaration one presented in 1961 by leonard stein a lawyer and former political secretary to world zionist organization and other in 1970 by verete then professor of israeli history at hebrew university of jerusalem shlaim states that stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions but that implicit in his narrative is that declaration resulted primarily from activity and skill of zionists whereas according to verete it was work of hard headed pragmatists motivated by british imperial interests in middle east much of modern scholarship on decision to issue declaration focuses on zionist movement and rivalries within it with a key debate being whether role of weizmann was decisive or whether british were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event danny professor of jewish history at university of haifa proposes a twist on an old idea asserting that sykes s february 1917 approach to zionists was defining moment and that it was consistent with pursuit of government s wider agenda to partition ottoman empire long term impact declaration had two indirect consequences emergence of a jewish state and a chronic state of conflict between arabs and jews throughout middle east it has been described as original sin with respect to both britain s failure in palestine and for wider events in palestine statement also had a significant impact on traditional anti zionism of religious jews some of whom saw it as divine providence this contributed to growth of religious zionism amid larger zionist movement starting in 1920 intercommunal conflict in mandatory palestine broke out which widened into regional arab israeli conflict often referred to as world s most intractable conflict chris rice quoted in lisa through my enemy s eyes envisioning reconciliation in israel palestine quote palestinian israeli divide may be most intractable conflict of our time virginia page peace time cease fire agreements and durability of peace p 67 britain s contradictory promises to arabs and jews during world wari sowed seeds of what would become international community s most intractable conflict later in century avner falk fratricide in holy land a psychoanalytic view of arab israeli conflict p 8 most experts agree that arab israeli conflict is most intractable conflict in our world yet very few scholars have produced any psychological explanation let alone a satisfactory one of this conflict s intractability dual obligation to two communities quickly proved to be untenable british subsequently concluded that it was impossible for them to pacify two communities in palestine by using different messages for different audiences palestine royal commission in making first official proposal for partition of region referred to requirements as contradictory obligations and that disease is so deep rooted that in our firm conviction only hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation following 1936 1939 arab revolt in palestine and as worldwide tensions rose in buildup to second world war british parliament approved white paper of 1939 their last formal statement of governing policy in mandatory palestine declaring that palestine should not become a jewish state and placing restrictions on jewish immigration whilst british considered this consistent with balfour declaration s commitment to protect rights of non jews many zionists saw it as a repudiation of declaration although this policy lasted until british surrendered mandate in 1948 it served only to highlight fundamental difficulty for britain in carrying out mandate obligations britain s involvement in this became one of most controversial parts of its empire s history and damaged its reputation in middle east for generations according to historian elizabeth monroe measured by british interests alone declaration was one of greatest mistakes in its imperial history 2010 study by jonathan schneer specialist in modern british history at georgia tech concluded that because build up to declaration was characterized by contradictions deceptions misinterpretations and wishful thinking declaration sowed dragon s teeth and produced a murderous harvest and we go on harvesting even today foundational stone for modern israel had been laid but prediction that this would lay groundwork for harmonious arab jewish cooperation proved to be wishful thinking document thumb lord balfour s desk in museum of
