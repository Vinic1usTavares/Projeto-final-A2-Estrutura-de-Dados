music part of my career because this movie has just consumed every inch of me between that and my four children i don t have time or energy for anything else for example i do appreciate that lots of people worked long and hard putting together things like dvd of sticky sweet tour that we just released and i have seen finished product but i have got no idea how people are going to find out about it or how it s going to be sold critical reception mikael wood from entertainment weekly gave video a b and commented this live cd dvd can t replicate being there sticky sweet taped in buenos aires in 2008 does capture show s streak as on electro garage hung up props too for a behind scenes doc that actually goes behind scenes independent gave release two out of five stars reviewer andy gill commented for all multitude of crotches spread about stage this is as as pop gets utterly lifeless despite fervent activity mayer nissim from digital spy felt that despite its absurd charm this cd won t provoke rediscovery of hard candy that it seems to nudge towards that said it s still an entertaining blast from start to finish and with dvd record of her outstandingly outlandish tour bundled in this is definitely worth entry price for anyone who still has even half an interest in queen mum of pop mark beech from bloomberg television said that it s intriguing how note perfect madonna is while running around and doing splits rolling stone gave album three and a half out of five stars and wrote that it featured stirring remixes like a fresh mash up of vogue with brassy funk of hard candys 4 minutes justin kanter from seattle post intelligencer gave a positive review and commented on performances over course of two full uninterrupted hours comes an abundance of grandiose sets and effects a voluminous line up of dancers precisely engineered sound and sequence and sharply produced celebrity studded video clips unquestionably it s madonna and company s actual show entire spectacle of song dance style and attitude that make sticky sweet tour an invigorating and highly memorable happening however he felt that performances of borderline 1984 and human nature were disappointing ben kaplan from canada com said sticky sweet is a document of a woman in her fifties who actually started peaking after most people thought she was through madonna doesn t speak with a british accent on her new record but even if she did it wouldn t really have mattered most of stage banter is drowned out by crowd s roar he listed performance of into groove 1985 as a highlight of tour tony clayton lea from irish times said madonna has experience to know what works and what doesn t it is this that makes sticky sweet such an interesting proposition a superbly shot movie of four act show that blends muscle with music depth with deftness stephen thomas erlewine from allmusic said since so much of tour depended on overblown spectacle sticky sweet tour is better experienced as a video instead of a cd but even as a video this doesn t rank among best madonna live albums as there s too much precision and not enough inspiration in whole show chart performance thumb left dvd begins with performance of candy shop which followed sweet machine introduction video alt a faraway image of a blond woman sitting on a throne atop a flight of stairs on a stage two male dancers in black coat and
