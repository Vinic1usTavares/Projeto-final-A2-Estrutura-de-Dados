tenth writing credit for series and kretchmer s ninth directing credit for show not pictured reveals cassidy beaver casablancas as perpetrator behind veronica s rape and bus crash thomas and crew had planned for beaver to be second season antagonist since character s first appearance in m a d thomas said we knew that beaver was killer of season 2 when we introduced him in season 1 we knew his motivation so playing him as picked upon less manly casablancas boy was all by design an episode earlier in series titled a trip to dentist supposedly revealed that duncan had had sex with veronica when they were both under influence of drugs a fact which is potentially negated by this episode when writing episode thomas and diane ruggiero did not plan for beaver to be actual rapist with thomas saying that i wish i could claim that we were that clever lead actress kristen bell who deduced that aaron echolls was killer in season 1 was unable to figure out identity of murderer in season 2 you never ever see show keep killer in main titles adding that writers think they re so smart and they are actor michael muhney who plays don lamb expressed some anxiety over course of season that he would be killer however bell played a prank on muhney telling him that she knew killer was going to be loretta cancun a minor character from pilot bell said muhney only believed me for like a day kyle gallner who plays beaver did not know that his character was going to be murderer until just before shooting of not pictured when one of costume designers told him about reveal left upright alt thumb

wiedman christopher b duncan later we learn that murder was ordered by duncan kane teddy dunn who appears briefly in a small cameo dunn had made his final regular appearance in donut run and had left show partly due to fan dislike of character dunn later stated that he thought that purpose of cameo was to garner sympathy for character before his final departure i think rob s goal was to leave character on a high note i certainly think he did so in a heroic way not pictured would mark final appearance by series regular jackie cook tessa thompson when asked whether jackie was done with show thomas replied she is i would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc but she will not be a series regular one notable recurring character absence in finale is that of gia goodman krysten ritter ritter wanted to appear in episode but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts it was unfortunate for me that i couldn t be in finale episode i booked a pilot because i was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her on a side note i did start to think that i was responsible for crash i really wanted her to be a bad guy she would later appear in veronica mars movie not pictured was final episode of veronica mars to air on upn before show switched to cw as part of 2006 united states broadcast tv realignment due to low ratings there was considerable doubt that veronica mars would be renewed meanwhile cw had developed several new pilots however cw did not pick up majority of their pilots making room on schedule for other shows in order to express their support for show s renewal fans flew a banner outside offices of upn and cw renewal was uncertain until after finale aired in april actor enrico colantoni who plays keith stated regarding renewal unofficially everyone at cbs and warner bros is saying yeah no worries but you know those are always famous last words and then last year they told us two days after we wrapped and they got a lot of criticism over that so i know they re not gonna make that mistake again they re gonna wait until may colantoni also expressed optimism towards show s future on cw believing that it would be a chance for show to get more exposure on may 15 before official press release was announced it was believed that cw had ordered 13 episodes of veronica mars later it was revealed that series

showcased series at its surprising and funny best not its rushed and convoluted worst he called reversal of rape plot line a gimmicky reversal but that thematically it worked reviewer commented positively on reveal of beaver as murderer as well as cliffhanger season s low key but effective cliffhanger suggested again that her life however charmed and tv ish it can seem remains in youthful flux eric goldman of ign gave a glowing review giving episode a 9 out of 10 indicating that it was amazing he wrote that most of major mysteries established this season are given a satisfying and proper conclusion he praised how episode combined all second season storylines including mysteries and neptune high portion of veronica s life final scenes do a very nice job of closing high school chapter of veronica mars story while also leaving plenty of questions about future of some characters in particular goldman also lauded performances of kristen bell and enrico colantoni writing that as always kristen bell and enrico colantoni knock it out of park with bell especially having to go through a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions all of which she does spectacularly in a review of whole second season goldman wrote that their was some complaints that season finale was a bit too rushed with a lot of information offered all at once yet while that s a bit valid it s also an exciting and surprising finale that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1 rowan kaiser of a v club gave a mostly positive review praising reveal of beaver as murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as veronica s rapist he wrote that as twists go this was a good one and that kyle gallner makes transition from goofy kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well circles under his eyes specifically which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light regarding rape reveal reviewers wrote that on a narrative level i was fine with it it s still a big problem in an emotional sense in general rape is a difficult subject and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own kaiser summed up his review by writing not pictured acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season sure it doesn t entirely work but overall it gets job done with emotion and flair price peterson writing for tv com gave a glowing review calling it best yet episode of veronica mars he elaborated by stating this episode was just a total triumph for how it brought together so much from past 22 episodes and beyond i loved aaron echolls assassination i loved that last image of duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some australian beach i especially loved it s a wonderful life esque dream sequence this episode was so good that even though i knew beaver was bad guy i still came away shocked by many of reveals that s just good writing right there conversely television without pity gave episode a b amy ratcliffe writing for ign ranked episode as fifth best episode of veronica mars writing season 2 finale had head twisting reveals heartbreaking moments tragedy and so many jumps in crime solving that sherlock might not have been able to keep up buzzfeed called episode best episode of series stating it s extremely violent extremely scary and extremely moving if you don t cry watching this episode there s a tiny little rock where your heart should be on a similar list tv line ranked episode third only behind a trip to dentist and pilot give me my remote also ranked episode as best of series writing if i had to pick a single episode to represent show this would be it actual plot of this episode was compelling fast paced and twist at end was shocking reviewer went on to praise kristen bell s performance and less action heavy parts of episode digital spy listed episode on an unranked list of five best veronica mars episodes writing that it has its issues but that rooftop sequence with veronica cassidy kyle gallner and logan is pure gorgeous melodrama and keith s fake out death feels devastating instead of cheap thanks to kristen bell s gut

out and that twist fit with evidence however he was more critical of keith s near death writing what did feel like piling on however was beaver killing keith kristen bell tried her best to sell it but
