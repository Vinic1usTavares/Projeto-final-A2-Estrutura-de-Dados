thumb upright hyder avery macleod and mccarty used strands of purified dna such as this precipitated from solutions of cell components to perform bacterial transformations avery macleod mccarty experiment was an experimental demonstration reported in 1944 by oswald avery colin macleod and maclyn mccarty that dna is substance that causes bacterial transformation in an era when it had been widely believed that it was proteins that served function of carrying genetic information with very word protein itself coined to indicate a belief that its function was primary it was culmination of research in 1930s and early 20th century at rockefeller institute for medical research to purify and characterize transforming principle responsible for transformation phenomenon first described in griffith s experiment of 1928 killed streptococcus pneumoniae of virulent strain type iii s when injected along with living but non virulent type ii r pneumococci resulted in a deadly infection of type iii s pneumococci in their paper studies on chemical nature of substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types induction of transformation by a acid fraction isolated from pneumococcus type iii published in february 1944 issue of journal of experimental medicine avery and his colleagues suggest that dna rather than protein as widely believed at time may be hereditary material of bacteria and could be analogous to genes and or viruses in higher organisms fruton 1999 pp 438 440 thumb 400px avery and his colleagues showed that dna was key component of griffith s experiment in which mice are injected with dead bacteria of one strain and live bacteria of another and develop an infection of dead strain s type with development of serological typing medical researchers were able to sort bacteria into different strains or types when a person or test animal e g a mouse is inoculated with a particular type an immune response ensues generating antibodies that react specifically with antigens on bacteria blood serum containing antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria antibodies will react with other bacteria of same type as original inoculation fred neufeld a german bacteriologist had discovered pneumococcal types and serological typing until frederick griffith s studies bacteriologists believed that types were fixed and unchangeable from one generation to next lehrer steven explorers of body 2nd edition iuniverse 2006 p 46 griffith s experiment reported in 1928 identified that some transforming principle in pneumococcal bacteria could transform them from one type to another griffith a british medical officer had spent years applying serological typing to cases of pneumonia a frequently fatal disease in early 20th century he found that multiple types some virulent and some non virulent were often present over course of a clinical case of pneumonia and thought that one type might change into another rather than simply multiple types being present all along in testing that possibility he found that transformation could occur when dead bacteria of a virulent type and live bacteria of a non virulent type were both injected in mice mice would develop a fatal infection normally only caused by live bacteria of virulent type and die and virulent bacteria could be isolated from such infected mice findings of griffith s experiment were soon confirmed first by fred neufeld at koch institute and by martin henry dawson at rockefeller institute dawson martin h of r and s forms of pneumococcus journal of experimental medicine volume 47 no 4 1 april 1928 577 591 a series of rockefeller institute researchers continued to study transformation in years that followed with richard h p sia dawson developed a method of transforming bacteria in vitro rather than in vivo as griffith had done after dawson s departure in 1930 james took up attempt to extend griffith s findings resulting in extraction of aqueous solutions of transforming principle by 1933 colin macleod worked to purify such solutions from 1934 to 1937 and work was continued in 1940 and completed by maclyn mccarty fruton

pneumococcus is characterized by smooth colonies which have a polysaccharide capsule that induces antibody formation different types are classified according to their immunological specificity purification procedure avery undertook consisted of first killing bacteria with heat and extracting saline soluble components next protein was precipitated out using chloroform and polysaccharide capsules were hydrolyzed with an enzyme an immunological precipitation caused by type specific antibodies was used to verify complete destruction of capsules then active portion was precipitated out by alcohol fractionation resulting in fibrous strands that could be removed with a stirring rod chemical analysis showed that proportions of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and phosphorus in this active portion were consistent with chemical composition of dna to show that it was dna rather than some small amount of rna protein or some other cell component that was responsible for transformation avery and his colleagues used a number of biochemical tests they found that trypsin chymotrypsin and ribonuclease enzymes that break apart proteins or rna did not affect it but an enzyme preparation of a crude preparation obtainable from a number of animal sources that could break down dna destroyed extract s transforming power follow up work in response to criticism and challenges included purification and crystallization by moses kunitz in 1948 of a dna i and precise work by rollin hotchkiss showing that virtually all detected nitrogen in purified dna came from glycine a breakdown product of nucleotide base adenine and that undetected protein contamination was at most 0 02 by hotchkiss s estimation fruton 1999 p 439 thumb 150px oswald avery thumb 150px colin macleod thumb 150px maclyn mccarty with watson and crick experimental findings of avery macleod mccarty experiment were quickly confirmed and extended to other hereditary characteristics besides polysaccharide capsules however there was considerable reluctance to accept conclusion that dna was genetic material according to phoebus levene s influential tetranucleotide hypothesis dna consisted of repeating units of four nucleotide bases and had little biological specificity dna was therefore thought to be structural component of chromosomes whereas genes were thought likely to be made of protein component of chromosomes morange 1998 pp 30 1999 pp 440 441 this line of thinking was reinforced by 1935 crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus by wendell stanley and parallels among viruses genes and enzymes many biologists thought genes might be a sort of super enzyme and viruses were shown according to stanley to be proteins and to share property of with many enzymes on intersecting theories of viruses genes and enzymes in this period see angela n h life of a virus tobacco mosaic virus as an experimental model 1930 1965 university of chicago press chicago 2002 furthermore few biologists thought that genetics could be applied to bacteria since they lacked chromosomes and sexual reproduction in particular many of geneticists known informally as phage group which would become influential in new discipline of molecular biology in 1950s were dismissive of dna as genetic material and were inclined to avoid messy biochemical approaches of avery and his colleagues some biologists including fellow rockefeller institute fellow alfred mirsky challenged avery s finding that transforming principle was pure dna suggesting that protein contaminants were instead responsible although transformation occurred in some kinds of bacteria it could not be replicated in other bacteria nor in any higher organisms and its significance seemed limited primarily to medicine deichmann pp 220 222 scientists looking back on avery macleod mccarty experiment have disagreed about just how influential it was in 1940s and early 1950s gunther stent suggested that it was largely ignored and only celebrated afterwards similarly to gregor mendel s work decades before rise of genetics others such as joshua lederberg and leslie c dunn attest to its early significance and cite experiment as beginning of molecular genetics deichmann pp 207 209 a few and geneticists had taken an interest in physical and chemical nature of genes before 1944 but avery macleod mccarty experiment brought renewed and wider interest in subject while original publication did not mention genetics specifically avery as well as many of geneticists who read paper were aware of genetic implications that avery may have isolated gene itself as pure dna biochemist erwin chargaff geneticist h j muller and others praised result as establishing biological specificity of dna and as having important implications for genetics if dna played a similar role in higher organisms in 1945 royal society awarded avery copley medal in part for his work on bacterial transformation deichmann pp 215 220 between 1944 and 1954 paper was cited at least 239 times with citations spread evenly through those years mostly in papers on microbiology and biochemistry in addition to follow up work by mccarty and others at rockefeller institute in response to mirsky s criticisms experiment spurred considerable work in microbiology where it shed new light on analogies between bacterial heredity and genetics of sexually reproducing organisms french microbiologist andre claimed to extend avery s bacterial transformation findings to escherichia coli although this could not be confirmed by other researchers in 1946 however joshua lederberg and edward tatum demonstrated bacterial conjugation in e coli and showed that genetics could apply to bacteria even if avery s specific method of transformation was not general avery s work also motivated maurice wilkins to continue x ray crystallographic studies of dna even as he faced pressure from funders to focus his research on whole cells rather than biomolecules despite significant number of citations to paper and positive responses it received in years following publication avery s work was largely neglected by much of scientific community although received positively by many scientists experiment did not seriously affect mainstream genetics research in part because it made little difference for classical genetics experiments in which genes were defined by their behavior in breeding experiments rather than their chemical makeup h j muller while interested was focused more on physical rather than chemical studies of gene as were most of members of phage group avery s work was also neglected by nobel foundation which later expressed public regret for failing to award avery a nobel prize deichmann pp 227 231 by time of 1952 hershey chase experiment geneticists were more inclined to consider dna as genetic material and alfred hershey was an influential member of phage group morange 1998 pp 44 1999 pp 440 442 erwin chargaff had shown that base composition of dna varies by species contrary to tetranucleotide hypothesis and in 1952 rollin hotchkiss published his experimental evidence both confirming chargaff s work and demonstrating absence of protein in avery s transforming principle furthermore field of bacterial genetics was quickly becoming established and biologists were more inclined to think of heredity in same terms for bacteria and higher organisms after hershey and chase used radioactive isotopes to show that it was primarily dna rather than protein that entered bacteria upon infection with bacteriophage it was soon widely accepted that dna was material despite much less precise experimental results they found a not insignificant amount of protein entering cells as well as dna hershey chase experiment was not subject to same degree of challenge its influence was boosted by growing network of phage group and following year by publicity surrounding dna structure proposed by watson and crick watson was also a member of phage group
