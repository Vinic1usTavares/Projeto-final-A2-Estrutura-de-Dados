mari modern tell hariri was an ancient semitic city in modern day syria its remains constitute a tell located 11 kilometers north west of abu kamal on euphrates river western bank some 120 kilometers southeast of deir ez zor it flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900 bc and 1759 bc as a purposely built city existence of mari was related to its position in middle of euphrates trade routes this position made it an intermediary between sumer in south and levant in west mari was first abandoned in middle of 26th century bc but was rebuilt and became capital of a hegemonic east semitic state before 2500 bc this second mari engaged in a long war with its rival ebla and is known for its strong affinity with sumerian culture it was destroyed in 23rd century bc by akkadians who allowed city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing title of shakkanakku military governor governors later became independent with rapid disintegration of akkadian empire and rebuilt city as a regional center in middle euphrates valley shakkanakkus ruled mari until second half of 19th century bc when dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons a short time after shakkanakku collapse mari became capital of amorite lim dynasty amorite mari was short lived as it was annexed by babylonia in c 1761 bc but city survived as a small settlement under rule of babylonians and assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during hellenistic period worshiped both semitic and sumerian deities and established their city as a center of old trade however although pre amorite periods were characterized by heavy sumerian cultural influence mari was not a city of sumerian immigrants but rather a semitic speaking nation that used a dialect similar to eblaite amorites were west semites who began to settle area before 21st century bc by lim dynasty s era c 1830 bc they became dominant population in fertile crescent mari s discovery in 1933 provided an important insight into geopolitical map of ancient mesopotamia and syria due to discovery of more than 25 000 tablets that contained important information about administration of state during 2nd millennium bc and nature of diplomatic relations between political entities in region they also revealed wide trading networks of 18th century bc which connected areas as far as afghanistan in southern asia and crete in mediterranean region name name of city can be traced to mer an ancient storm deity of northern mesopotamia and syria who was considered patron deity of city georges noted that name of city was spelled identically to that of storm god and concluded that mari was named after him history 280 px thumb mari s landmarks first kingdom mari is not considered a small settlement that later grew but rather a new city that was purposely founded during mesopotamian early dynastic period i c 2900 bc to control waterways of euphrates trade routes that connect levant with sumerian south city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from euphrates river to protect it from floods and was connected to river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which meander it used for transport which is hard to identify today city is difficult to excavate as it is buried deep under later layers of habitation a defensive system against floods composed of a circular embankment was unearthed in addition to a circular 6 7 m thick internal rampart to protect city from enemies an area 300 meters in length filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters separated outer embankment from inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters and was strengthened by defensive towers other findings include one of city gates a street beginning at center and ending at gate and residential houses mari had a central mound but no temple or palace has been unearthed there a large building was however excavated with dimensions of 32 meters x 25 meters and seems to have had an administrative function it had stone foundations and rooms up to 12 meters long and 6 meters wide city was abandoned at end of early dynastic period ii c 2550 bc for unknown reasons second kingdom around beginning of early dynastic period iii earlier than 2500 bc mari was rebuilt and populated again new city kept many of first city s exterior features including internal rampart and gate also kept was outer circular embankment measuring 1 9 km in diameter which was topped by a wall two meters thick capable of protecting archers thumb 150 px left statue of il 25th century bc however internal urban structure was completely changed and new city was carefully planned first to be built were streets that descended from elevated center into gates ensuring drainage of rain water at heart of city a royal palace was built that also served as a temple four successive architectural levels from second kingdom s palace have been unearthed oldest is designated p3 while latest is p0 last two levels are dated to akkadian period first two levels were excavated findings include a temple named enceinte sacree which was largest in city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated also unearthed were a pillared throne room and a hall with three double wood pillars leading to temple six more temples were discovered in city including temple called massif rouge to whom it was dedicated is unknown and temples dedicated to ninni zaza ishtarat ishtar ninhursag and shamash all temples were located in center of city except for ishtar temple area between enceinte sacree and massif rouge is considered to have been administrative center of high priest second kingdom appears to have been a powerful and prosperous political center its kings held title of lugal and many are attested in city most important source being letter of king enna dagan c 2350 bc which was sent to irkab damu of ebla in it mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements however reading of this letter is still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars mari ebla war thumb 280 px cylinder dating to second kingdom 25th century bc earliest attested king in letter of enna dagan is ansud who is mentioned as attacking ebla traditional rival of mari with whom it had a long war and conquering many of ebla s cities including land of next king mentioned in letter is sa umu who conquered lands of ra ak and king kun damu of ebla defeated mari in middle of 25th century bc war continued with ishtup isar of mari s conquest of emar at a time of eblaite weakness in mid 24th century bc king of ebla had to pay tribute to iblul il of mari who is mentioned in letter conquering many of ebla s cities and campaigning in burman region enna dagan also received tribute his reign fell entirely within reign of irkab damu of ebla who managed to defeat mari and end tribute mari defeated ebla s ally nagar in year seven of eblaite vizier s term causing blockage of trade routes between ebla and southern mesopotamia via upper mesopotamia war reached a climax when eblaite vizier ibbi made an alliance with nagar and kish to defeat mari in a battle near terqa ebla itself suffered its first destruction a few years after terqa in c 2300 bc during reign of mariote king hidar according to alfonso archi hidar was succeeded by isqi mari whose royal seal was discovered it depicts battle scenes causing archi to suggest that he was responsible for destruction of ebla while still a general just a decade after ebla s destruction c 2300 bc middle chronology mari itself was destroyed and burned by sargon of akkad michael give date as c 2265 bc short chronology third kingdom mari was deserted for two generations before being restored by akkadian king a governor was appointed to govern city who held title shakkanakku military governor akkad kept direct control over city which is evident by naram sin of akkad s appointment of two of his daughters to priestly offices in city shakkanakku dynasty thumb left lion of mari 22nd century bc first member of shakkanakku dynasty on lists is ididish who was appointed in c 2266 bc according to lists ididish ruled for 60 years and was succeeded by his son making position hereditary third mari followed second city in terms of general structure phase p0 of old royal palace was replaced by a new palace for shakkanakku another smaller palace was built in eastern part of city and contained royal burials that date to former periods ramparts were rebuilt and strengthened while embankment was turned into a defensive wall that reached 10 meters in width former sacred inclosure was maintained so was temple of ninhursag however temples of ninni zaza and ishtarat disappeared while a new temple called temple of lions dedicated to dagan was built by shakkanakku ishtup ilum and attached to it was a rectangular terrace that measured 40 x 20 meters for sacrifices akkad disintegrated during shar kali sharri s reign and mari gained its independence but use of shakkanakku title continued during following third dynasty of ur period a princess of mari married son of king ur nammu of ur and mari was nominally under ur hegemony however vassalage did not impede independence of mari and some shakkanakkus used royal title lugal in their votive inscriptions while using title of shakkanakku in their correspondence with ur s court dynasty ended for unknown reasons not long before establishment of next dynasty which took place in second half of 19th century bc lim dynasty second millennium bc in fertile crescent was characterized by expansion of amorites which culminated with them dominating and ruling most of region including mari which in c 1830 bc became seat of amorite lim dynasty under king yaggid lim however epigraphical and archaeological evidences showed a high degree of continuity between shakkanakku and amorite eras yaggid lim was ruler of suprum before establishing himself in mari he entered an alliance with ila kabkabu of but relations between two monarchs changed to an open war conflict ended with ila kabkabu capturing yaggid lim s heir yahdun lim and according to a tablet found in mari yaggid lim who survived ila kabkabu was killed by his servants however in c 1820 bc yahdun lim was firmly in control as king of mari thumb left goddess of vase 18th century bc yahdun lim started his reign by subduing seven of his rebelling tribal leaders and rebuilding walls of mari and terqa in addition to building a new fort which he named dur yahdun lim he then expanded west and claimed to have reached mediterranean however he later had to face a rebellion by banu yamina nomads who were centered at tuttul and rebels were supported by yamhad s king sumu epuh whose interests were threatened by recently established alliance between yahdun lim and eshnunna yahdun lim defeated yamina but an open war with yamhad was avoided as mariote king became occupied by his rivalry with shamshi adad i of assyria son of late ila kabkabu war ended in a defeat for mari and yahdun lim was assassinated in c 1798 bc by his possible son sumu yamam who himself got assassinated two years after ascending throne while shamshi adad advanced and annexed mari assyrian era and lim restoration shamshi adad appointed his son yasmah adad on throne of mari new king married yahdun lim s daughter while rest of lim family took refuge in yamhad and annexation was officially justified by what shamshi adad considered sinful acts on side of lim family to strengthen his position against his new enemy yamhad shamshi adad married yasmah adad to daughter of ishi addu of qatna however yasmah adad neglected his bride causing a crisis with qatna and he proved to be an unable leader causing rage of his father who died in c 1776 bc while armies of yarim lim i of yamhad were advancing in support of zimri lim heir of lim dynasty thumb investiture of zimri lim 18th century bc as zimri lim advanced a leader of banu simaal zimri lim s tribe overthrew yasmah adad opening road for zimri lim who arrived a few months after yasmah adad s escape and married princess shibtu daughter of yarim lim i a short time after his enthronement in c 1776 bc zimri lim s ascension to throne with help of yarim lim i affected mari s status zimri lim referred to yarim lim as his father and yamhadite king was able to order mari as mediator between yamhad s main deity hadad and zimri lim who declared himself a servant of hadad zimri lim started his reign with a campaign against banu yamina he also established alliances with eshnunna and hammurabi of babylon and sent his armies to aid babylonians new king directed his expansion policy toward north in upper khabur region which was named where he subjugated local petty kingdoms in region such as and forcing them into vassalage expansion was met by resistance of lim king of whom zimri lim defeated securing mariote control over region in c 1771 bc and kingdom prospered as a trading center and entered a period of relative peace zimri lim s greatest heritage was renovation of royal palace which was expanded greatly to contain 275 rooms exquisite artifacts such as goddess of vase statue and a royal archive that contained thousands of tablets relations with babylon worsened with a dispute over city of hit that consumed much time in negotiations during which a war against elam involved both kingdoms in c 1765 bc finally kingdom was invaded by hammurabi who defeated zimri lim in battle in c 1761 bc and ended lim dynasty while terqa became capital of a rump state named kingdom of hana later periods thumb shamash risha usur c 760 bc mari survived destruction and rebelled against babylon in c 1759 bc causing hammurabi to destroy whole city however mari was allowed to survive as a small village under babylonian administration an act that hammurabi considered merciful later mari became part of assyria and was listed among territories conquered by assyrian king tukulti ninurta i reigned 1243 1207 bc afterward mari constantly changed hands between assyria and babylon in middle of eleventh century bc mari became part of hana whose king tukulti mer took title king of mari and rebelled against assyria causing assyrian king ashur bel kala to attack city mari came firmly under authority of neo assyrian empire and was assigned in first half of 8th century bc to a certain nergal erish to govern under authority of king adad nirari iii reigned 810 783 bc in c 760 bc shamash risha usur an autonomous governor ruling parts of upper middle euphrates under nominal authority of ashur dan iii styled himself governor of lands of and mari so did his son ninurta usur however by that time mari was known to be located in so called land of making it unlikely that usur family actually controlled it and suggesting that title was employed out of historical reasons city continued as a small settlement until hellenistic period before disappearing from records people language and government thumb 140 px left a mariote from second kingdom 25th century bc founders of first city may have been sumerians or more probably east semitic speaking people from terqa in north i j gelb relates mari s foundation with kish civilization which was a cultural entity of east semitic speaking populations that stretched from center of mesopotamia to ebla in western levant at its height second city was home of about 40 000 people this population was east semitic speaking one and used a dialect much similar to language of ebla eblaite language while shakkanakku period had an east semitic akkadian speaking population west semitic names started to be attested in mari since second kingdom era and by middle bronze age west semitic amorite tribes became majority of pastoral groups in middle euphrates and khabur valleys amorite names started to be observed in city toward end of shakkanakku period even among ruling dynasty members during lim era population became predominantly amorite but also included akkadian named people and although amorite language became dominant tongue akkadian remained language of writing pastoral amorites in mari were called haneans a term that indicate nomads in general those haneans were split into banu yamina sons of right and banu simaal sons of left with ruling house belonging to banu simaal branch kingdom was also a home to tribes of suteans who lived in district of terqa mari was an absolute monarchy with king controlling every aspect of administration helped by scribes who played role of administrators during lim era mari was divided into four provinces in addition to capital provincial seats were located at terqa and tuttul each province had its own bureaucracy government supplied villagers with ploughs and agricultural in return for a share in harvest kings of mari sumerian king list skl records a dynasty of six kings from mari enjoying hegemony between dynasty of and dynasty of kish names of mariote kings were damaged on early copies of list and those kings were correlated with historical kings that belonged to second city however an undamaged copy of list that date to old babylonian period was discovered in shubat enlil and names bears no resemblance to any of historically attested monarchs of second city indicating that compilers of list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind that predate second city chronological order of kings from second kingdom era is highly uncertain nevertheless it is assumed that letter of enna dagan lists them in a chronological order many of kings were attested through their own votive objects discovered in city and dates are highly speculative for shakkanakkus lists are incomplete and after hanun dagan who ruled at end of ur era c 2008 bc c 1920 bc short chronology they become full of lacunae roughly 13 more shakkanakkus succeeded hanun dagan but only few are

sumerian language and art was indistinguishable from sumerian art so was architectural style mesopotamian influence continued to affect mari s culture during amorite period which is evident in babylonian scribal style used in city however it was less influential than former periods and a distinct syrian style prevailed which is noticeable in seals of kings which reflect a clear syrian
