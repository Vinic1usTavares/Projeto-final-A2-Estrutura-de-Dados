plateful of warmed up leftovers hodgman ann may 23 2005 tidy endings entertainment weekly retrieved july 11 2011 hodgman criticized writers decision to devoting too much of episode to mary alice storyline rather than focusing on other characters she wrote that rex s death did not come as a surprise noting just as a tv or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he s about to retire we know it s over for rex minute bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he ll make it hodgman stated that her interest in gabrielle and carlos storyline was ruined by john telling carlos about affair rather than carlos discovering it himself she also declared that lynette storyline was wrapped up almost as perfunctorily or maybe it only seems that way because it s long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where husband and wife switch places hodgman concluded by saying fates of susan and mike are predictable as characters are too
