black and blue was written by james yoshimura and directed by series executive producer tom fontana like other three second season episodes script was already finished by time first season ended but due to poor nielsen ratings throughout duration of show nbc executives asked for several refinements including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts before approving a second season although yoshimura continued working on homicide throughout entire life of show he considered black and blue his favorite script braugher also complimented writing particularly during interrogation scene with his character i didn t dare judge my character before i did that scene andre braugher doesn t judge frank pembleton about being right or wrong it s a way for me to remain blessedly free of conscience but for me beauty of that scene was that we really dared to get into it typically in tv shows we skim over edges of issues like water spiders spouting platitudes and spouting unearned clarifying emotions but there were no violins strumming in black and blue pembleton s investigation of fellow police officers for a suspicious shooting was based on a real life investigation chronicled in david simon s 1991 non fiction book homicide a year on killing streets from which homicide series was adapted baltimore police department detective donald worden on whom bolander character is based handled actual real life investigation in 1988 however howard s affair with perpetrator was not part of real life incident but rather was added by yoshimura as part of show s efforts to ensure as many detectives were personally involved in storylines as possible several members of baltimore police department publicly criticized homicide for its negative portrayal of police in episode and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to executive producer barry levinson over matter kalat p 131 cellist zuill bailey served as a body double for ned beatty in scenes with bolander playing cello bailey was studying at baltimore s peabody conservatory at time and his appearance on homicide led to further collaborations with tom fontana including a recurring guest appearance for bailey on fontana s drama series oz episode featured guest appearances by isaiah washington who went on to play preston burke on medical drama series grey s anatomy kalat p 136 and julianna margulies who started her long running lead role as nurse carol hathaway on medical drama series er a few months after black and blue aired she was cast in part after having worked with fontana on unaired pilot of philly heat an abc miniseries he worked on about members of philadelphia fire department fontana offered margulies a recurring role on homicide but she turned it down in favor of er michael s kennedy an actor from richmond texas reprised his role of lt jimmy tyron from previous episode see no evil a struggling actor kennedy received a call from a casting director he knew in middle of an all night virginia beach shoot for a small role in assault at west point court martial of johnson whittaker giving him one day s notice of audition for homicide he so enjoyed working on show that he wrote a homicide script himself with tyron character playing a major part although it was ultimately never used black and blue also featured second of five guest appearances by mel proctor then home team sports announcer for washington bullets as grant besser a recurring reporter character in homicide songs slow fire by just like jane and up on roof by gerry goffin and carole king were featured in black and blue during final scene bolander and linda perform a movement of passacaglia a classical music song composed by george frideric handel reception ratings while season premiere episode bop gun opened with an extremely high rating due to a guest appearance by robin williams ratings had declined since then and tom fontana said a future decision about whether

grahnke gave episode four stars and said anyone who likes nypd blue should give homicide a try tom shales of washington post strongly praised both black and blue and see no evil in part because they
