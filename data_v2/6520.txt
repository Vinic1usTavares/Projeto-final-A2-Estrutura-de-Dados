cabbage or headed cabbage comprising several cultivars of brassica oleracea is a leafy green red purple or white pale green biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense leaved heads it is descended from wild cabbage b oleracea var oleracea and belongs to cole crops or brassicas meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower var botrytis brussels sprouts var and savoy cabbage var sabauda cabbage heads generally range from and can be green purple or white smooth leafed firm headed green cabbages are most common smooth leafed purple cabbages and leafed savoy cabbages of both colors are rarer it is a multi layered vegetable under conditions of long sunny days such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer cabbages can grow quite large heaviest cabbage was cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in europe before 1000 bc although savoys were not developed until 16th century ad by middle ages cabbage had become a prominent part of european cuisine cabbage heads are generally picked during first year of plant s life cycle but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross pollination cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies as well as to multiple pests and bacterial and fungal diseases cabbages are prepared many different ways for eating they can be pickled fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut steamed stewed sauteed braised or eaten raw cabbage is a good source of vitamin k vitamin c and dietary fiber food and agriculture organization of united nations fao reported that world production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2014 was 71 8 million metric tonnes with china accounting for 47 of world total taxonomy and etymology thumb cabbage cabbage brassica oleracea or b oleracea var capitata var tuba var sabauda or var is a member of genus brassica and mustard family several other cruciferous vegetables sometimes known as cole crops are considered cultivars of b oleracea including broccoli collard greens brussels sprouts kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli all of these developed from wild cabbage b oleracea var oleracea also called or field cabbage this original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics such as large heads for cabbage large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli varietal epithet capitata is derived from latin word for having a head b oleracea and its derivatives have hundreds of common names throughout world cabbage was originally used to refer to multiple forms of b oleracea including those with loose or non existent heads a related species brassica rapa is commonly named chinese napa or celery cabbage and has many of same uses it is also a part of common names for several unrelated species these include cabbage bark or cabbage tree a member of genus and cabbage palms which include several genera of palms such as roystonea oleracea and euterpe oenocarpus original family name of brassicas was cruciferae which derived from flower petal pattern thought by medieval europeans to resemble a crucifix katz and weaver p 279 word brassica derives from a celtic word for cabbage many european and asiatic names for cabbage are derived from slavic root cap or kap meaning head late middle english word cabbage derives from word head from picard dialect of old french this in turn is a variant of old french through centuries cabbage and its derivatives have been used as slang for numerous items occupations and activities cash and tobacco have both been described by slang cabbage while cabbage head means a fool or stupid person and means to be exhausted or in a vegetative state description thumb right upright cabbage inflorescence which appears in plant s second year of growth features white or yellow flowers each with four perpendicularly arranged petals cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate heart shaped cotyledon first leaves produced are ovate egg shaped with a lobed petiole plants are tall in their first year at mature vegetative stage and tall when flowering in second year dixon p 19 heads average between with fast growing earlier maturing varieties producing smaller heads most cabbages have thick alternating leaves with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected some varieties have a waxy bloom on leaves plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow about 90 percent of root mass is in upper of soil some lateral roots can penetrate up to deep inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring tall with flowers that are yellow or white each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern as well as four sepals six stamens and a superior ovary that is two celled and contains a single stigma and style two of six stamens have shorter filaments fruit is a that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape self pollination is impossible and plants are cross pollinated by insects initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves each measuring by after this leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through leaves cupping inward many shapes colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage leaf types are generally divided between crinkled leaf loose head savoys and smooth leaf firm head cabbages while color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples oblate round and pointed shapes are found katz and weaver p 280 cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics frost hardiness fast growth and storage ability appearance of cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding with varieties being chosen for shape color firmness and other physical characteristics ordas and cartea p 128 breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving nutritional content of cabbage ordas and cartea p 135 scientific research into genetic modification of b oleracea crops including cabbage has included european union and united states explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance history thumb right cabbage with moong dal curry although cabbage has an extensive history a brief historical sketch is in toussaint samat a history of food 2nd ed 2009 pp it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to many varieties of leafy greens classified as brassicas wild ancestor of cabbage brassica oleracea originally found in britain and continental europe is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats dixon p 2 retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened turgid leaves according to triangle of u theory of evolution and relationships between brassica species b oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables cabbages kale broccoli brussels sprouts and cauliflower represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than near eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat because of wide range of crops developed from wild b oleracea multiple broadly contemporaneous of cabbage may have occurred throughout europe cabbages and kale were probably first to be domesticated before 1000 bc katz and weaver p 284 perhaps by celts of central and western europe recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas unidentified brassicas were part of highly conservative unchanging mesopotamian garden repertory cabbage plants are mentioned by a leo oppenheim ancient mesopotamia portrait of a dead civilization rev ed 1977 p 313 it is believed that ancient egyptians did not cultivate cabbage which is not native to nile valley though a word shaw t in papyrus harris of time of ramesses iii has been interpreted as cabbage ptolemaic egyptians knew cole crops as under influence of greek krambe which had been a familiar plant to macedonian antecedents of ptolemies by early roman times egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other vegetables and pulses selected papyri i 186 noted in alan k bowman egypt after pharaohs p 151 ancient greeks had some varieties of cabbage as mentioned by theophrastus although whether they were more closely related to today s cabbage or to one of other brassica crops is unknown headed cabbage variety was known to greeks as krambe and to romans as brassica or open leafy variety kale was known in greek as and in latin as caulis chrysippus of wrote a treatise on cabbage which pliny knew pliny s natural history 20 78 83 but it has not survived greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical and that cabbage planted too near vine would impart its unwelcome odor to grapes this mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today toussaint samat p 622 brassica was considered by some romans a table luxury although lucullus considered it unfit for senatorial table toussaint samat p 623 more traditionalist cato elder espousing a simple republican life ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar he said it surpassed all other vegetables and approvingly distinguished three varieties he also gave directions for its medicinal use which extended to cabbage eater s urine in which infants might be rinsed cato de agricultura passages are paraphrased by pliny elder pliny elder listed seven varieties including pompeii cabbage cumae cabbage and cabbage according to pliny pompeii cabbage which could not stand cold is taller and has a thick stock near root but grows thicker between leaves these being and narrower but their tenderness is a valuable quality pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by columella in de re rustica apicius gives several recipes for tender cabbage shoots greeks and romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout headaches and symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion antipathy towards vine made it seem that eating cabbage would enable one to avoid drunkenness toussaint samat p 622 cabbage continued to figure in materia medica of antiquity as well as at table in first century ad dioscorides mentions two kinds of with medical uses cultivated and wild and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through 17th century at end of antiquity cabbage is mentioned in de on observance of foods of anthimus a greek doctor at court of

also a familiar staple of poor in lean year of 1420 bourgeois of paris noted that poor people ate no bread nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes without any bread or salt french naturalist jean ruel made what is considered first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise de natura stirpium referring to it as coles head coles sir anthony ashley 1st baronet did not disdain to have a cabbage at foot of his monument in wimborne st giles in istanbul sultan selim iii penned a tongue in cheek ode to cabbage without cabbage halva feast was not complete a translation is in mary isin sherbet and spice complete story of turkish sweets and desserts 2013 p 146 cabbages spread from europe into mesopotamia and egypt as a winter vegetable and later followed trade routes throughout asia and americas absence of sanskrit or other ancient eastern language names for cabbage suggests that it was introduced to south asia relatively recently in india cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from portugal who established trade routes from 14th to 17th centuries carl peter thunberg reported that cabbage was not yet known in japan in 1775 many cabbage varieties including some still commonly grown were introduced in germany france and low countries during 16th century german gardeners developed savoy cabbage during 17th and 18th centuries cabbage was a food staple in such countries as germany england ireland and russia and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten tannahill pp 289 291 sauerkraut was used by dutch scandinavian and german sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages jacques cartier first brought cabbage to americas in 1541 42 and it was probably planted by early english colonists despite lack of written evidence of its existence there until mid 17th century by 18th century it was commonly planted by both colonists and native american indians cabbage seeds traveled to australia in 1788 with first fleet and were planted same year on norfolk island it became a favorite vegetable of australians by 1830s and was frequently seen at sydney markets there are several guinness book of world records entries related to cabbage these include heaviest cabbage at heaviest red cabbage at longest cabbage roll at and largest cabbage dish at in 2012 scott robb of palmer alaska broke world record for heaviest cabbage at cultivation thumb left a cabbage field cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads produced during first year of its biennial cycle plants perform best when grown in well drained soil in a location that receives full sun different varieties prefer different soil types ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay but all prefer fertile ground with a ph between 6 0 and 6 8 for optimal growth there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in soil especially during early head formation stage and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during early stages of expansion of outer leaves wien and wurr p 533 temperatures between prompt best growth and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting flowering bradley et al pp 56 57 flowering induced by periods of low temperatures a process called vernalization only occurs if plant is past juvenile period transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when stem diameter is about vernalization allows plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering in certain climates cabbage can be planted at beginning of cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower a practice that was common in eastern us wien and wurr pp 512 515 thumb right upright green and purple cabbages plants are generally started in protected locations early in growing season before being transplanted outside although some are seeded directly into ground from which they will be harvested seedlings typically emerge in about 4 6 days from seeds planted deep at a soil temperature between maynard and hochmuth p 111 growers normally place plants apart closer spacing reduces resources available to each plant especially amount of light and increases time taken to reach maturity wien and wurr p 534 some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use these are generally called flowering cabbage they do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white red or pink early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity while late varieties take about 120 days maynard and hochmuth p 415 cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to touch they are harvested by cutting stalk just below bottom leaves with a blade outer leaves are trimmed and any diseased damaged or necrotic leaves are removed delays in harvest can result in head splitting as a result of expansion of inner leaves and continued stem growth wien and wurr p 524 factors that contribute to reduced head weight include growth in compacted soils that result from no till farming practices drought waterlogging insect and disease incidence and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds when being grown for seed cabbages must be isolated from other b oleracea subspecies including wild varieties by to prevent cross pollination other brassica species such as b rapa b b nigra b and raphanus sativus do not readily cross pollinate katz and weaver p 282 cultivars thumb white cabbage there are several cultivar groups of cabbage each including many cultivars savoy characterized by crimped or curly leaves mild flavor and tender texture spring greens loose headed commonly sliced and steamed green light to dark green slightly pointed heads this is most commonly grown cultivar red smooth red leaves often used for pickling or stewing white also called dutch smooth pale green leaves some sources only delineate three cultivars savoy red and white with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed into latter ordas and cartea p 124 cultivation problems due to its high level of nutrient requirements cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies including boron calcium phosphorus and potassium there are several physiological disorders that can affect postharvest appearance of cabbage internal tip burn occurs when margins of inside leaves turn brown but outer leaves look normal necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around midrib in pepper spot tiny black spots occur on areas between veins which can increase during storage fungal diseases include wirestem which causes weak or dying transplants fusarium yellows which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves and blackleg see which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray brown spotted leaves fungi brassicae and a cause dark leaf spots in affected plants they are both and airborne and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest causes post emergence disease wirestem resulting in killed seedlings damping off root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads thumb right cabbage moth damage to a savoy cabbage one of most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is black rot caused by campestris which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at leaf margins and wilting of plants caused by slime mold like organism brassicae results in swollen club like roots downy mildew a parasitic disease caused by oomycete parasitica produces pale leaves with white brownish or olive mildew on lower leaf surfaces this is often confused with fungal disease powdery mildew pests include root knot nematodes and cabbage maggots which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves aphids which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves harlequin bugs which cause white and yellow leaves thrips which lead to leaves with white bronze spots striped flea beetles which riddle leaves with small holes and caterpillars which leave behind large ragged holes in leaves bradley et al pp 57 59 caterpillar stage of small cabbage white butterfly pieris rapae commonly known in united states as imported cabbage worm is a major cabbage pest in most countries large white butterfly pieris brassicae is prevalent in eastern european countries diamondback moth

insects include cabbage root fly delia and cabbage maggot hylemya brassicae whose larvae can burrow into part of plant consumed by humans planting near other members of cabbage family or where these plants have been placed in previous years can prompt spread of pests and disease excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems production cabbage production 2014 country production millions of tonnes 33 4 9 0 5 3 3 5 2 9 1 9 1 5 world 71 8 small source faostat of united nations in 2014 global production of cabbages combined with other brassicas was 71 8 million tonnes led by china with 47 of world total table other major producers were india russia and south korea cabbages sold for market are generally smaller and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale those used for processing especially sauerkraut are larger and have a lower percentage of water both hand and mechanical harvesting are used with hand harvesting generally used for cabbages destined for market sales in commercial scale operations hand harvested cabbages are trimmed sorted and packed directly in field to increase efficiency vacuum cooling rapidly vegetable allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product cabbage can be stored longest at with a humidity of 90 100 percent these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity when stored under less ideal conditions cabbage can still last up to four months katz and weaver p 285 culinary use cabbage consumption varies widely around world russia has highest annual per capita consumption at followed by belgium at netherlands at and spain at americans consume annually per capita cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways simplest options include eating vegetable raw or steaming it though many cuisines pickle stew or cabbage pickling is one of most popular ways of preserving cabbage creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi although kimchi is more often made from chinese cabbage b rapa savoy cabbages are usually used in salads while smooth leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing bean curd and cabbage is a staple of chinese cooking tannahill p 146 while british dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat tannahill p 277 in poland cabbage is one of main food crops and it features prominently in polish cuisine it is frequently eaten either cooked or as sauerkraut as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as cabbage sauerkraut meat and wild mushrooms among other ingredients stuffed cabbage and filled dumplings other eastern european countries such as hungary and romania also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient in india and ethiopia cabbage is often included in spicy salads and in united states cabbage is used primarily for production of coleslaw followed by market use and sauerkraut production characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by glucosinolates a class of sulfur containing glucosides although found throughout plant these compounds are concentrated in highest quantities in seeds lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue and they decrease as tissue ages katz and weaver pp 282 283 cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent unpleasant odor and taste these develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced nutrients and phytochemicals cabbage is a rich source of vitamin c and vitamin k containing 44 and 72 respectively of daily value dv per 100 gram amount right table of usda nutrient values cabbage is also a moderate source 10 19 dv of vitamin b6 and folate with no other nutrients having significant content per 100 gram serving table basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti disease effects such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates studies on cruciferous vegetables including cabbage include whether they may lower risk against colon cancer cabbage is a source of indole 3 a chemical under basic research for its possible properties herbalism in addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable cabbage has been used historically in herbalism ancient greeks recommended consuming vegetable as a laxative and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning for eye salves and for liniments for bruises ancient roman pliny elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of vegetable ancient egyptians ate cooked cabbage at beginning of meals to reduce intoxicating effects of wine janick p 51 this traditional usage persisted in european literature until mid 20th century cooling properties of leaves were used in britain as a treatment for trench foot in world war i and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses other medicinal uses recorded in european folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism sore throat hoarseness colic and melancholy both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts pneumonia appendicitis and ulcers there is no clinical evidence that cabbage has any medicinal properties disadvantages bloating excessive consumption of cabbage may lead to increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to which human small intestine cannot digest food borne illness cabbage has been linked to outbreaks of some food borne illnesses including listeria monocytogenes and clostridium latter toxin has been traced to pre made packaged coleslaw mixes while spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage two outbreaks of e coli in united states have been linked to cabbage consumption biological risk assessments have concluded that there is potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage due to contamination at many stages of growing harvesting and packaging processes contaminants from water humans animals and soil have potential to be transferred to cabbage and from there to
