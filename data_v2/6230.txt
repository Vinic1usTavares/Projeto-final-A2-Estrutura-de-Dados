arado e 381 smallest fighter was a proposed parasite fighter aircraft conceived by arado flugzeugwerke in december 1944 for germany s luftwaffe during world war ii e 381 was to have been carried aloft by and launched from an arado ar 234 mother aircraft it would then have activated its rocket engine which would have propelled it to attack allied mainly american and british bombers development was cancelled due to lack of funds and official support pp 153 and smith p p 101 there were three proposed variants each had fuel capacity for only two target runs after which pilot would have been required to glide without power to a landing on underbelly skids to survive close pursuits e 381 was designed with narrowest frontal cross section possible to increase its chances of surviving shots from front this also forced pilot to lie in a prone position cross section was or approximately a quarter of cross section of messerschmitt bf 109 development thumb left a computer rendered image of an arado e 381 suspended under belly of ar 234c mother ship near end of world war ii in december 1944 german aircraft manufacturers arado bmw gotha heinkel henschel and zeppelin submitted design proposals for small rocket or jet powered aircraft intended for pursuit or ground attack duties all these proposals exploited luftwaffe s concept of gaining a tactical advantage by placing excessive stress on man in cockpit german pilot albrecht p 103 g forces envisioned in these proposals were feasible for aircraft structures but exceeded human capabilities in a normal sitting position designers attempted to alleviate this constraint by placing pilot in prone position which increased sustainable g force limit this also allowed a reduction in fuselage size weight and drag a smaller cross section also decreased likelihood of being hit by enemy gunners and arado exploited this opportunity to fullest according to their specific design philosophy fighter was designed to fly close to bomber formations and open fire from its mk 108 cannon at point blank range e 381 began in a proposal from arado flugzeugwerke to air ministry for a parasite fighter carried underneath another aircraft to destroy allied bombers three variants of e 381 named mark i ii and iii were designed each version was essentially an armored tube provided with armament and a walter hwk 109 509 rocket engine for power aircraft would have carried enough fuel for two approaches to target as well as only sixty some say forty five rounds after using all his fuel during an attack it was intended that pilot would glide fighter to ground deploy its drogue parachute and land aircraft on a primitive skid landing gear none of designs were ever completed due to its cancellation though some wooden airframes and a single mockup were constructed in 1944 to provide prone position training for pilots e 381 was cancelled due to a lack of funds and interest by ministry of aviation along with a scarcity of mother ar 234 p pp 145 146 arado ar 234c four bmw 003 jet engined aircraft intended for this purpose was never flight tested before war s end variants thumb 500px an x ray sideview drawing

381 i alt a graphic view of arado e 381 first design mark i had a fuselage with a circular cross section and a small round window in nose for pilot vision a armored shell protected most of fuselage pilot would have been in a prone position in very cramped cockpit cross section was or approximately a quarter of cross section of messerschmitt bf 109 behind a removable bullet resistant glass screen mounted in front of pilot two small bulges were located on sides of fuselage for pilot s elbows three c stoff tanks surrounded pilot with t stoff oxidizer tank in center section between pilot and engine aircraft had straight wings mounted at top of aircraft in dorsal area at wing mounts fuselage humped to accommodate a blister for a single mk 108 cannon and 60 other writers say 45 rounds lepage pp 257 258 walter hwk 109 single chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath aft fuselage which also carried a twin fin empennage and drogue parachute housing landing aircraft required extension of retractable landing skid and deployment of a braking drogue parachute as pilots could access plane only from a hatch above cockpit pilot would have to enter e 381 before it could be attached to carrier ar 234c and had no way to escape in case of an emergency while attached to carrier pp 150 155 arado e 381 ii second design mark ii was very similar to mark i aside from being larger and having smaller fins variant was planned to have a deeper and shorter fuselage and a high mid wing layout it was to be powered by a walter hwk 109 509 a 2 engine unit was rated at of thrust about a quarter of way back from nose fuselage deepened in form of a hump which extended to tail this hump housed a single mk 108 cannon with 45 rounds arado e 381 iii third design mark iii was also similar to mark i aside from being larger than any of preceding variants circular cross section of previous variants became more triangular and mk 108 cannon was replaced with six rockets of an unspecified type although landing procedure was unchanged a hatch was added on side to provide for simpler pilot entry and exit specifications e 381 i right 300px alt a three view of an arado e 381 i thumb a three
