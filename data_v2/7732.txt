827th tank destroyer battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of united states army active during second world war it was activated in april 1942 as a segregated african american unit deploying to europe at end of 1944 and attached to 12th armored division it saw action during operation nordwind in january 1945 where elements of battalion performed creditably however its overall combat record was marred by severe disciplinary problems and insufficient training it was withdrawn in february and assigned to rear area duties while it nominally remained active for remainder of war it had been effectively disbanded background us army s basic wartime racial policy established in 1937 dictated that both whites and african americans were to be inducted into army in equal proportions and strength but that they were to be assigned to segregated units black soldiers could be led by white officers but not vice versa and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by war department mix of combat and support service units was in theory to be roughly equal between both groups this caused tension between department and operational commanders with latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units lee pp 49 50 in practice almost all combat units in pre war period were white lee p 44 in response to growing pressure for a more equal distribution white house issued a statement in october 1940 which while reaffirming segregation provided that negro organizations will be established in each major branch of service lee pp 75 76 first black armored units which had been a matter of great public interest were activated in early 1941 lee pp 120 121 two black tank destroyer units were formed that december as tank destroyer battalions were treated as a separate arm of service a further five were activated in 1942 and four in addition to two planned but later canceled in 1943 lee p 122 early service thumb right african american soldiers from an unknown unit manning a m3 gmc during training circa 1943 827th tank destroyer battalion was activated on april 20 1942 at camp forrest tennessee one of five such battalions created that year initially armed with m3 gmc half tracks it later received self propelled m10 tank destroyer before being reorganized as a towed battalion equipped with trucks and 3 anti tank guns it finally returned to a self propelled unit equipped with m18 hellcats lee p 679 at no point during this constant reshuffling did unit ever receive a full allocation of equipment lee p 487 at same time original officer cadre was replaced twice first with black officers then with white officers from other disbanded segregated battalions by time battalion sailed overseas it had seen eight separate commanding officers lee pp 679 80 unit emerged from these repeated reorganizations in very poor state training was inadequate with unit repeatedly failing battalion competence tests and some areas of combat training notably indirect fire were avoided altogether discipline and order within unit was equally low in september 1944 battalion held two courts martials for murder situation was so dire that battalion s commander felt it was likely that he would oversee disbanding of battalion or its conversion into a non combat service unit latter of which had already happened to a number of other segregated tank destroyer battalions lee pp 679 80 827th was originally scheduled to be sent to pacific theater but in february 1944 it was declared insufficiently trained and held back for further preparation a different unit was substituted at last minute lee p 487 next six months did not show great improvement in quality but nonetheless battalion was eventually sent overseas it arrived in marseille in late 1944 deploying to front in december attached to 12th armored division lee p 680 combat thumb right 500px tank destroyer battalion sp structure march 1944 first portion of 827th to be deployed for combat was a single company in support of 714th tank battalion of 12th armored division on 20 december 1944 lee p 679 failing to see action company was withdrawn to reserve after three days on line discipline proved to be a problem during this period with men abandoning their guns to collect firewood despite assistance and advice from 614th tank destroyer battalion an experienced and well regarded black unit operating in same area a second company was used for screening purposes in first week of january also not seeing combat while remainder of battalion narrowly avoided being assigned to an indirect fire role it was completely unprepared for lee p 681 on 6 january battalion while still attached to 12th armored division was assigned to participate in task force wahl led by 79th infantry division which was defending against january 1945 german counteroffensive in alsace lorraine region disciplinary problems persisted company ordered to lead move was unable to deploy as most of its men were absent and remainder mostly drunk by time battalion managed to move one of its officers had shot a man and been shot himself while trying to restore order among his company and in a separate incident a sergeant had been assaulted by one of his own men and defending himself accidentally shot a bystander lee p 681 following two weeks saw a period of prolonged combat as task force slowly fell back to pressure of german offensive with battalion split up among various commands and often cut off or out of communication infantry units tank destroyers were assigned to expected to take full operational control often giving inappropriate orders more suited to tanks than to lightly armored breeding resentment among battalion s crews at same time 827th had trained with expectation that gunners would fire only on direct instruction of their own officers which limited both their ability to co operate with outsiders and their willingness to adapt and improvise during small scale combat vehicle commanders regularly argued about orders or refused to act on them without their own commander present in one case on 9 january an infantry commander threatened to shoot a m18 crew if it did not engage a german tank stranded on roadside lee pp 682 3 not all elements of battalion suffered similar problems however on same day 9 january b company destroyed eleven german tanks advancing on village of rittershoffen with four more next day while another section working with tank destroyer battalion in hatten nearby accounted for nine these units remained with infantry in village for several days unable to withdraw and acquitted themselves well in close fighting this was all more of an achievement when it was considered that leaving disciplinary problems aside battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced lee pp 683 4 one member of battalion was awarded silver star converse p 88 fn 30 while 79th division recommended a crew which had fought in hatten to receive bronze stars it is unclear if these were ever awarded lee p 685 service duties following reports of disciplinary problems vi corps ordered an investigation which took place over four days while elements of battalion were still engaged at rittershoffen it recommended that battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander while major general edward h brooks corps commander instead recommended that battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units general alexander patch commanding seventh army agreed with brooks suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from men of service units themselves replaced by men of 827th this was contentious however number and status of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate and converting a black combat unit to a service one in favor of white troops was likely controversial lee p 684 as discussion continued battalion was withdrawn from front lines leaving task force wahl on 23 january it returned to 12th armored division where three platoons were committed to combat to support fighting in colmar pocket in first week of february remainder of battalion was kept in reserve where disciplinary problems including assaults on civilians grew to point at which commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 february battalion was removed from its attachment to 12th armored on 12 february by request of divisional command and withdrawn to rear area of xv corps to take up guard duties lee pp 685 686 battalion s future had been referred to sixth army group controlling formation for further consideration after some debate they requested investigation be reopened with a particular focus on enlisted men of unit lee p 685 second inspection showed that enlisted men were broadly competent at their duties but that most of them preferred rear area duties over combat roles inspection recommended that enlisted men be transferred to one of segregated infantry divisions in event unit was assigned to sixth army group headquarters where it was used in a service role it remained nominally active to avoid political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit lee p
