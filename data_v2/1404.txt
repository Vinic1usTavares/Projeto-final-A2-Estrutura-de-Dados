banksia aquilonia commonly known as northern banksia is a tree in family proteaceae native to north queensland on australia s northeastern coastline with an average height of it has narrow glossy green leaves up to long and high pale yellow flower spikes known as inflorescences appearing in autumn as spikes age their flowers fall off and they develop up to 50 follicles each of which contains two seeds alex george described plant in his 1981 monograph of genus banksia as a variety of banksia integrifolia but later reclassified it as a separate species genetic studies show it to be related to banksia plagiocarpa banksia oblongifolia and banksia robur species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark it is rarely cultivated description thumb left bright green and brownish new growth and green follicles on spike in summer banksia aquilonia grows as a tall shrub or small tree up to high though plants up to have been recorded it has hard fissured grey bark and narrow elliptic or lanceolate leaves measuring long by wide with entire straight margins and acute tips they are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent midrib covered in red brown hair brownish new growth appears in summer plant is in bloom from march to june flowers occur in banksia characteristic vertical flower spike an inflorescence made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis b aquilonia flower spike is a pale yellow colour roughly cylindrical high and up to in diameter tubular perianths of individual flowers are long these open at maturity anthesis to release styles all old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on bare woody spike follicles measure long high and wide furry at first they become smooth with age and open when ripe and their two half oval valves split to release one or two seeds they contain obovate dark grey brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator measuring long they are made up of a wedge shaped seed body long by wide woody separator is same shape as seed with an impression where seed body lies next to it seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons around long juvenile leaves are narrower measuring long and wide and often have serrate toothed margins although inflorescences of banksia aquilonia are similar to b integrifolia leaves are marked in their differences midrib on leaves undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish brown hairs and leaves are spirally arranged on branches rather than in whorls as in all b integrifolia subspecies it was these differences that george felt were distinctive enough for it to be separate it as a full species from b integrifolia overall habit of a banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of b integrifolia though is generally smaller southernmost populations of b aquilonia are separated from northernmost b integrifolia occurrence by hence location is helpful in identification variants field volunteers for banksia atlas recorded plants with large adult and juvenile leaves up to long along tully to mission beach road and a population of smaller shrub sized plants to high with small narrow leaves long and wide at coronation lookout in national park plants with normal morphology occurring further down mountain taxonomy banksia aquilonia was first described by alex george in 1981 as a variety of banksia integrifolia coast banksia from a specimen collected at witts lookout in crystal creek national park south of ingham on 12 april 1975 species name is latin adjective meaning northern as it was most northerly form of b integrifolia in 1996 kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published a cladistic analysis of banksia based on morphology in which this taxon stood out as only member of b integrifolia to be both morphologically and geographically distinct from other infraspecific taxa they also noted that there were no intermediate plants between what was then known as b integrifolia var aquilonia and other populations of b integrifolia on this basis they would have liked to promote it to species rank but did not because their inferred phylogeny suggested that this taxon arose from within b integrifolia they were unwilling to render b integrifolia paraphyletic by elevating this taxon to species rank and they were equally unwilling to elevate all four varieties to species rank since others all had significant overlaps in distribution and morphology therefore they simply promoted all four to subspecies rank this example has since been held up as an interesting case study on how concept of species should be defined as it presents problem of a monophyletic group comprising a paraphyletic basal group of incompletely differentiated geographic forms within which is nested at least one divergent autapomorphic taxon that invites treatment as a species george promoted it to species rank on basis of its distinctive leaf arrangement and midrib in 1996 thus its full name with author citation is banksia aquilonia a s george a s george it is placed in subgenus banksia section banksia and series salicinae its placement within banksia may be summarised as follows genus banksia subgenus banksia section banksia series salicinae banksia dentata banksia aquilonia banksia integrifolia banksia plagiocarpa banksia oblongifolia banksia robur banksia conferta banksia paludosa banksia marginata banksia canei banksia saxicola series grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series quercinae section coccinea section oncostylis subgenus initially assigning banksia aquilonia to be variety of b integrifolia george noted that it had affinities with then newly described species banksia plagiocarpa with which it co occurs on and near hinchinbrook island in north queensland since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia aquilonia formed a clade with b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia and b robur rather than b integrifolia early in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b aquilonia is placed in b subg spathulatae common names include northern banksia white banksia honeysuckle or white bottlebrush a local aboriginal name is in and languages distribution and habitat thumb right range of banksia aquilonia occurs in coastal areas of northern queensland from cedar bay national park to range national park in areas with an annual rainfall of it occurs from near sea level to an altitude of in a variety of habitats and aspects it grows in wet sclerophyll forest or rainforest margins on plateaus ridges slopes and low lying swampy areas on sandy or rocky soils generally of granitic origin or sometimes clay it commonly grows with tree species such as pink bloodwood corymbia intermedia forest red gum eucalyptus tereticornis swamp turpentine lophostemon suaveolens forest oak allocasuarina torulosa and black sheoak a littoralis and understorey species such as coin spot wattle acacia and yellow wattle a flavescens much of its lowland habitat in wet tropics has been degraded or fragmented although range overlaps with b dentata two species are not known to occur together aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark regeneration from root suckers has also been recorded unlike many banksia species which release their seed after bushfires banksia aquilonia sets seed when follicles mature banksia inflorescences are energy rich sources of food and b aquilonia nectar is a likely food item of endangered mahogany glider petaurus gracilis as well as many other mammals and birds avian species observed visiting flower spikes include bridled honeyeater white cheeked honeyeater eastern spinebill and rainbow lorikeet aquilonia adapts readily to cultivation in humid or temperate climates but is rarely cultivated a fast growing plant it can grow in acidic soils from ph 3 5 to 6 5 propagation is generally by seed and plants flower at four to six years of age vegetative propagation is possible from semi hardened cuttings of pencil thickness flower spikes attract birds to garden it can also be grown in a pot with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense references external links aquilonia category
