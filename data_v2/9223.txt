character s true identity in an interview with total film he said that s for audience to decide my job is to show up and do a part i don t own audience s imagination singer said film is ambiguous about most of character s details but fax sent at end of film proves in his mind that kint is soze bryan enk writing for ugo states that myth making story of soze s origins is a classic ghost story that would be right at home in horror fiction writing about psychopaths in film academic wayne wilson explicitly compares soze to satan and assigns to him demonic motives wilson states that soze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over police this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity but soze cannot resist urge to show off and create mischief in journal of nietzsche studies lewis call states that soze s mythological status draws ire of authoritarian government agents because he represents a terrifying truth that power is ephemeral and has no basis in reality according to call soze s intermediaries usual suspects themselves are more useful to police as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld in direct contrast to soze himself hanna m roisman compares kint to odysseus capable of adapting both his personality and his tales to his current audience throughout his tale kint adapts his confession to kujan s revealed biases roisman draws direct parallels to odysseus tales to like odysseus kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative appealing to kujan s arrogance kint allows himself to be outwitted humiliated and broken by his interrogator kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives kujan privileged perspective of skeptic kint thus creates a neo noir thriller inside of a neo noir thriller and demonstrates artificiality of storytelling benjamin identifies post structural elements to film such as lack of a clear protagonist throughout much of film
