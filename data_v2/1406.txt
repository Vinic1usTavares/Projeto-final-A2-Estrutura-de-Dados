upright cabin console airborne real time cueing hyperspectral enhanced reconnaissance also known by acronym archer is an aerial imaging system that produces ground images far more detailed than plain sight or ordinary aerial photography can it is most sophisticated unclassified hyperspectral imaging system available according to u s government officials archer can automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of object being sought such as a missing aircraft for abnormalities in surrounding area or for changes from previous recorded spectral signatures it has direct applications for search and rescue counterdrug disaster relief and impact assessment and homeland security and has been deployed by civil air patrol cap in us on australian built gippsland ga8 airvan fixed wing aircraft cap civilian auxiliary of united states air force is a volunteer education and public service non profit organization that conducts aircraft search and rescue in us overview archer is a daytime non invasive technology which works by analyzing an object s reflected light it cannot detect objects at night underwater under dense cover underground under snow or inside buildings system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in belly of aircraft which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500 feet 800 meters and 100 knots 50 meters second ground speed system software was developed by space computer corporation of los angeles and system hardware is supplied by novasol corp of honolulu hawaii specifically for cap archer system is based on hyperspectral technology research and testing previously undertaken by united states naval research laboratory nrl and air force research laboratory afrl cap developed archer in cooperation with nrl afrl and united states coast guard research development center in largest interagency project cap has undertaken in its 74 year history since 2003 almost us 5 million authorized under 2002 defense appropriations act has been spent on development and deployment cap reported completing initial deployment of 16 aircraft throughout u s and training over 100 operators but had only used system on a few search and rescue missions and had not credited it with being first to find any wreckage in searches in georgia and maryland during 2007 archer located aircraft wreckage but both accidents had no survivors according to col drew alexa director of advanced technology and archer program manager at cap an archer equipped aircraft from utah wing of civil air patrol was used in search for adventurer steve fossett in september 2007 archer did not locate mr fossett but was instrumental in uncovering eight previously uncharted crash sites in high desert area of nevada some decades old col alexa described system to press in 2007 human eye sees basically three bands of light archer sensor sees 50 it can see things that are anomalous in vegetation such as metal or something from an airplane wreckage major cynthia ryan of nevada civil air patrol while also describing system to press in 2007 stated archer is essentially something used by geosciences it s pretty sophisticated stuff beyond what human eye can generally see she elaborated further it might see boulders it might see trees it might see mountains sagebrush whatever but it goes not that or yes that amazing part of this is that it can see as little as 10 per cent of target and extrapolate from there in addition to primary search and rescue mission cap has tested additional uses for archer for example an archer equipped cap ga8 was used in a pilot project in missouri in august 2005 to assess suitability of system for tracking hazardous material releases into environment and one was deployed to track oil spills in aftermath of hurricane rita in texas during september 2005 since then in case of a flight originating in missouri archer system proved its usefulness in october 2006 when it found wreckage in antlers okla national transportation and safety board was extremely pleased with data archer provided which was later used to locate aircraft debris spread over miles of rough wooded terrain in july 2007 archer system identified a flood borne oil spill originating in a kansas oil refinery that extended downstream and had invaded previously unsuspected reservoir areas 2007 civil air patrol annual report to congress client agencies epa coast guard and other federal and state agencies found data essential to quick remediation in september 2008 a civil air patrol ga 8 from texas wing searched for a missing aircraft from arkansas it was found in oklahoma identified simultaneously by ground searchers and overflying archer system rather than a direct find this was a validation of system s accuracy and efficacy in subsequent recovery it was found that archer plotted debris area with great accuracy technical description major archer subsystem components include advanced hyperspectral imaging hsi system with a resolution of one square meter per pixel panchromatic high resolution imaging hri camera with a resolution of 8 cm x 8 cm 3 in x 3 in per pixel global positioning system gps integrated with an inertial navigation system ins hyperspectral imager passive hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy remote sensor observes a target in multi spectral bands hsi camera separates image spectra into 52 bins from 500 nanometers nm wavelength at blue end of visible spectrum to 1100 nm in infrared giving camera a spectral resolution of 11 5 nm although archer records data in all 52 bands computational algorithms only use first 40 bands from 500 nm to 960 nm because bands above 960 nm are too noisy to be useful for comparison normal human eye will respond to wavelengths from approximately 400 to 700 nm and is trichromatic meaning eye s cone cells only sense light in three spectral bands as archer aircraft flies over a search area reflected sunlight is collected by hsi camera lens collected light passes through a set of lenses that focus light to form an image of ground imaging system uses a pushbroom approach to image acquisition with pushbroom approach focusing slit reduces image height to equivalent of one vertical pixel creating a horizontal line image horizontal line image is then projected onto a diffraction grating which is a very finely etched reflecting surface that disperses light into its spectra diffraction grating is specially constructed and positioned to create a two dimensional 2d spectrum image from horizontal line image spectra are projected vertically i e perpendicular to line image by design and arrangement of diffraction grating 2d spectrum image projects onto a charge coupled device ccd two dimensional image sensor which is aligned so that horizontal pixels are parallel to image s horizontal as a result vertical pixels are coincident to spectra produced from diffraction grating each column of pixels receives spectrum of one horizontal pixel from original image arrangement of vertical pixel sensors in ccd divides spectrum into distinct and non overlapping intervals ccd output consists of electrical signals for 52 spectral bands for each of 504 horizontal image pixels on board computer records ccd output signal at a frame rate of sixty times each second at an aircraft altitude of 2 500 ft agl and a speed of 100 knots a 60 hz frame rate equates to a ground image resolution of approximately one square meter per pixel thus every frame captured from ccd contains spectral data for a ground swath that is approximately one meter long and 500 meters wide high resolution imager a high resolution imaging hri black and white or panchromatic camera is mounted adjacent to hsi camera to enable both cameras to capture same reflected light hri camera uses a pushbroom approach just like hsi camera with a similar lens and slit arrangement to limit incoming light to a thin wide beam however hri camera does not have a diffraction grating to disperse incoming reflected light instead light is directed to a wider ccd to capture more image data because it captures a single line of ground image per frame it is called a line scan camera hri ccd is 6 144 pixels wide and one pixel high it operates at a frame rate of 720 hz at archer search speed and altitude 100 knots over ground at 2 500 ft agl each pixel in black and white image represents a 3 inch by 3 inch area of ground this high resolution adds capability to identify some objects processing a monitor in cockpit displays detailed images in real time and system also logs image and global positioning system data at a rate of 30 gigabytes gb per hour for later analysis on board data processing system performs numerous real time processing functions including data acquisition and recording raw data correction target detection cueing and chipping precision image geo registration and display and dissemination of image products and target cue information archer has three methods for locating targets signature matching where reflected light is matched to spectral signatures anomaly detection using a statistical model of pixels in image to determine probability that a pixel does not match profile and change detection which executes a pixel by pixel comparison of current image against ground conditions that were obtained in a previous mission over same area in change detection scene changes are identified and new moved or departed targets are highlighted for evaluation in spectral signature matching system can be programmed with parameters of a missing aircraft such as paint colors to alert operators of possible wreckage it can also be used to look for specific materials such as petroleum products or other chemicals released into environment or even ordinary items like commonly available blue polyethylene tarpaulins in an impact assessment role information on location of blue tarps used to temporarily repair buildings damaged in a storm can help direct disaster relief efforts in a counterdrug role a blue tarp located in a remote area could be associated with illegal activity references
