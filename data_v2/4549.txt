hurricane edouard was strongest hurricane in 1996 atlantic hurricane season reaching winds of 145 mph 230 km h on its path edouard remained a major hurricane for eight days an unusually long amount of time a cape verde hurricane storm formed near coast of africa in middle of august it moved westward then curved northward and persisted until early september when it became extratropical to southeast of new england edouard was originally forecast to strike northeast united states but it produced hurricane force gusts to portions of southeastern massachusetts while remaining offshore winds caused minor damage totaling 20 million in addition hurricane generated strong waves and rip currents to coastlines killing two people in ocean city md and causing numerous injuries meteorological history a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on august 19 accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure a large circulation quickly developed once it reached atlantic ocean and system organized into tropical depression four late on august 19 while located 345 mi 555 km southeast of cape verde initial forecasts predicted for great intensification including one forecast for depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days however depression remained disorganized and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on august 22 after becoming a tropical storm edouard quickly strengthened due to establishment of an upper level anticyclone over storm storm moved to west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north and edouard strengthened into a hurricane on august 23 due to very favorable conditions hurricane rapidly strengthened on august 24 and august 25 to peak as a 145 mph 230 km h category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale a weakness in subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to west northwest and hurricane passed about 250 mi 400 km north of lesser antilles on august 28 for three days during this time edouard maintained category 4 intensity though weakened late on august 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear right thumb hurricane edouard to south southeast of massachusetts on september 1 late on august 29 hurricane edouard developed three concentric eyewalls an unusual occurrence coinciding with an increase in strength to 140 mph 220 km h a mid tropospheric trough turned hurricane to north to

edouard turned to east then moved around periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by storm early on september 7 preparations a high pressure system over new england resulted in possibility that edouard would track to west and strike united states one computer model predicted hurricane would strike near atlantic city new jersey with winds of over 111 mph 178 km h on labor day this caused cape may county officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for busiest tourist weekend of year though an evacuation never occurred due to possibility for a landfall on east coast
