recently received german code books captured from beached cruiser magdeburg was aware that an operation was taking place but was not sure where germans would strike therefore admiralty ordered david beatty s 1st battlecruiser squadron six battleships of 2nd battle squadron and several cruisers and destroyers to intercept german battlecruisers however beatty s task force nearly ran headlong into entire high seas fleet at 06 20 beatty s destroyer screen came into contact with german torpedo boat this began a confused 2 hour battle between british destroyers and german cruiser and destroyer screen often at very close range at time of first encounter helgoland class battleships were less than away from six british dreadnoughts this was nearly within firing range but in darkness neither british nor german admirals were aware of composition of their opponents fleets admiral ingenohl aware of kaiser s order not to risk battle fleet without his express approval concluded that his forces were engaging screen of entire grand fleet and so 10 minutes after first contact he ordered a turn to southeast continued attacks delayed turn but by 06 42 it had been carried out for about 40 minutes two fleets were steaming on a parallel course at 07 20 ingenohl ordered a further turn to port which put his ships on a course for safety of german bases on 17 january ingenohl ordered helgoland to go

battleship could be eliminated germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent russian ships from returning to gulf helgoland and majority of other big ships of high seas fleet remained outside gulf for entirety of operation dreadnoughts and posen were detached on 16 august to escort minesweepers and to destroy slava though they failed to sink old battleship after three days russian minefields had been cleared and flotilla entered gulf on 19 august but reports of allied submarines in area prompted a german withdrawal from gulf following day battle of jutland thumb helgolands bridge and forward main battery turrets alt a large warship s bridge and two gun turrets under command of captain von helgoland fought at battle of jutland alongside her sister ships in i battle squadron for majority of battle i battle squadron formed center of line of battle behind rear admiral behncke s iii battle squadron and followed by rear admiral mauve s elderly pre dreadnoughts of ii

shell from either or in forward part of ship shell hit armored belt about 0 8 m 32 in above waterline where armor was only 15 cm thick 15 inch shell broke up on impact but it still managed to tear a hole in hull it rained splinters on foremost port side 15 cm gun though it could still be fired approximately 80 tons of water entered ship by 23 30 high seas fleet had entered its night cruising formation order had largely been inverted with four nassau class ships in lead followed directly by helgolands with kaisers and konigs astern of them rear was again brought up by elderly pre dreadnoughts mauled german battlecruisers were by this time scattered at around midnight on 1 june helgoland and nassau class ships in center of german line came into contact with british 4th destroyer flotilla 4th flotilla broke off action temporarily to regroup but at around 01 00 unwittingly stumbled into german dreadnoughts a second time helgoland and oldenburg opened fire on two leading british destroyers helgoland fired six salvos from her secondary guns at destroyer fortune before she succumbed to tremendous battering shortly after helgoland shifted fire to an unidentified destroyer helgoland fired five salvos from her 15 cm guns to unknown effect british destroyers launched torpedoes at german ships but they managed to successfully evade them with a turn to starboard following return to german waters helgoland and thuringen along with s nassau posen and took up defensive positions in jade roadstead for night during battle ship suffered only minor damage helgoland was hit by a single 15 inch shell but sustained minimal damage nevertheless dry docking was required to repair hole in belt armor work was completed by 16 june in course of battle helgoland had fired 63 main battery shells and 61 rounds from her 15 cm guns later career after battle of jutland admiral scheer argued that fleet could not break british naval blockade that only resumption of unrestricted u boat warfare would be successful as a result high seas fleet largely remained in port with exception of two abortive sorties in august and october 1916 in april 1917 helgoland accidentally rammed new battlecruiser which was in process of fitting out as she left her berth in october 1917 helgoland in company with oldenburg went to to receive light cruisers and which were

arrived on scene both ships surrendered their crews were taken ashore and incarcerated rebellion then spread ashore on 3 november an estimated 20 000 sailors dock workers and civilians fought a battle in kiel in an attempt to secure release of jailed mutineers by 5 november red flag of socialists flew above every capital ship in wilhelmshaven save following day a sailors council took control of base and a train carrying mutineers from helgoland and thuringen was stopped in cuxhaven where men escaped according to terms of treaty of versailles all four helgoland class battleships were disarmed and surrendered as prizes of war to allies as replacements for ships scuttled in scapa flow on 21 22 november 1918 helgoland steamed to harwich to retrieve crews of u boats that had been surrendered
