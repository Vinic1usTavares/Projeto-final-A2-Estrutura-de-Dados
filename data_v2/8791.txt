lublin of 1569 established polish lithuanian commonwealth a more closely unified federal state replacing previously existing personal union of two countries union was largely run by polish and increasingly polonized lithuanian and ruthenian nobility through system of central parliament and local assemblies but from 1573 led by elected kings formal rule of proportionally more numerous than in other european countries nobility constituted a sophisticated early democratic system in contrast to absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in rest of europe polish lithuanian union had become an influential player in europe and a vital cultural entity spreading western culture eastward in second half of 16th and first half of 17th century polish lithuanian commonwealth was a huge state in central eastern europe with an area approaching one million square kilometers following reformation gains warsaw confederation of 1573 was culmination of unique in europe religious toleration processes catholic church embarked on an ideological counter offensive and counter reformation claimed many converts from protestant circles disagreements over and difficulties with assimilation of eastern ruthenian populations of commonwealth had become clearly discernible at an earlier stage from late 16th century they manifested themselves in religious union of brest which split eastern christians of commonwealth and on military front in a series of cossack uprisings commonwealth assertive militarily under king stephen bathory suffered from dynastic distractions during reigns of vasa kings sigismund iii and wladyslaw iv it had also become a playground of internal conflicts in which kings powerful and factions of nobility were main actors commonwealth fought wars with russia sweden and ottoman empire at commonwealth s height some of its powerful neighbors experienced difficulties of their own and polish lithuanian state sought domination in eastern europe in particular over russia allied with habsburg monarchy it did not directly participate in thirty years war tsar ivan iv of russia undertook in 1577 hostilities in livonian region which resulted in his takeover of most of area and caused polish lithuanian involvement in livonian war successful counter offensive led by king bathory and jan zamoyski resulted in peace of 1582 and retaking of much of territory contested with russia with swedish forces establishing themselves in far north estonia estonia was declared a part of commonwealth by sigismund iii in 1600 which gave rise to a war with sweden over livonia war lasted until 1611 without producing a definite outcome in 1600 as russia was entering a period of instability commonwealth proposed a union with russian state this failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful often adventurous attempts some involving military invasions other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming while differences between two societies and empires proved in end too formidable to overcome polish lithuanian state ended up in 1619 after truce of deulino with greatest ever expansion of its territory at same time it was weakened by huge military effort made in 1620 ottoman empire under sultan osman ii declared a war against commonwealth at disastrous battle of tutora hetman stanislaw zolkiewski was killed and commonwealth s situation in respect to turkish tatar invasion forces became very precarious a mobilization in poland lithuania followed and when hetman jan karol chodkiewicz s army withstood fierce enemy assaults at battle of khotyn 1621 situation improved on southeastern front more warfare with ottomans followed in 1633 1634 and vast expanses of commonwealth had been subjected to tatar incursions and slave taking expeditions throughout period war with sweden now under gustavus adolphus resumed in 1621 with his attack on riga followed by swedish occupation of much of livonia control of baltic sea coast up to puck and blockade of danzig commonwealth exhausted by warfare that had taken place elsewhere in 1626 1627 mustered a response utilizing military talents of hetman stanislaw koniecpolski and help from austria under pressure from several european powers campaign was stopped and ended in truce of altmark leaving in swedish hands much of what gustavus adolphus had conquered another war with russia followed in 1632 and was concluded without much change in status quo king wladyslaw iv then proceeded to recover lands lost to sweden at conclusion of hostilities sweden evacuated cities and ports of

this king would serve as monarch until he died at which time country would have another election this monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic because of high degree of influence wielded by noble classes often seen as a single non homogenous class in 1572 sigismund ii augustus last king of jagiellonian dynasty died without any heirs political system was not prepared

elements it evolved into an original polish form of baroque baroque art was developing to a great extent under patronage of catholic church which utilized art to facilitate religious influence allocating for this purpose very substantial financial resources at its disposal most important in this context art form was architecture with features rather austere at first accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts beginning in 1580s a number of churches patterned after church of gesu in rome had been built gothic and other older churches were increasingly being supplemented with baroque style architectural additions sculptures wall paintings and other ornaments which is conspicuous in many polish churches today royal castle

only way for any monarch s successor to assume office thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in future henrician articles summarized accumulated rights of polish nobility including religious freedom guarantees and introduced further restrictions on elective king as if that were not enough henry also signed so called pacta conventa through which he accepted additional specific
