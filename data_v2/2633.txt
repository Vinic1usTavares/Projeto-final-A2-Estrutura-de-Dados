just way you are and grenade bruno mars revealed he wanted to create something unexpected with its follow up this is me going into studio and recording and writing whatever i want mars said confidently this album represents my freedom it all started backstage after a show during a jamming session in a greenroom while singing phrase locked out of heaven according to philip lawrence track developed a meaning as they started to write it when you re with someone who s showing you a new way to love smeezingtons went to new york to work with jeff bhasker emile haynie and mark ronson and during a jamming session with drums bass and guitar mars created riff of song he started singing chorus previously created on top of riff then smeezingtons went back to l a where they finished lyrics and changed original melody lawrence felt that recording was sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it making them enthusiastic to place a driving rhythm in it composer recalled thinking it was something special in studio same way he did during creation of just way you are and billionaire jeff bhasker one of song s producers explained track s roots as it came in middle of process of putting together album he further elaborated we were just having a jam session tracking some things and bruno started playing this groove and making up something on spot we all thought it was pretty good we wound up working a long time on that trying to get it just right locked out of heaven began as a cha cha style duet sounding like santana s smooth ronson asked dap kings to collaborate on track in order to get a crisply syncopated locked in groove according to michael leonhart he contributed with thriller 1984 vibe horns to song however they didn t make final version of track regarding development of song smeezingtons thought there s a good pocket on this song right now let s keep it going mars also mentioned that it took a long time to create it commenting people didn t see us going at each other s throats in studio and pulling out our hair he added trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line lawrence believes lack of heavy hitting drums and presence of a

locked out of heaven for too long can i just stay here spend rest of my days here he sings during his google hangout on day of song s release mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from track mars picked phrase but swimming in your water is something spiritual and said that single s exploration of feeling and being in love fits into sensual sensual and sensual theme of album it has been described as a reggae rock and pop rock track heavily influenced by new wave and funk tim sendra of allmusic described song as a breezy mashup of beat it 1982 police and dire straits for paul macinnes of guardian called it a brazen but successful welding of dire straits sultans of swing 1978 and can t stand losing you 1978 by police carl williott of idolator found out that angular guitars and mars sting like staccato delivery are heavily indebted to police also seeing hints of foster people on omnipresent eh eh eh eh ooo punctuating beat melinda newman of hitfix commented that song has a police 80s rock skipping beat plus a touch of romantics what i like about you 1980 mikael wood of los angeles times likened it to police era ghost in machine 1981 heavily influenced by human league jon caramanica of new york times simply called it a vivid carbon copy of zenyatta 1980 era police though critics have pointed out song s similarities to some of hits by police mars told mtv news that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by sting fronted band instead it came to him out of blue one night during his studio sessions prior to recording unorthodox jukebox album i don t think it initially tried to sound like anybody else but i picked up guitar and just started playing song s opening chords mars explained that s how it normally works i ll pick up a guitar and i ll start humming a melody and i started singing that and i was up there in sting ville in that register so that s what you get john marx a partner in music division at william morris endeavor wme who was responsible for managing moonshine jungle tour said it s type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket it has that live element to it it was a very active track critical reception thumb right majority of music critics noted similarities between locked out of heaven to a handful of tracks by english rock band police pictured later mars admitted that song was inspired by band song has received positive reviews from most music critics robert copsey of digital spy was positive giving song a rating of 5 out of 5 stars praising 80s styled funk beats and wildly infectious percussion singalong chorus may be a hasty reminder that his strength lies in fist clenching he also wrote that considered song one of most interesting musical evolutions of 2012 jody rosen of rolling stone gave song 3 5 out of 5 stars writing that song is about unbridled passion but as usual with mars aesthetic is tidy and impeccable pop songcraft polished to a high gloss gleam jittery police esque rock reggae verses that erupt amid thunder boom synths into a four on floor chorus carl williott of idolator also gave song a positive review writing that it shows an interesting musical evolution and called song interesting and marks it as a shift for mars and his style ryan reed of paste magazine called it a driving pop anthem that moves from a punchy roxanne esque new wave groove to a soulful synth driven chorus matt cibula of popmatters further explained track writing it starts out like an early police single with some straight up de blanc syncopation and a shockingly good sting vocal impression but chorus opens up to turn into something less police y and more dare i say it bruno mars y kitty empire of observer wrote that song channels police but its 21st century builds owe as much to rave pop as they do to producer mark ronson it s an ill omened meeting that somehow gels jason lipshut of billboard gave a very positive review stating that locked out of heaven is mars best solo single to date with singer songwriter yelping about fornication as a tossed salad of chopped guitars and vocal exclamations buttress his sumptuous leading man act sometimes perfect lead single is hard to find other times it walks right up to you and delivers a big cozy hug melinda newman of hitfix praised mars singing and catchy little background vocals which according to her keep song moving downstream at a rapid pace she also noted that even clumsy lyrics like your sex takes me to paradise can t diminish that joy that beats and melody bring accolades locked out of heaven

concept of video shows mars having a good time with his bandmates doing things like smoking drinking beer and playing games he is also seen singing song with his band at a club video has a vintage style reminiscent of vhs tapes mars said concept is just old fashioned fun no story line it s not me singing to a girl you get a good sense of what you re going to get live it s very vhs y i love that man it takes me back to my childhood when tracking is off and color is off there s a beauty in that you d have to stand by tv with like aluminum foil all over you hugh mcintire of billboard explained video writing everything about locked out of heaven whether it be video or track itself is retro while song references early discography of police video takes us back a little bit further from style of their dress and wonky tv effects on video one might guess that bruno and his friends are partying in 70s only akai mpc sampler being played by a band member reminds viewer that this video is in fact modern reception idolator reviewer sam lansky wrote that mars is serving up all kinds of retro flavor in clip for that song which eschews higher concept vibe of his other videos dancing monkeys in lazy song for a mellower vibe adding that video is all filtered with instagram evoking effects that give it grainy feel of an old tape rolling stone commented that video takes place in a dingy club however real attraction here are grainy visuals filmed in fake fuzziness giving clip a retro feel chris martins of spin magazine said video s vintage style may be slightly off since song sounds far more sting than curtis mayfield but regarded it as a good one nonetheless music video for song received multiple awards and nominations in 2013 it received a nomination for outstanding music video at naacp image award at 2013 mtv video music awards japan visual received three nominations for best male video video of year and best song it also received nominations for video of year best pop video

shimmy ya and a few hip swivels bruno s ska bop jam was given new life it all seems so effortless so cool and fresh pop performances don t often fall ahead of curve but this one does sam lansky of
