subterranean jungle is seventh studio album by american punk rock band ramones released by sire records on february 23 1983 album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces this is because guitarist johnny ramone received more leeway in steering overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs recording sessions saw disputes between band members mainly because many of them were dealing with alcohol addiction or in bassist dee dee ramone s case other drugs album begins with two cover songs and features a third on side 2 lyrics circle various themes while structuring of songs shifted towards hard rock psychedelic rock album was deemed by critics to be an attempt to retreat to band s roots and received mostly positive reviews subterranean jungle was not very successful commercially peaking at number 83 on us billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally singles released from album did not chart either this is last album by band to feature marky ramone on drums until 1989 album brain drain conception unlike previous albums subterranean jungle shifted band s sound output focus towards getting back to their punk rock roots rather than trying to expand fan base by releasing more pop oriented songs this change is due to guitarist johnny ramone obtaining more priority over style choice johnny felt as though band needed to be focused and stop worrying about getting played on radio and just make a good record since lead singer joey ramone was not given as much stylistic freedom album lacks sense of pop influence which previous releases had contained and instead was shaped mostly by johnny s hard rock background bowe 2010 p 66 johnny obtained more control over musical style because band members experienced conflict amongst themselves specifically rooted in each member excluding johnny facing issues with addiction both joey and drummer marky ramone were dealing with alcoholism while bassist dee dee ramone was severely addicted to cocaine and was undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment since ramones previous two releases had producers which proved disappointing to members they were skeptical of upcoming producer this would be ritchie cordell with whom they also had issues true 2005 p 177 porter 2004 p 104 marky relates i hated production i hated producer true 2005 p 180 artwork for subterranean jungle features an image of band inside a subway car photograph was taken by george dubose at subway station on 57th street and sixth avenue in manhattan this cover concept was designed by dubose who suggested that since b sixth avenue express train stopped at empty station for about 20 minutes leigh 2009 pp 227 228 in photograph marky is featured peering out subway window marky was positioned this way after johnny asked dubose to do so because they were kicking him out of band but he didn t know it yet marky recalled that he liked that shot but he knew something was up internal conflicts during recording sessions would cause band members to fire marky during album s recording consequently substituting him with drummer billy rogers on time has come today johnny recounts we were having trouble with mark because his drinking problem was really bad so we did time has come today with a different drummer billy rogers from walter lure s band ramone 2012 ch 11 time has come today became ramones only song to involve three drummers marky ramone on album credits billy rogers on recording and richie ramone on music video compositions and lyrics album opens with two cover songs first little bit o soul was originally written by john carter and ken lewis and second i need your love was first performed by bobby dee waxman subterranean jungle is first ramones release to begin with a song not written by band this track list structure was criticized by author everett true who said that it was disorientating johnny also thought that fact that album featured three covers was a bad idea saying we shouldn t have but i was happy with guitar sound on it album s third track outsider was written by dee dee and in 2002 it was covered by green day on shenanigans myers 2006 p 189 what d ya do was track number four and was described by music journalist chuck eddy as crudely metallic eddy 2011 p 34 eddy also deemed next track highest trails above as aor mystic somebody like me was called a full on rock anthem by everett true who went on to say that lyrics contained no nonsense lines true 2005 p 179 side b of album begins with psycho therapy which was written by both johnny and dee dee song has since grown into one of ramones most popular songs dee dee recalled i knew we needed a real ramones song for album and i knew johnny was depressed about how things were going he needed that song to get excited about band again next track is another cover song time has come today which was originally recorded by soul music group chambers brothers ramones version of song featured a psychedelic rock influence and was said by eddy to have more of a garage feel to it as compared to original my my kind of a girl was directed specifically toward band s female fandom lyrics were written by joey about meeting a girl on 8th street in manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her in vanity fair song was regarded as a lingering affection for phil spector s pop grandeur dee dee s time bomb which was track number eleven was said by true to be more ridiculous than frightening album concludes with everytime i eat vegetables it makes me think of you which was said by author todd anderson to be a sing along anderson 2006 ch 5 release and reception subterranean jungle was released by sire records in february 1983 ramone 2002 p 237 in a contemporary review for village voice music journalist robert christgau wrote that despite containing two inferior pieces highest trails above and i need your love album is more worthy of an audience than anything they ve done in 80s stereo review magazine strongly recommended it to headbangers of all ages as a textbook ramones album whose lyrics about mental illness and drug abuse can actually be refreshing album peaked at number 83 in on billboard 200 in us but failed to chart elsewhere neither of album s singles psycho therapy and time has come today charted in a retrospective review for allmusic author stephen thomas erlewine called subterranean jungle band s most enjoyable record since rocket to russia and said that producers steered ramones back toward 60s pop infatuation that provided foundation for their early records he ended his review by stating that it may not be defined as strictest sense of punk rock however he strongly suggested that band had not sounded so alive since their earlier days douglas wolk writing in rolling stone album guide 2004 was less enthusiastic and called it an attempt at radio friendly production with a series of cover songs that almost recasts group as an oldies act wolk 2004 p 675 6 in a 2004 interview for new york magazine johnny ramone graded album a b and said that he was pleased with its guitar sound despite three cover songs while remarking i was
