frame a view through mark iii free gun reflector sight first produced in 1943 used on british army guns naval guns and as a pilot sight and a defensive gun sight on aircraft reticle image in this sight is produced by an optical collimator bounced off a beam splitter dot remains on target even though viewer s head is moved side to side a reflector sight or reflex sight is an optical device that allows user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed on field of view these sights work on simple optical principle that anything at focus of a lens or curved mirror such as an illuminated reticle will appear to be sitting in front of viewer at infinity reflector sights employ some sort of reflector to allow viewer to see infinity image and field of view at same time either by bouncing image created by lens off a slanted glass plate or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images reticle while viewer looks through reflector since reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with device sight is attached to regardless of viewer s eye position removing most of parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices since their invention in 1900 reflector sights have come to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons they were used on fighter aircraft in a limited capacity in world war i widely used in world war ii and still used as base component in many types of modern head up displays they have been used in other types of usually large weapons as well such as anti aircraft gun sights anti tank gun sights and any other role where operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view and sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function there was some limited use of sight on small arms after world war ii but it came into widespread use after late 1970s with invention of red dot sight with a red light emitting diode led as its reticle making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time reflector sights are also used in civilian applications such as sights on surveying equipment optical telescope pointing aids and camera design thumb diagram of three types of reflector sights top uses a collimating lens cl and a beam splitter b to create a virtual image at infinity v of a reticle r bottom two use half silvered curved mirrors cm as collimating optics reflector sights work by using a lens or an image forming curved mirror with a luminous or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that observer looking through beam splitter or mirror will see image at focus of collimating optics superimposed in sight s field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity since optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light light that is nearly parallel light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with axis of device or gun barrel it is aligned with i e with no parallax at infinity collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in cylindrical volume of collimated light created by sight behind optical window but this also means for targets closer than infinity sighting towards edge of optical window can make reticle move in relation to target since observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at edge eye movement perpendicular to device s optical axis will make reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in cylindrical column of light created by collimating optics american rifleman volume 93 national rifle association of america reflector sight by john b butler page 31 a common type used in applications such as aircraft gun sights uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter this type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components lens and beam splitter glass plate reticle optics are situated at 90deg to optical path making lighting difficult usually needing additional electric illumination condensing lenses etc a more compact type replaces lens beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining image of an offset reticle this type is most often seen as red dot type used on small arms it is also possible to place reticle between viewer and curved mirror at mirror s focus reticle itself is too close to eye to be in focus but curved mirror presents viewer with an image of reticle at infinity this type was invented by dutch optical engineer lieuwe van albada in 1932 originally as a camera viewfinder and was also used as a gunsight on world war ii bazookas us m9 and m9a1 bazooka featured folding reflecting sight assembly viewing portion of a reflector sight does not use any refractive optical elements it is simply a projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into users eye this gives it defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights a reflector sight also does not have field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes depending on design constraints their field of view is user s naked eye field of view and their non focusing collimated nature means they don t have optical telescopes constraint of eye relief reflector sights can be combined with telescopes usually by placing telescope directly behind sight so it can view projected reticle creating a telescopic sight but this re introduces problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate reticle to function reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails american rifleman volume 93 national rifle association of america reflector sight by john b butler page 29 history thumb 1901 diagram of a version of howard grubb s collimating reflector sight designed to make a compact version suitable for firearms and small devices ambient lighting of reticle was improved by placing it facing up and bouncing it off a relay mirror then off a concave collimating mirror idea of a reflector sight originated in 1900 with irish optical designer and telescope maker howard grubb in patent no 12108 grubb conceived of his gun sight for large and small ordnance as a better alternative to difficult to use iron sight while avoiding telescopic sight s limited field of view greater apparent target speed parallax errors and danger of keeping eye against an eye stop in 1901 scientific transactions of royal dublin society he described his invention as thumb upright left prototype of grubb reflector sight attached to a rifle it was noted soon after its invention that sight could be a good alternative to iron sights and also had uses in surveying and measuring equipment reflector sight was first used on german fighter aircraft in aircraft armament vol 2 guns and gunsights by r wallace clarke page 134 and widely adopted on all kinds of fighter and bomber aircraft in 1930s by world war ii reflector sight was being used on many types of weapons besides aircraft including anti aircraft guns naval guns anti tank weapons and many other weapons where user needed simplicity and quick target acquisition nature of sight through its development in 1930s and into world war ii sight was also being referred to in some applications by abbreviation reflex sight applied physics chauncey guy suits george russell harrison louis jordan 1948 page 222 one of most important types of gun sights used by army and navy during war was reflex or reflector sight weapon sights thumb upright german paratrooper looks through reflector sight of 40 gunsight on a flak 38 anti aircraft gun 1944 one of more sophisticated sights at time reflector sights were invented as an improved gun sight and since their invention they have been adapted to many types of weapons when used with different types of guns reflector sights are considered an improvement over simple iron sights sights composed of two spaced metal aiming points that have to be aligned applied optics and optical engineering volume 5 part 2 page 198 rudolf robert rennie shannon james c applied optics and optical engineering volume 5 part 2 page 198 iron sights take considerable experience and skill in user who has to hold a proper eye position and focus exclusively on front sight keeping it centered on unfocused rear sight while keeping whole centered on a target at different distances requiring alignment of all three planes of focus to achieve a hit transactions volume 23 by institution of mining engineers great britain federated institution of mining engineers page 125 reflector sight s single parallax free virtual image in focus with target removes this aiming problem helping poor average and expert shooters alike since collimated image produced by sight is only truly parallax free at infinity sight has an error circle equal to diameter of collimating optics for any target at a finite distance depending on eye position behind sight and closeness of target this induces some aiming error for larger targets at a distance given non magnifying quick target acquisitions nature of sight this aiming error is considered trivial on small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping reticle in middle of optical window sighting down its optical axis some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with optical collimator set at a finite distance this gives sight parallax due to eye movement size of optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at set distance somewhere around a desired target range of 25 50 yards compared to standard telescopic sights a reflector sight can be held at any distance from eye does not require a designed eye relief and at almost any angle without distorting image of target or reticle they are often used with both eyes open brain will tend to automatically superimpose illuminated reticle image coming from dominant eye onto other eye s unobstructed view giving shooter normal depth perception and full field of view since reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically convenient mounting position on a weapon aircraft thumb longitudinal cross section of a basic reflector sight for pre wwii german fighter planes 1937 german c12 a earliest record of reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918 optical firm of anstalt oigee of berlin working from grubb patents developed 2 versions what came to be known as oigee reflector sight both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim plane s machine guns one version was used in operational trials on albatros d va fighter biplane and fokker dr 1 fighter triplane there was some interest in this sight after world war i but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until 1930s first by french then by most other major airforces these sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights reflector sights as aircraft gun sights have many advantages pilot gunner need not position their head to align sight line precisely as they did in two point mechanical sights head position is only limited to that determined by optics in collimator mostly by diameter of collimator lens sight does not interfere with overall view particularly when collimator light is turned off both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting thumb left hud inside cockpit of a fighter jet optical nature of reflector sight meant it was possible to feed other information into field of view such as modifications of aiming point due to deflection determined by input from a gyroscope lon o nordeen air warfare in missile age page 265 1939 saw development by british of first of these gyro gunsights reflector sights adjusted by gyroscope for aircraft s speed and rate of turn enabling display of a lead adjusted sighting reticle that lagged actual boresight of weapon s allowing boresight to lead target in a turn by proper amount for an effective strike as reflector sight designs advanced after world war ii giving pilot more and more information they eventually evolved into head up display hud illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at focus of collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead finding computer and radar but also various aircraft indicators such as an artificial horizon compass altitude and airspeed indicators facilitating visual tracking of targets or transition from instrument to visual methods during landings firearms thumb a us marine looking through an itl mars reflex sight on his rifle idea of attaching a reflector sight to a firearm has been around since its invention in 1900 soon after world war ii models appeared for rifles and shotguns including shotgun sight 1945 game breeder and sportsman volumes 50 52 1945 which used a curved semi reflective mirror to reflect an ambient lit reticle and giese electric gunsight 1947 which had a battery powered illuminated reticle stock up for outdoors popular science dec 1946 vol 149 no 6 page 150 later types included qwik point 1970 and thompson insta sight both were beam splitter type reflector sights that used ambient light illuminating a green crosshair in insta sight and a red plastic rod light pipe that produced a red aiming spot reticle in qwik point popular science sep 1971 page 56 left thumb upright a view through a red dot sight mid to late 1970s saw introduction of what are usually referred to as red dot sights a type that gives user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point invention intelligence volume 11 inventions promotion board national research development corporation of india 1976 page 12 typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light emitting diode led at its focus using an led as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves reliability and general usefulness of sight there is no need for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just red spectrum passing through most other light and led itself is solid state and consumes very little power allowing battery powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours reflector sights for military firearms usually referred to as reflex sights took a long time to be adopted us house committee on armed services noted as far back as 1975 on suitability of use of reflex sight for m16 hearings before and special reports made by committee on armed services of house of representatives on subjects affecting naval and military establishments volume 980 page united states congress house committee on armed services political science 1975 but us military did not widely introduce reflector sights until early 2000s with red dot sight designated close combat optic reticle types many reticle illumination and pattern options are available common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights fiber optic light collectors and even tritium capsules some sights are specifically designed to be visible when viewed through night vision devices color of a sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead to aid precision aiming and range estimation and still others provide selectable patterns sights that use dot reticles are almost invariably measured in minutes of arc sometimes called minutes of angle or moa moa is a convenient measure for shooters using english units since 1 moa approximately at a distance of which makes moa a handy unit to use in ballistics 5 moa 1 5 dot is small enough not to obscure most targets and large enough to quickly acquire a proper sight picture for many types of action shooting a larger dot has traditionally been preferred 7 10 15 or even 20 moa 2 3 4 5 or 6 mil have been used often these will be combined with horizontal and or vertical lines to provide a level reference most sights have either active or passive adjustments for reticle brightness which help shooter adapt to different lighting conditions a very dim reticle will help prevent loss of night vision in low light conditions while a brighter reticle will display more clearly in full sunlight configurations modern optical reflector sights designed for firearms and other uses fall into two housing configurations tubed and open tube sights look similar to standard telescopic sights with a cylindrical tube containing optics many tube sights offer option of interchangeable filters such as polarizing or haze reducing filters glare reducing and conveniently protective flip up lens covers open sights also known as mini reflex sights and mini red dots take advantage of fact that reflector sight s only optical element optical window doesn t need any housing at all this configuration consists of a base with just necessary reflective surface for collimating reticle mounted on it due to their diminished profile open sights do not usually accommodate filters and other accessory options typically supported by tube designs other uses thumb upright telrad a reflector sight for astronomical telescopes introduced in late 1970s reflector sights have been used over years in nautical navigation devices and surveying equipment albada type sights were used on early large format cameras point and shoot type cameras and on simple disposable cameras these sights are also used on astronomical telescopes as to help aim telescope at desired object there are many commercial models first of which was telrad invented by amateur astronomer steve in late 1970s others are now available from companies such as apogee photon rigel and reflector sights are also used in entertainment industry in productions such as live theater on follow spot spotlights sights such as telrad s adapted for use and purpose built spot dimensions volume 19 page 114 lighting dimensions associates 1995 allow spotlight operator to aim light without turning it on similar types collimator sights also called c farmer ordnance field guide page 279 or occluded eye gunsight oeg jan kay international defense directory 1991 92 page 241 are simply optical collimator focusing a reticle without any optical window viewer cannot see through them and only sees an image of reticle they are used either with both eyes open while one looks into sight with one eye open and moving head to alternately see sight and then at target or using one eye to partially see sight and target at same time reticle is illuminated by an electric or passive ambient light source oeg and corp are two examples of commercially available ambient lit collimator sights these sights have advantage of requiring less illumination for reticle for same level of usability due to high contrast black background behind reticle for this reason occluded eye gunsights were more practical for use on small arms before low power consumption illumination sources such as leds became commonplace holographic weapon sights are similar in layout to reflector sights but do not use a projected reticle system instead a representative reticle is recorded in three dimensional space onto holographic film at time of manufacture this image is part of optical viewing window recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated
