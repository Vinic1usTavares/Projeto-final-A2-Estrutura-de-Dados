iguanodon meaning iguana tooth named in 1825 is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that existed roughly halfway between first of swift bipedal hypsilophodontids of mid jurassic and duck billed dinosaurs of late cretaceous while many species have been classified in genus iguanodon dating from late jurassic period to early cretaceous period of asia europe and north america research in first decade of 21st century suggests that there is only one well substantiated species i bernissartensis which lived from late barremian to earliest aptian ages early cretaceous in belgium spain england and possibly elsewhere in europe between about 126 and 113 million years ago iguanodon were large bulky herbivores distinctive features include large thumb spikes which were possibly used for defense against predators combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food genus was named in 1825 by english geologist gideon mantell but discovered by william harding bensted based on fossil specimens found in england some of which were subsequently assigned to mantellodon iguanodon was second type of dinosaur formally named based on fossil specimens after megalosaurus together with megalosaurus and hylaeosaurus it was one of three genera originally used to define dinosauria genus iguanodon belongs to larger group iguanodontia along with duck billed hadrosaurs taxonomy of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long standing ones reassigned to other genera scientific understanding of iguanodon has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from fossils numerous specimens of this genus including nearly complete skeletons from two well known bone beds have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding many aspects of living animal including feeding movement and social behaviour as one of first scientifically well known dinosaurs iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in public s perception of dinosaurs its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains discovery and history gideon mantell sir richard owen and discovery of dinosaurs thumb left upright original i anglicus teeth from mantell s 1825 paper discovery of iguanodon has long been accompanied by a popular legend story goes that gideon mantell s wife mary ann discovered first iguanodon tooth collections online museum of new zealand te papa tongarewa of an iguanodon in strata of tilgate forest in whitemans green cuckfield sussex england in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient however there is no evidence that mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients furthermore he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found teeth although he had previously stated in 1827 that mrs mantell had indeed found first of teeth later named iguanodon other later authors agree that story is not certainly false it is known from his notebooks that mantell first acquired large fossil bones from quarry at whitemans green in 1820 because also theropod teeth were found thus belonging to carnivores he at first interpreted these bones which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton as those of a giant crocodile in 1821 mantell mentioned find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in strata however in his 1822 publication fossils of south downs he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between teeth and his very incomplete skeleton presuming that his finds presented two large forms one carnivorous an animal of lizard tribe of enormous magnitude other herbivorous in may 1822 he first presented herbivorous teeth to royal society of london but members among them william buckland dismissed them as fish teeth or incisors of a rhinoceros from a tertiary stratum on 23 june 1823 charles lyell showed some to georges cuvier during a soiree in paris but famous french naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros though very next day cuvier retracted lyell reported only dismissal to mantell who became rather diffident about issue in 1824 buckland described megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit mantell s collection seeing bones on 6 march he agreed that these were of some giant saurian though still denying it was a herbivore emboldened nevertheless mantell again sent some teeth to cuvier who answered on 22 june 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore in a new edition that year of his recherches sur les fossiles cuvier admitted his earlier mistake leading to an immediate acceptance of mantell and his new saurian in scientific circles mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern day parallel among extant reptiles in september 1824 he visited royal college of surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth however assistant curator samuel stutchbury recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared albeit twenty times longer thumb mantell s iguanodon restoration based on maidstone mantellodon remains in recognition of resemblance of teeth to those of iguana mantell decided to name his new animal iguanodon or iguana tooth from iguana and greek word odon odon odontos or tooth based on isometric scaling he estimated that creature might have been up to long more than length of megalosaurus his initial idea for a name was iguana saurus iguana lizard but his friend william daniel conybeare suggested that that name was more applicable to iguana itself so a better name would be iguana like or iguanodon cadbury d 2000 dinosaur hunters fourth estate london 384 p he neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial but one was supplied in 1829 by friedrich holl i anglicum which was later amended to i anglicus thumb left fossil iguanodont remains found in maidstone in 1834 now classified as mantellodon mantell sent a letter detailing his discovery to local portsmouth philosophical society in december 1824 several weeks after settling on a name for fossil creature letter was read to members of society at a meeting on 17 december and a report was published in hampshire telegraph following monday 20 december which announced name mis spelt as mantell formally published his findings on 10 february 1825 when he presented a paper on remains to royal society of london a more complete specimen of similar animal was discovered in a quarry in maidstone kent in 1834 lower lower greensand formation which mantell soon acquired he was led to identify it as an iguanodon based on its distinctive teeth maidstone slab was utilized in first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of iguanodon but due to its incompleteness mantell made some mistakes most famous of which was placement of what he thought was a horn on nose discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that horn was actually a modified thumb still encased in rock maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at natural history museum in london borough of maidstone commemorated this find by adding an iguanodon as a supporter to their coat of arms in 1949 this specimen has become linked with name i mantelli a species named in 1832 by christian erich hermann von meyer in place of i anglicus but it actually comes from a different formation than original i mantelli i anglicus material maidstone specimen also known as gideon mantell s mantel piece and formally labelled nhmuk 3741 was subsequently excluded from

ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in turbulent worlds of reform act era british politics and science owen a firm creationist opposed early versions of evolutionary science then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict with paper describing dinosauria he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over determined that

like animals as owen was putting forward but had slender forelimbs however his passing left him unable to participate in creation of crystal palace dinosaur sculptures and so owen s vision of dinosaurs became that seen by public for decades with benjamin waterhouse hawkins he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel

happening but when removed into drier open air natural chemical conversion began to occur to limit this effect de pauw immediately in mine gallery re covered dug out fossils with wet clay sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons in brussels after opening plaster he

weishampel s work on ornithopod feeding mechanisms provided a better understanding of how it fed and david b norman s work on numerous aspects of genus has made it one of best known dinosaurs in addition a further find of numerous iguanodon skeletons in nehden germany has provided evidence for gregariousness in this genus as animals in this restricted find appear to have been killed by flash

at that time believed to be another species of iguanodon one major revision to iguanodon brought by renaissance would be another re thinking of how to reconstruct animal a major flaw with dollo s reconstruction was bend he introduced into tail this organ was more or less straight as shown by skeletons he was excavating and presence of ossified tendons in fact to get bend in tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo like posture tail would have had to be broken with its correct straight tail and back animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to ground arms in place to support body

iguanodonts iguanodon were bulky herbivores that could shift from bipedality to quadrupedality only well supported species i bernissartensis is estimated to have weighed about 3 08 tonnes 3 4 tons on average and measured about long as an adult with some specimens possibly as long as these animals had large tall but narrow skulls with toothless beaks probably covered with keratin and teeth like those of iguanas but much larger and more closely packed arms of i bernissartensis were long up to 75 length of legs and robust with rather inflexible hands built so that three central fingers could bear weight thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from three main digits in early restorations spike was placed on animal s nose later fossils revealed true nature of thumb spikes although

unlike hadrosaurids which had columns of replacement teeth iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side with none at front of jaw and lower jaw 25 numbers differ because teeth in lower jaw are broader than those in upper because tooth rows are deeply inset from outside of jaws and because of other anatomical details it is believed that as with most other ornithischians iguanodon had some sort of cheek like structure muscular or non muscular to retain food in mouth fastovsky d e and smith j b dinosaur paleoecology dinosauria 614

iguanodontidae illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs 110 115 this family traditionally has been something of a wastebasket taxon including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids in practice animals like camptosaurus mochlodon muttaburrasaurus ouranosaurus and were usually assigned to this family with advent of cladistic analyses iguanodontidae was traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic and these animals are recognised to fall at different points in relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram instead of in a single distinct clade essentially modern concept of iguanodontidae currently includes only iguanodon groups like are still used as unranked clades in scientific literature though many traditional are now included in superfamily hadrosauroidea iguanodon lies between camptosaurus and ouranosaurus in cladograms and is probably descended from a like animal at one point jack horner suggested based mostly on skull features that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups with iguanodon on line to flat headed hadrosaurines and ouranosaurus on line to crested lambeosaurines but his proposal has been rejected

formation of utah palaeobiology feeding thumb left i bernissartensis skull and neck one of first details noted about iguanodon was that it had teeth of a herbivorous reptile although there has not always been consensus on how it ate as mantell noted remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile especially in toothless scoop shaped form of lower jaw symphysis which he found best compared to that of two toed sloth and extinct ground sloth mylodon he also suggested that iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food like a giraffe more complete remains have shown this to be an error for example hyoid bones that supported tongue are heavily built implying a muscular non prehensile tongue used for moving food around in mouth giraffe tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to dollo via a broken lower jaw norman d b 1985 illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs 115 skull was structured in such a way that as it closed bones holding teeth in upper jaw would bow out this would cause lower surfaces of upper jaw teeth to rub against upper surface of lower jaw s teeth grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is rough equivalent of mammalian chewing because teeth were always replaced animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life and could eat tough plant material additionally front ends of animal s jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes both upper and lower providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger which could have been used to manipulate objects unlike other fingers thumb upright a hand in brussels extended digit is prehensile fifth finger exactly what iguanodon ate with its well developed jaws is not known size of larger species such as i bernissartensis would have allowed them access to food from ground level to tree foliage at high a diet of horsetails cycads and conifers was suggested by david norman although iguanodonts in general have been tied to advance of angiosperm plants in cretaceous due to dinosaurs inferred low browsing habits angiosperm growth according to this hypothesis would have been encouraged by iguanodont feeding because gymnosperms would be removed allowing more space for weed like early angiosperms to grow bakker r t when dinosaurs invented flowers dinosaur heresies 179 198 evidence is not conclusive though whatever its exact diet due to its size and abundance iguanodon is

fragmentary which led to much speculation on posture and nature of iguanodon iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn nosed beast however as more bones were discovered mantell observed that forelimbs were much smaller than hindlimbs his rival owen was of opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar like legs job of overseeing first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to mantell who declined due to poor health and owen s vision subsequently formed basis on which sculptures took shape its bipedal nature was revealed with discovery of bernissart skeletons however it was depicted in an upright posture with tail dragging along ground acting as third leg of a tripod during his re examination of iguanodon david norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely because long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons to get tripodal pose tail would literally have to be broken putting animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of arms and pectoral girdle more understandable for example hand is relatively immobile with three central fingers grouped together bearing hoof like phalanges and able to this would have allowed them to bear weight wrist is also relatively immobile and arms and shoulder bones robust these features all suggest that animal spent time on all fours thumb assigned track from germany furthermore it appears that iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier juvenile i bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults 60 of hindlimb length versus 70 for adults when walking as a quadruped animal s hands would have been held so that palms faced each other as shown by iguanodontian trackways and anatomy of this genus s arms and hands three toed pes foot of iguanodon was relatively long and when walking both hand and foot would have been used in a digitigrade fashion walking on fingers and toes maximum speed of iguanodon has been estimated at which would have been as a biped it would not have been able to gallop as a quadruped large three toed footprints are known in early cretaceous rocks of england particularly wealden beds on isle of wight and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on in 1846 e went so far as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named iguanodon and samuel beckles noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks but might have come from dinosaurs identity of was greatly clarified upon discovery in 1857 of hind leg of a young iguanodon with distinctly three toed feet showing that such dinosaurs could have made tracks despite lack of direct evidence these tracks are often attributed to iguanodon a trackway in england shows what may be an iguanodon moving on all fours but foot prints are poor making a direct connection difficult tracks assigned to ichnogenus iguanodon are known from locations including places in europe where body fossil iguanodon is known to spitsbergen svalbard norway thumb spike thumb i bernissartensis hand with spike thumb spike is one of best known features of iguanodon although it was originally placed on animal s nose by mantell complete bernissart specimens allowed dollo to place it correctly on hand as a modified thumb this would not be last time a dinosaur s modified thumb claw would be misinterpreted noasaurus baryonyx and are examples since 1980s where an enlarged thumb claw was first put on foot as in dromaeosaurids this thumb is typically interpreted as a close quarter stiletto like weapon against predators although it could also have been used to break into seeds and fruits or against other iguanodon one author has suggested that spike was attached to a venom gland but this has not been accepted as spike was not hollow nor were there any grooves on spike for conducting venom possible social behaviour left thumb restoration of an i bernissartensis group with other dinosaurs from wessex formation although sometimes interpreted as result of a single catastrophe bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events according to this interpretation at least three occasions of mortality are recorded and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span 10 100 years this does not necessarily mean these iguanodon were herding animals an argument against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site unlike modern cases with herd mortality they more likely were periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated in a lake or marshy setting nehden find however with its greater span of individual ages more even mix of dollodon or mantellisaurus to iguanodon bernissartensis and confined geographic nature may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers there is no evidence that iguanodon was sexually dimorphic with one sex appreciably different from other at one time it was suggested that bernissart i mantelli or i atherfieldensis dollodon and mantellisaurus respectively represented a sex possibly female of larger and more robust possibly male i bernissartensis however this is not supported today a 2017 analysis showed that i bernissartensis does exhibit a large level of individual variation in both its limbs scapula humerus thumb claw ilium ischium femur tibia and spinal column axis sacrum tail vertebrae additionally this analysis found that individuals of i bernissartensis generally seemed to fall into two categories based on whether their tail vertebrae bore a furrow on bottom and whether their thumb claws were large or small paleopathology evidence of a fractured hip bone was found in a specimen of iguanodon which had an injury to its ischium two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone in their which are called in popular culture upright thumb iguanodon appearing in arthur conan doyle s lost world since its description in 1825 iguanodon has been a feature of worldwide popular culture two lifesize reconstructions of mantellodon considered iguanodon at time built at crystal palace in london in 1852 greatly contributed to popularity of genus their thumb spikes were mistaken for horns and they were depicted as elephant like quadrupeds yet this was first time an attempt was made at constructing full size dinosaur models in 1910 heinrich harder portrayed a group of iguanodon in classic german collecting cards about extinct and prehistoric animals tiere der several motion pictures have featured iguanodon in 2000 disney animated film dinosaur an iguanodon named aladar served as protagonist with four other iguanodonts as other main characters are neera kron bruton and his scout creto a loosely related ride of same name at disney s animal kingdom is based around bringing an iguanodon back to present iguanodon is one of three dinosaur genera that inspired godzilla other two were tyrannosaurus and stegosaurus iguanodon has also made appearances in some of many land before time films as well as episodes of television series aside from appearances in movies iguanodon has also been featured on television documentary miniseries walking with dinosaurs 1999 produced by bbc and played a starring role in sir arthur conan doyle s book lost world as well as featuring in an episode of discovery channel documentary dinosaur planet incorrectly portrayed being able to run on all fours and living in late cretaceous it also was present in bob bakker s raptor red 1995 as a utahraptor prey item a main belt asteroid has been named iguanodon in honour of genus because it is both one of first dinosaurs described and one of best known dinosaurs iguanodon has been well placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs its reconstructions have gone through three stages elephantine quadrupedal horn snouted reptile satisfied victorians then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated early 20th century but was slowly overturned during 1960s by its current more agile and dynamic representation able to shift
