lion class were a pair of battlecruisers built for royal navy before world war i nicknamed splendid cats ships were a significant improvement over their predecessors of in terms of speed armament and armour these improvements were in response to german battlecruisers of which were in turn larger and more powerful than first british battlecruisers of served as flagship of grand fleet s battlecruisers throughout world war i campbell p 29 she sank german light cruiser during battle of heligoland bight in august 1914 and participated in battles of dogger bank in 1915 and jutland following year she was so badly damaged at battle of dogger bank that she had to be towed back to port during battle of jutland lion suffered a serious cordite fire that could have destroyed ship also participated in battle of heligoland bight and was then sent south to caribbean to intercept german east asia squadron in case they used panama canal after squadron was sunk at battle of falkland islands in december 1914 princess royal rejoined 1st battlecruiser squadron bcs during battle of dogger bank she scored only a few hits one crippled german armoured cruiser which allowed enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by concentrated fire of british battlecruisers shortly afterwards princess royal became flagship of 1st bcs and participated in battle of jutland both ships were present during inconclusive action of 19 august 1916 sister ships spent rest of war on uneventful patrols in north sea they provided distant cover during second battle of heligoland bight in 1917 in 1920 they were put into reserve and were then sold for scrap a few years later in accordance with terms of washington naval treaty of 1922 design and description acceleration of german naval building programme in 1907 1908 forced h h asquith s liberal government to yield to public pressure and authorise more ships for 1909 1910 construction programme only a single battleship and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908 1909 but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909 1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships to placate public and admiralty continuing pressure forced government to announce in july 1909 that contingency ships would also be built this pressure also allowed admiralty to gain approval to improve size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over new german dreadnoughts then under construction roberts pp 31 32 lion class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to new german battlecruisers of moltke class as german ships were to invincible class increase in speed armour and gun size forced a 40 increase in size over indefatigable class and made them largest warships in world burt p 151 their layout was adapted from design of first super dreadnought class s of 1910 with 13 5 inch 343 mm guns ships were first battlecruisers to be armed with new 13 5 inch mk v gun design of lions remedied some of shortcomings of preceding battlecruisers which suffered from an inability of en echelon amidships turrets to safely fire across deck limiting them to a three turret broadside this was done because greater size and weight of new guns rendered wing turrets impracticable as such all four turrets in lions were arranged on centreline q turret was located amidships and could only fire on broadside burt p 154 director of naval construction sir philip watts suggested that a fifth turret superfiring over rear turret could be added if ship was lengthened by three frames in total and that this would add very little cost other than ps175 000 for additional turret but add 25 more firepower to ship roberts p 33 this was not approved possibly because of doubts about its feasibility general characteristics thumb left 300px left elevation and deck plan from 1919 jane s fighting ships alt drawing of three stacked battlecruiser lions were significantly larger than their predecessors of they had an overall length of a beam of and a draught of at deep load they displaced at normal load and at deep load over more than earlier ships they had a metacentric height of at deep load roberts pp 43 44 propulsion lion class ships had two sets of parsons direct drive steam turbines each of which was housed in a separate engine room outer propeller shafts were coupled to high pressure turbines and these exhausted into low pressure turbines which drove inner shafts a cruising stage was built into casing of each high pressure ahead turbine burt p 158 their three bladed propellers were in diameter on inner shafts and outer propellers were in diameter turbines used steam provided by forty two yarrow boilers in seven boiler rooms roberts pp 70 76 they were designed to

to increase its burn rate roberts pp 76 80 at full capacity they could steam for at a speed of gardiner and gray p 29 armament lion class ships mounted eight bl 13 5 inch mark v guns in four twin hydraulically powered gun turrets designated a b q and y unlike two previous classes of battlecruiser in royal navy which had turrets fore aft and on each side of ship lion class ships had their main armament mounted in a single line from front to rear with b turret superfiring over a turret q turret mounted amidships and y turret aft guns had an elevation range from 3deg to 20deg their gunsights were limited to 15deg until super elevating prisms were installed before battle of jutland in may 1916 to allow full elevation they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at 20deg elevation they had a range of their rate of fire was two rounds per minute friedman pp 49 52 ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun roberts p 83 secondary armament of lion class consisted of sixteen bl 4 inch mark vii guns most of which were mounted in casemates in single mounts guns had a maximum elevation of 15deg which gave them a range of they fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of friedman pp 97 98 they were provided with 150 rounds per gun campbell p 27 ships were fitted with two submerged torpedo tubes one on each broadside fire control main guns were controlled from conning tower data from a argo rangefinder located on top of conning tower was input into a mk i dreyer fire control table located in transmitting station ts below conning tower where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by guns target s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist gunnery officer in predicting movement of target b and x turrets were provided with nine foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions roberts pp 91 92 fire control technology advanced quickly during years immediately preceding world war i and development of director firing system was a major advance this consisted of a fire control director mounted high in ship which electrically provided gun data to turrets via a pointer on a dial which turret crewmen only had to follow director layer fired guns simultaneously which aided in spotting shell splashes and minimised effects of roll on dispersion of shells roberts pp 92 93 lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after battle of dogger pp 159 161 and princess royal got hers in early 1916 a second director was added to each ship in 1918 armour armour protection given to lions was heavier than that of indefatigables their waterline belt of krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships in contrast to belt of their predecessors it thinned to 4 inches towards ships ends but did not reach either bow or stern they were also given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of 6 inches over same length as thickest part of waterline armour and thinned to abreast end turrets ends of armoured citadel were closed off by 4 inch transverse bulkheads nickel steel plating was used for protective decks lower armoured deck was generally only thick except outside citadel where it was upper armoured deck was situated at top of upper armour belt and was also only 1 inch thick forecastle deck armour ranged from roberts pp 102 03 gun turrets had 9 inch fronts and sides and their roofs were thick barbettes were protected by 9 inches of armour above deck thinning to above upper armour deck and below it sides of conning tower were thick and it had a three inch roof and communication tube nickel steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast magazines and shell rooms their funnel uptakes were protected by nickel steel splinter armour thick on sides and 1 inch on ends between upper and forecastle decks roberts pp 109 112 after battle of jutland revealed their vulnerability to plunging shellfire 1 inch of additional armour weighing approximately was added to magazine crowns and turret roofs roberts p 113 construction only lion was completed to original design which had fore funnel placed between forward superstructure and tripod foremast this meant that hot and flue gases from boilers made spotting top on foremast completely unworkable when ships were steaming at high speed that upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable depending on wind and that signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning roberts p 34 both ships were altered to correct this problem lion before being commissioned and princess royal as she was fitting out at a total cost of 170 fore funnel was moved aft original fore and mainmasts exchanged position and foremast was now just a pole mast not a tripod spotting tower at rear of conning tower was removed conning tower enlarged nine foot argo rangefinder was moved from foremast spotting top to roof of conning tower and all funnels were raised to same height roberts p 35 as part of these modifications two 4 inch guns mounted above forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect gun crews from weather and enemy action name builder laid down

fired shells weighing at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of their cyclic rate of fire was 200 rounds per minute actual rate was significantly less friedman p 119 pole foremast was modified to a tripod after 1916 this was due to increased weight of masthead fire control equipment associated with director firing in 1917 lion and princess royal received searchlight towers on aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four inch gun each from aft battery in early 1918 both ships received flying off platforms on q and x turrets for sopwith pup and sopwith 1 1 2 strutter aircraft and lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at aft end of her aft superstructure burt p 161 service pre war career upon commissioning both lion and princess royal were assigned to 1st cruiser squadron which was renamed 1st battlecruiser squadron bcs in january 1913 of which lion became flagship rear admiral david beatty assumed command of 1st bcs on 1 march 1913 sisters along with rest of 1st bcs made a

heligoland bight on 28 august 1914 beatty s ships had originally been intended as distant support of british cruisers and destroyers closer to german coast in case large ships of high seas fleet sortied in response to british attacks they turned south at full speed at 11 35 when british light forces failed to disengage on schedule and rising tide meant that german capital ships would be able to clear sand bar at mouth of jade estuary brand new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in battle and was under fire from german light cruisers and when battlecruisers loomed out of mist at 12 37 strassburg was able to duck into mists and evade fire but coln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from squadron beatty was distracted from task of finishing her off by sudden appearance of elderly light cruiser directly to his front he turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk battlecruisers encountered crippled coln shortly after turning north and she was sunk by lion after a few salvoes massie pp 109 13 princess royal was detached in november to reinforce north atlantic and caribbean squadrons in search for admiral graf spee s east asia squadron after it destroyed west indies squadron of rear admiral christopher cradock during battle of coronel she returned home next month after german ships had been sunk at battle of falkland islands roberts p 123 raid on scarborough german navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding british towns on north sea coast in an attempt to draw out royal navy and destroy elements of it in detail an earlier raid on yarmouth on 3 november 1914 had been partially successful but a larger scale operation was devised by admiral franz von hipper afterwards fast battlecruisers would conduct bombardment while entire high seas fleet was to station itself east of dogger bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of royal navy that responded to raid germans did not know that british were reading german naval codes and were planning to catch raiding force on its return journey they were not aware that high seas fleet would be at sea as well admiral beatty s 1st bcs now reduced to four ships including lion as well as 2nd battle squadron with six dreadnoughts was detached from grand fleet in an attempt to intercept germans near dogger bank massie pp 333 34 hipper set sail on 15 december for another raid and successfully bombarded several english towns but british destroyers escorting 1st bcs had already encountered german destroyers of high seas fleet in early morning and fought an inconclusive action with them communications failures meant that beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards but he turned in pursuit of german ships once he learned of their presence lead british ships were closing in on germans when beatty learned that scarborough was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept other german force massie pp 342 43 thumb left

cruisers of ii scouting group began to pass british forces searching for hipper they spotted a german cruiser a few minutes later and beatty turned his battlecruisers towards german ships thinking they were advance screen for hipper s ships those were 50 km 31 mi behind another british communications failure allowed german light cruisers to escape and they alerted hipper to location of british battlecruisers german battlecruisers wheeled to northeast of british forces and escaped tarrant p 34 battle of dogger bank on 23 january 1915 a force of german battlecruisers under command of hipper sortied to clear dogger bank of any british fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on german movements british were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of british battlecruisers contact was initiated following morning when arethusa spotted german light cruiser and germans had spotted beatty s force a few minutes later hipper ordered a turn to south at believing that this would suffice if ships that he saw to his northwest were british battleships and that he could always increase speed to bluchers maximum speed of if they were british battlecruisers massie pp 376 84 beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch germans before they could escape leading ships lion princess royal and were doing in pursuit and lion opened fire at very long range german battlecruisers opened fire themselves about 20 minutes later and concentrated their fire on lion and combined their fire to cripple lion over next hour even though princess royal engaged derfflinger during this period tarrant pp 35 36 another signalling failure caused british ships to focus on sinking blucher when beatty intended most of his ships to continue pursuit of battlecruisers massie pp 398 402 during this time princess royal hit blucher at least twice including hit that crippled her and allowed other british ships to engage campbell p 32 beatty tried to correct mistake but he was so far behind leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst smoke and haze he then transferred to a destroyer and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers he caught up to them shortly before blucher sank and boarded princess royal beatty ordered pursuit resumed of german battlecruisers but rescinded order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking blucher and that hipper s ships would be able to reach german waters before british could catch them lion was headed home at when rest of battlecruisers caught up with her tarrant p 38 later that afternoon battlecruiser was ordered to take lion under tow it took almost two days to reach port massie pp 409 12 ship was under
