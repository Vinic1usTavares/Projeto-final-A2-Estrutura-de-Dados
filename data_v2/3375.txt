first of series to be written by robert engels engels returned to pen a number of other episodes across both seasons episode was directed by tim hunter who would also go on to helm episode 16 and episode 28 in second season hunter had known series co creator david lynch from their time studying together at american film institute hunter engels 00 27 00 31 engels had been brought on board by other creative force in series mark frost who felt that engels sense of humor would be well suited to series style hunter engels 02 56 03 01 engels found pace of series writing to be quite fast noting that frost and lynch would outline plot of an episode in a matter of hours engels had previously been used to spending days at a time working on similar amounts of material with writing crews on other programs hunter engels 03 10 04 17 hunter recalls being pleasantly surprised to learn that russ tamblyn and richard beymer had been cast as regular characters in series having enjoyed early work of both actors during 1950s and 1960s hunter engels 04 50 05 27 tamblyn improvised elements of his performance including a magic trick involving two golf balls which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in episode hunter engels 05 28 05 56 character of gordon cole first played by lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call was conceived as being hard of hearing this was because lynch liked idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice and worked backwards to establish a reason for this engels wrote most of cole s dialogue over series having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing hunter engels 08 20 08 47 engels felt that three largest influences on series as a whole were 1960s television series wild wild west mayberry r f d and fugitive inclusion of a one armed character in twin peaks was a direct homage to latter of these hunter engels 13 01 13 28 engels has also noted that series would make use of normal conventional storylines and everyday occurrences as a familiar framework allowing subtle details to seem slightly more unusual against this backdrop he particularly cites this episode s parole hearing for hank jennings as an example as it offers nothing out of ordinary other than single domino which jennings is playing with at all times drawing attention to item as it is only thing which seems out of place hunter engels 18 07 20 05 hunter s direction in some scenes was inspired by otto preminger s work on 1945 film noir fallen angel that film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scene hunter found himself using several of preminger s techniques to make most out of several of episode s smaller sets such as rr diner hunter engels 29 12 30 14 several scenes in episode were also shot using a split diopter lens allowing for a greater depth of field for example a scene featuring sherilyn fenn and richard beymer talking had actors at either side of a room split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus hunter engels 36 04 36 59 episode ends with a shot featuring a dutch angle hunter was only director on series who frost and lynch allowed to use this shot which was otherwise forbidden hunter engels 44 50 45 15 broadcast and reception episode 4 was first broadcast on abc network on may 3 1990 in its initial airing it was viewed
