motte v faulkner decided 28 november 1735 was a copyright lawsuit between benjamin motte and george faulkner over who had legal rights to publish works of jonathan swift in london this trial was one of first to test statute of anne copyright law in regards to irish publishing independence although neither held copyright to all of swift s works suit became a legal struggle over irish rights which were eventually denied by english courts faulkner in 1735 published works of jonathan swift in dublin however a few of works were under motte s copyright within kingdom of great britain and when faulkner sought to sell his book in london motte issued a formal complaint to jonathan swift and then proceeded to sue faulkner an injunction was issued in motte s favor and book was prohibited from being sold on british soil basis of law protected rights of author and not publisher of works and swift was unwilling to support a lawsuit against faulkner with swift s reaction used as a basis lawsuit was later seen as a struggle between rights of irishmen to print material that were denied under english law ehrenpreis 1983 p 787 background benjamin motte motte was a london publisher who took over benjamin tooke s publishing business which printed many of swift s earlier works in 1726 swift sent motte a copy of gulliver s travels to be printed anonymously ehrenpreis 1983 pp 739 494 motte took great care to protect identity of author and employed five publishing houses to speed production of book and avoid unlicensed copying clive 2004 in 1727 motte formed his first direct contract with swift in order to publish swift s miscellanies as part of contract motte paid tooke for original copyright to work ehrenpreis 1983 p 739 george faulkner faulkner s dublin journal a newspaper established in 1725 featured many articles written by swift or inspired by writings of swift between 1727 and 1730 faulkner published many works attributed to swift but many were actually written by others after 1730 only one of those works printed by faulkner under swift s name turned out to be written by someone besides swift which suggests to some critics that swift was working with faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under swift s name ehrenpreis 1983 p 780 he was first to publish answer to craftsman swift s final defense of irish economy from england s policies ferguson 1962 p 178 faulkner was also first to publish collected drapier s letters as fraud detected on 2 october 1725 davis 1935 p faulkner also helped edit an epistle upon an epistle around december 1729 woolley 1981 p 202 case on 14 august 1725 swift wrote to charles ford that his work gulliver s travels was finished however he soon added a scene referring to drapier s letters ferguson 1962 p 135 swift wrote in a letter to pope a printer shall be found brave enough to venture his ears swift 1963 vol iii p 276 printer swift found was benjamin motte and swift did not control publication in order to as some critics say preserve his anonymity lock 1981 p 513 although swift found motte willing to print work he was not willing to print swift s additional scene swift s lack of control over publication lead to swift complaining of mangled and murdered pages swift 1963 vol iv pp 197 198 this was one of many reasons that swift turned from motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal on 9 october 1733 swift wrote now you may please to remember how much i complained of motts suffering some friend of his i suppose it was mr took a clergy man now dead not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to author s manner and style and intention swift 1910 to ford 9 october 1733 three editions of gulliver s travels were produced in london during 1726 and a corrected edition of motte s works were printed by john hyde in dublin lock 1981 p 514 although herbert davis thought that hyde edition would not please swift some critics argue that swift involved himself in helping hyde make some corrections to edition that was based on motte s london edition lock 1981 p 524 next year risk ewing and smith printed in dublin a simple reprint of motte s original print with minor corrections motte then produced his second edition his fourth version of gulliver s travels in 1727 with many corrections teerink 1963 pp 298 294 many of corrections of motte s later editions were based on swift s corrections sent to printer via letters edition published by faulkner includes over 500 corrections to original text surpassing any other editions faulkner s version also contains over 50 passages that either not present in original or expanded on from original text this has suggested to some critics that faulkner edition was a later rework of gulliver s travels and not just a correction to printing related mistakes inclusion of these many additions was later seen by critics as part of swift s disapproval of motte s versions but others see motte s version as being more true to anti government spirit of swift s work which confuses swift s motivation in allowing faulkner to reprint work lock 1981 pp 514 516 523 525 swift s other works were previous collected in a four volume set edited by alexander pope called miscellanies but swift wanted to have a proper edition of his works some critics speculate that swift turned to having his work printed without public sponsorship because he was afraid of breaking his commitments to pope and his publisher motte ehrenpreis 1983 p 779 regardless of what swift may or may not be planning he wrote to motte in december 1732 and said i have cause to believe that some of our printers will collected all they think to be mine and print them by subscription which i will never encourage nor oppose swift 1910 to pope 6 january 1734 on 9 february 1733 faulkner advertised his future publication of swift s collected works in four volumes in dublin journal herbert 1935 p 42 however this edition led to controversy since london bookseller benjamin motte had publication rights under english copyright law to many of works included in faulkner s edition english in 1735 attempted to pass a law that would allow a copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright but this law failed to pass through parliament cornu 1939 p 118 decision motte without power to halt introduction of faulkner s work on his own asked swift to intervene but swift passively refused even without backing of swift motte turned to english legal system to halt introduction of faulkner s edition motte issued a bill of complaint and sued under statute of anne claiming that faulkner s publishing of 1735 works infringed on his right to publish works like gulliver s travels cornu 1939 pp 119 120 case was heard by court of chancery and they agreed with motte in a ruling by lord talbot lord chancellor of great britain in 28 november 1735 it was determined motte could put forth an injunction to whole of swift s works pollard 2000 p 203 although works like drapier s letters were not under motte s copyright and some works were printed before 1709 faulkner s complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in england cornu 1939 pp 120 121 critical response it is uncertain if swift allowed faulkner to publish works in order to allow an irish publisher to compete against an english publisher or if swift had no say in matter and faulkner published works against swift s will in a letter to motte in may 1736 swift did not defend faulkner s legal right to publish works but made sure to attitude and action of motte as a publisher for prosecuting faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that faulkner would be allowed to reprint copyrighted material swift 1910 pp 493 494 however some critics believe that swift used incident to enlarge affair into another example of english oppression of irish cornu 1939 p 114 swift wrote in a letter to motte on 25 may 1736 cruel oppressions of this kingdom by england are not to be borne you send what books you please hither and booksellers here can send nothing to you that is written here as this is absolute oppression if i were a bookseller in this town i would use all safe means to reprint london books and run them to any town in england that i could because whoever offends not laws of god or country he lives in commits no sin but i am so incensed against from england and have so little regard to laws they make that i do as a clergyman encourage merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in europe or anywhere else and conceal it from custom house officers as i would hide my purse from a highwayman if he came to rob me on road although england hath made a law to contrary and so i would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author s books printed here and send them to all towns in england if i could do it with safety and profit because i repeat it is no offence against god or laws of country i live in swift 1910 to motte 25 may 1736 there is much debate in academic community on which printer produced authoritative edition of swift s works especially gulliver s travels harold williams was one of major proponents of faulkner edition being correct williams 1952 however some critics argue that faulkner edition was instead a corrected edition that added new revisions and that neither text can truly be called authoritative lock 1980 pp 66 88 influence in legal terms report of motte v faulkner of 28 november 1735 is no longer in existence but was cited in a later legal decisions on copyright issues such as miller v taylor of 1769 which read in case of motte vs falkner 28 november 1735 an injunction was granted for printing pope s and swift s miscellanies many of these pieces were published in 1701 1702 1708 and counsel strongly pressed objection as to these pieces lord talbot continued injunction as to whole and it was acquiesced under yet irish bookseller was a man of substance and general point was of consequence to him but he was not advised to litigate further english reports 4 burrow s 2325 case pope v curll 1741 refers to irish english aspects of publishing that came up in motte v faulkner curll claimed his reprinting of a work from a dublin edition originally made by george faulkner would under statute of anne be lawfully reprinted in england lord hardwicke ruled on matter 17 june 1741 that works first published in ireland do not
