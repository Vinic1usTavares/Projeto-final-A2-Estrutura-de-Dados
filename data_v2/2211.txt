john clive ward 1 august 1924 6 may 2000 was a british australian physicist he introduced ward takahashi identity also known as ward identity or ward s identities andrei sakharov said ward was one of titans of quantum electrodynamics he made significant contributions to quantum solid state physics statistical mechanics and ising model ward was one of authors of standard model of gauge particle interactions his contributions were published in a series of papers he co authored with abdus salam he is also credited with being an early advocate of use of feynman diagrams it has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments often without knowing it and generally without quoting him in 1955 ward was recruited to work at atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston there he independently derived a version of teller ulam design for which he has been called father of british h bomb early life john clive ward was born in east ham london on 1 august 1924 he was son of joseph william ward a civil servant who worked in inland revenue and his wife winifred palmer a schoolteacher he had a sister mary patricia he attended elementary school and westcliff high school for boys in 1938 he sat for and won a ps100 scholarship to bishop stortford college he took higher school certificate examination in 1942 receiving distinctions in mathematics physics chemistry and latin and was offered a scholarship to merton college oxford although second world war was raging at time ward was not called up by army and was allowed to complete his bachelor of arts degree in engineering science with first class honours studying mathematics under j h c whitehead and e c titchmarsh he received a bursary from harmsworth trust and in october 1946 with war over secured a position as a graduate assistant to maurice pryce who had recently been appointed a professor of theoretical physics at oxford scientific contributions quantum entanglement in 1947 ward and pryce published a paper in nature in which they were first to calculate and use probability amplitudes for polarisation of a pair of quantum entangled photons moving in opposite directions for polarisations x and y ward derived this probability amplitude to be which can be normalised as this can be used to derive correlation of quantum polarisations of two photons their prediction was confirmed experimentally by chien shiung wu and i in 1950 this was first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as applicable to einstein rosen epr paradox result was subsequently explained by richard dalitz and frank duarte apparently following dirac s doctrine ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics with his harmsworth scholarship expiring and seeing few prospects at oxford ward responded to a job advertisement from university of sydney he was offered a position but when he arrived found that it was for a tutor and not a lecturer he therefore served out year then returned to oxford to complete his doctor of philosophy d phil thesis on some properties of elementary particles ward expected that his thesis an elaboration of his 1947 paper would be easily approved by external examiner nicholas kemmer but at last minute kemmer s place was taken by rudolf peierls who refused to accept it only after a forceful argument by internal examiner j de witt was thesis awarded ward identity pryce arranged for ward to receive an award from department of scientific and industrial research dsir for two years it was then that he developed ward takahashi identity originally known as ward identity or ward s identities this result in quantum electrodynamics was inspired by a conjecture of freeman dyson and was disclosed in a one half page letter typical of ward s succinct style in their book quantum electrodynamics walter greiner and state in their discussion of charge renormalisation ward identity has a much more fundamental significance it ensures universality of electromagnetic interaction in his book infinity puzzle frank close wrote ward s identities are basic foundations on which entire edifice of renormalisation rests in 1950 ward s dsir fellowship was coming to an end pryce had become a visiting professor at institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey and ward s colleagues p t matthews and abdus salam were visiting members there in 1950 1951 academic year through them he was able to secure a 3 000 membership for 1951 1952 academic year it was at princeton that he was introduced to ising model and met mark kac from cornell university with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of ising model using a combinatorial method his joint work with kac on ising model gave rise to what is now being called kac ward operator when his membership ended he worked for bell laboratories in 1952 and 1953 he then accepted an offer of a lectureship at university of adelaide from bert green where he worked for a year before taking up another membership at institute for advanced study standard model thumb right luttinger s theorem introduced by j m luttinger and ward relates a fermi liquid s particle density to volume of its fermi surface ward left british hydrogen bomb programme and took a job with an electronics company in california later in 1956 elliott montroll offered him a visiting professorship at university of maryland noting a recent paper by keith brueckner and murray gell mann on ground state energy of an electron gas ward gave a lecture in which he proposed a different approach montroll recognised that this was debye huckel theory over next few weeks ward later recalled we had managed not only to produce a definitive extension of a previously purely classical theory but also to establish rules for diagrammatic treatment of problems in quantum statistical mechanics rules that are now bread and butter of modern calculations soon after physicists were rocked by news that wu and tsung dao lee had demonstrated in wu experiment that parity is not conserved in weak interactions this inspired ward to consider particle physics again along with many others he consider how gauge theory could be applied to fermi s theory of beta decay ward became one of authors of standard model of gauge particle interactions his contributions on electromagnetic and weak interactions were published in a series of papers he co authored with abdus salam ward wrote a note to abdus informing him that albert einstein would be spinning in his grave presumably clockwise contributions of salam and ward to standard model were used in development of theoretical structure of higgs boson ward also made contributions to quantum mechanics fermion theory quantum solid state physics and statistical mechanics and ising model in 1955 ward was recruited by william cook to work on british hydrogen bomb programme at atomic weapons research establishment at aldermaston british government had decided that it needed hydrogen bombs and it was aldermaston s task to design one cook had been put in charge of project in september 1954 ward was only theoretical physicist at aldermaston director william penney although a physicist was an expert on hydrodynamics and instrumentation penney was not happy to have ward forced on him and two did not get along john corner recalled that ward did not fit in at aldermaston british knowledge of thermonuclear designs was limited to work done by wartime manhattan project edward teller s classic super and a 1946 design by john von neumann and klaus fuchs all that was known for certain about american hydrogen bomb design was that it had multiple stages i was assigned ward later recalled improbable job of uncovering secret of ulam teller invention an idea of genius far beyond talents of personnel at aldermaston a fact well known to both cook and penney after working through a large number of proposals ward hit upon a workable design incorporating staging compression and radiation implosion at a meeting on 2 december 1955 ward sketched it on blackboard penny s response was cool regarding it as too complicated but cook recognised it as worthy although ward s design was not one ultimately adopted for hydrogen bombs used in operation grapple concept was influential and development of a more advanced design than americans had would be key to achieving overall objective of project a resumption of nuclear special relationship with americans he has been called father of british h bomb macquarie university after maryland ward looked for a new job he thought he had found one at university of miami in florida but was denied tenure and left in 1959 he then secured a position at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania but was unhappy there he applied once again for a one year membership at institute for advanced study and was accepted for a third time then offered him a position at johns hopkins university in 1961 he remained until 1966 when he answered an advertisement for a mathematics professor at victoria university of wellington in new zealand australian friends were astounded that anyone would choose new zealand over australia and in 1967 he became foundation professor of physics at macquarie university in sydney he turned down offers from oxford and cambridge he eventually became an australian citizen in 1967 he created physics program at macquarie university using feynman lectures on physics as primary textbooks this program had a strong experimental emphasis and ward himself who originally was trained as an engineer had great admiration for anything practical he is credited with being an early pioneer in use of feynman diagrams and spreading their use in australia in late 1970s ward participated with frank duarte in successful macquarie science reform movement and considered this a most important accomplishment most visible sign was that university agreed to present bachelor of science bsc degrees instead of just bachelor of arts ba degrees former being more highly prized by students and workplaces in australia personal life and death ward s total number of published papers was only about 20 a fact that reflects a strong sense of self criticism he was also critical of what he called phd factories and expressed scepticism towards importance attached to having a large number of citations he never supervised graduate students although he never received nobel prize in physics he did receive some significant awards including guthrie medal and dirac medal in 1981 heineman prize in 1982 and hughes medal in 1983 for his highly influential and original contributions to quantum field theory particularly ward identity and salam ward theory of weak interactions he became a fellow of royal society in 1965 he has an erdos number of 2 andrei sakharov said ward was one of titans of quantum electrodynamics alongside freeman dyson richard feynman julian schwinger sin itiro tomonaga and gian carlo wick in this regard it has been said that physicists have made use of his principles and developments often without knowing it and generally without quoting him besides his physics ward played piano and french horn he was a bachelor for most of his life but he was briefly married while in us he had no children he died on vancouver island in
