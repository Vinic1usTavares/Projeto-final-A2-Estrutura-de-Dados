third epistle of john often referred to as third john and written 3 john or iii john is antepenultimate book of new testament and attributed to john evangelist traditionally thought to be author of gospel of john and other two epistles of john third epistle of john is a private letter composed to a man named gaius recommending to him a group of christians led by demetrius which had come to preach gospel in area where gaius lived purpose of letter is to encourage and strengthen gaius and to warn him against diotrephes who refuses to cooperate with author of letter early church literature contains no mention of epistle with first reference to it appearing in middle of third century this lack of documentation though likely due to extreme brevity of epistle caused early church writers to doubt its authenticity until early 5th century when it was accepted into canon along with other two epistles of john language of 3 john echoes that of gospel of john which is conventionally dated to around ad 90 so epistle was likely written near end of first century others contest this view such as scholar john a t robinson who dates 3 john to c ad 60 65 john a t robinson chap ix location of writing is unknown but tradition places it in ephesus epistle is found in many of oldest new testament manuscripts and its text is free of major discrepancies or textual variants content there is no doctrine laid out in 3 john which is strictly a personal letter but overall theme is importance of hospitality especially when it comes to men who were working to spread gospel third john is shortest book of bible by word count though 2 john has fewer verses painter 361 it is only new testament book which does not contain names jesus or christ original greek uses term onomatos onomatos generally translated name referring specifically to name of jesus but text does not say jesus or christ brown 727 greeting and introduction letter is written to a man named gaius stott 217 gaius seems to have been a wealthy man since epistle s author who identifies himself only as elder did not think it would impose unduly on him to host some traveling preachers for a short time dodd 156 elder may have converted gaius since he calls gaius his child in faith apostolic constitutions vii 46 9 records that gaius was made bishop of pergamon though there is no early support for this statement name gaius occurs three other times in new testament first a christian gaius is mentioned in macedonia as a traveling companion of paul along with aristarchus acts 19 29 one chapter later a gaius from is named as one of paul s seven traveling companions who waited for him at troas acts 20 4 next a gaius is mentioned residing in corinth as being one of only a few people there others being crispus and household of who were baptised by paul who founded church in that city 1 corinthians 1 14 lastly a gaius is referred to in a final greeting portion of epistle to romans romans 16 23 as paul s host and also host of whole church in whatever city paul is writing from at time probably corinth however there is no reason to suppose that any of these men were gaius of 3 john stott 217 218 verse 2 where author wishes material prosperity upon gaius similar to prosperity of his soul is a commonly used proof text within prosperity gospel teachings opponents of prosperity gospel consider verse to be little more than well wishing missionaries elder continues letter by commending gaius for his loyalty and his hospitality towards a group of traveling brothers painter 371 brothers are brothers in faith or missionaries who in accordance with jesus command in mark 6 8 9 have set out on a journey without any money dodd 160 elder then goes on to request that gaius provide for brothers to continue their journey opposition of diotrephes elder next describes his conflict with diotrephes who does not acknowledge elder s authority and is excommunicating those like gaius who welcome missionaries sent by elder painter 374 375 elder mentions a previous letter which he has written to church which was suppressed by diotrephes and says that he intends to visit church and to confront diotrephes painter 374 375 stott 227 church is apparently known to gaius but he is likely not a member of it since otherwise elder would not need to provide him with information about diotrephes activities dispute between diotrephes and elder seems to be based on church leadership and authority rather than doctrine since elder does not accuse diotrephes of teaching heresy dodd 165 most scholars do not connect letter elder mentions with 2 john since 3 john does not contain any reference to doctrinal controversy described in 2 john and argue that elder is here referring to a previous letter of recommendation dodd 160 painter 363 john painter however argues elder is in fact referring to 2 john since there is overlap between 2 john 9 and theme of hospitality in 3 john painter 374 376 elder closes this section with an entreaty to gaius beloved do not imitate evil but imitate good whoever does good is from god whoever does evil has not seen god 3 john 11 esv this injunction is reminiscent of several passages in 1 john 2 3 5 3 4 10 4 7 dodd 165 166 final greetings and conclusion verse 12 introduces another man named demetrius who according to apostolic constitutions vii 46 9 was ordained by john as bishop of philadelphia now amman jordan dodd 166 demetrius was probably a member of group of missionaries discussed earlier in letter and 3 john likely serves as a recommendation letter to gaius about demetrius recommendation letters were quite common in early church as evidenced by 2 corinthians 3 1 romans 16 1 2 and colossians 4 7 8 elder before ending letter says that he has many other things to tell to gaius and plans to make a journey to see him in near future using almost exact language of 2 john 12 painter 380 closing verse peace be to you friends greet you greet friends one by one is typical of contemporary correspondence with peace be to you a greeting adopted by christians from jews dodd 168 authorship 3 john was almost certainly written by same author who wrote 2 john and likely 1 john as well brooke lxxiii lxxv this individual may have been john evangelist himself or someone else perhaps john presbyter though according to scholar c h dodd if we attempt to identify anonymous author of these epistles with some known individual we have little but surmise to go on dodd lxix there are many similarities between 2 and 3 john both follow format of other personal letters of era in both author self identifies as presbyter painter 52 a term which literally means elder dodd 155 and both deal with themes of hospitality and conflict within church painter 56 they are also extremely similar in length probably because they were both written to fit on one papyrus sheet 3 john is also linguistically similar to both 2 john and other johannine works of 99 different words used 21 are unimportant words like and or leaving 78 significant words 23 of these do not appear in 1 john or gospel of john of which four are unique to 3 john one is common to 2 and 3 john and two are found in both 2 and 3 john as well as in other new testament writings approximately 30 of significant words in 3 john do not appear in 1 john or gospel compared to 20 for 2 john dodd lxii these considerations indicate a close affinity between 2 and 3 john though 2 john is more strongly connected with 1 john than it is with 3 john dodd lxvi a minority of scholars however argue against common authorship of 2 and 3 john and rudolf bultmann held that 2 john was a forgery based on 3 john brown 15 16 if 3 john was written by john apostle however it is strange that diotrephes would oppose him since apostles were highly respected in early church schnackenburg 270 one possible alternative view of epistle s authorship arises from a fragment written by papias of hierapolis and quoted by eusebius which mentions a man named presbyter john however since nothing else is known of this individual it is not possible to positively identify him as author of 3 john schnackenburg 268 269 date and location of writing all three letters of john were likely written within a few years of each other and internal evidence indicates that they were written after gospel of john placing them in second half of first century brown 100 101 this dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to gnostic and teaching which denied full humanity of jesus and which was gaining ascendancy at end of first century brown 101 dodd argues for a date between 96 110 a d concluding from absence of references to persecution in letters that they were probably written after harsh reign of roman emperor domitian whose persecution of christians seems to have prompted writing of book of revelation dodd notes however that they could have been written in pre domitian era which is likely if author was a personal disciple of jesus dodd xxviii lxix lxx lxxi marshall suggests a date of between 60s and 90s marshall 48 rensberger suggests a dating of around 100 assuming that gospel of john was written in 90s and letters must have followed after brown argues for a date of between 100 and 110 with all three letters composed in close time proximity a date past 110 115 is unlikely as parts of 1 john and 2 john are quoted by polycarp and papias rensberger 29 30 brooke lviii letters do not indicate location of authorship but since earliest quotations of them in writings of polycarp papias and irenaeus come from province of asia minor it is likely that epistles were also written in asia dodd lxvii church tradition typically places them in city of ephesus rensberger 30 manuscripts 3 john is preserved in many of old manuscripts of new testament of greek great uncial codices codices sinaiticus alexandrinus and vaticanus contain all three johannine epistles while codex ephraemi rescriptus contains 3 john 3 15 along with 1 john 1 1 4 codex bezae while missing most of catholic epistles contains 3 john 11 15 in latin translation in languages other than greek vulgate and sahidic armenian syriac and ethiopian versions contain all three epistles plummer 63 64 between different copies there are no major difficulties or differences meaning that there is very little doubt over determining original text brooke lxiv canonical history there are some doubtful similarities between passages in johannine epistles and writings of polycarp and papias schnackenburg 274 but earliest definitive references to epistles come from late second century brown 5 irenaeus in adversus 3 16 8 written c 180 quotes 2 john 7 and 8 and in next sentence 1 john 4 1 2 but does not distinguish between 1 and 2 john he does not quote from 3 john brown 9 10 canon seems to refer to two letters of john only dodd xiv though it is possible to interpret it as referring to three marshall 48 49 1 john is extensively cited by tertullian who died in 215 and clement of alexandria in addition to quoting 1 john wrote a commentary on 2 john in his brown 10 all three johannine epistles were recognized by 39th festal letter of athanasius synod of hippo and council of carthage 397 additionally didymus blind wrote a commentary on all three epistles showing that by early 5th century they were being considered as a single unit first reference to 3 john is in middle of third century eusebius says that origen knew of both 2 and 3 john however origen is reported as saying all do not consider them genuine brown 11 brooke lix similarly pope dionysius of alexandria origen s pupil was aware of a reputed second or third epistle of john also around this time 3 john is thought to have been known in north africa as it was referred to in sententiae episcoporum produced by seventh council of carthage brown 11 there was doubt about authority of 3 john however with eusebius listing it and 2 john as disputed books despite describing them as well known and acknowledged by most although eusebius believed apostle wrote gospel and epistles it is likely that doubt about fidelity of author of 2 and 3 john was a factor in causing them to be disputed brown 11 12 by end of fourth century presbyter author of 2 and 3 john was thought to be a different person than apostle john this opinion although reported by jerome was not held by all as jerome himself attributed epistles to john apostle brooke lxii brown 12 one factor which helps explain late attestation of 3 john and doubts about its authority is very short nature of letter early writers may simply not have had occasion to quote from it stott 16 see also john apostle textual variants in third epistle of john notes and references bibliography
