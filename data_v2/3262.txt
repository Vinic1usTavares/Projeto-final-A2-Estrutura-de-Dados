bell who had previously starred in then recently cancelled series veronica mars was a fan of series and had met up with writers that informed her they would love to have her on show while character of elle was created before bell was cast following her casting character was slightly altered to better resemble her elle was one of new characters introduced in second season and according to contract

and study those individuals with special abilities daughter of company head bob bishop she possesses power to generate and manipulate electricity elle is portrayed as mentally unstable which is

kristen bell had voiced interest in appearing on heroes because she was a fan in july 2007 during a train ride back from san diego comic con with heroes actors zachary quinto and masi oka and writers from series writers had mentioned that if bell ever want ed to come on heroes give us writers a call to which bell said she would love to announced in august 2007 bell was to portray elle a mysterious young lady with an awesome power for a total of thirteen episodes heroes creator tim kring and writers had created character of elle with idea that she was a cautionary tale of what could happen if other characters had known of their abilities for duration of their lives as elle did kring pitched bell idea for character which she loved and soon they were off and running casting of bell as kring explains was not easy to pull off but because of large ensemble cast of series and multiple story arcs we found a way to jump into a small window in bell s schedule originally elle was only meant to be bob s stepdaughter and meredith gordon s daughter making her claire bennet s sister however this idea was dropped due to lack of storyline and plot holes character elle was created long before bell was cast however kring noted when you do cast an actor you try to tailor that character a little closer to who actor is so it s hard to know when one starts to influence other characterization when kristen bell was cast she noted that with elle it would be unclear whether she s good or bad in four months ago elle admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath and previous to that she had displayed sadistic behavior as a result of testing done to her as a child bell explains bodies are not able to take that much electricity and pain and so elle s psychologically a little off her rocker she is able to kill without apparent remorse although in one instance she reacts defensively when mohinder asks her how many have died by her hand during an interview with scifi world tim kring described elle as a little off and bell added that elle is a little messed up in head and a highly conflicted individual who does not have ability to decipher between right and wrong because of that bell explains that elle comes off as more of a victim bell also explains that elle is one of few characters with abilities that embrace their power and is almost on verge of being addicted to her ability elle enjoys emotional power it gives her over other people she is described as one who is always out to get what she wants and someone who doesn t have many boundaries bell describes elle as a vixen who feels like she has a romantic connection to everybody and in a few episodes elle is shown displaying a great deal of affection to men and flirting with both peter petrelli and mohinder suresh bell noted similarities between elle and character claire bennet saying that they relate to each other and are two sides of same coin because while elle s father sanctioned testing on her supposedly causing her mental instability noah kept claire hidden preventing claire from experiencing same childhood that really messed elle up bell has said in interviews that in later episodes of heroes you ll find out that elle holds key to claire s future and that elle has a present with peter and a past with claire s dad and a future with claire powers and abilities elle has ability to generate and

testing by company during her childhood that measured extent of her power bob had stated that elle was in a different league when comparing her to claire when inquiring about her abilities elle was able to learn from noah bennet that company had wanted to record extent of her abilities whether she could power a flashlight a street lamp or an entire city block and bob had often prompted to
