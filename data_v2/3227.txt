would fit best artists were chosen after lyrics were written and were selected based on how well miyake and takahashi felt they would gel with world of katamari damacy and content of song lyrics they were also chosen to create a pretty silly goofy selection of singers that would appeal to a broad spectrum of people from different generations once lyrics and singers had been chosen music was written specifically for each artist with intention of creating songs that were familiar but not trendy so that they would not seem dated in future humming in opening song described by miyake as na na

it did not match up to previous soundtracks in series they additionally felt that second disc did not add much to album and that on whole new me my katamari tracks were not strong or numerous enough

in japan as was released for playstation 3 in 2009 by namco bandai music for game includes a number of remixed tracks from previous iterations of series using a combination of electric and organic sounds according to sound director yuu miyake miyake employed help of over 20 other japanese artists and remixers to help soundtrack which was designed to act as part of a musical trilogy with soundtrack to katamari damacy and we love katamari this was accomplished by choosing tracks from those games that were either fan or staff favorites and having them remixed by both japanese and non japanese artists though miyake notes that majority of artists were japanese as he did not know many non japanese musicians same problem that kept non japanese artists out of first two soundtracks of trilogy miyake has stated that focusing so much on using music from earlier in series made it very challenging to still allow each artist to explore their creativity and does not intend to repeat this
