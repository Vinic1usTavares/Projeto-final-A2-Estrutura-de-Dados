political works many other authors were not equally adept to write about political subjects and were reluctant to visit places of work his role in shaping north korean literature was to be pivotal cho s early works mt paektu mr 1947 and land mr 1946 would point out direction that north korean literature was about to take these works would soon become models for north korean literature upon his return he started writing for choson sinmun soviet red army s korean language paper working as a correspondent and translator he translated works of such soviet poets as mayakovsky and literary

ui koji 1951 we are korean youth choson ch 1951 as well as lyric poems swing kune and sitting on a white rock 1947 serial poem resistance in yosu ui yosu tells about yosu uprising in south korea lyric epic land was written on workers party s orders on producing works about land reform in north korea after liberation and was first poem to describe topic cho wrote lyrics for pass a song about korean people s army soldiers fighting their way through to while all of poems are thoroughly ideological some south korean scholars such as yi chang ju of north research institution have sought to emphasize cho s lyrical side in order to domesticate him to serve rapprochement between two countries cultural orientations some of cho s poems have been adapted into popular music lyrics that enjoy popularity in south as well as north aram willow and swing are love songs that were inspired by a more relaxed cultural atmosphere following translation of russian language poetry into korean these influences include mikhail isakovsky s katyusha to which whistle in particular bears likeness whistle adapted as a popular song in 1990 is often seen in south as a non political song however according to gabroussenko south korean observers often fail to notice political and cultural elements borrowed from isakovsky and soviet lyrical poetry in whistle for instance couple embodies exemplary socialist traits mt paektu thumb alt a crowd looking at a large statue depicting young kim il sung in military attire cho s epic mt paektu promotes kim il sung as a heroic guerrilla well suited to lead country cho s long epic poem mt paektu was written in february 1947 and published in 1948 in rodong sinmun it was first poem written about kim il sung whom original version of poem simply refers to as commander kim poem which tells story of battle of in 1937 is a classic in literature portraying anti japanese struggle its text inextricably links kim il sung s person with paektu mountain namesake height of poema connection that has remained central in north korean propaganda to this day poem has its origins in cho s fascination with anti japanese guerrillas including and choe hyon with whom he had met creation of epic was politically motivated too as soviets who had dispatched cho to north korea wanted to strengthen kim il sung s grip on power publications presenting him as a legendary anti japanese hero were needed and so mt paektu was born work is dedicated to glorious soviet army that liberated korea and is written with soviets and not koreans in mind due to vigorous promotion of a mass culture in both output and readership of literature copies of mt paektu were printed by hundreds of thousands more than any work in history of korean literature before that generally speaking poem was well received public was interested and young readers acclaimed it it was liked in kfla as it employed revolutionary romanticism in its portrayal of kim kim personally liked poem too and began visiting cho s home in his memoirs with century kim writes that he was first person to listen to cho recite poem and liked its jewel like sentences more than esthetic kim says he was attracted to content and they both shed tears when cho chanted a passage about fallen comrades in keeping with its nature as propaganda content of mt paektu exaggerates kim il sung s activities during liberation struggle poem presents kim as having heroic transcendental humane and warm qualities he is represented as a popular hero that people look up to suggesting that he is right person to lead newly established state politically mt paektu was very effective in newly founded state as such it became a new classic a model for cult of personality of kim il sung perpetuated by subsequent works of literature in north korea according to b r myers work exemplifies particular traits of an early cult of personality built upon soviet marxism leninism and bloc conformity which were soon replaced by korean ethnic nationalism of writers like han sorya while cho s kim il sung is a brilliant strategist who has masculine qualities like strength and intellect in han s works he embodies traditional korean virtues of innocence and naivety having mastered marxism leninism with his heart not his brain ethnically inspired style of han would establish itself as standard of propaganda over cho s benoit berthelier however sees continuity in cho s work and contemporary propaganda according to him cho can be credited with having created a genre of revolutionary romanticism which systematized use of legends and supernatural imagery in kim and his successors cult of personality long epic poetry was not a popular genre in north korea before mt paektu but it was in soviet union where cho had immigrated from poema and mayakovsky s prosody and poetry were also among cho s influences that can be seen in mt paektu these russian stylistic influences gave mt paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from north korean public for instance some in literature circles were unfamiliar with concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres criticizing work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose according to north korean studies scholar david west relatively favorable reaction to mt paektu compared to some other literature testifies to north korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience south korean scholars have presented two competing views about mt paektu academics of older generation typically dismiss mt paektu as personality cult literature younger generation and leftist scholars however see guerrillas other than kim il sung such as ch ol ho pun and sok jun and by extension people as hero of story for some of them like sin tong ho excluding role of others than kim il sung is an outright obstruction for creating a national unity in literature 1947 text has been revised three times because of changes within political system of north korea to produce heavily revised e editions in 1955 1986 and 1995 original version of poem invokes russian civil war heroes vasily chapayev nikolay and sergey lazo while a newer revision omits them and concentrates on indigenous assets work was adapted on stage by han t ae ch on it has been translated into english arabic french german russian spanish czech polish chinese japanese and mongolian of these mongolian one was deemed distorted by north koreans and sparked a diplomatic crisis in 1976 resulting in expulsion of mongolian ambassador to country death and legacy cho died on 31 july 1951 in his office in pyongyang during an american bombing raid in war mt paektu received national prize first class in 1948 cho s works were awarded festival prize country s highest literary honor modeled after stalin prize he also was awarded order of national flag second class for his work during war in 1951 as well as a posthumous national prize first class in 1952 for his cycle of poems korea is fighting mr 1951 his resting place is at patriotic martyrs cemetery in pyongyang today cho is regarded as founding father of north korean socialist realist poetry or indeed poetry in general or even north korean literature as a whole in mid 1950s many soviet koreans including cho s close friends were discredited in purges according to gabroussenko cho s untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition with exception of a period in 1970s when cho s name was barely mentioned in official publications his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in north korea see also han sorya history of north korea korean poetry north korean literature notes and
