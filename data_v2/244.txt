novel reflected several historical events that flipped french social order in short succession french revolution which led to first republic napoleon s rise fall and return of house of bourbon le pere goriot begins in june 1819 four years after napoleon s defeat at waterloo and bourbon restoration book depicted mounting tension between aristocracy which had returned with king louis xviii and bourgeoisie produced by industrial revolution kanes pp 3 7 in narrative france saw a tightening of social structures with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty by one estimate almost three quarters of parisians did not make 500 600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of living kanes p 38 at same time this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during ancien regime individuals willing to adapt to rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds much to distaste of established wealthy class brooks 1998 p xi literary background when balzac began writing le pere goriot in 1834 he had written several dozen books including a stream of pseudonymously published potboiler novels in 1829 he published les chouans first novel to which he signed his own name this was followed by louis lambert 1832 le colonel chabert 1832 and la peau de chagrin 1831 robb pp 425 429 around this time balzac began organizing his work into a sequence of novels that he eventually called la comedie humaine divided into sections representing various aspects of life in france during early 19th century thumb upright french criminal eugene francois vidocq was basis for character vautrin in le pere goriot one of these aspects which fascinated balzac was life of crime in winter of 1828 29 a french grifter turned policeman named eugene francois vidocq published a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits balzac met vidocq in april 1834 and used him as a model for a character named vautrin he was planning for an upcoming novel hunt p 91 oliver p 149 writing and publication in summer of 1834 balzac began to work on a tragic story about a father who is rejected by his daughters his journal records several undated lines about plot subject of old goriot a good man middle class lodging house 600 fr income having stripped himself bare for his daughters who both have 50 000 fr income dying like a dog quoted in bellos p 16 he wrote first draft of le pere goriot in forty autumn days it was published as a serial in revue de paris between december and february it was released as a novel in march 1835 by publishing house of who also published second edition in may a much revised third edition was published in 1839 by charpentier oliver p 102 brooks 1998 p viii kanes p 7 bellos p 15 as was his custom balzac made copious notes and changes on proofs he received from publishers so that later editions of his novels were often significantly different from earliest in case of le pere goriot he changed a number of characters into persons from other novels he had written and added new paragraphs filled with detail bellos pp 23 24 character eugene de rastignac had appeared as an old man in balzac s earlier philosophical fantasy novel la peau de chagrin while writing first draft of le pere goriot balzac named character but he decided to use same character from la peau de chagrin other characters were changed in a similar fashion it was his first structured use of recurring characters a practice whose depth and rigor came to characterize his novels bellos pp 16 17 see generally pugh in 1843 balzac placed le pere goriot in section of la comedie humaine entitled scenes de la vie parisienne scenes of life in paris quickly thereafter he reclassified it due to its intense focus on private lives of its characters as one of scenes de la vie privee scenes of private life dedinsky pp 147 148 these categories and novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work depicting all society sketching it in immensity of its turmoil balzac 1842 although he had prepared only a small predecessor for la comedie humaine entitled etudes de moeurs at this time balzac carefully considered each work s place in project and frequently rearranged its structure robb p 234 dedinsky pp 129 131 plot summary novel opens with an extended description of maison vauquer a boarding house in paris rue neuve sainte genevieve covered with vines owned by widow madame vauquer residents include law student eugene de rastignac a mysterious agitator named vautrin and an elderly retired vermicelli maker named jean joachim goriot old man is ridiculed frequently by other boarders who soon learn that he has bankrupted himself to support his two well married daughters rastignac who moved to paris from south of france becomes attracted to upper class he has difficulty fitting in but is tutored by his cousin madame de beauseant in ways of high society rastignac endears himself to one of goriot s daughters delphine after extracting money from his own already poor family vautrin meanwhile tries to convince rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named victorine whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother he offers to clear way for rastignac by having brother killed in a duel rastignac refuses to go along with plot balking at idea of having someone killed to acquire their wealth but he takes note of vautrin s machinations this is a lesson in harsh realities of high society before long boarders learn that police are seeking vautrin revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed trompe la mort cheater of death vautrin arranges for a friend to kill victorine s brother in meantime and is captured by police goriot supportive of rastignac s interest in his daughter and furious with her husband s tyrannical control over her finds himself unable to help when his other daughter anastasie informs him that she has been selling off her husband s family jewelry to pay her lover s debts old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a stroke delphine does not visit goriot as he lies on his deathbed and anastasie arrives too late only once he has lost consciousness before dying goriot rages about their disrespect toward him his funeral is attended only by rastignac a servant named christophe and two paid mourners goriot s daughters rather than being present at funeral send their empty coaches each bearing their families respective coat of arms after short ceremony rastignac turns to face paris as lights of evening begin to appear he sets out to dine with delphine de nucingen and declares to city a nous deux maintenant it s between you and me now style balzac s style in le pere goriot is influenced by american novelist james fenimore cooper and scottish writer walter scott in cooper s representations of native americans balzac saw a human barbarism that survived through attempts at civilization in a preface to second edition in 1835 balzac wrote that title character goriot who made his fortune selling vermicelli during a time of widespread hunger was an illinois of flour trade and a huron of grain market kanes pp 4 5 vautrin refers to paris as a forest of new world where twenty varieties of savage tribes clash another sign of cooper s influence hunt p 92 scott was also a profound influence on balzac particularly in his use of real historical events as backdrop for his novels although history is not central to le pere goriot post napoleonic era serves as an important setting and balzac s use of meticulous detail reflects influence of scott in his 1842 introduction to la comedie humaine balzac praises scott as a modern troubadour who literature with spirit of past at same time balzac accused scottish writer of romanticizing history and tried to distinguish his own work with a more balanced view of human nature kanes pp 31 32 thumb left 1901 edition of works of honore de balzac including father goriot although novel is often referred to as a mystery barberis p 306 kanes pp 26 27 it is not an example of whodunit or detective fiction instead central puzzles are origins of suffering and motivations of unusual behavior characters appear in fragments with brief scenes providing small clues about their identity vautrin for example slips in and out of story offering advice to rastignac ridiculing goriot bribing housekeeper christophe to let him in after hours before he is revealed as a master criminal this pattern of people moving in and out of view mirrors balzac s use of characters throughout la comedie humaine kanes pp 27 28 le pere goriot is also recognized as a bildungsroman wherein a naive young person matures while learning ways of world kanes pp 30 31 brooks 1998 p ix stowe pp 24 25 see also ginsberg pp 32 44 rastignac is tutored by vautrin madame de beauseant goriot and others about truth of parisian society and coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success as an everyman he is initially repulsed by gruesome realities beneath society s gilded surfaces eventually however he embraces them kanes p 30 setting aside his original goal of mastering law he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing in some ways this mirrors balzac s own social education reflecting distaste he acquired for law after studying it for three years robb p 44 recurring characters le pere goriot especially in its revised form marks an important early instance of balzac s trademark use of recurring characters persons from earlier novels appear in later works usually during significantly different times of life pugh p 57 hunt pp 93 94 pugh makes it clear that other authors namely robert chasles pierre beaumarchais and de la had used this technique earlier although balzac did not follow in their footsteps pleased with effect he achieved with return of rastignac balzac included 23 characters in first edition of le pere goriot that would recur in later works during his revisions for later editions number increased to 48 robb p 253 hunt p 94 pugh pp 73 81 although balzac had used this technique before characters had always reappeared in minor roles as nearly identical versions of same people rastignac s appearance shows for first time in balzac s fiction a novel length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character pugh pp 78 79 brooks 1998 pp vii ix balzac experimented with this method throughout thirty years he worked on la comedie humaine it enabled a depth of characterization that went beyond simple narration or dialogue when characters reappear notes critic samuel rogers they do not step out of nowhere they emerge from privacy of their own lives which for an interval we have not been allowed to see rogers 182 bellos makes a similar point on p 21 although complexity of these characters lives inevitably led balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency mistakes are considered minor in overall scope of project robb p 254 readers are more often troubled by sheer number of people in balzac s world and feel deprived of important context for characters detective novelist arthur conan doyle said that he never tried to read balzac because he did not know where to begin quoted in robb p 254 see generally pugh this pattern of character reuse had repercussions for plot of le pere goriot baron de nucingen s reappearance in 1837 reveals that his wife s love affair with rastignac was planned and coordinated by baron himself this new detail sheds considerable light on actions of all three characters within pages of le pere goriot complementing evolution of their stories in later novel mccarthy p 96 pugh pp 177 178 realism balzac uses meticulous abundant detail to describe maison vauquer its inhabitants and world around them this technique gave rise to his title as father of realist novel brooks 2005 p 16 auerbach p 280 details focus mostly on penury of residents of maison vauquer much less intricate are descriptions of wealthier homes madame de beauseant s rooms are given scant attention and nucingen family lives in a house sketched in briefest detail mozet pp 348 349 kanes p 37 at start of novel balzac declares in english all is true this phrase is an allusion to william shakespeare since it was used at time as a title for an adaptation in france of henry viii bellos p 14 although characters and situations are fictions details employed and their reflection of realities of life in paris at time faithfully render world of maison vauquer auerbach p 282 rue neuve sainte genevieve where house is located presents a grim look about houses a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls balzac 1901 p 3 interiors of house are painstakingly described from shabby sitting room nothing can be more depressing to coverings on walls depicting a feast papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food balzac 1901 pp 5 and 18 respectively mozet p 351 balzac owed former detail to expertise of his friend hyacinthe de latouche who was trained in practice of hanging wallpaper robb 152 house is even defined by its repulsive smell unique to poor boardinghouse kanes p 52 themes thumb charter of 1814 granted by king louis xviii of france created a legal structure dominated by wealth and serves as backdrop for rastignac s maneuvers in le pere goriot social stratification one of main themes in le pere goriot is quest to understand and ascend society s strata charter of 1814 granted by king louis xviii had established a legal country which allowed only a small group of nation s most wealthy men to vote thus rastignac s drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in body politic as with scott s characters rastignac epitomizes in his words and actions zeitgeist in which he lives through his characters and narration balzac lays bare social darwinism of this society in one particularly blunt speech madame de beauseant tells rastignac this attitude is further explored by vautrin who tells rastignac secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been discovered because it was properly executed balzac 1901 p 115 this sentence has been frequently and somewhat inaccurately paraphrased as behind every great fortune is a great crime see for example porter eduardo mexico s plutocracy thrives on robber baron concessions new york times 27 august 2007 retrieved on 13 january 2008 influence of paris novel s representations of social stratification are specific to paris perhaps most densely populated city in europe at time kanes p 41 bellos pp 58 59 traveling only a few blocks as rastignac does continually takes reader into vastly different worlds distinguished by their architecture and reflecting class of their inhabitants paris in post napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods three of these are featured prominently in le pere goriot aristocratic area of faubourg saint germain newly upscale quarter of rue de la chaussee d antin and run down area on eastern slope of montagne sainte genevieve kanes p 36 these of city serve as which rastignac seeks to master vautrin meanwhile operates in stealth moving among them undetected kanes p 44 rastignac as naive young man from country seeks in these worlds a new home paris offers him a chance to abandon his far away family and remake himself in city s ruthless image barberis pp 310 311 his urban exodus is like that of many people who moved into french capital doubling its population between 1800 and 1830 texture of novel is thus inextricably linked to city in which it is set paris explains critic peter brooks is looming presence that gives novel its particular tone brooks 1998 p x it is said that in le pere goriot paris becomes a character in same way city did in hunchback of notre dame and london becomes in charles dickens works this is evident in balzac s portrayal of parisian society as mercilessly stratified corrupt amoral and money obsessed in addition protagonists living in its quarters were presented in perfect harmony with their environment corruption rastignac vautrin and goriot represent individuals corrupted by their desires in his thirst for advancement rastignac has been compared to faust with vautrin as mephistopheles kanes p 45 critic pierre barberis calls vautrin s lecture to rastignac one of great moments of comedie humaine and no doubt of all world literature barberis p 307 france s social upheaval provides vautrin with a playground for an ideology based solely on personal advancement he encourages rastignac to follow suit barberis p 309 still it is larger social structure that finally overwhelms rastignac s soul vautrin merely explains methods and causes although he rejects vautrin s offer of murder rastignac succumbs to principles of brutality upon which high society is built by end of novel he tells bianchon i m in hell and i have no choice but to stay there quoted in barberis p 312 while rastignac desires wealth and social status goriot longs only for love of his daughters a longing that borders on idolatry hunt p 89 crawford p 13 because he represents bourgeois wealth acquired through trade and not aristocratic primitive accumulation his daughters are happy to take his money but will see him only in private even as he is dying in extreme poverty at end of book he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball petrey p 329 family relations relations between family members follow two patterns bonds of marriage serve mostly as machiavellian means to financial ends while obligations of older generation to young take form of sacrifice and deprivation delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to baron de nucingen a money savvy banker he is aware of her extramarital affairs and uses them as a means to extort money from her anastasie meanwhile is married to comte de who cares less about illegitimate children she has than jewels she sells to provide for her lover who is conning her in a scheme that rastignac has heard was popular in paris this depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects harsh reality of unstable social structures of time kanes pp 46 49 auerbach p 285 bellos pp 46 51 thumb upright left balzac was accused of plagiarizing william shakespeare s play king lear given similarity of goriot s daughters anastasie and delphine to lear s children goneril and regan depicted here in a 1902 painting by edwin austin abbey parents meanwhile give endlessly to their children goriot sacrifices everything for his daughters balzac refers to him in novel as christ of paternity for his constant suffering on behalf of his children kanes p 47 bellos pp 81 82 that they abandon him lost in their pursuit of social status only adds to his misery end of book contrasts goriot s deathbed moments with a festive ball hosted by madame de beauseant attended by his daughters as well as rastignac suggesting a fundamental schism between society and family petrey p 337 betrayal of goriot s daughters is often compared to that of characters in shakespeare s king lear hunt pp 87 89 robb p 257 bellos pp 34 35 balzac was even accused of plagiarism when novel was first published discussing these similarities critic george saintsbury claims that goriot s daughters are as surely of their father as lear s daughters goneril and regan as herbert j hunt points out in balzac s comedie humaine however goriot s tale is in some ways more tragic since he has a regan and a goneril but no cordelia hunt p 87 narrative of goriot s painful relations with his children has also been interpreted as a tragicomic parable of louis xvi s decline at a crucial moment of filial sentiment in balzac s novel vautrin breaks in singing o richard o mon roi royalist anthem that precipitated october days of 1789 and eventual downfall of louis xvi a connection that would have been powerful to balzac s readers in 1830s douthwaite pp 140 152 an ill founded faith in paternal legitimacy follows both goriot and louis xvi into grave rastignac s family off stage also sacrifices extensively for him convinced that he cannot achieve a decent status in paris without a considerable display of wealth he writes to his family and asks them to send him money sell some of your old jewelry my kind mother i will give you other jewels very soon balzac 1901 p 85 they do send him money he requests and although it is not described directly in novel endure significant hardship for themselves as a result his family absent while he is in paris becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice although goriot and vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him by end of novel they are gone and he is alone barberis pp 310 314 reception and legacy le pere goriot is widely considered balzac s essential novel its influence on french literature has been considerable as shown by novelist felicien marceau s remark we are all children of le pere goriot quoted in oliver p 149 brooks refers to its perfection of form its economy of means and ends brooks 1998 p ix martin kanes meanwhile in his book le pere goriot anatomy of a troubled world calls it keystone of comedie humaine kanes p 9 it is central text of anthony pugh s voluminous study balzac s recurring characters and entire chapters have been written about detail of maison vauquer see mozet as well as downing george e a famous boarding house studies in balzac s realism e p dargan ed new york russell russell 1932 because it has become such an important novel for study of french literature le pere goriot has been translated many times into many languages thus says balzac biographer graham robb goriot is one of novels of la comedie humaine that can safely be read in english for what it is robb p 258 on other hand when michal peled ginsberg conducted a survey of professors in preparation for his book approaches to teaching balzac s old goriot participants complained that most used translation by marion ayton crawford is not very good but they say they cannot come up with an alternative ginsberg p 4 initial reviews of book were mixed some reviewers accused balzac of plagiarism or of overwhelming reader with detail and painting a simplistic picture of parisian high society kanes p 13 others attacked questionable morals of characters implying that balzac was guilty of legitimizing their opinions he was condemned for not including more individuals of honorable intent in book kanes pp 14 15 balzac responded with disdain in second preface of 1835 he wrote with regard to goriot poor man his daughters refused to recognize him because he had lost his fortune now critics have rejected him with excuse that he was immoral quoted in kanes p 53 many critics of time though were positive a review in le journal des femmes proclaimed that balzac s eye penetrates everywhere like a cunning serpent to probe women s most intimate secrets quoted in kanes p 15 another review in la revue du theatre praised his admirable technique of details many reviews positive and negative were evidence of book s popularity and success one publisher s critique dismissed balzac as a boudoir writer although it predicted for him a brief career but a glorious and enviable one balzac himself was extremely proud of work declaring even before final installment was published le pere goriot is a raging success my fiercest enemies have had to bend knee i have triumphed over everything over friends as well as envious quoted in kanes p 12 as was his custom he revised novel between editions compared to other novels however le pere goriot remained largely unchanged from its initial version in years following its release novel was often adapted for stage two theatrical productions in 1835 several months after book s publication sustained its popularity and increased public s regard for balzac kanes pp 15 16 in 20th century a number of film versions were produced including adaptations directed by travers vale 1915 jacques de baroncelli 1922 and paddy russell 1968 name of rastignac meanwhile has become an iconic sobriquet in french language a rastignac is synonymous with a person willing to climb social ladder at any cost another well known line of this book by balzac is when vautrin
