military commander lieutenant colonel george etherington disagreed on how to react and ended up surrendering without significant resistance both leaders were subjected to inquiries over surrender

negotiations between british and black caribs political situation on saint vincent was somewhat tense island was divided roughly in half between land controlled by white planters principally british and that controlled by local black carib population line dividing these territories ran from island s north west to its south east and had been agreed in a treaty signed in 1773 after first carib war neither side had been happy with compromise agreement and its terms were a continuing source of friction craton pp 151 153 british had uniquely among its caribbean possessions had to establish a chain of outposts to protect planter population morris p xv saint vincent s colonial government and defences were in some disarray governor valentine morris had assumed office in 1776 when isle was granted a separate government and reported then that it had virtually no defences in addition to difficult relations with caribs british population was also sympathetic to cause of colonial independence french capture of dominica in 1778 had raised constitutional questions surrounding imposition of martial law and colonial assembly had consequently refused to appropriate funds for improving island defences governor morris had spent his own funds instead on improvements contributing to financial difficulties he would run into later o shaughnessy pp 187 193 only british military presence on island was a garrison of about 450 men from royal american regiment under command of lieutenant colonel george etherington most of whom were poorly trained recruits and about half of whom were unfit for duty etherington rather than training and drilling his troops or fully staffing island s outposts was employing significant numbers of them to clear land on an estate on north west side of island shephard pp 36 38 etherington s estate was on territory on carib side of island and its grant for etherington s service in seven years war but made under circumstances caribs viewed as illegal was a major source of annoyance to caribs craton pp 148 190 governor de bouille had established regular contact with caribs and was supplying them with arms shephard pp 38 39 in late august 1778 french

martinique on 9 june and reached waters off saint vincent on 16th one of privateers was driven ashore on windward side of island losing 82 men two of ships anchored in young s bay near while third anchored off kingstown ships flew no national colours leading to local speculation as to their intent local planters who thought they might be merchant vessels expected to pick up sugar harvest prevented a sentry at one of island s coastal fortifications from firing a signal cannon and one man sent out to one of ships was taken prisoner as french began landing their troops a small company under captain de la roque was landed on eastern shore to mobilise caribs shephard pp 40 p 88 these irregular forces which grew to number about 800 quickly overran british settlements near borders between british lands and those of caribs while du rumain led his main body of troops toward kingstown levot p 796 alarm was eventually raised and governor morris thought it would be possible to make a stand against french in hills above kingstown in hopes that royal navy would bring relief lieutenant colonel etherington was however opposed to this especially when size of approaching carib force became apparent and a truce flag was sent to french du rumain demanded an unconditional surrender which morris rejected during negotiations three ships were spotted flying british flags du rumain returned to his ship and quickly determined that strangers were supply ships two he captured but third got away after further negotiations terms were agreed that were similar to those granted by de
