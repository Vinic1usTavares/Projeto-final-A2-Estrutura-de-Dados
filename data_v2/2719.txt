z39 was a type 1936a mob destroyer built for germany s kriegsmarine during world war ii she was laid down in august 1940 and completed three years later her anti aircraft armament was increased extensively during war she served with 6th destroyer flotilla her entire german career which she spent escorting transports in baltic sea laying mines and bombarding land forces she served with a total of three different countries from 1943 to 1945 with kriegsmarine as z39 from 1945 to 1947 with us navy as dd 939 and from 1948 to 1964 with french navy as q 128 over her german career she laid numerous barrages of mines in baltic sea and bombarded soviet forces several times in last months of war z39 helped escort steamships which were evacuating german soldiers and civilians from eastern europe to denmark she was damaged twice once from soviet planes while in paldiski and other time from british planes while in kiel at end of war she was transferred to united states navy where she was experimented upon to test her equipment especially her high pressure steam propulsion plant after us navy deemed her obsolete she was transferred to french navy where she was cannibalized for parts and made into a pontoon for minesweepers background destroyer function during world war two destroyers served three basic functions first to act as screening ships to defend their fleets from enemy fleets second to attack screening ships of enemy fleets and third to defend their fleet from submarines how destroyers were actually used varied upon country germany abandoned third function almost entirely which showed in german destroyers lack of strong anti submarine armament preferring to rely upon a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re fitted as minelayers role of destroyer began to vary much more heavily as ww2 progressed where british destroyers were built for escorting fleets defending them from enemy planes and sinking submarines german destroyers were built to escort fleets or act as torpedo boats interbellum after end of world war one germany signed treaty of versailles which put heavy limits both upon size and displacement of warships that germany could possess during interbellum period between first and second world wars almost all warship categories experienced a large growth in average size of their ships and size of their armaments as a result of treaty germany felt that it could not compete with ships of allied navies and therefore began to ignore treaties at first covertly but later openly after hitler publicly denounced them all german ships of time had their displacements purposefully understated so as to have their official sizes comply with treaty at first these changes were made with goal of being able to match or exceed french and polish destroyers but later on it was required that these destroyers be able to match british destroyers a much harder goal due to comparatively small number of german shipyards compared to british or french germany adopted a policy of their destroyers so that they bore similar armament to french and polish light cruisers to compensate for their low numbers several negative effects came with this however such as making them slower and overweight although german heavy destroyers matched british light cruisers in armament they were much less seaworthy and had far worse facilities for control and use of their guns plan z plan z was a german naval re armament plan started in 1939 involving building ten battleships four aircraft carriers twelve battlecruisers three pocket battleships five heavy cruisers forty four light cruisers sixty eight destroyers and 249 submarines these ships were to be split into two battle fleets a home fleet to tie down british war fleet in north sea and a raiding fleet to wage war upon british convoys erich raeder grand admiral of kriegsmarine was assured by hitler that war would not start until at least 1945 raeder had wanted deadline for plan z to be finished to be 1948 but hitler lowered it to 1945 world war two actually started in 1939 meaning that very few of germany s heavy ships were finished in time for start of war germany s main naval opponents france and england had together compared to number germany had upon entry in parentheses 22 battleships 2 7 carriers 0 22 heavy cruisers 4 61 light cruisers 6 255 destroyers 34 135 submarines 57 of which less than half could actually serve in atlantic or north sea due to severe advantage their enemies had raeder remarked that kriegsmarine could not hope to win and thus only course for them was to die valiantly design and armament z39 was long at waterline and long overall had a beam of and a draught of she had a displacement of at standard load and at full load she had a complement of 332 before her barbara project modifications she was armed with seven anti aircraft guns two twin anti aircraft guns a twin l 48 gun on a turret forward two single l 48 guns in a aft two quadruple torpedo tubes and carried 60 mines she had greek coat of arms on either side of her twin turret after modifications she carried eighteen 2 cm guns fourteen 3 7 cm guns and rest of her armament remained unchanged her propulsion system consisted of six wagner boilers feeding high pressure superheated steam at and to two sets of wagner geared steam turbines these gave ship a rated power of and a top speed of she had a range of at her cruising speed of sensor suite included a fumo 21 radar which was placed on ship s bridge and four sumatra aerials on foremast searchlights she also had several other radars and radar detectors including a fumb 3 bali and fumo 81 berlin s on her masthead and a fumo 63 k she also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around entire ship but was covered by her spray deflector service history z39 was ordered on 26 june 1939 laid down by germaniawerft in yard in kiel on 15 august 1940 launched on 2 december 1941 and was commissioned on 21 august 1943 her commissioning had been delayed by lengthy construction times and z39 was not fully operational until 7 january 1944 these construction issues were due to multiple reasons such as small number of german shipyards which forced kriegsmarine to choose priorities inexperienced naval engineers and lack of workers at some point between her launching and commissioning she was modified under project barbara with addition of three pairs of anti aircraft aa guns added one pair forward of her bridge one pair abreast after her funnel and one pair abreast forward of her funnel she had one pair of single 3 7 cm 1 5 in guns added on to her after funnel platform she had a pair of twin guns added to her bridge wings she had a pair of quadruple 2 cm 0 8 in guns and a pair of single 2 cm 0 8 in guns added to an extended deckhouse in her no 3 gun position after these changes she began minelaying operations in skagerrak and kattegat until march when she was transferred to reval off gulf of finland german service after this move she served in 6th destroyer flotilla alongside german destroyers and between 12 and 13 february z39 laid mines in dorothea a barrage alongside two other destroyers and three minelayers on 10 march she took part in minelaying operations along with two other destroyers between 11 and 12 march she bombarded soviet forces near narva from 13 march to 22 april she took part in six different minelaying operations one such operation lasted from 13 to 14 april in which z39 two other destroyers and six minelayers laid seeigel 6b mine barrage south of suur tyarsaari from 16 to 17 april z39 two other destroyers and six minelayers laid seeigel 3b barrage off of island in narva bay a smokescreen was laid during operation in order to prevent ships from being shelled by soviet coastal artillery an operation from 21 to 22 april involving z39 two other destroyers and six minelayers was cancelled midway due to one of minelayers hitting a mine and then sinking from 23 to 24 april z39 two other destroyers and eight minelayers laid seeigel 7b 3 barrage in narva bay from 25 to 26 april z39 two other destroyers and nine minelayers laid seeigel 8b barrage southwest of suur tyarsaari during operations between 13 and 26 april a total of 2 831 mines and 1 174 sweep detonators were laid on 23 june of same year she was damaged by soviet bombers while moored off of paldiski and was escorted to libau by z28 after reaching libau on 29 june z39 made her way to kiel for repairs by way of piast canal near swinemunde while at port in kiel on 24 july she was hit by a bomb when british air force bombed kiel harbour causing damage to her quarterdeck and leading to her having to be towed back to swinemunde she was repaired using parts cannibalised from z44 and z45 z44 had been damaged in an air raid on 29 july while in bremen and sunk so that only her superstructure remained above water and z45 was being built z39 had been repaired enough to be seaworthy on 28 february 1945 and was ordered to sail to copenhagen for more extensive repairs but due to nazi germany s lack of fuel she sailed to sassnitz instead during this time kriegsmarine which had always dealt with shortages in oil reached critically low levels of oil supply on 25 march z39 finished repairs while in swinemunde and resumed operations on 1 april from 5 april to 7 april she escorted transports and parts of task force thiele around bay of danzig from 8 april to 9 april she provided naval gunfire support for german army on 10 april she and escorted german destroyer which had sustained damage from both mines and bombs to warnemunde and swinemunde from 1944 german surface ships were called upon to provide support for army group north along baltic sea coast this often involved shelling land targets something in which german ship crews had no training this tactical use of cruisers destroyers and torpedo boats was difficult in restrictive waterways of baltic but despite these difficulties it justified continued existence of surface fleet soviet union s continued advances along east baltic coast also spurred this change from spring of 1945 to near end of war surface forces of kriegsmarine became almost entirely focused upon resupplying and supporting garrisons along baltic coast later after march kriegsmarine embarked upon task of evacuating hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers from east ahead of soviet forces which were rapidly pushing westward z39 took part in a number of these evacuation operations on 15 april z39 two other destroyers and four torpedo boats escorted german steamships matthias stinnes eberhart pretoria and askari to copenhagen with a total of 20 000 refugees on 2 may she shelled soviet army forces from oder estuary on 3 may she alongside battleship moved to protect bridge across river at wolgast after schlesien hit a mine near greifswalder oie on same day z39 towed her to swinemunde where schlesien was deliberately grounded ship was placed so that her guns could fire on and defend roads leading into city one day later z39 three other destroyers one torpedo boat one ship tender one auxiliary cruiser one anti aircraft ship and five steamer ships sailed for copenhagen taking 35 000 wounded soldiers and refugees with them on 8 may z39 six other destroyers and five torpedo boats set sail with 20 000 soldiers and civilians from hela to glucksburg and arrived on may 9 following german surrender she was decommissioned from kriegsmarine on 10 may 1945 at kiel american and french service thumb z39 underway off boston on 22 august 1945 at some point after war ended z39 was sailed by a mixed german and british crew to wilhelmshaven and then on 6 july 1945 to plymouth us claimed her as a prize ship on 12 july she left england on 30 july and arrived in boston on 7 august where on 14 september after extensive trials she was commissioned into us navy as dd 939 she was used by us navy in order to test her equipment namely her high pressure steam propulsion plant in late 1947 us navy deemed her obsolete and transferred her to french navy after arriving in casablanca in january 1948 she sailed to toulon redesignated q 128 and was cannibalised for her parts which were used to repair french destroyers kleber ex hoche ex z25 and marceau ex she served as a pontoon for
