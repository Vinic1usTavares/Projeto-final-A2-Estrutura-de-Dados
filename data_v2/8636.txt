in south atlantic description president class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load they had an overall length of a beam of and a mean deep draught of ships were powered by a pair of english electric geared steam turbines each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two babcock wilcox boilers turbines developed a total of which gave a maximum speed of they carried of fuel oil that gave them a range of at their crew numbered 14 officers and 200 ratings presidents were armed with one twin gun mount for qf 4 5 inch 114 mm mk v dual purpose guns forward and one twin mount for bofors anti aircraft guns for anti submarine work ships were fitted with type 162 170 and 177m sonars for pair of triple barrelled mk 10 limbo anti submarine mortars they were equipped with a type 293q surface search radar type 262 and 275 gunnery radars type 277q height finding radar and a type 978 navigation radar by mid 1960s it was obvious that sonars of president class were capable of detecting submarines well outside range of limbo anti submarine mortars and south africans decided to follow lead of royal navy in giving them ability to operate helicopters that could carry anti submarine torpedoes or depth charges to a considerable distance from ships therefore forward limbo mortar was removed and its space was plated over to form a small flight deck bofors mount its director and aft superstructure was replaced by a hangar for a westland wasp helicopter two single bofors guns were positioned on hangar roof and provisions were made for four browning machine guns a pair of american mk 32 triple barrelled anti submarine torpedo tubes were added amidships and their electronics were upgraded including addition of a thomson csf jupiter early warning radar atop a new mainmast unlike her sister ships who were upgraded after president kruger ship retained her original fire control system construction and career three president class frigates were ordered by south african navy in late 1950s following simonstown agreement with royal navy rn ship that became president kruger was actually second ship to be ordered of three sisters and was ordered from yarrow shipbuilders on 18 september 1957 with name president steyn government wanted first ship to be completed to receive name of paul kruger first state president of south african republic and a strike at alexander stephens and sons shipyard delayed laying of that ship s keel so she exchanged names with first yarrow built ship which had already been laid down and became president kruger she was laid

future politician lance corporal tony leon was official photographer for this journey aging president class frigates were earmarked for disposal in 1978 with newer french built vessels scheduled to replace them to provide manpower for french corvettes under construction president kruger was placed in reserve in early 1977 however imposition of united nations security council resolution 418 put an end to both sale of replacement corvettes as well as any major refurbishment of president class frigates although president kruger had her fire control system upgraded and her electronics modernized during a refit in 1979 1980 she recommissioned on 15 august and later participated in 20th anniversary of republic s founding in may 1981 and exercised with a squadron from republic of china together with president pretorius shortly afterwards two sisters made a showing flag cruise along east african coast accident and sinking on morning of 18 february 1982 president kruger was conducting anti submarine exercises for submarine officer commanding course with president pretorius emily hobhouse and tafelberg high intensity exercises progressed from 06 00 to 23 00 over several days with different candidate submarine captains being given an opportunity of executing a mock attack against tafelberg rest of day ships followed a narrow zig zag course that allowed submarine repeated opportunities to engage surface ships in lower intensity exercises while bulk of crew rested frigates too were using opportunity to carry out anti submarine exercises with each ship given a patrol sector ahead of tafelberg escorts were expected to patrol their areas in a random fashion from tafelberg president krugers station was on tafelbergs port side between 10 and 330 degrees and president steyn had a station on starboard side at approximately 04 00 whole formation had to change direction by 154 degrees a near complete reversal in direction to stay within their training area frigates had to change direction first to maintain their protective positions ahead of tafelberg on new heading president krugers options were to turn 200 degrees to port or 154 degrees to starboard while latter turn was smaller and tactically sound it was more dangerous as it involved turning towards other two ships critically inexperienced officer of watch oow elected to turn to starboard and initiated a turn with 10 degrees of rudder rather than standard 15 degree turn a 10 degree turn had a larger radius and would take longer to execute than a 15 degree turn thereby allowing tafelberg more time to close on ship turning in front of her shortly after beginning turn an argument ensued between oow and principal warfare officer pwo over proper amount of wheel to apply about two thirds of way through turn operations room lost radar contact with tafelberg in clutter because high definition navigation radar was broken and ship was using less precise search radar oow was unable to recover situation and tafelbergs bow impacted president kruger on her port side at 03 55 impact tore a large hole in her side and killed 13 of 15 men sleeping near point of collision ship took on a large list and captain ordered abandon ship at 04 32 exercise was immediately terminated and other ships present began rescue operations more ships both military and civilian began arriving after dawn as did aircraft from south african air force a total of 177 crewmen of 193 aboard were rescued aftermath thumb model of sas president kruger at south african naval museum in simonstown a naval board of inquiry was appointed shortly afterwards that determined cause of collision was of a lack of seamanship by captain and watch officers of ship justice minister kobie coetsee subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into death of only crewman whose body was found inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on captain and pwo notes citations external
