avalon hill as part of avalon s attempt to bolster its computer game business it was originally announced as beyond squad leader a tie in to avalon s million selling squad leader board wargame franchise however companies relationship was troubled and atomic broke away after a high profile departure at its publisher renaming project close combat atomic continued production with microsoft and ultimately released game in july 1996 military psychologist dr steven silver worked with team to increase accuracy of close combats psychological modeling with sales of 200 000 copies game was a commercial success critics offered praise to its visuals and several commended its innovation conversely its slow scrolling was often criticized and some labeled its use of psychological models as a fundamental mistake game started close combat series which encompassed 17 titles and sold in excess of 5 million copies by 2018 atomic developed four sequels to close combat by 2000 and later created close combat marines for united states marine corps following company s sale to destineer franchise has continued at other developers under publisher matrix games since 2007 gameplay left thumb a top down battle plays out between germany and united states near a forest in one of bocage regions of france close combat is a real time computer wargame that takes place from a top down graphical

between united states 29th infantry division and germany s 352nd infantry division in six weeks after invasion of normandy player is able to control either side and manages infantry crew served weapons and armor via six commands move fire move fast defend hide and smoke tactics such as cover suppression and unit positioning are required to win soldiers are vulnerable in large groups and while charging game s battles play out in bocage environments open plains and towns such as saint lo each soldier in close combat behaves according to a simulated psyche which influences his actions combat readiness and obedience to player s commands mental and physical combat stresses impact a soldier s behavior and morale an exhausted or scared squad may grow reluctant to shoot or move or may fire inaccurately a soldier under severe stress can become shell shocked and entirely unable to fight or enter a berserk rage units will often disobey poor or dangerous orders such as exiting cover

confrontations or engage in a long form campaign which extends from normandy landings to battle of saint lo 29th infantry division wins campaign by claiming saint lo in under 43 days while german side focuses on delaying united states players are given pre selected forces at start of each mission and are scored based on number of enemy units destroyed and objectives captured at end in addition to single player battles against a computer opponent game contains multiplayer support for up to two players development origins close combat began production at atomic games in 1992 while company was working on v for victory video game series under publisher three sixty pacific it was originally called project x and focused on real time infantry tactics in a world war ii setting inspiration for project as a real time wargame first came when atomic president keith zabalaoui encountered dune ii dr steven silver a specialist in post traumatic stress disorder among military veterans approached team with his research into state trait anxiety during this period he subsequently helped to develop a psychological modeling system for project xs soldiers zabalaoui later said that company s more traditional wargames never really excited him as a designer and he noted that veterans atomic had consulted for those games repeatedly brought up genre s unrealistic portrayal of soldiers behavior thumb right avalon hill adopted and rebranded atomic games project x as beyond squad leader a tie in to a successful line of board wargames following a split with three sixty that culminated in a lawsuit for unpaid royalties atomic was signed to avalon hills computer game division in 1993 by producer jim rose initially avalon offered team a chance to create a one to one adaptation of company s squad leader board wargame a computer version of squad leader had been considered at avalon hill for several years as game and its sequel advanced squad leader were commercial successes in board form with sales over 1 million copies by 1997 however complexity of series had made this idea too daunting in past according to computer gaming worlds terry coleman after being shown project x avalon hill chose to adopt and rebrand game as beyond squad leader and atomic team started developing this project and world at war series for their new publisher this partnership was a key piece of avalon hill s effort led by rose to revive its computer game branch in face of flagging board game sales public anticipation for beyond squad leader was high william r trotter of pc gamer us declared it perhaps most eagerly awaited pc wargame ever thanks in part to board titles fanatical fanbase however atomic s project was never set to be a literal adaptation of physical squad leader game breaking from its source material adaptation focused on simulating psychology of small groups of soldiers via real time gameplay soldiers ai dictated much of their behavior beyond player s control zabalaoui explained in 1993 that he hoped to capture experience of real world military commanders who cannot tell what their men are going to do in any given situation until it happens to emphasize this core element team automated advanced squad leaders detailed calculations and focus ed on what game is really all about which is tactics and on play of game rather than looking up rules according to zabalaoui he later noted that his goal was to recreate spirit of squad leader without adopting its design zabalaoui expected beyond squad leaders deviations to prove controversial from start and decision subsequently polarized wargame community particularly biggest fans of original board series with avalon hill beyond squad leader underwent a long and troubled development cycle and atomic and avalon hill experienced creative friction during creation of both it and world at war games computer gaming world columnist alan emrich wrote in 1995 to say there was no love lost between jim rose and atomic s keith zabalaoui would be a gracious understatement game was originally announced for a september 1994 release but computer gaming world reported a rumor in july 1994 that project had been postponed to early 1995 by april that year pc gamer us estimated that beyond squad leader was 65 complete and on track for a summer launch it was ultimately described as vaporware stephen poole of gamespot while william r trotter noted that it looked like it would never come out rose later complained that avalon hill s parent company monarch office services was disinterested and conservative in allocating funds and distribution to computer game division he argued that lack of support led to an unnecessarily slow development cycle for beyond squad leader left thumb atomic games sought to recreate combat stress reactions of real soldiers and hired a specialist in post traumatic stress disorder among military veterans to guarantee accuracy by april 1995 beyond squad leaders team size had reached four main programmers led by coder steve mariotti roughly 10 team members were ultimately involved in game atomic adopted a relatively loose team structure for project zabalaoui provided general plan and oversight while others designed many sections in large part by themselves zabalaoui found that this type of delegated work deepened game and made development more enjoyable an overriding goal across team was to attract both mainstream strategy game players and hardcore wargamers latter of whom were known for being difficult to please according to zabalaoui atomic tried to combine detailed simulation for hardcore players with accessible audiovisuals and a streamlined interface historical research for project continued through planning stage and into production collaborating with dr steven silver atomic gave each soldier an individual anxiety index based on tiredness preparedness combat experience past successes and other factors according to t liam mcdonald of boot these factors were reduced to numbers and incorporated into probability tables that determine soldiers actions and change in response to events during play alongside soldiers individual psychological models atomic designed a model for a squad s overall anxiety programmer john anderson explained that influence of team and how that team reacts as a unit makes a huge difference as to whether an individual soldier will actually obey an order two complementary algorithms tactical tai and strategic sai power game s ai system while tai controls psychological modeling and low level action sai is constantly analyzing battlefield for enemy troops and keeping tabs on big picture zabalaoui said game ultimately grew to 2 000 source lines of code that relate to psychological modeling and more cpu time was allocated to its ai simulation than to its visuals by june 1995 rose had left avalon hill to found talonsoft and beyond squad leader had entered alpha testing he felt that game s limited budget and support intensified after monarch launched costly magazine girls life and he left for talonsoft as a result rose said at time if they d given me power and money to do what needed doing beyond squad leader would be out by now avalon hill director of software development bill replied that while company s decisions certainly are conservative board and computer game divisions were profitable and their overall situation was really pretty good switch to microsoft atomic games split with avalon hill in september 1995 and d day america invades was two companies last game together according to emrich zabalaoui remarked that this event was purely a business decision and that there was no ill will between companies while beyond squad leader title remained avalon hill s property atomic owned all other aspects of project and chose to continue development under a new title at time zabalaoui told trotter that a large company had recently approached atomic over project he further remarked i can t say at this point what game will be called although i personally like close combat by december 1995 game s publisher was announced as microsoft atomic was first developer contracted in microsoft s wider push into strategy games which later included ensemble studios according to zabalaoui project s real time nature and psychological modeling had attracted publisher which at time was seeking developers with a good track record who could help get them established atomic games was nearly bankrupt and deal saved company beyond squad leader was ultimately renamed close combat and microsoft displayed it at 1996 electronic entertainment expo e3 in may after more than three years of development close combat was completed in june 1996 it was originally set for release on july 23 with an expected price point of 40 but certain stores made it available at that price by july 7 reception close combat was commercially successful upon its release it became united states 13th best selling computer game of july 1996 according to market research firm pc data next generation reported that it was among microsoft s most successful titles as of march 1997 game achieved global sales of roughly 200 000 copies by early 1999 and attracted a younger demographic than atomic s past games zabalaoui said that team was very pleased with its commercial performance and that it had outsold their earlier efforts by around ten to one however he noted that it was frustrating to see close combat sell only 200 000 units when other rts titles sell 5 times that or more reviewer for computer games strategy plus steve wartofsky hailed close combat as an intuitive combat simulation akin to simcity 2000 he praised its graphics and streamlined quality and called its in game documentation wonderful magazine later nominated close combat as its pick for best wargame of 1996 but ultimately gave prize to that year s battleground games shiloh antietam and waterloo in computer gaming world patrick c miller wrote that game looks sounds and plays like nothing else and considered it a flawed success its originality and tactical realism received high marks but he heavily criticized its limited documentation in contrast to wartofsky s view this issue was compounded by its unresponsive controls and slow scrolling while wartofsky praised close combats stripped down quality as focus including its small scale campaign and lack of a level editor miller considered these signs of product s shallowness close combats focus is too narrow its depth too limited he argued next generations reviewer echoed miller s criticism of jerky scrolling but disagreed with his overall positive assessment and labeled game a serious microsoft misfire writer found its ai system fundamentally flawed and remarked that while allowing troops to disobey orders is interesting in theory in practice it makes game frustrating and unfair michael e ryan of pc magazine shared next generations negative view of game despite echoing miller s and wartofsky s praise for its visuals he considered troop ai questionable and disliked abundance of on screen data we immediately found ourselves longing for relative simplicity of command conquer wrote ryan conversely andrew wright called close combat a big step forward for wargamers in pc zone despite its scrolling issues for him it was an effective compromise between command conquer and complexity of traditional wargaming although again noting sluggish scrolling pc gamess andrew miller agreed with wright that close combat represented a new plateau for computer wargames and held its audiovisuals in particularly high regard like writer for next generation however he criticized visuals for being difficult to read he noted i often mistook american soldiers for shrubs in 1997 editors of pc gamer us presented close combat with their 1996 best wargame award and remarked that its developers had broken away from long established turn based models of past it was also nominated in this category by computer game entertainment but lost prize to tigers on 2 pc gamer soon named close combat 46th best computer game ever released and hailed it as a radical leap forward for wargames one of most predictable and staid of pc game genres legacy early sequels close combat was first game in long running close combat series which contained 17 entries and sold above 5 million units by 2018 its direct sequel close combat a bridge too far followed in october 1997 developed by atomic games and published again by microsoft game was a commercial success with sales equal to those of its predecessor following release of close combat iii russian front in december 1998 microsoft opted to discontinue close combat franchise while all three games had been profitable marc of cnet gamecenter reported indications that company is now only interested in publishing games that have potential of selling 250 000 units or more up to that point company had published close combat games on a title to title basis according to keith zabalaoui atomic reacted by splitting from microsoft and migrating to mindscape s strategic simulations ssi label in april 1999 in order to create close combat iv battle of bulge 1999 later that year zabalaoui said that microsoft had been a terrific publisher and that atomic had parted company with them as friends who may some day work together again thumb left mattel s purchase and divestment of learning company atomic games publisher caused significant financial trouble at company atomic began work on a fifth close combat game with ssi in early 2000 however mindscape had since been sold to mattel when that company bought learning company mindscape s parent for 3 5 billion in 1999 as a result close combat v was published by mattel interactive a financially unstable company computer games magazines robert mayer noted in september 2000 that future of this game series is up in air mattel interactive is perennially on trading block and atomic has lost some key staff members in recent months computer gaming world writer mark asher later called mattel s push into game industry a disastrous foray mattel s stock dropped and much of its management including its ceo was forced to resign late in september mattel sold learning company at a bargain price to gores group a spokesman for new managers announced that they expected to make it profitable within six months fifth close combat subtitled invasion normandy was released in october two months later atomic was forced to lay off all employees beyond zabalaoui and two other senior members after gores group canceled team s in development hammer s slammers game trey walker of gamespot reported at time according to zabalaoui gores exercised its right to cancel project for any reason or no reason at all later history in 2003 atomic collaborated with united states marine corps usmc to develop close combat marines published commercially by usmc and used within organization and at united states military academy as a training program douglass c perry of ign noted that it was usmc s first ever game project following this title atomic worked with destineer and usmc on close combat first to fight a first person shooter intended again as a training tool for military announced in april 2004 alongside strategy title close combat red phoenix first to fight was described by peter of destineer as an effort to combine destineer s first person technology with atomic s military expertise destineer ultimately purchased atomic games in may 2005 with stated goal of reviving close combat strategy franchise first five entries in series had sold above 1 2 million units by that time in 2006 destineer licensed close combat intellectual property to matrix games two companies announced plans to remake and update atomic s early entries in series partnering with developer cso simtek matrix began creation of close combat cross of iron an expanded remake of close combat iii companies decided not to update first close combat a choice dictated by age of code and fact that series and game engine changed dramatically after first iteration according to simtek s shaun wallace matrix proceeded to release cross of iron in 2007 it was followed by modern tactics 2007 wacht am rhein 2008 and longest day 2009 developed by strategy 3 tactics and last stand arnhem 2010 developed by strategy 3 tactics and black hand studios these titles remade marines battle of bulge invasion normandy and a bridge too far respectively after completing
