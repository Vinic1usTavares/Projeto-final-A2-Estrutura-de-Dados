omayra sanchez garzon august 28 1972 november 16 1985 was a 13 year old colombian girl killed in armero tolima by 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz volcano volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive lahars volcanically induced mudflows landslides and debris flows rushed into river valleys below mountain killing nearly 23 000 people and destroying armero and 13 other villages after a lahar demolished her home sanchez was pinned beneath debris of her house where she remained trapped in water for three days her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers who put great efforts into comforting her after 60 hours of struggling she died likely as a result of either gangrene or hypothermia her death highlighted failure of officials to respond correctly to threat of volcano contrasted with efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims despite inadequate supplies and equipment a photograph of sanchez taken by photojournalist frank fournier shortly before she died was published in news outlets around world it was later designated world press photo of year for 1985 sanchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture remembered through music literature and commemorative articles background on november 13 1985 nevado del ruiz volcano erupted at 9 09 pm of that night pyroclastic flows exploding from crater melted mountain s icecap forming lahars volcanic mudflows and debris flows which cascaded into river valleys below one lahar consisting of three pulses did most of damage traveling at per second first pulse enveloped most of town of armero killing up to 20 000 people two later pulses weakened buildings another lahar killed 1 800 people in nearby chinchina in total 23 000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to armero were destroyed left thumb formerly in center of this area town of armero was buried by thick volcanic mudflows in 1985 loss of life was exacerbated by authorities failure to take costly preventive measures in absence of clear signs of imminent danger there had been no substantial eruption of volcano since 1845 which contributed to complacency locals called volcano sleeping lion in september 1985 as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked area around volcano officials began planning for evacuation a hazard map was prepared in october it highlighted danger from falling ash and rock near murillo santa isabel and as well as threat of lahars in mariquita chinchina and armero map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk many survivors had never heard of it though several major newspapers had featured it henry villegas of colombian institute of mining and geology stated that maps clearly demonstrated armero would be affected by lahars but had met with strong opposition from economic interests he said that short time between map s preparation and eruption hindered timely distribution colombian congress criticised scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering and government and army were preoccupied with guerrilla campaign in bogota national capital which was then at its height death toll was increased by lack of early warnings unwise land use as villages were built in likely path of lahars and lack of preparedness in communities near volcano colombia s worst natural disaster armero tragedy as it came to be known was second deadliest volcanic disaster of 20th century surpassed only by 1902 eruption of mount pelee it was fourth deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 ad its lahars were deadliest in volcanic history life omayra sanchez lived in neighborhood of santander with her parents alvaro enrique a rice and sorghum collector and maria along with her brother alvaro enrique and aunt maria adela garzon prior to eruption her mother had traveled to bogota on business night of disaster omayra and her family were awake worrying about ashfall from eruption when they heard sound of an approaching lahar after it hit omayra became trapped under her home s concrete and other debris and could not free herself when rescue teams tried to help her they realized that her legs were trapped under her house s roof sources differ as to degree to which sanchez was trapped 2009 said she was trapped up to her neck while barragan 1987 said that she was trapped up to her waist for first few hours after mudflow hit she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in debris after a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris he and others cleared tiles and wood over course of a day once girl was freed from waist up her rescuers attempted to pull her out but found task impossible without breaking her legs in process each time a person pulled her water pooled around her rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat divers discovered that sanchez s legs were caught under a door made of bricks with her aunt s arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet death despite her predicament sanchez remained relatively positive she sang to german santa maria barragan a journalist who was working as a volunteer asked for sweet food drank soda and agreed to be interviewed at times she was scared and prayed or cried on third night sanchez began hallucinating saying that she did not want to be late for school and mentioned a math exam near end of her life sanchez s eyes reddened her face swelled and her hands whitened at one point she asked people to leave her so they could rest hours later workers returned with a pump and tried to save her but her legs were bent under concrete as if she was kneeling and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs lacking surgical equipment to save her from effects of an amputation doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die in all sanchez suffered for nearly three nights roughly 60 hours before she died at approximately 10 05 a m on november 16 from exposure most likely from gangrene or hypothermia her brother survived lahars her father and aunt died her mother expressed her feelings about omayra s death it is horrible but we have to think about living i will live for my son who only lost a finger as public became aware of sanchez s situation through media her death became a symbol of failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved controversy broke out after descriptions of shortages were released in newspapers disproving what officials had previously indicated that they had used best of their supplies volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels cutting tools and stretchers ran out rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization an unnamed police officer said that government should have depended on human resources to alleviate problems and that system of rescue was disorganized colombia s minister of defense miguel uribe said he understood criticism of rescue effort but said that colombia was an undeveloped country that did not have that kind of equipment photograph frank fournier a french reporter who landed in bogota on november 15 took a photograph of sanchez in her final days titled agony of omayra sanchez when he reached armero at dawn on 16th a farmer directed him to sanchez who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near deserted fournier later described town as very haunting with eerie silence punctuated by screaming he said that he took photograph feeling that he could only report properly on courage and suffering and dignity of little girl in his attempt to publicize disaster s need for relief efforts feeling otherwise powerless at time there was international awareness of disaster sanchez was one of victims at center of associated controversy over responsibility for destructive aftermath image captured international attention according to an unnamed bbc reporter many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be last few hours of omayra s life after photo was published in paris match many accused fournier of being a vulture he responded i felt story was important for me to report and i was happier that there was some reaction it would have been worse if people had not cared about it i believe photo helped raise money from around world in aid and helped highlight irresponsibility and lack of courage of country s leaders picture later won world press photo of year for 1985 legacy armero catastrophe came shortly after m 19 guerrilla group s raid and subsequent palace of justice siege on november 6 worsening an already chaotic situation after sanchez s death blame for it and for armero tragedy fell on colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to volcano s eruption nevado del ruiz volcano is still active according to volcano watch center in colombia melting only 10 percent of ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to similar to mudflow that destroyed armero in 1985 such lahars can travel up to along river valleys in a few hours estimates show that up to 500 000 people living in chinchina and valleys are at risk and 100 000 of these are considered to be at high risk city of armero no longer exists site was commemorated as a memorial with christian crosses and a small monument to sanchez in years following eruption sanchez has been repeatedly commemorated especially in newspapers like el tiempo many victims of disaster were commemorated but sanchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry novels and music for example a punk rock band formed in chile in 2008 named themselves omayra sanchez they express their discontent that they feel with negligence on part of people who in this day and age run world adios omayra la de armero 1988 written by eduardo santa as a response to eruption depicts girl s last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of catastrophe in no 1994 german santa maria barragan writes that of all horrors he saw at armero nothing was more painful than seeing face of omayra sanchez under ruins of her house isabel allende s short story and of clay are we created de barro hechos is told from perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under fireplace of her ruined home allende later wrote her sanchez s big black eyes filled with resignation and wisdom still pursue me in my dreams writing story failed to exorcise her ghost to try to prevent repetition of such a disaster government of colombia created oficina nacional para la atencion de desastres national office for disaster preparedness now known as direccion de y atencion de desastres directorate for disaster prevention and preparedness all colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters notes
