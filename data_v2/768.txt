with different styles fit perfectly in one program and of course copland symphony is one of best pieces ever written by an american composer kalmar said of recording it is a great pleasure to share

album as a thank you gift to donors during a fundraising campaign classical voice north america paul e robinson said album s contents were unrelated to its title and had nothing whatever to do with early days of american west but complimented orchestra s performances he praised excellent flute soloist in incredible flutist called performance of copland s symphony more careful than inspired and noted vast dynamic range created by label s sound technology peter dickinson of gramophone compared kalmar s interpretation of symphony no 3 to other available recordings kalmar and oregon symphony are impressive and create a challenge to established choices kalmar is a minute shorter than bernstein in both opening movement and fanfare finale overall his interpretation is similar to bernstein s and orchestra s expert handling of work suggests that they should record more furthermore he wrote engineering is excellent but individual tracks for piston would have been a help anthony tommasini music critic for new york times called recording exciting and said piston piece received a supple colorful performance he complimented a jazz symphony which he said emerges here as a savvy audacious score and ended his review with best of all is an urgent superbly played account of copland s third symphony oregonian david stabler praised oregon symphony for recording lesser known works by piston and antheil album received a grammy award nomination for best orchestral performance at 58th annual grammy awards marking third for kalmar and orchestra in addition alspaugh was nominated for producer of year classical said of recognition i think this is a confirmation of excellent quality that orchestra is offering in my mind it s very important that we get nominated whether we get grammy or not
