military history of australia spans nation s 230 year modern history from early australian frontier wars between aboriginals and europeans to ongoing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan in early 21st century although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars and war and military service have been significant influences on australian society and national identity including anzac spirit relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by enduring themes of australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma as british offshoots australian colonies participated in britain s small wars of 19th century while later as a federated dominion and then an independent nation australia fought in first world war and second world war as well as in wars in korea malaya borneo and vietnam during cold war in post vietnam era australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions through united nations and other agencies including in sinai persian gulf rwanda somalia east timor and solomon islands as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations while more recently they have also fought as part of multi lateral forces in iraq and afghanistan in total nearly 103 000 australians died during course of these conflicts this figure represents military casualties only and does not include those that died during frontier conflict see coulthard clark 1998 p v war and australian society thumb interior courtyard of australian war memorial in canberra almost 877 000 people visited australian war memorial during 2009 10 and another 204 000 visited its travelling exhibitions australian war memorial 2010 p 14 for most of last century military service has been one of single greatest shared experiences of white australian males and although this is now changing due to professionalisation of military and absence of major wars during second half of 20th century it continues to influence australian society to this day war and military service have been defining influences in australian history while a major part of national identity has been built on an idealised conception of australian experience of war and of soldiering known as anzac spirit these ideals include notions of endurance courage ingenuity humour egalitarianism and mateship traits which according to popular thought defined behaviour of australian soldiers fighting at gallipoli during first world war gallipoli campaign was one of first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two of more enduring themes of australian strategic culture bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare evans 2005 indeed australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until japanese crisis of 1942 while since then an alliance with united states has underwritten its security arguably this pattern of bandwagoning both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs as well as for more pragmatic security concerns has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies regardless a tendency towards strategic complacency has also been evident with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges millar 1978 p 49 reflecting both realist and liberal paradigms of international relations and conception of national interests a number of other important themes in australian strategic culture are also obvious such themes include an acceptance of state as key actor in international politics centrality of notions of westphalian sovereignty a belief in enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security and proposition that status quo in international affairs should only be changed peacefully white 2002 p 257 likewise multilateralism collective security and defence self reliance have also been important themes grey 1999 pp 265 266 change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history being product of australian society s democratic political tradition and judaeo christian anglo european heritage as well its associated values beliefs and economic political and religious ideology millar 1978 pp 25 26 these behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely european island on edge of asia pacific and geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from centres of world power to be sure during threats to core australia has often found itself defending periphery and perhaps as a result it has frequently become involved in foreign wars throughout these conflicts australian soldiers known colloquially as diggers have often been noted somewhat paradoxically for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities grey 1999 p 1 colonial era british forces in australia 1788 1870 thumb left a painting depicting castle hill convict rebellion in 1804 from 1788 until 1870 defence of australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces originally marines protected early settlements at sydney cove and norfolk island however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a british army unit specifically recruited for colonial service known as new south wales corps new south wales corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of irish convicts at castle hill in 1804 soon however shortcomings in corps convinced war office of need for a more reliable garrison in new south wales and van diemen s land chief of these shortcomings was rum rebellion a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 as a result in january 1810 73rd perthshire regiment of foot arrived in australia by 1870 25 british infantry regiments had served in australia as had a small number of artillery and engineer units dennis et al 1995 p 121 although primary role of british army was to protect colonies against external attack no actual threat ever materialised although unknown by british at time in 2015 it was reported that recent research had revealed that spain had planned to invade fledgling australian colony in 1790s with a 100 ship armada operation which was intended to challenge growth of british influence in pacific would have included an attack on sydney mounted from spanish colonies in south america however it was subsequently deferred and ultimately abandoned see british army was instead used in policing guarding convicts at penal institutions combating putting down convict rebellions as occurred at bathurst in 1830 and to suppress aboriginal resistance to extension of european settlement notably british soldiers were involved in battle at eureka stockade in 1854 on victorian goldfields members of british regiments stationed in australia also saw action in india afghanistan new zealand and sudan dennis et al 1995 pp 121 124 during early years of settlement naval defence of australia was provided by detached royal navy units of east indies station based in sydney however in 1859 australia was established as a separate squadron under command of a commodore marking first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed in australia royal navy remained primary naval force in australian waters until 1913 when australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to royal australian navy royal navy s depots dockyards and structures were given to australian people dennis et al 1995 p 59 frontier warfare 1788 1934 thumb poster issued in van diemen s land during black war implying a policy of friendship and equal justice for white settlers and indigenous australians such a policy did not actually exist at time reactions of native aboriginal inhabitants to sudden arrival of british settlers in australia were varied but were inevitably hostile when settlers presence led to competition over resources and to occupation of indigenous inhabitants lands european diseases decimated aboriginal populations and occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation dennis et al 1995 p 9 by and large neither british nor aborigines approached conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare at times however frontier wars did see involvement of british soldiers and later mounted police units not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands while many aborigines served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes fighting between aborigines and europeans was localised as aborigines did not form confederations capable of sustained resistance as a result there was not a single war but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across continent macintyre 1999 p 62 organised or disorganised however a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning in 18th century and continuing into early 20th century this warfare contradicts popular and at times academic myth of peaceful settlement in australia faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres among most famous is battle of in western australia in 1834 such incidents were not officially sanctioned however and after myall creek massacre in new south wales in 1838 seven europeans were hanged for their part in killings grey 1999 pp 31 34 however in tasmania so called black war was fought between 1828 and 1832 and aimed at driving most of island s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas although it began in failure for british it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst native population dennis et al 1995 p 12 grey 1999 p 31 it may be inaccurate though to depict conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by europeans on aborigines although many more aborigines died than british this may have had more to do with technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by europeans grey 1995 p 12 aboriginal tactics varied but were mainly based on pre existing hunting and fighting practices using spears clubs and other primitive weapons unlike indigenous peoples of new zealand and north america on main aborigines failed to adapt to meet challenge of europeans although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms this was not widespread dennis et al 1995 p 5 aborigines were never a serious military threat to european settlers regardless of how much settlers may have feared them grey 1999 p 30 on occasions large groups of aborigines attacked settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued during which aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage this could sometimes be effective with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents waiting out first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while settlers reloaded however such open warfare usually proved more costly for aborigines than europeans dennis et al 1995 pp 12 13 thumb left mounted police engaging indigenous australians during waterloo creek massacre of 1838 central to success of europeans was use of firearms however advantages afforded by firearms have often been overstated prior to late 19th century firearms were often cumbersome muzzle loading smooth bore single shot muskets with flint lock mechanisms such weapons produced a low rate of fire while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within these deficiencies may have initially given aborigines an advantage allowing them to move in close and engage with spears or clubs yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave europeans a distinct advantage with six shot colt revolver snider single shot breech loading rifle and later martini henry rifle as well as rapid fire rifles such as winchester rifle becoming available these weapons when used on open ground and combined with superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of aborigines often proved successful europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast moving often hidden enemies tactics employed included night time surprise attacks and positioning forces to drive natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks dennis et al 1995 pp 7 8 conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed pattern of british settlement in australia grey 1999 p 32 beginning in new south wales with arrival of first europeans in may 1788 it continued in sydney and its surrounds until 1820s as frontier moved west so did conflict pushing into outback new south wales in 1840s in tasmania fighting can be traced from 1804 to 1830s while in victoria and southern parts of south australia majority of violence occurred during 1830s and 1840s south west of western australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 war in queensland began in area around brisbane in 1840s and continued until 1860 moving to central queensland in 1850s and 1860s and then to northern queensland from 1860s to 1900 in western australia violence moved north with european settlement reaching kimberley region by 1880 with violent clashes continuing until 1920s in northern territory conflict lasted even later still especially in central australia continuing from 1880s to 1930s one estimate of casualties places european deaths at 2 500 while at least 20 000 aborigines are believed to have perished far more devastating though was effect of disease which significantly reduced aboriginal population by beginning of 20th century a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist dennis et al 1995 p 11 new

involved in actions against maori fortifications one sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during deployment dennis et al 1995 p 435 invasion of waikato in late 1863 new zealand government requested troops to assist in invasion of waikato province against maori promised settlement on confiscated land more than 2 500 australians over half of whom were from victoria were recruited to form four waikato regiments other australians became scouts in company of forest rangers despite experiencing arduous conditions australians were not heavily involved in battle and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties australians were involved in actions at pukekohe east titi hill orakau and te ranga fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action coulthard clark 1998 pp viii ix conflict was over by 1864 and waikato regiments disbanded in 1867 however many of soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at cessation of hostilities had drifted to towns and cities by end of decade while many others had returned to australia grey 1999 p 22 colonial military forces 1870 1901 thumb left members of hobart town volunteer artillery in august 1869 from 1870 until 1901 each of six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 and while colonial office in london retained control of some affairs governor of each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia to do this they were granted authority from british crown to raise military and naval forces initially these were militias in support of british regulars but when military support for colonies ended in 1870 colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia paid citizen soldiers and a small permanent component they were mainly infantry cavalry and mounted infantry and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline even after significant reforms in 1870s including expansion of permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in modern sense by 1885 forces numbered 21 000 men although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of british empire during 19th century with colonies raising contingents to serve in sudan south africa and china dennis et al 1995 pp 159 165 despite a reputation of colonial inferiority many of locally raised units were highly organised disciplined professional and well trained during this period defences in australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery based on garrisoned coastal forts however by 1890s improved railway communications between mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces to belief that colonies could be defended by rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry as a consequence he called for a restructure of defences and defensive agreements to be made between colonies edwards argued for colonial forces to be federated and for professional units obliged to serve anywhere in south pacific to replace volunteer forces these views found support in influential new south wales commandant major general edward hutton however suspicions held by smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria stifled proposal these reforms remaining unresolved however and defence issues were generally given little attention in debate on political federation of colonies dennis et al 1995 p 584 grey 1999 50 51 thumb right torpedo boat of new south wales naval brigade c 1890s with exception of western

sent an army to deal with revolt but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces british instructed egyptians to abandon sudan and sent general charles gordon to co ordinate evacuation but he was killed in january 1885 when news of his death arrived in new south wales in february 1885 government offered to send forces and meet contingent s expenses dennis et al

following defeat of afrikaner republics still boers held out forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines of supply this new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in australian colonies and raising of bushmen s contingents with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse riding and shooting skills but little military experience after federation in 1901 eight australian commonwealth horse battalions of newly created australian army were also sent to south africa although they saw little fighting before war ended some australians later joined local south african irregular units instead of returning home after discharge these soldiers were part of british army and were subject to british military

and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications such measures required considerable expenditure and caused much bitterness towards british however they soon yielded results odgers 1994 p 47 by mid 1901 bulk of fighting was over and british mounted units would ride at night to attack boer farmhouses or encampments overwhelming them with

south wales military forces subsequently became first commander of commonwealth military forces on 26 december and set to work devising an integrated structure for new army in 1911 following a report by lord kitchener royal military college duntroon was established as was a system of universal national service prior to federation each self governing colony had operated its own naval force these navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities forcing separate colonies to subsidise cost of a british naval squadron in their waters for decades colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 march 1901 when commonwealth naval force was created this new force also lacked blue water capable ships and ultimately did not lead to a change in australian naval policy in 1907 prime minister alfred deakin and creswell while attending imperial conference in london sought british government s agreement to end subsidy system and develop an australian navy admiralty rejected and resented challenge but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient deakin was unimpressed and in 1908 invited american great white fleet to visit australia this visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to order of two 700 ton destroyers macdougall 1991 p 23 surge in german naval construction prompted admiralty to

empire is at war so also is australia odgers 1994 p 58 and reflecting sentiment of many australians that any declaration of war by britain automatically included australia this was itself in part due

been born in britain dennis 1999 p 85 as existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under provisions of defence act 1903 an all volunteer expeditionary force known as australian imperial
