either side of entrance to new harbour fort pasir panjang was built on labrador and fort siloso on pulau mati now sentosa it was found that steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders underwater mines to strengthen defence further by 1881 mines were laid in waters between two forts and eastern entrance of harbour mines were tethered to seabed but floated dangerously under surface of water unseen to any enemy marine vessels to enable safe passage of ships a friendly safe channel was created through minefields work involved in laying of minefields under narrow channel just 240 m apart had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under channels were constructed to link two forts lim twin fortress p 26 there are however no

or platform specially prepared to support large heavy guns and artillery first type of gun put on fort pasir panjang was 7 inch rifled muzzle loading r m l two of these guns were first installed in 1878 so as to provide a temporary defence for fort they were however removed soon after defence reviews of 1885 then proposed that these guns be reinstalled together with 9 2 inch rifled breech loading r b l guns while latter guns came into fort much later 7 inch r m l were already in place by 1886 in 1896 a proposal was forwarded to replace 7 inch r m l gun with two 6 inch quick firing q f guns this came out of suggestion that 7 inch r m l has neither sufficient range accuracy nor rapidity of fire for effective defence even engineer of fort h e mccallum referred to these guns as being worst in service information obtained from on site information board by national parks board emplacement was eventually modified to contain 2 x 6 in 152 mm q f guns this modern type of gun definitely better in terms of its accuracy and rapidity to counter speedy motor torpedo boats that appeared in 1880s each shell used by these 6 inch q f weighed 45 kilograms lim guns of labrador and their

constructed to serve gun emplacements located directly above it to date tunnels serving gun emplacement iii is most extensive tunnel discovered at labrador park as one walked into tunnel there is an enlarged chamber allowing for two way human traffic this was important since walkways in tunnel tend to be very narrow tunnel then splits into two one leads to cartridge storeroom and hoist area while other leads to shell storeroom and hoist area a hoist is a mechanical pulley system to lift shells and cartridges from underground room to emplacement above it allocation of separation hoists for shells and cartridges allows for convenience and a more systematic operation of gun above it uses of underground rooms underground storerooms played important roles in fort for one they protected ammunition from being ignited by enemy fire secondly use of hoists facilitated easy movement and retrieval of ammunition thirdly tunnel provided protection for gunners not involved in actual manning of gun lastly they help to protect gun and gunners above from any accidental explosions in underground room itself tunnels lead to following areas lighting room given inflammable nature of store no naked flames were allowed in any rooms with exception of this room cartridge room for storage of cartridges cartridge lift area where hoist raising cartridges to emplacement aboveground was found

yong y s et al 2011 2004 fortress singapore battlefield guide singapore marshall cavendish p 68 nonetheless labrador battery guns had limited effect during battle and rounds allocated to it were more armour piercing cartridges rather than high explosive rounds which were more effective against infantry as a result these guns were ineffective and saw little action during battle of singapore lim

is known as a scorched earth policy after world war ii there was a worldwide disbandment of british forts as advances in air defence systems caused them to become obsolete today ruins of coastal
