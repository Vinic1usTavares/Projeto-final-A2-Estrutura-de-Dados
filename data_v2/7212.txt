cinema blend focused primarily on series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case of week overall it was a good mystery of week but seeing as it was second to last episode only thing i cared about was that we finally got more weevil rowan kaiser of a v club gave episode a mixed review stating that case of week was an oversimplification of overall themes of veronica mars reviewer enjoyed potential for logan and dick s character development although he felt that it was blunted by knowledge that series was about to end as fun as this episode is lack of fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it but knowledge that this might be last time we see them puts a damper on things still better to go out with good episodes than bad references external
