aggregating review website metacritic gave game a 77 100 kotaku gave release a generally positive rating praising redone visuals tweaked gameplay and expanded content but also noting game s age is still palpable game informer gave collection an 8 25 out of 10 stating core of this collection is excellent original game and that s where your attention should be other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus features joystiq gave a positive unscored review saying collection captures that early era of franchise at its purest simplicity it s a trip down memory lane for long term fans while visual overhaul and back to beginnings story should make it a welcoming entry point for newcomers gamespot gave hd remake a 7 out of 10 saying kingdom hearts hd 1 5 remix presents a couple of earliest games in beloved series in their best light and makes a revealing cinematic experience out of a third one three experiences complement one another with unique elements and welcome context that is a treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike giving game a 7 5 out of 10 gametrailers felt that while kingdom hearts hd 1 5 remix certainly lives up to hd part of its name collection is not without its shortcomings original game s inclusion with all new revisions and addition of final mix content is a worthy investment on its own and inclusion of chain of memories is a nice gesture card based battle system might be off putting but it s a unique experiment that deviates from norm of series however despite overhauled visuals and new voice work it s hard to excuse reduction of 358 2 days to a lengthy film rather than an actual game ign felt that collection was an excellent way to replay series first two games in crisp high definition splendor but was disappointed that box art did not properly distinguish 358 2 days as a non playable game they awarded collection an 8 5 out of 10 electronic gaming monthly gave collection an 8 out of 10 stating collection brings a ps2 classic to modern age with a noticeably impressive visual update improved camera controls and for added fun secondary and tertiary kingdom hearts content all contained on one disc additional collections hd 2 5
