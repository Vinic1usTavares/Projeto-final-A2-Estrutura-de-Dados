right gandingan gongs placed one inside other gongs themselves although variable in pitch are relatively similar in size diameters range from 1 8 to 2 feet and 5 to 8 inches including boss in width for smallest to largest gongs respectively because of their slight differences smaller gongs could be placed into larger gongs making transport of these gongs more portable than an agung s whose turned in rim eliminates that possibility traditionally metal used for gandingan was bronze but due to its scarcity after wwii gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets recently galvanized steel sheets have been used by maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of gong knob body and rim would be made from separate sheets and welded together then ground out to produce a finished product comparatively these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times technique thumb left student demonstrating proper way to use gandingan gandingan is usually played while standing behind instrument with gandingan player holding two wooden mallets mallets called balu are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber at one end and are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for agung rubber ends of balu are held between opposing knobs of gandingan and player would use them to strike knobs to achieve a sound gandingan players can demonstrate different techniques dependent on occasion in formal kulintang performances players would use all four gongs but during some informal occasions such as a playing style called apad and kulndet players would use only three of highest pitched gongs of gandingan and in instances such as gandingan contest gandingan players may be assisted by two kulintang assistants who would hold gongs steadily in place as players ferociously demonstrate their virtuosity on instrument uses ensemble thumb right playing gandingan as part of kulintang ensemble traditionally among maguindanao main function of gandingan was its use as a secondary melodic instrument after kulintang in kulintang ensemble in olden style of play strictly done by women patterns used function to feature highlight reinforce rhythmic modes already established by singular and women players would use a limited number of patterns that were repeated to provide a sonorous foundation to entire ensemble thumb right traditionally women were only ones allowed to play gandingan contest newer styles of play have recently emerged pushing bounds of what gandingan was traditionally used for one type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense complicated rhythmic patterns upon gandingan this type of play unlike olden style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound because of strenuous type of play male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity considered a sign of masculinity on gandingan during a gandingan contest two expert gandingan players would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other this type of play is said to have evolved from spread of virtuosic style on agung communication another type of play called apad is used for conveying linguistic messages from one player to another this ability to mimic intonations of maguindanao language on three highest tuned gongs has dubbed gandingan as talking gongs traditionally because of strict rules forbidding direct conversational interactions between sexes gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another using gandingan young men and women would spend hours teasing flirting gossiping playing guessing games trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another for instance if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but boy didn t like her back boy wouldn t resort to telling his friends literally he didn t like her instead he could use gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up message by translating his song in fact during 1950s many families would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play young men would gather around gandingan and gossip about people they dislike usually chatting with other gandingan players further away locals says much of this jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating night air gandingans were also used by a young man and woman who were having strong feelings for one another and if feelings were just right couple would elope with one another for instance if young man wanted to ask young women to come here man would play on gandingan singkaden ka singkaden another common message couples would play is ko seka literally meaning i am waiting for you along with those trivial messages gandingans were also used in more seriously matters when signaling to others of imminent danger during martial law gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming marcos soldiers every time villagers received signal they would disappear leaving soldiers aloof until soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them gandingan was responsible for scurry so they arrested gandingan player a similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone s carabao in order to keep his brother from getting arrested brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house but like marcos soldiers police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest theft for stealing and brother on gandingan for obstruction of justice origin thumb
