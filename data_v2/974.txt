stephanus johannes paulus paul kruger 10 october 1825 14 july 1904 was one of dominant political and military figures in 19th century south africa and president of south african republic or transvaal from 1883 to 1900 nicknamed oom paul uncle paul he came to international prominence as face of boer cause that of transvaal and its neighbour orange free state against britain during second boer war of 1899 1902 he has been called a personification of afrikanerdom and remains a controversial and divisive figure admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero and critics view him as obstinate guardian of an unjust cause born near eastern edge of cape colony kruger took part in great trek as a child during late 1830s he had almost no education apart from bible and through his interpretation believed earth was flat a protege of voortrekker leader andries pretorius he witnessed signing of sand river convention with britain in 1852 and over next decade played a prominent role in forging of south african republic leading its commandos and resolving disputes between rival boer leaders and factions in 1863 he was elected commandant general a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after election of president thomas francois burgers kruger was appointed vice president in march 1877 shortly before south african republic was annexed by britain as transvaal over next three years he headed two deputations to london to try to have this overturned he became leading figure in movement to restore south african republic s independence culminating in boers victory in first boer war of 1880 81 kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate then was elected president in 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered london convention under which britain recognised south african republic as a fully independent state following influx of thousands of predominantly british settlers with witwatersrand gold rush of 1886 uitlanders out landers provided almost all of south african republic s tax revenues but lacked civic representation boer burghers retained control of government uitlander problem and associated tensions with britain dominated kruger s attention for rest of his presidency to which he was re elected in 1888 1893 and 1898 and led to jameson raid of 1895 96 and ultimately second boer war kruger left for europe as war turned against boers in 1900 and spent rest of his life in exile refusing to return home following british victory after he died in switzerland at age of 78 in 1904 his body was returned to south africa for a state funeral and buried in heroes acre in pretoria early life family and childhood stephanus johannes paulus kruger was born on 10 october 1825 at bulhoek a farm in area of cape colony third child and second son of casper jan hendrik kruger 1801 1852 a farmer and his wife elsje elisa nee steyn 1806 1834 family was of dutch speaking afrikaner or boer background of german french huguenot and dutch stock his paternal ancestors had been in south africa since 1713 when jacob kruger from berlin arrived in cape town as a 17 year old soldier in dutch east india company s service jacob s children dropped umlaut from family name a common practice among south africans of german origin over following generations kruger s paternal forebears moved into interior his mother s family had lived in south africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by cape standards kruger s great great uncle hermanus steyn had been president of self declared republic of that revolted against company rule in 1795 bulhoek kruger s birthplace was steyn family farm and had been elsie s home since early childhood her father douw gerbrand steyn had settled there in 1809 kruger and steyn families were acquainted and casper occasionally visited bulhoek as a young man he and elsie married in cradock in 1820 when he was 19 and she was 14 a girl sophia and a boy douw gerbrand were born before paul was born in 1825 his first two names stephanus johannes were chosen after his paternal grandfather but rarely used provenance of third given name paulus was to remain rather a mystery johannes meintjes wrote in his 1974 biography of kruger and yet boy was always called paul paul kruger was baptised at cradock on 19 march 1826 soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to north west at near colesberg in remote north east of cape colony his mother died when he was eight his father casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife nee du plessis beyond reading and writing which he learned from relatives only education kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor roos and calvinist religious instruction from his father in adulthood kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from bible great trek thumb upright 1 2 great trek routes of 1830s and 1840s alt in 1835 casper kruger his father and his brothers gert and theuns moved their families east and set up farms near caledon river on cape colony s far north eastern frontier cape had been under british sovereignty since 1814 when netherlands ceded it to britain with convention of london boer discontent with aspects of british rule such as institution of english as sole official language and abolition of slavery in 1834 led to great trek a mass migration by dutch speaking voortrekkers north east from cape to land on far side of orange and vaal rivers many boers had been expressing displeasure with british cape administration for some time but krugers were comparatively content they had always co operated with british and had not owned slaves they had given little thought to idea of leaving cape a group of emigrants under hendrik potgieter passed through krugers caledon encampments in early 1836 potgieter envisioned a boer republic with himself in a prominent role he sufficiently impressed krugers that they joined his party of voortrekkers kruger s father continued to give children religious education in boer fashion during trek having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner at stops along journey trekkers made improvised classrooms marking them with reeds and grass more educated emigrants took turns in teaching thumb left voortrekkers a 1909 depiction alt a romantic depiction of settlers in covered wagons driving voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for area they were entering from mzilikazi and his ndebele or matabele people a branch from zulu kingdom to south east on 16 october 1836 11 year old kruger took part in battle of where potgieter s laager a circle of wagons chained together was unsuccessfully attacked by mzilikazi and around 4 000 6 000 matabele warriors kruger and other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet casting while women and larger boys helped fighting men of whom there were about 40 kruger could recall battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age during 1837 and 1838 kruger s family was part of voortrekker group under potgieter that trekked further east into natal here they met american missionary daniel lindley who gave young paul much spiritual invigoration zulu king dingane concluded a land treaty with potgieter but he reconsidered and massacred first piet retief s party of settlers then others at kruger later recounted his family s group coming under attack from zulus soon after retief massacre describing children to their mothers breasts by spears or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels but god heard our prayer he recalled and we followed them and shot them down as they fled until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack i could shoot moderately well for we lived so to speak among game because of attacks krugers returned to highveld where they took part in potgieter s campaign that forced mzilikazi to move his people north across limpopo river to what became matabeleland kruger and his father settled at foot of magaliesberg mountains in transvaal in natal andries pretorius defeated more than 10 000 of dingane s zulus at battle of blood river on 16 december 1838 a date subsequently marked by boers as dingane s day or day of vow burgher boer tradition of time dictated that men were entitled to choose two farms one for crops and one for grazing upon becoming enfranchised burghers at age of 16 kruger set up his home at waterkloof near rustenburg in magaliesberg area this concluded he wasted little time in pursuing hand of maria du plessis daughter of a fellow voortrekker south of vaal she was only 14 years old when they married in potchefstroom in 1842 same year kruger was elected a deputy field cornet a singular honour at seventeen meintjes comments this role combined civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior commissioned officer kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman horseman and guerrilla fighter in addition to his native dutch he could speak basic english and several african languages some fluently he had shot a lion for first time when he was a boy in old age he recalled being 14 but meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11 during his many hunting excursions kruger was nearly killed on several occasions in 1845 while he was hunting rhinoceros along river his four pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb kruger wrapped wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp where he treated it with turpentine he refused calls to have hand amputated by a doctor and instead cut off remains of injured thumb himself with a pocketknife when gangrenous marks appeared on his arm up to his shoulder he placed hand in stomach of a freshly killed goat a traditional boer remedy he considered this a success when it came to turn of second goat my hand was already easier and danger much less wound took more than six months to heal but he did not wait that long to start hunting again thumb left upright andries pretorius a great influence on young kruger alt a man in a dark suit with a white hat his left arm seems to be in a sling in his right hand he grasps barrel of a rifle britain annexed voortrekkers short lived natalia republic in 1843 as colony of natal pretorius briefly led boer resistance to this but before long most of boers in natal had trekked back north west to area around orange and vaal rivers in 1845 kruger was a member of potgieter s expedition to delagoa bay in mozambique to negotiate a frontier with portugal lebombo mountains were settled upon as border between boer and portuguese lands maria and their first child died of fever in january 1846 in 1847 kruger married her cousin gezina du plessis from colesberg area their first child casper jan hendrik was born on 22 december that year concerned by exodus of so many whites from cape and natal and taking view that boers remained british subjects british governor sir harry smith in 1848 annexed area between orange and vaal rivers as orange river sovereignty pretorius led a boer commando raid against this and they were defeated by smith at battle of like krugers pretorius lived in magaliesberg mountains and often hosted young kruger who greatly admired elder man s resolve sophistication and piety a warm relationship developed kruger s political awareness can be dated from 1850 meintjes writes and it was in no small measure given to him by pretorius like pretorius kruger wanted to centralise emigrants under a single authority and win british recognition for their territory as an independent state this last point was not due to hostility to britain neither pretorius nor kruger was particularly anti british but because they perceived emigrants unity as under threat if cape administration continued to regard them as british subjects henry douglas warden british resident in orange river area advised smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with pretorius smith sent representatives to meet him at sand river kruger aged 26 accompanied pretorius and on 17 january 1852 was present at conclusion of sand river convention under which britain recognised emigrant farmers in transvaal as independent they called themselves zuid south african republic in exchange for boers pledge not to introduce slavery in transvaal british agreed not to make an alliance with any coloured nations there kruger s uncle gert was also present his father casper would have been as well but he was ill and unable to attend field cornet thumb upright kruger as a field cornet photographed c 1852 alt a bearded man apparently about 30 years old boers and local tswana and basotho chiefdoms were in near constant conflict mainly over land kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852 and in august that year he took part in battle of a raid against tswana chief i boer commando was headed by pretorius but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy edema kruger narrowly escaped death twice first a piece of shrapnel hit him in head but knocked him out without cutting him later a tswana bullet swiped across his chest tearing his jacket but not wounding him commando wrecked david livingstone s mission station at destroying his medicines and books livingstone was away at time kruger s version of story was that boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in livingstone s house and interpreting this as a breach of britain s promise at sand river not to arm tribal chiefs confiscated them whatever truth livingstone wrote about boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter depicting them as mindless barbarians livingstone and many others criticised boers for abducting women and children from tribal settlements and taking them home to work as slaves boers argued that they did not keep these captives as slaves but as indentured apprentices who having lost their families were given bed board and training in a boer household until reaching adulthood modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a technical ruse by boers to enforce a means of inexpensive labour for them while avoiding overt slavery gezina kruger had an maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage and paid her a dowry having been promoted to rank of lieutenant between field cornet and commandant kruger formed part of a commando sent against chief in december 1852 to recover some stolen cattle pretorius was still sick and only nominally in command seven months later on 23 july 1853 pretorius died aged 54 just before end he sent for kruger but young man arrived too late meintjes says that pretorius was perhaps first person to recognise that behind kruger s rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all more remarkable for being almost entirely self developed commandant pretorius did not name a successor as commandant general his eldest son marthinus wessel pretorius was appointed in his stead younger pretorius elevated kruger to rank of commandant pretorius son claimed power over not just transvaal but also orange river area he said british had promised it to his father but virtually nobody not even supporters like kruger accepted this following sir george cathcart s replacement of smith as governor in cape town british policy towards orange river sovereignty changed to extent that british were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second boer republic there this was in spite of fact that in addition to boer settlers there were many english speaking colonists who wanted rule from cape to continue on 23 february 1854 sir george russell clerk signed orange river convention ending sovereignty and recognising what boers dubbed oranje orange free state bloemfontein former british garrison town became free state s capital transvaal seat of government became pretoria named after elder pretorius south african republic was in practice split between south west and central transvaal where most of pretorius s supporters were and regionalist factions in zoutpansberg lydenburg and utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion kruger s first campaign as a commandant was in latter part of 1854 against chiefs and makapan near waterberg chiefs retreated into what became called caves of makapan with many of their people and cattle and a siege ensued in which thousands of defenders died mainly from starvation when commandant general piet potgieter of zoutpansberg was shot dead kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve body and was almost killed himself mediator thumb upright m w pretorius who became transvaal s first president in 1857 alt a moustachioed man in a dark three piece suit marthinus pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with orange free state but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite transvaal in 1855 he appointed an eight man constitutional commission including kruger which presented a draft constitution in september that year lydenburg and zoutpansberg rejected proposals calling for a less centralised government pretorius tried again during 1856 holding meetings with eight man commissions in rustenburg potchefstroom and pretoria but stephanus schoeman zoutpansberg s new commandant general repudiated these efforts constitution settled upon formalised a national volksraad parliament and created an executive council headed by a president pretorius was sworn in as first president of south african republic on 6 january 1857 kruger successfully proposed schoeman for post of national commandant general hoping to thereby end factional disputes and foster unity but schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or pretorius with transvaal on verge of civil war tensions also rose with orange free state after pretorius s ambitions of absorbing it became widely known kruger had strong personal reservations about pretorius not considering him his father s equal but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him after free state government dismissed an ultimatum from pretorius to cease what he regarded as marginalisation of his supporters south of vaal pretorius called up burghers and rode to border prompting president jacobus nicolaas boshoff of free state to do same kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching transvaal commando he spoke out against idea of fighting their fellow boers when he learned that boshoff had called on schoeman to lead a commando against pretorius from zoutpansberg and lydenburg he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms with pretorius s approval kruger met boshoff under a white flag kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of pretorius s actions and situation as a whole but defended his president when free began to speak harshly of him a commission of 12 men from each republic including kruger reached a compromise whereby pretorius would drop his claim on free state and a treaty was concluded on 2 june 1857 over next year kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between free state and moshoeshoe i of basotho and persuaded schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions after which zoutpansberg accepted central government with schoeman as commandant general on 28 june 1858 schoeman appointed kruger assistant commandant general of south african republic all in all kruger s biographer t r h davenport comments he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes devotion to duty as an officer and a real capacity for power play forming dopper church kruger considered providence his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly he knew large sections of bible by heart he understood biblical texts literally and inferred from them that earth was flat a belief he retained firmly to his dying day at he said grace twice at length and in formal dutch rather than south african dialect that was to become afrikaans in late 1858 when he returned to waterkloof he was mentally and physically drained following exertions of past few years and in midst of a spiritual crisis hoping to establish a personal relationship with god he ventured into magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water a search party found him nearly dead from hunger and thirst davenport records experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith which for rest of his life was unshakeable and according to meintjes perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child kruger belonged to doppers a group of about 6 000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional calvinist doctrine they based their theology almost entirely on old testament and among other things wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from psalms when 1859 synod of nederduits hervormde kerk van afrika nhk main church in transvaal decided to enforce singing of modern hymns kruger led a group of doppers that denounced nhk as deluded and false and left its rustenburg congregation they formed van zuid afrika gk thereafter known informally as dopper church and recruited reverend dirk postma a like minded traditionalist recently arrived from netherlands to be their minister this act also had secular ramifications as according to 1858 constitution only nhk members could take part in public affairs civil war commandant general in late 1859 pretorius was invited to stand for president in orange free state where many burghers now favoured union partly as a means to overcome basotho transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad but nevertheless he readily did so and won transvaal volksraad attempted to side step constitutional problems surrounding this by granting pretorius half a year s leave hoping a solution might come about during this time and president duly left for bloemfontein appointing johannes hermanus grobler to be acting president in his absence pretorius was sworn in as president of free state on 8 february 1860 he sent a deputation to pretoria to negotiate union next day thumb upright stephanus schoeman a fierce opponent of kruger during 1860s alt an elderly man with a magnificent white beard kruger and others in transvaal government disliked pretorius s unconstitutional dual presidency and worried that britain might declare sand river and orange river conventions void if republics joined pretorius was told by transvaal volksraad on 10 september 1860 to choose between his two posts to surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as president of transvaal and continued in free state after schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant grobler as acting president kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing where schoeman was censured and relieved of his post willem cornelis van rensburg was appointed acting president while a new election was organised for october 1862 having returned home kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in capital volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in dopper church meant he could not enter politics van rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all reformed denominations thumb upright left kruger photographed as commandant general of south african republic c 1865 loss of his left thumb is visible alt a confident looking man of about 40 with a large dark beard thumb on his left hand is absent schoeman mustered a commando at potchefstroom but was routed by kruger on night of 9 october 1862 after schoeman returned with a larger force kruger and pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on disturbances in january 1863 and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant general schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against state and banished in may election results were announced van rensburg became president with kruger as commandant general both expressed disappointment at low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections van rensburg s opponent this time was pretorius who had resigned his office in orange free state and returned to transvaal turnout was higher and on 12 october volksraad announced another van rensburg victory kruger was returned as commandant general with a large majority civil war ended with kruger s victory over jan viljoen s commando raised in support of pretorius and schoeman at crocodile river on 5 january 1864 elections were held yet again and this time pretorius defeated van rensburg kruger was re elected as commandant general with over two thirds of vote civil war had led to an economic collapse in transvaal weakening government s ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over local chiefdoms though lydenburg and utrecht did now accept central administration by 1865 tensions had risen with zulus to east and war had broken out again between orange free state and basotho pretorius and kruger led a commando of about 1 000 men south to help free state basotho were defeated and moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory but president johannes brand of free state decided not to give any of conquered land to transvaal burghers transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse despite kruger s attempts to maintain discipline following february after a meeting of executive council in potchefstroom kruger capsized his cart during journey home and broke his left leg on one leg he righted cart and continued rest of way this injury incapacitated him for next nine months and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right thumb upright president thomas francois burgers whose election dismayed kruger alt a dark haired man with a scruffy beard in 1867 pretoria sent kruger to restore law and order in zoutpansberg he had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition and discipline in ranks was poor on reaching schoemansdal which was under threat by chief katlakter kruger and his officers resolved that holding town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation following which katlakter razed town loss of schoemansdal once a prosperous settlement by boer standards was considered a great humiliation by many burghers transvaal government formally exonerated kruger over matter ruling that he had been forced to evacuate schoemansdal by factors beyond his control but some still argued that he had given town up too readily peace returned to zoutpansberg in 1869 following intervention of republic s swazi allies pretorius stepped down as president in november 1871 in 1872 election kruger s preferred candidate william robinson was decisively defeated by reverend thomas francois burgers a church minister from cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of scriptures he did not believe in devil for example kruger publicly accepted burgers s election announcing at his inauguration that as a good republican he submitted to vote of majority but he had grave personal reservations regarding new president he particularly disliked burgers s new education law which restricted children s religious instruction to outside school hours in kruger s view an affront to god this coupled with sickness of gezina and their children with malaria caused kruger to lose interest in his office in may 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post which burgers promptly granted office of commandant general was abolished following week kruger moved his main residence to boekenhoutfontein near rustenburg and for a time absented himself from public affairs diamonds and deputations under burgers thumb upright 1 4 south africa in 1878 alt burgers busied himself attempting to modernise south african republic along european lines hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united independent south africa finding boer officialdom inadequate he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from netherlands his ascent to presidency came shortly after realisation that boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth diamonds had been discovered in territory just north of orange river on western edge of free state arousing interest of britain and other countries mostly british settlers referred to by boers as uitlanders out landers were flooding into region britain began to pursue federation at that time often referred to as confederation of boer republics with cape and natal and in 1873 over boer objections annexed area surrounding huge diamond mine at kimberley dubbing it griqualand west some doppers preferred to embark on another trek north west across kalahari desert towards angola rather than live under burgers this became trek of 1874 emigrants asked kruger to lead way but he refused to take part in september 1874 following a long delay calling volksraad due to sickness burgers proposed a railway to delagoa bay and said he would go to europe to raise necessary funds by time he left in february 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours and kruger had been restored to executive council in 1876 hostilities broke out with bapedi people under sekhukhune burgers had told acting president piet joubert not to fight a war in his absence so transvaal government did little to combat bapedi raids on his return burgers resolved to send a commando against sekhukhune he called on kruger to lead column but much to his surprise erstwhile commandant general refused burgers unsuccessfully asked joubert to head commando then approached kruger twice more but to no avail kruger was convinced that god would cause any military expedition organised by burgers to fail particularly if president rode with commando which he was determined to do i cannot lead commando if you come kruger said for with your merry evenings in laager and your sunday dances enemy will even shoot me behind wall for god s blessing will not rest on your expedition burgers who had no military experience led commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him after being routed by sekhukhune he hired a group of volunteers under german conrad von to defend country paying for this by levying a special tax war ended but burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate with burgers due to stand for re election following year kruger became a popular alternative candidate but he resolved to stand by president after burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend south african republic s independence towns of transvaal were becoming increasingly british in character as immigration and trade gathered apace and idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in british government in late 1876 lord carnarvon colonial secretary under benjamin disraeli gave sir theophilus shepstone of natal a special commission to confer with south african republic s government and if he saw fit annex country british annexation first and second deputations shepstone arrived in pretoria in january 1877 he outlined criticisms expressed by carnarvon regarding transvaal government and expressed support for federation after a joint commission of inquiry on british grievances kruger and state attorney e j p jorissen refuted most of carnarvon s allegations one of which was that pretoria tolerated slavery shepstone stayed in capital openly telling burgers he had come to transvaal to annex it hoping to stop annexation by reforming government burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad which opposed them all but then passed them heightening general mood of discord and confusion one of these reforms appointed kruger to new post of vice president impression of kruger garnered by british envoys in pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar bigoted peasant regarding his austere weather beaten face greying hair and simple dopper dress of a short cut black jacket baggy trousers and a black top hat they considered him extremely ugly furthermore they found his personal habits such as copious spitting revolting shepstone s legal adviser william was one of first british officials to write about kruger calling him horrible he recounted a public luncheon at which kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of meal combing it according to martin meredith kruger s was mentioned in british reports so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality and indeed his objectives they did not consider him a major threat to british ambitions thumb upright left e j p jorissen kruger s colleague in first deputation to london pictured in 1897 alt a grey haired man with a dark jacket and a tie shepstone had transvaal s annexation as a british territory formally announced in pretoria on 11 april 1877 burgers resigned and returned to cape to live in retirement his last act as president was to announce government s decision to send a deputation headed by kruger and jorissen to london to make an official protest he exhorted burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to british until these diplomats returned jorissen one of dutch officials recently imported by burgers was included at kruger s request because of his wide knowledge of european languages kruger was not confident in his english a second dutchman willem eduard bok accompanied them as secretary they left in may 1877 travelling first to bloemfontein to confer with free state government then on to kimberley and worcester where 51 year old kruger boarded a train for first time in his life in cape town where his german ancestor had landed 164 years before he had his first sight of sea during voyage to england kruger encountered a 19 year old law student from orange free state named martinus theunis steyn jorissen and bok marvelled at kruger in their eyes more suited to 17th century than his own time one night when kruger heard two dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and structure of universe he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and earth was not flat he might as well throw his bible overboard at colonial office in whitehall carnarvon and kruger s own colleagues were astonished when speaking through interpreters he rose to what meintjes calls remarkable heights of oratory averring that annexation breached sand river convention and went against popular will in transvaal his arguments were undermined by reports to contrary from shepstone and other british officials and by a widely publicised letter from a potchefstroom vicar claiming that kruger only represented will of a handful of irreconcilables carnarvon dismissed kruger s idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that british rule would remain kruger did not meet queen victoria though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact between august and october he visited netherlands and germany where he aroused little general public interest but made a potent impact in reformed congregations he visited after a brief sojourn back in england he returned to south africa and arrived at boekenhoutfontein shortly before christmas 1877 he found a national awakening occurring paradoxically john writes british occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit when kruger visited pretoria in january 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in church square attempting to stir up crowd kruger said that since carnarvon had told him annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do gambit worked burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to british thumb upright piet joubert kruger s associate in second deputation alt a man with a huge beard and a dark jacket according to meintjes kruger was still not particularly anti british he thought british had made a mistake and would rectify situation if this could be proven to them after conducting a poll through former republican infrastructure 587 signed in favour of annexation 6 591 against he organised a second deputation to london made up of himself and joubert with bok again serving as secretary envoys met british high commissioner in cape town sir bartle frere and arrived in london on 29 june 1878 to find a censorious letter from shepstone waiting for them along with a communication that since kruger was agitating against government he had been dismissed from executive council carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by sir michael hicks beach who received deputation coldly after bok gave a lengthy opening declaration hicks beach muttered have you ever heard of an instance where british lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw kruger retorted yes orange free state deputation remained in london for some weeks thereafter communicating by correspondence with hicks beach who eventually reaffirmed carnarvon s decision that annexation would not be revoked deputation attempted to rally support for their cause as first mission had done but with eastern question dominating political scene few were interested one english sympathiser gave kruger a gold ring bearing inscription take courage your cause is just and must triumph in end kruger was touched and wore it for rest of his life like its predecessor second deputation went on from england to continental europe visiting netherlands france and germany in paris where 1878 exposition universelle was in progress kruger saw a hot air balloon for first time and readily took part in an ascent to view city from above high up in mid air he recalled i asked aeronaut as we had gone so far to take me all way home pilot asked who kruger was and on their descent gave him a medal to remind me of my journey through air deputation composed a long reply to hicks beach which was published as an open letter in british press soon before they sailed for home on 24 october 1878 unless annexation were revoked letter stated transvaal boers would not co operate regarding federation drive for independence kruger and joubert returned home to find british and zulus were close to war shepstone had supported zulus in a border dispute with south african republic but then after annexing transvaal changed his mind and endorsed boer claim meeting sir bartle frere and lord chelmsford at pietermaritzburg on 28 november 1878 kruger happily gave tactical guidance for british campaign he advised use of boer tactics making at every stop and constantly scouting ahead but refused frere s request that he accompany one of british columns saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding transvaal chelmsford thought campaign would be a promenade and did not take

ended on 4 july 1879 with chelmsford s decisive victory at zulu capital ulundi around same time british appointed a new governor and high commissioner for transvaal and natal sir garnet wolseley who introduced a new transvaal constitution giving boers a limited degree of self government wolseley blunted zulu military threat by splitting kingdom into 13 chiefdoms and crushed sekhukhune and bapedi during late 1879 he had little success in winning boers over to idea of federation his defeat of zulus and bapedi had opposite effect as with these two long standing threats to security removed transvaalers could focus all their efforts against british most boers refused to co operate with wolseley s new order kruger declined a seat in new executive council at wonderfontein on 15 december 1879 6 000 burghers many of them bearing republic s vierkleur four colour flag voted to pursue a restored independent republic pretorius and bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to wolseley and sir owen lanyon who had replaced shepstone prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then kruger persuaded them not to saying this was premature pretorius and bok were swiftly released after jorissen telegraphed british liberal politician william ewart gladstone who had met kruger s first deputation in london and had since condemned annexation as unjust during his midlothian campaign in early 1880 hicks beach forwarded a scheme for south african federation to cape parliament kruger travelled to cape to agitate against proposals alongside joubert and jorissen by time they arrived liberals had won an election victory in britain and gladstone was prime minister in cape town and elsewhere kruger lobbied vigorously against annexation and won much sympathy davenport suggests that this contributed to federation plan s withdrawal which in turn weakened british resolve to keep transvaal kruger and joubert wrote to gladstone asking him to restore south african republic s independence but to their astonishment prime minister replied in june 1880 that he feared withdrawing from transvaal might lead to chaos across south africa kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully and over following months transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner

african republic but not to british usurper administration kruger and cronje knew each other writer johan frederik van who was acquainted with them both suggested that kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed in november when british authorities in potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher s wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute cronje and a group of armed boers intervened overcame presiding officers and reclaimed wagon on hearing of this from cronje kruger told joubert i can no longer restrain people and english government is entirely responsible for present state of things starting on 8 december 1880 at a farm to south west of pretoria 10 000 boers congregated largest recorded meeting of white people in south africa up to that time i stand here before you kruger declared called by people in voice of people i have heard voice of god king of nations and i obey he announced fulfilment of decision taken at wonderfontein previous year to restore south african republic government and volksraad which as vice president of last independent administration he considered his responsibility to help him in this he turned to jorissen and bok who respectively became state attorney and state secretary and pretorius and joubert who reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with kruger assembly approved a proclamation announcing

pretoria lanyon refused and mobilised british garrison kruger took part in first boer war in a civilian capacity only playing a diplomatic and political role with aid of jorissen and bok first major clash a successful boer ambush took place on 20 december 1880 at by turn of year transvaalers had all six british garrison outposts including that in pretoria under siege colley assembled a field force in natal summoned reinforcements from india and advanced towards transvaal joubert moved about 2 000 boers south to drakensberg and repulsed colley at laing s nek on 28 january 1881 after colley retreated to near he was attacked by joubert s second in command nicolaas smit on 8 february and again defeated understanding that they could not hold out against might of british empire indefinitely kruger hoped for a solution at earliest opportunity triumvirate wrote to colley on 12 february that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission colley liaised by telegraph with gladstone s colonial secretary lord kimberley then wrote to kruger on 21 february that if boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks kruger received this letter on 28 february and readily accepted but by now it was too late colley had been killed at battle of majuba hill day before another decisive victory for boers under smit this progressive humiliation of imperial forces in south africa by a ragtag collection of farmers to paraphrase meintjes and historian ian castle stunned western world colley s death horrified kruger who feared it might jeopardise peace process his reply to colley s letter was delivered to his successor sir evelyn wood on 7 march 1881 a day after wood and joubert had agreed to an eight day truce kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice which in his view only gave british opportunity to strengthen their forces he expected a british attempt to avenge majuba which indeed wood and others wanted but gladstone wanted peace and wood was instructed to proceed with talks negotiations began on 16 march british offered amnesty for boer leaders retrocession of transvaal under british suzerainty a british resident in pretoria and british control over foreign affairs kruger pressed on how british intended to withdraw and what exactly suzerainty meant brand arrived to mediate on 20 march and following day agreement was reached british committed to formally restore republic within six months final treaty was concluded on 23 march 1881 pretoria convention kruger presented treaty to volksraad on triumvirate s behalf at heidelberg on 15 april 1881 with a feeling of gratitude to god of our fathers he said who has been near us in battle and danger it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you treaty i consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and whole world that our respect for her majesty queen of england for government of her majesty and for english nation has never been greater than at this time when we are enabled to show you a proof of england s noble and magnanimous love for right and justice this statement was to be ignored by many writers but manfred nathan one of kruger s biographers stresses it as one of his most notable utterances kruger reaffirmed his faith in royal commission of wood sir hercules robinson and cape s chief justice sir henry de villiers who convened for first time in natal on 30 april brand with them as an adviser commissioners held numerous sessions in pretoria over following months with little input from kruger who was bedridden with pneumonia kruger was largely happy with terms under which republic would regain its sovereignty but two points offended him first of these was that british would recognise them as transvaal republic and not south african republic second was that it was still not clear to him what british suzerainty was commission in which de villiers emerged as dominant figure defined it primarily as british purview over transvaal s external affairs final pretoria convention was signed on 3 august 1881 by joubert pretorius and members of royal commission kruger was absent due to his illness but he did attend official retrocession

and most of his facial hair leaving chinstrap beard he kept thereafter his and gezina s permanent home on church street what is now called kruger house would be completed in 1884 a direct consequence of end of british rule was an economic slump transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on verge of bankruptcy triumvirate spent two months discussing terms of pretoria convention with new volksraad approve it or go back to laing s nek said kruger before it was finally ratified on 25 october 1881 during this time kruger introduced tax reforms announced triumvirate s decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed reverend s j du toit to be superintendent of education to counteract influx of uitlanders residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years in july 1882 volksraad decided to elect a new president following year joubert and kruger emerged as candidates kruger campaigned on idea of an administration in which god s word would be my rule of conduct as premier he would prioritise agriculture industry and education revive burgers s delagoa bay railway scheme introduce an immigration policy that would prevent boer nationality from being stifled and pursue a cordial stance towards britain and obedient native races in their appointed districts he defeated joubert by 3 431 votes to 1 171 and was inaugurated as

kruger became president soon after discovery of gold near what was to become which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers this gold is still going to soak our country in blood said joubert a

where burghers had crossed border defined in pretoria convention and formed two new boer republics stellaland and goshen on former tswana territory in 1882 these states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance main road from cape to matabeleland and african interior kruger and volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to london to renegotiate pretoria convention and settle western border issue third deputation comprising kruger smit and du toit with ewald as secretary left transvaal in august 1883 and sailed from cape town two months later kruger spent part of voyage to britain studying english language with a bible printed in dutch and english side by side talks with new colonial secretary lord derby and robinson progressed smoothly apart from an incident when kruger thinking himself insulted nearly punched robinson and on 27 february 1884 london convention superseding that of pretoria was concluded britain ended its suzerainty reduced transvaal s national debt and once again recognised country as south african republic western border question remained unresolved but kruger still considered convention a triumph thumb upright

appearances were attended by tens of thousands deputation discussed bilateral aspects of proposed delagoa bay railway with portuguese and in netherlands laid groundwork for netherlands south african railway company which would build and operate it kruger now held that burgers had been far ahead of his time while reviving his predecessor s railway scheme he also brought back policy of importing officials from netherlands in his view a means to strengthen boer identity and keep transvaal dutch willem johannes leyds a 24 year old dutchman returned to south africa with deputation as republic s

britain proclaimed a protectorate over bechuanaland including stellaland goshen corridor while joubert was in negotiations with rhodes du toit had kruger proclaim transvaal protection over corridor on 18 september 1884 joubert was outraged as was kruger when on 3 october du toit unilaterally hoisted vierkleur in goshen realising implications of this it clearly violated london convention kruger had flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 september meeting rhodes personally in late january 1885 kruger insisted flag incident had taken place without his consent and conceded

reported to transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between pretoria and heidelberg south african republic s formal proclamation of this two months later prompted witwatersrand gold rush and founding of johannesburg which within a few years was largest city in southern africa populated almost entirely by uitlanders economic landscape of region was transformed overnight south african republic went from verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to cape colony s following year british became anxious to link johannesburg to cape and natal by rail but kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave delagoa bay line first priority president was by this time widely nicknamed oom paul uncle paul both among boers and uitlanders who variously used it out of affection or contempt he was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised independence of republic s judiciary to help his friend alois hugo nellmapius who had been found guilty of embezzlement kruger rejected court s judgement and granted nellmapius a full pardon an act nathan calls completely indefensible kruger defeated joubert again in 1888 election by 4 483 votes to 834 and was sworn in for a second time in may nicolaas smit was elected vice president and leyds was promoted to state secretary thumb left

and his clique kruger despised rhodes considering him corrupt and immoral in his memoirs he called him capital incarnate and curse of south africa according to editor of kruger s memoirs rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting we simply take delagoa bay from portugal kruger was appalled failing to make headway in talks with portuguese kruger switched his attention to kosi bay next to swaziland in late 1888 in early 1889 kruger and new orange free state president francis william reitz enacted a common defence pact and a customs treaty waiving most import duties same year volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove nederduits hervormde official status open legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches sovereign in their own spheres kruger proposed to end lack of higher education in boer republics by forming a university in pretoria enthusiastic support emerged for this but free university of amsterdam expressed strong opposition not wishing to lose afrikaner element of its student body no university was built kruger was obsessed with south african republic s independence retention of which he perceived as under threat if transvaal became too british in character uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind taxation on their mining provided almost all of republic s revenues but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in running of country though english language was dominant in mining areas only dutch remained official kruger expressed great satisfaction at new arrivals industry and respect for state s laws but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers with probable result of absorption into british sphere agonising over how he could meet wishes of new population for representation without injuring republic or prejudicing interests of older burghers he thought he had solved problem in 1889 when he tabled a second volksraad in which uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them most deemed this inadequate and even kruger s own supporters were unenthusiastic rhodes and other british figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in transvaal than boers kruger s administration recorded twice as many transvaalers as uitlanders but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers according to british liberal politician james bryce most uitlanders saw country as virtually english and perceived something unreasonable or even grotesque in control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors on 4 march 1890 when kruger visited johannesburg men sang british patriotic songs tore down and trampled on vierkleur at city landdrost s office and rioted outside house where president was staying one of agitators accused him of treating uitlanders with contempt kruger retorted i have no contempt for new population only for people like yourself riot was broken up by police and chamber of mines issued an apology which kruger accepted saying only a few of uitlanders had taken part few boers were as conciliatory as kruger meintjes marks this as point where rift between transvaalers and uitlanders began early 1890s thumb upright cecil rhodes prime minister of cape colony from 1890 alt a moustachioed man in a dark three piece suit in mid march 1890 kruger met new british high commissioner and governor sir henry brougham loch loch s legal adviser william philip schreiner and rhodes who had by now attained a dominant position in transvaal s mining industry and a royal charter for his british south africa company to occupy and administer matabeleland and mashonaland a group of transvaalers planned to emigrate to mashonaland so called bowler trek and rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans he and loch offered to support kruger in his plan to acquire a port at kosi bay and link it to transvaal through swaziland if in return transvaal would enter a south african customs union and pledge not to expand northwards kruger made no commitments thinking this union might easily turn into federation britain had pursued years before but on his return to pretoria forbade any boer trek to mashonaland rhodes became prime minister of cape colony in july 1890 a month later british and transvaalers agreed to joint control over swaziland without consulting south african republic could build a railway through it to kosi bay on condition that transvaal thereafter supported interests of rhodes s chartered company in matabeleland and its environs kruger honoured latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed trek another would be emigration to mashonaland over protests of joubert and many others this along with his handling of economy and civil service now widely perceived as overloaded with dutch imports caused opposition to grow industrial monopolies kruger s administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient especially dynamite concession given to edouard lippert and a french consortium which kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging kruger s second volksraad sat for first time in 1891 any resolution it passed had to be ratified by first volksraad its role was in effect largely advisory uitlanders could vote in elections for second volksraad after two years residency on condition they were naturalised as burghers a process requiring renunciation of any foreign allegiance residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years with added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old during close run campaign for 1893 election in which kruger was again challenged by joubert with chief justice john gilbert kotze as a third candidate president indicated that he was prepared to lower 14 year residency requirement so long as it would not risk subversion of state s independence electoral result was announced as 7 854 votes for kruger 7 009 for joubert and 81 for kotze joubert s supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount ballots were counted twice more and although results varied slightly each time every count gave kruger a majority joubert conceded and kruger was inaugurated for third time on 12 may 1893 thumb raadsaal transvaal government building in church square pretoria alt a stately three storey building with a tower on top kruger was by this time widely perceived as a personification of afrikanerdom both at home and abroad when he stopped going to government offices at raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike changing of guard in britain once seen he is not easily forgotten wrote lady phillips his greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number and i think his character is clearly to be read in his face strength of character and cunning rising tensions raiders and reformers by 1894 kosi bay scheme had been abandoned and delagoa bay line was almost complete and railways from natal and cape had reached johannesburg chief s insurgency in north compelled joubert to call up a commando and state artillery in may 1894 those drafted included british subjects large majority of whom indignantly refused to report feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted kotze s ruling that british nationality did not preclude one from conscription as a transvaal resident prompted an outpouring of displeasure from uitlanders that manifested itself when loch visited pretoria following month protesters waited for kruger and loch to enter presidential coach at railway station then unharnessed horses attached a union jack and raucously dragged carriage to loch s hotel embarrassed loch complied with kruger s request that he should not go on to johannesburg kruger announced that government will in meantime provisionally no more commandeer british subjects for personal military service in his memoirs he alleged that loch secretly conferred with uitlanders national union at this time about how long miners could hold johannesburg by arms without british help thumb upright joseph chamberlain british colonial secretary alt a man in a light suit with a hat in his hand following year national union sent kruger a petition bearing 38 500 signatures requesting electoral reform kruger dismissed all such entreaties with assertion that enfranchising these new comers these disobedient persons might imperil republic s independence protest he shouted at one uitlander deputation what is use of protesting i have guns you haven t johannesburg press became intensely hostile to president personally using term to encapsulate all republic s perceived injustices in august 1895 after gauging burghers views from across country first volksraad rejected opposition s bill to give all uitlanders vote by 14 ballots to 10 kruger said this did not extend to those who had proved their trustworthiness and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in transvaal commandos delagoa bay railway line was completed in december 1894 realisation of a great personal ambition for kruger who tightened final bolt of our national railway personally formal opening in july 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all neighbouring territories present including loch s successor sir hercules robinson this railway changed whole internal situation in transvaal kruger wrote in his autobiography until that time cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly so to speak of johannesburg traffic difference of opinion between kruger and rhodes over distribution of profits from customs duties led to drifts crisis of september october 1895 cape colony avoided transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead kruger s closure of drifts fords in vaal river where wagons crossed prompted rhodes to call for support from britain on grounds that london convention was being breached colonial secretary joseph

time when leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895 he took with him an order from transvaal government for rifles and munitions conferring with colonial office rhodes pondered co ordination of an uitlander revolt in johannesburg with british military intervention and had a force of about 500 marshalled on bechuanaland transvaal frontier under leander starr jameson chartered company s administrator in matabeleland on 29 december 1895 ostensibly following an urgent plea from johannesburg reform committee as national union now called itself these troops crossed border and rode for witwatersrand jameson raid had begun jameson s force failed to cut all of telegraph wires allowing a rural transvaal official to raise alarm early though there are suggestions kruger had been tipped off some days before joubert called up burghers and rode west to meet jameson robinson publicly repudiated jameson s actions and ordered him back but jameson ignored him and pushed on towards johannesburg robinson wired kruger offering to come immediately for talks reform committee s efforts to rally uitlanders for revolt floundered partly because not all of mine owners or were supportive and by 31 december conspirators had raised a makeshift vierkleur over their headquarters at offices of rhodes s gold fields company signalling their capitulation unaware of this jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to piet cronje on 2 january 1896 a congratulatory telegram to kruger from kaiser wilhelm ii on 3 january prompted a storm of anti boer and anti german feeling in britain with jameson becoming lionised as a result kruger shouted down talk of death penalty for imprisoned jameson or a campaign of retribution against johannesburg challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed and accepted robinson s proposed mediation with alacrity after confiscating weapons and munitions reform committee had stockpiled kruger handed jameson and his troops over to british custody and granted amnesty to all johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members who were charged with high treason four main leaders lionel phillips john hays hammond george farrar and frank rhodes brother of cecil pleaded guilty in april 1896 and were sentenced to hang but kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of ps25 000 each resurgence jameson raid ruined rhodes s political reputation in cape and lost him his longstanding support from afrikaner bond he resigned as prime minister of cape colony on 12 january kruger s handling of affair made his name a household word across world and won him much support from afrikaners in cape and orange free state who began to visit pretoria in large numbers president granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as olive schreiner and frank harris and wore knightly orders of netherlands portugal belgium and france on his sash of state jameson was jailed by british but released

african republic s diplomatic actions such as joining geneva convention which he said breached article iv of london convention which forbade extraterritorial dealings except vis a vis orange free state chamberlain asserted that transvaal was still under british suzerainty a claim kruger called nonsensical kruger and steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in bloemfontein in march 1897 along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend other s independence two months later sir alfred milner became new high commissioner and governor in cape town kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever volksraad did not give him his way in 1897 session there was much surprise when new member louis botha reacted to usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it a constitutional crisis developed after judiciary under chief justice kotze abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over constitution this decision would have upset whole country kruger recalled for a number of rules concerning goldfields franchise and so on depended on resolutions of volksraad chief justice de villiers of cape mediated sided with kruger and upheld volksraad decrees thumb upright jan smuts kruger s state attorney from 1898 alt a young man in a dark jacket with a dark bow tie kruger was never more popular domestically

burger s 3 753 and was sworn in as president for fourth time on 12 may 1898 after a three hour inauguration address his longest speech as president his first act of his fourth term was to sack kotze who was still claiming right to test legislation in courts to kruger s critics this lent much credence to notion that he was a tyrant milner called kotze s dismissal end of real justice in transvaal and a step that threatened all british subjects and interests there kruger s final administration was meintjes suggests strongest in history of republic he had former free state president f w reitz as state secretary from june 1898 and leyds who set up an office in brussels as envoy extraordinary in europe post of state attorney was given to a young lawyer from cape called jan smuts for whom kruger presaged great things removal of leyds to europe marked end of kruger s longstanding policy of giving important government posts to dutchmen convinced of cape afrikaners sympathy following jameson

which a south african republic policeman was acquitted of manslaughter after shooting a british subject dead during an attempted arrest prompted outcry from british element in transvaal and is highlighted by nathan as starting point of final agitation which led to war south african league a new uitlander movement prepared two petitions each with more than 20 000 signatures that appealed to queen victoria for intervention against transvaal government which they called inefficient corrupt and oppressive other uitlanders produced a counter petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with kruger s government attempting to address main point of contention raised by milner and chamberlain kruger spoke of reducing residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less in may and june 1899 he and milner met in bloemfontein with steyn taking on role of mediator you must make concessions on franchise issue steyn counselled franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with first principles of a republican and democratic government free state expects you to concede should you not give in on this issue you will lose all sympathy and all your friends kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower franchise and was prepared to do anything but they must not touch my independence he said they must be reasonable in their demands thumb british press depiction of kruger attempting to appease uitlanders chamberlain looks on unimpressed alt a cartoon see description uitlander is depicted as towering over kruger who

a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for new burghers kruger offered naturalisation after two years residence and full franchise after five more seven years effectively along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of free state high commissioner declared his original request an irreducible minimum and said he would discuss nothing else until franchise question was resolved on 5 june milner proposed an advisory council of non burghers to represent uitlanders prompting kruger to cry how can strangers rule my state how is it possible when milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role kruger burst into tears saying it is our country you want milner ended conference that evening saying further meetings steyn and kruger wanted were unnecessary back in pretoria kruger introduced a draft law to give mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven year residency period for voting rights this would not be retroactive but up to two years prior residence would be counted towards seven and uitlanders already in country for nine years or more would get vote immediately jan hendrik of afrikaner bond persuaded kruger to make this fully retrospective to immediately enfranchise all white men in country seven years or more but milner and south african league deemed this insufficient after kruger rejected british proposal of a joint commission on franchise law smuts and reitz proposed a five year retroactive franchise and extension of a quarter of volksraad seats to witwatersrand region on condition that britain drop any claim to suzerainty chamberlain issued an ultimatum in september 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions else british would formulate their own proposals for a final settlement kruger resolved that war was inevitable comparing boers position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife he posited aware of deployment of british troops from elsewhere in empire kruger and smuts surmised that from a military standpoint boers only chance was a swift pre emptive strike steyn was anxious that they not be seen as aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace he informed kruger on 9 october that he also now thought war unavoidable that afternoon transvaal government handed british envoy conyngham greene an ultimatum advising that if britain did not withdraw all troops from border within 48 hours a state of war would exist british government considered conditions impossible and informed kruger of this on 11 october 1899 start of second boer war was announced in pretoria that

leyds telling him this was a fantasy kruger took no part in fighting partly because of his age and poor health he turned 74 week war broke out but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured his personal contributions to military campaign were mostly from his office in pretoria where he oversaw war effort and advised his officers by telegram boer commandos including four of kruger s sons six sons in law and 33 of his grandsons advanced quickly into cape and natal won a series of victories and by end of october were besieging kimberley ladysmith and mafeking soon thereafter following a serious injury to joubert kruger appointed louis botha to be acting commandant general british relief of kimberley and ladysmith in february 1900 marked turning of war against boers morale plummeted among commandos over following months with many burghers simply going home kruger toured front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot he had hoped for large numbers of cape afrikaners to rally to republican cause but only small bands did so along with a few thousand foreign volunteers principally dutchmen germans and scandinavians when british troops entered bloemfontein on 13 march 1900 reitz and others urged kruger to destroy gold mines but he refused on grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after war mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 may lord roberts took johannesburg kruger left pretoria on 29 may travelling by train to and on 2 june government abandoned capital roberts entered three days later with major towns and railways under british control conventional phase of war ended kruger wired steyn pondering surrender but free state president insisted they fight to bitter end kruger found new strength in steyn and all transvaal officers forbidding laying down of arms bitter enders under botha christiaan de wet and koos de la rey took to veld and waged a guerrilla campaign british under lord kitchener applied scorched earth policy in response burning farms of boers still in field non combatants mostly women and children were put into what british army dubbed concentration camps kruger moved to onder where his small house became in late june after roberts announced annexation of south african republic to british empire on 1 september 1900 free state had been annexed on 24 may kruger proclaimed on 3 september that this was not recognised and declared null and void it was decided in following days that to prevent his capture kruger would leave for lourenco marques and there board ship for europe officially he was to tour continent and perhaps america too to raise support for boer cause exile and death thumb upright kruger leaving for europe in 1900 he would never return at right is his secretary madie bredell alt kruger viewed in silhouette from behind bredell to his right kruger is wearing his top hat kruger left transvaal by rail on 11 september 1900 he wept as train crossed into mozambique he planned to board first outgoing steamer herzog of german east africa line but was prevented from doing so when at behest of local british consul portuguese governor insisted that kruger stay in port under house arrest about a month later queen wilhelmina of netherlands concluded a deal with britain to extricate kruger on a dutch warship hnlms gelderland and convey him through non british waters to marseille kruger was delighted to hear of this but dismayed that gezina still in pretoria was not well enough to accompany him gelderland departed on 20 october 1900 he received a rapturous welcome in marseille on 22 november 60 000 people turned out to see him disembark accompanied by leyds he went on to an exuberant reception in paris then continued to cologne on 1 december here public greeted him with similar excitement but kaiser wilhelm ii refused to receive him in berlin having apparently still harboured hopes of german assistance in war kruger was deeply shocked kaiser has betrayed us he told leyds they went on to netherlands which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily but would feel more like home after another buoyant reception from general public kruger was cordially received by wilhelmina and her family in hague but it soon became clear to leyds that it embarrassed dutch authorities to have them staying in seat of government kruger party moved to hilversum in april 1901 gezina with whom kruger had had 16 children nine sons seven daughters of whom some died young had eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from concentration camp at krugersdorp where their mother had died in july 1901 five of eight children died within nine days and two weeks later gezina also died meintjes writes that a strange silence enveloped kruger thereafter by now partially blind and almost totally deaf he dictated his memoirs to his secretary hermanus christiaan madie bredell and pieter grobler during latter part of 1901 and following year they were published kruger and his entourage relocated in december 1901 to utrecht where he took a comfortable villa called oranjelust and was joined by his daughter elsje and her family thumb left oranjelust kruger s home in utrecht photographed in 1963 alt an elegant white two storey house of european appearance oranjelust written over door rhodes died in march 1902 bequeathing groote to be official residence for future premiers of a unified south africa kruger quipped to bredell perhaps i ll be first war formally ended on 31 may 1902 with treaty of vereeniging boer republics became orange river and transvaal colonies kruger accepted it was all over only when bredell had flags of south african republic and orange free state removed from outside oranjelust two weeks later in reply to condolences from germany kruger would only say my grief is beyond expression kruger would not countenance idea of returning home partly because of personal reluctance to become a british subject again and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile steyn similarly refused to accept new order and joined kruger in europe though he did later return botha de wet and de la rey visited oranjelust in august 1902 and according to hearsay were berated by kruger for signing away independence rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that generals issued a statement denying them after passing october 1902 to may 1903 at menton on french riviera kruger moved back to hilversum then returned to menton in october 1903 in early 1904 he moved to clarens a small village in canton of vaud in western switzerland where he spent rest of his days looking over lake geneva and alps from his balcony he who wishes to create a future must not lose track of past he wrote in his final letter addressed to people of transvaal thus seek all that is to be found good and fair in past shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for future it is true much that has been built is now destroyed damaged levelled but with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again after contracting pneumonia paul kruger died in clarens on 14 july 1904 at age of 78 his bible lay open on a table beside him kruger s body was initially buried in hague but was soon repatriated with british permission after ceremonial lying in state he was accorded a state funeral in pretoria on 16 december 1904 vierkleur of south african republic draped over his coffin and buried in what is now called heroes acre in church street cemetery appraisal and legacy thumb statue of paul kruger in church square pretoria alt an impressive monument a statue of kruger stands on a tall plinth he is wearing his top hat each of plinth s four sides has a statue of a crouching boer next to it academic opinion on kruger is divided to admirers he was an astute reader of people events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero to critics he was an anachronistic throwback stubborn slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black africans more nonsense has been written about him than anybody i know of writes meintjes in whose view true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment prejudice and deification depicting kruger as anything from saint to stuffy mendacious savage rights and wrongs aside meintjes asserts kruger is central figure of boer history and one of most extraordinary of south africans following union of south africa under botha in 1910 kruger remained a vital force in south african politics and afrikaner culture government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed kruger national park in 1926 in 1954 over half a century after its construction by anton van a bronze statue of kruger in his characteristic dopper suit and top hat was erected in church square pretoria kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching boers from different time periods thirteen years later south african mint put his likeness on a gold bullion coin still produced and exported in 21st century his home in pretoria and farm at boekenhoutfontein are provincial heritage sites former of which is preserved to appear as in his time kruger gives his name to town of krugersdorp and to many streets and squares in south africa and other countries especially netherlands and belgium this has on occasion led to controversy in 2009 local authorities in st gallen switzerland renamed because of racist associations clarens free state is named after kruger s last home in switzerland during second world war kruger s life story and image were appropriated by propagandists in nazi germany who produced biographical film ohm kruger uncle kruger 1941 to attack british with emil in title role underdevelopment of south african administrative law until late 20th century was davenport asserts direct result of kruger s censure and dismissal of chief justice kotze in 1898 over question of judicial review paul kruger s name and fame he made himself leyds said it is sometimes said that he was illiterate this is of course nonsense he was certainly not learned but he had a thorough knowledge of many things in lower spheres of diplomacy mr kruger was a master e b iwan muller asserted he was quick in detecting false moves made by his opponents and an adept in turning them to his own advantage but of large combinations he was hopelessly incapable to secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander prospects of future if indeed he had power of forecasting them he was what i believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician but a hopeless strategist soon after kruger s death smuts told british humanitarian campaigner emily hobhouse he typified boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects and was no doubt greatest man both morally and intellectually whom boer race has so far produced in his iron will and tenacity his never say die attitude towards fate his mystic faith in another world he represented what is best in all of us notes and and journal articles online sources bibliography further reading gordon cecil
