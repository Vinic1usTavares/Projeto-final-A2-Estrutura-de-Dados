spotnitz wrote episode along with john shiban script for all souls was written by john shiban and frank spotnitz and directed by allen coulter original genesis for episode was an idea developed by dan angel and billy brown two story board editors for series that had left after christmas of 1997 in this incarnation plot was radically different according to shiban story was about mulder and scully and angels but it never quite worked way it was originally conceived shiban and spotnitz decided to overhaul script and feature elements of earlier christmas carol and emily story arc as writers wanted to include very universal idea of scully exploring feelings for her deceased daughter this episode according to andy meisler thus became unofficial third part in story with this episode scully dons role of believer whereas mulder plays skeptic this mulder scully criss cross accentuated a major theme for fifth season meisler p 239 in order to counter some of darker aspects of script shiban and spotnitz on behest of co star david duchovny added several lines of comic relief delivered by mulder according to it was in more straight ahead investigative shows creepier scarier shows that i would try to make sure that we kept this kind of humanity alive through humor hurwitz and knowles p 131 filming 175px right thumb shiban and spotnitz decided to frame action of episode around scully confessing to a priest confessional pictured scenes at st john s church church featured in episode were shot in actual st augustine church in vancouver british columbia prior to filming script for episode was approved by church s local monseigneur as a fail safe production crew scouted several other churches in case permissions were rescinded gradnitzer and pittson p 176 177 special stain glass windows were created that featured an angel ascending into heaven to go along with themes of episode book that father mccue has about nephilim was created by assistant art director vivien nishi with guidance from spotnitz scenes at father gregory s church were filmed in an older boiler room at george pearson hospital this location had previously been used in earlier fifth season entry as a cafeteria production crew initially worried that building s high windows would bring in too much natural light and so some of windows were lit up via artificial means episode contained several elaborate effects which were achieved via makeup or cgi makeup artist laverne basham and hairstylist anji were tasked with giving each of quadruplets all played by emily perkins a different look they were also responsible for making jody racicot appear older which proved particularly difficult given that racicot did not have any hair that they could dye grey and he had tightest skin of any thirtysomething guy they d ever seen visual effects to create shifting heads of seraphim were created with cgi which visual effects supervisor lauri george finalized only hours before airtime scene was created by having actor tracy wear a lion mask to track scene then different heads were filmed against a green screen and composited various light effects were then to make it look scary and more angelic after watching a rough cut of episode shiban and spotnitz decided that they were far from end feeling that something was missing two decided to frame happenings of episode with two scenes featuring scully in a church confessional vancouver producer j p finn was chosen to play priest due to his hushed delivery and map of ireland features initially gillian anderson had been given script for these scenes days in advance on day of filming however she was sent a number of rewrites and subsequently demanded more time to become familiar with new script so as to not rush or undermine emotion she was supposed to put into scene crew ended up shooting a day later due to this finn never actually filmed with anderson in order to make up for addition of church scenes first cut of episode had to be trimmed scene by scene and line by line broadcast and reception all souls premiered on fox network in united states on april 26 1998 and was first broadcast in united kingdom on bbc

as among of top 10 tv angels he applauded episode s role switching allowing scully to be believer and mulder to be skeptic emily vanderwerff of a v club wrote positively of episode and awarded it a b despite calling entry an occasionally too slow episode vanderwerff praised anderson lauding her performance as another potential emmy tape in a season full of them furthermore she enjoyed juxtaposition of scully s skepticism and her religious beliefs noting that series could have taken idea into realm of irony but instead played it with a deathly seriousness that allowed it to work other reviews were more negative paula vitaris from cinefantastique gave episode a largely critical review and awarded it one star out of four vitaris wrote with its trip into blatant religiosity all souls comes off like a bad episode of millennium furthermore she was critical of scenes wherein souls were taken noting excessive religious imagery as dara s soul is taken camera pans to right and stops to linger on a telephone pole that forms a cross robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated episode one star out of five two derided fact that episode s killer appears to either be god or an angel commanded by god along with fact that four girls are destined to die because they are disabled and have no right to live furthermore shearman and pearson concluded that while religious worship is not a passive act it is treated so in episode shearman and pearson pp 140 141 ultimately they concluded that while looking at death from a different angle is fascinating it would be explored better in closure footnotes bibliography external links all souls at xfiles com all souls at tv com category 1998 american
