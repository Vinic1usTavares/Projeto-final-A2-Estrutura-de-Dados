psychiatrist s office episode featured one of first scenes in which maslany plays multiple characters interacting in same shot to construct scene in which sarah and alison meet in soccer field shed maslany and her stunt double kathryn alexandre first shot a master version of scene using a technodolly a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements two versions of scene were then re filmed without alexandre with maslany playing each of characters to simulate alison placing her hand on sarah s shoulder a grip stand was used in place of sarah s shoulder for maslany to hold when playing alison and to simulate sarah slapping alison s arm away maslany slapped air when playing sarah and reacted as if she had been hit when playing alison final scene was created through digital compositing whereby both versions of scene with maslany playing both characters separately are combined to produce a single shot maslany felt that as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself she over thought process i think i was trying too hard to get it right nobody s there when you re shooting these things so you overcompensate reception overall instinct was well received by

particularly enjoyed interactions between art and sarah den of geek critic rob kemp thought that episode was well developed and felt that it stood out from current crop of tv science fiction he praised serious nature of episode as well as effort that has gone into grounding show into reality simon cocks of gave instinct 4 out of 5 stars describing it as riveting television he found maslany s performance incredible and effortless and felt that her scenes with art at police station provided strongest material in a more mixed review for twitch film todd brown opined that instinct sometimes crossed line between camp and believability he praised development of story and characters but felt that while maslany s acting was remarkably strong as both sarah and sarah being beth her performance as alison feels a bit shrill references external links instinct at bbc america category 2013 television episodes category orphan black episodes category 2013 in canadian television
