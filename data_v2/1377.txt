production development thumb left bhardwaj added some bollywood elements and a dark and serious side into script he brought from a kenyan writer during a scriptwriting workshop held by mira nair in 2005 cajetan boy a kenyan writer from nairobi showed vishal bhardwaj a script about twin brothers from city s slums and events that occur in their lives during a 24 hour period bhardwaj liked boy s approach to script nair and bhardwaj discussed it and thought it was a typical bollywood masala film boy sent bhardwaj another draft of his script three years later bhardwaj asked boy to sell him idea and he later bought script for us 4 000 bhardwaj revisited idea and added some bollywood elements and a dark serious side to script he worked on original idea with writers sabrina dhawan abhishek chaubey and supratik sen he included dhawan in writing screenplay because as he thought she would give it a solid structure bhardwaj said that during writing of screenplay most of original ideas were changed and climax was indianized his re worked version now included one brother with a stammer and other with a lisp bhardwaj said that despite complicated structure kaminey is anything but arty and could not alienate audiences in any part of india and that it is a simple story but with a complicated structure dhawan said that film s script was complex and has multiple stories which required excessive writing and rewriting to make each character sound distinct media showed concern over film s title deeming it odd and some people were shocked because of title which can be translated into english as mean however makers said that kaminey is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment according to bhardwaj idea for title came from a scene from gulzar s 1987 in which lead actor naseeruddin shah refers to actress in a loving manner it was first time that he heard word used that way bhardwaj told rediff when script of this film was written it was like discovering your own mean side format of film is of a caper and all characters in this film excluding one has an agenda so i thought it was an apt title for film casting thumb 200px right alt shahid kapoor and priyanka chopra are looking towards camera shahid kapoor and priyanka chopra were cast in lead roles shahid kapoor was cast in film s lead role several media outlets reported that bhardwaj considered many actors before casting kapoor in role which he refused bhardwaj refuted claims saying there is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film and i would like to clear up rumour by saying that kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it kapoor said that he accepted role after reading script priyanka chopra was cast to play sweety lead female role she initially turned down role saying she felt it was a boys film and her eight scene part did not seem good enough however bhardwaj persuaded her to accept role idea for casting screenwriter amole gupte came from casting director honey gupte said that when he received a call from he thought it was a joke he stated a man named honey introduced himself as vishal bhardwaj s casting director and offered me a very important role i banged phone down not believing a word of what he said however after meeting and hearing a script reading he loved story and accepted offer actors chandan roy sanyal shiv subramnayam hrishikesh joshi rajatava dutta and deb mukherjee were cast in supporting roles for role of drug dealer tashi bhardwaj chose his friend tenzing tour operator in he had character and attitude he wanted and a weird sense of humour characters bhardwaj instructed film s entire cast and crew to watch caper classics such as lock stock and two smoking barrels 1998 snatch 2000 pulp fiction 1994 and true romance 1993 to study nuances and become familiar with genre shahid kapoor played both charlie and guddu twin brothers with speech impediments charlie has a lisp and guddu stammers producers did not want them to look like caricatures so kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments according to kapoor producers wanted to find out about medical reasons for impediments and their mental effects they met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping kapoor said that each role had its own challenges charlie s physique was very different from kapoor s and it took him nearly a year to change look of his body he found changing from one character to other difficult chopra described her character sweety as feisty and vivacious she said sweety is very busy and does not have time to take care of her looks and apply make up her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend s college or stay in his hotel and eventually marry him chopra described both her character and herself as being outspoken and fun loving as well as honest and unable to hide something that is wrong she said she had a different cultural background to sweety and found it challenging to convincingly portray a maharashtrian marathi girl she had to adopt body language and a maharashtrian accent to suit character she learnt marathi language to make character as authentic as possible which she found difficult chopra said i am speaking a lot of marathi in film it was difficult for me because it s a difficult language and i am not good at marathi but i think it s my luck that through kaminey i got to learn one more language gupte described his character as mercurial and found playing him a physical delight gupte said his character keeps frame unpredictable and that it provided him with a foil to express rage and anguish he worked a lot on his characterisation and tried to bring in his own references from european and japanese cinema chandan roy sanyal described his character mikhail as provocative mad wicked and humorous subramnayam and joshi who played lobo and lele respectively described their characters as most corrupt policemen in their department at anti narcotics bureau they said that to prepare for roles they followed script and bhardwaj s instructions to get characters right mukherjee prepared for his role as mujeeb by reading script and understanding characters and discussing it with bhardwaj dutta who played bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms that he did not have much time to prepare for his role because he was given script after he arrived in mumbai where bhardwaj briefed him filming principal photography commenced in mid 2008 and film was mostly shot in mumbai during a late night shoot for a scene in pune chopra received minor injuries chopra was supposed to ride a motorcycle with kapoor seated on seat both fell off motorcycle as it skidded on mud kapoor was unhurt but chopra received scratch marks and bruises it was reported that kapoor suffered from several injuries while shooting during filming chopra became hoarse because she had to scream her lines an essential part of her role as an extremely vocal maharashtrian girl some important railway sequences were shot at wadi bunder yard near sandhurst road kapoor found filming for both of his characters at nearly same time very difficult he would shoot them on alternate days themes and influences according to hindustan times kaminey is first attempt to deal with reality in a mature matter of fact manner unlike other hindi films in which female lead is sita protagonist is rama and antagonist is ravana characters in kaminey are nuanced humans in layered and complex situations namrata joshi from outlook wrote that kaminey reflects bhardwaj s enduring fascination for underdogs characters on margins of society and morally compromised bhardwaj told rediff com that film deals with themes that affect our lives directly and is a reminder that we all have a dark side and often we are not fully aware of that side rakesh bedi from economic times wrote bhardwaj presents two warring brothers with speech defects in today s world of communication is fraught with many dangers misunderstandings paranoias recriminations conflicts everyone speaks but no one understands bhardwaj gave twins verbal impediments to show that world has now been so to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out he continued w ith some glitches bhardwaj has almost re birthed hindi film film also explores sex and sexuality which according to bedi were explored in a radically different and refreshing way and director daringly takes it a step further when sweety becomes pregnant couple decide to carry pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation so she literally pushes her man into marriage had bhardwaj abjured marriage it would have been a complete break but nuptials were essential to drama of film daily beast said that for aficionados of hindi language genre kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto it takes classic bollywood tropes estranged brothers a case of mistaken identity high drama approaching slapstick comedy and presents them with hollywood style realism instead of bollywood s wink nudge mix of melodrama and posturing bhardwaj has been influenced by many manmohan desai subhash ghai quentin tarantino and francis ford combines these influences in his work rakesh bedi wrote that bhardwaj keeps displaying his vision throughout film reviewers have compared film s multi plot narrative to those of several films by tarantino guy ritchie and coen brothers reviewers said that film mostly belongs to level of pulp fiction shubhra gupta of indian express called it bollywood s first all way out to there pulp fiction bedi wrote there s bunuel in bengali dons there s kurosawa in that surreal train car in which charlie lives there s ray in money floating dreams that charlie has keshav chaturvedi of hindustan times compared apocalyptical gang war in climax to apocalypse now 1979 he said bhardwaj just demolishes cliches of bollywood in ripping apart stereotype he gives us a prototype a bollywood that deals with alienation angst and atrocity a review in times of india said that film s climax reaches level of reservoir dogs and described it as absolutely riveting stuff with camera going on a hitherto unexplored journey
