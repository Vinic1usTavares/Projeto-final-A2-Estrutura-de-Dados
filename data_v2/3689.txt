flossenburg was a nazi concentration camp built in may 1938 by ss main economic and administrative office unlike other concentration camps it was located in a remote area in fichtel mountains of bavaria adjacent to town of flossenburg and near german border with czechoslovakia camp s initial purpose was to exploit forced labor of prisoners for production of granite for nazi architecture in 1943 bulk of prisoners switched to producing messerschmitt bf 109 fighter planes and other armaments for germany s war effort although originally intended for criminal and asocial prisoners after germany s invasion of soviet union camp s numbers swelled with political prisoners from eastern europe it also developed an extensive subcamp system that eventually outgrew main camp before it was liberated by united states army in april 1945 89 964 to 100 000 prisoners passed through flossenburg and its subcamps around 30 000 people died there from malnutrition overwork or executions or during death marches some of perpetrators were convicted in flossenburg trial and camp was repurposed for other uses before opening of a memorial and museum in 2007 background thumb left upright albert speer s plan for berlin during first half of 1938 nazi concentration camp population expanded threefold due to increased arrests by schutzstaffel ss of individuals deemed undesirable especially asocial and criminal prisoners to create a slave labor force ss leader heinrich himmler ordered founding of new concentration camps to expand ss economic empire ss intended to exploit slave labor of prisoners to quarry granite which was in high demand for monumental building projects in nazi style this would also profit ss owned and operated dest company german earth and stone works which had been founded in april during second half of march 1938 a high ranking ss commission led by oswald pohl and theodor eicke toured southern germany searching for a site for a new camp that would meet ss specifications on 24 march 1938 they chose a site near small town of flossenburg in upper palatinate for establishment of a concentration camp due to quarries of blue gray granite located nearby unlike all other nazi concentration camps to date which were near rail junctions and population centers camp was to be located in remote fichtel mountains near formerly owned by holy roman emperor friedrich barbarossa flossenburg was a poor rural area with about 1 200 inhabitants who mostly worked on quarries which had existed since 19th century local economy especially stone industry was negatively impacted by new border with czechoslovakia after treaty of versailles and 1930s economic slump adolf hitler s rise to power increased demand for granite earning nazi party local support construction of camp was funded by a contract with albert speer s ministry for reconstruction of berlin it was first occasion that economic considerations had determined site of a camp establishment thumb gate of flossenburg with nazi slogan arbeit macht frei work sets you free upright order for construction of eight barracks at flossenburg went through on 31 march ss guards arrived in april and on 3 may 1938 a transport of 100 prisoners arrived from dachau establishing camp more prisoners arrived from dachau on 9 and 16 may himmler visited camp on 16 may with pohl indicating that ss considered it an important project ss attempted to segregate prisoners incarcerated for criminal offenses at flossenburg because forced labor in quarries was considered a particularly harsh punishment most of prisoners at flossenburg were classified as criminal with some asocial and a few homosexual prisoners criminals quickly took over prisoner functionary positions new prisoners had to construct camp themselves beginning with barbed wire fence this was initially main use of forced labor while performing this heavy and dangerous work prisoners lived in makeshift structures simultaneously hundreds of prisoners had to work in quarries camp s population had increased to 1 500 following arrivals from dachau sachsenhausen and buchenwald in january 1939 first commandant jakob unexpectedly died he was replaced by a former ss officer at dachau karl kunstler who presided over an era in which camp became an economically productive center for granite quarrying and increasingly deadly for its prisoners with first barracks complete in 1939 work began on an internal jail guard towers a washing facility and a sewer system in april 1939 economic productivity of camp led to pohl ordering camp to be expanded to fit 3 000 prisoners to build additional barracks terraces had to be cut into hillsides an arduous task that led to many injuries fifty five prisoners died before outbreak of world war ii in september 1939 during mid 1939 nazi authorities planned to invade poland it was decided to stage false flag attacks in order to justify a german declaration of war several prisoners from flossenburg and other concentration camps were secretly transferred to a gestapo prison in breslau poisoned and dressed in polish uniforms on 31 august 1939 bodies were dumped at a border post in where they were shot and hacked photographs were taken as proof of a polish attack on germany expansion thumb left layout of camp as drawn by survivor stefan upright 1 2 in september 1939 ss transferred 1 000 political prisoners to flossenburg from dachau in order to clear latter camp to train first regiment of waffen ss these prisoners who were first political prisoners at flossenburg were moved back to dachau in march 1940 first foreign prisoners were transferred to camp by gestapo in april including czech student protestors and polish resistance members vast majority of new foreign prisoners were incarcerated due to their opposition to nazi regime a few of them were jews most of jewish political prisoners were executed or died shortly after arriving from mistreatment last twelve surviving jews were deported to auschwitz on 19 october 1942 pursuant to himmler s order to make reich judenrein number of polish prisoners increased sharply in 1941 on 23 january 600 arrived from auschwitz in mid october 1941 1 700 to 2 000 soviet prisoners of war arrived at flossenburg as part of a massive transfer of soviet prisoners to ss camp system in poor condition due to their previous mistreatment they spent several months recovering before they were deemed fit to work they were accommodated in a special cordoned off area by february 1943 flossenburg had 4 004 prisoners not including soviet prisoners of war from april 1943 commandant was max koegel described by american historian todd huebner as a vicious martinet who lacked ability to manage camp during its rapid expansion continuing influxes of political prisoners from occupied countries caused germans to become a minority that same year during 1944 flossenburg s population expanded almost eightfold from 4 869 to 40 437 due to a high influx of mainly non german prisoners this was part of an expansion that applied over entire nazi concentration camp system by end of 1943 number of guards had increased to about 450 including 140 ukrainian auxiliaries as with other concentration camps guards initially consisted of ss men from germany and austria whose ranks were augmented with volksdeutsche recruits after 1942 number of guards increased sixfold during 1944 and reached 4 500 by time camp was evacuated due to manpower shortages fit young guards were called up for front line service and many older men members of wehrmacht and five hundred ss women were recruited into guard force at flossenburg subcamps map of selected subcamps expansion of camp led to establishment of subcamps first of which was established at in february 1942 to provide forced labor to a mining company many of them were located in sudetenland or across border in protectorate of bohemia and moravia initially subcamps were not involved in armaments production which changed in second half of 1944 due to a large influx of available prisoners and activities of jagerstab which sought to increase german aircraft production jagerstab s dispersal of aircraft production spurred expansion of subcamp system in 1944 and resulted in establishment of two largest of subcamps at and in second half of 1944 45 new camps were created compared to three camps in previous six months staffing these new camps was increasingly filled by luftwaffe soldiers volksdeutsche ss men ethnic germans from outside reich and ss women for subcamps containing female prisoners by april 1945 80 of prisoners were at subcamps forced labor quarries thumb quarry at flossenburg upright 1 2 three quarries were operational by end of 1938 and a fourth opened in april 1941 all four quarries were located near main camp and total planned output was annually stone was average quality blue gray and yellow gray granite 90 of which was suitable for architectural purposes production gradually increased during 1940 but remained constant in 1941 initially all work was done by manual labor prisoners worked alongside civilian laborers and performed most arduous and dangerous tasks accidents led to many deaths beginning in 1940 and 1941 machines were introduced to increase efficiency in mid 1939 quarries became main use of labor in camp and following year they consumed half of total labor which was valued at 367 000 reichmarks from november 1940 some prisoners were trained as stonemasons in a specialized workshop their numbers reached 1 200 by december 1942 prisoners were instructed by civilian experts in a ten week course covering both practical and theoretical topics but watched carefully by kapos those who failed to advance were sent to work in quarries while those whose productivity improved were given cigarettes and extra food stone that they cut was used for construction of camp autobahns and various ss military projects but later on it was destined for monumental german stadium project and nazi party rally grounds in nuremberg of five prewar concentration camps where economic industries were prominent flossenburg was one that was most significant and consistent in producing income for dest for example it produced of stone in 1939 almost three quarters of total production that year largest buyer of flossenburg granite was albert speer s office for reconstruction of berlin within this project largest and most significant orders were for wilhelm kreis soldiers hall project beginning in 1940 increasing amounts of stone were used for road building 15 in 1939 but 60 next year first quarry shut down in may 1943 and its workers were reassigned to arms production but half of prisoner labor was still going to quarries although civilian production was being scaled back in order to reorient economy to total war dest managed to secure permission to keep many of its quarries open into 1944 at flossenburg company maintained strong control over economic enterprises of camp despite fact that this aspect was supposed to be under control of ss main economic and administrative office ss in early 1944 1 000 prisoners were still employed in quarries aircraft and armaments thumb left aircraft factory at flossenburg photographed after liberation upright 1 2 during 1942 focus of ss shifted towards war production leading to negotiations with arms manufacturers to license their products to dest messerschmitt ag was one of most important armaments companies that demonstrated interest in acquiring slave labor of concentration camp prisoners opening negotiations with dest via regensburg by end of 1942 to produce parts for messerschmitt bf 109 aircraft at flossenburg under terms of deal messerschmitt would provide skilled technicians raw materials and tools paying dest 3 reichsmarks per day for a skilled laborer and 1 5 reichsmarks per day for an unskilled prisoner thus messerschmitt could increase its profit margin by reducing labor cost while dest could reduce its administrative costs by acting as a manpower agency in mid january 1943 dest accepted offer production started in early february according to yad vashem historian daniel uziel conversion of flossenburg to armaments production was especially significant because it had been most profitable dest enterprise number of prisoners working for messerschmitt increased greatly after bombing of messerschmitt s regensburg plant on 17 august 1943 that month 800 prisoners worked for messerschmitt a year later 5 700 prisoners were employed in armaments production a subcontractor of messerschmitt established flossenburg subcamps to support its production a subcamp at established in december 1943 to produce tailplanes for bf 109 and another subcamp at st which produced aircraft wings in january 1944 despite strict regulations forbidding contact german civilian workers came into contact with prisoners and some helped by providing extra food or other assistance flossenburg camp system had become a key supplier of bf 109 parts by february 1944 when messerschmitt s regensburg plant was bombed again during big week seven hundred soviet prisoners who had been working at regensburg factory were transferred to flossenburg to continue working on bf 109 production increased production at flossenburg was essential to restoring production in aftermath of attack aircraft manufacturer arado eventually became one of primary users of slave labor at subcamps for arado ar 234 jet bomber project at freiberg among other locations other prisoners in subcamps were forced to work on synthetic oil production or repairing railways before end of war about 18 000 prisoners at flossenburg and its subcamps were working on aviation related projects conditions thumb barracks at flossenburg concentration camp ten percent of deaths at flossenburg occurred before 1943 quarries caused death rate to be higher at flossenburg than at camps with less physically demanding industries such as brickworks switch to armaments production in 1943 led to a decrease in death rate prisoners also suffered from a shortage of fresh water due to elevation and unusually cold and wet weather their clothing was not adequate for these conditions main camp situated in a narrow valley had little room for expansion originally constructed for only 1 500 prisoners population of main camp increased to between 10 000 and 11 000 before it was evacuated in april 1945 in order to increase productivity prisoners were forced to sleep and work in shifts this also helped alleviate chronic overcrowding in barracks prisoner functionaries at flossenburg were unusually brutal and corrupt because positions had been taken by criminal prisoners even though overall only about 5 of prisoners had been classified as criminal final camp elder anton uhl was beaten to death by prisoners after liberation many of criminal functionaries sexually abused young male prisoners causing commandant to isolate teenage boys in a separate barracks ss hierarchy was also known for corruption and brutality prisoners were mistreated in various ways from being beaten or doused with cold water to being shot by guards during alleged escape attempts prisoners were chronically undernourished and disease was rampant conditions differed based on a prisoner s status and race polish and soviet prisoners occupied lowest rungs on prisoner hierarchy being put on most physically demanding work details and allocated less food than other prisoners there was an epidemic of dysentery in january 1940 that shut down work at camp and typhus epidemics in september 1944 and january 1945 claimed many lives total number of prisoners who passed through flossenburg and its subcamps has been estimated at 89 964 or over 100 000 about 30 000 of prisoners died at flossenburg or during its evacuation main causes of death were malnutrition and disease between 13 000 and 15 000 prisoners died at main camp and more than 10 000 at satellite camps an estimated three quarters of deaths occurred in nine months before liberation executions thumb left flossenburg crematorium due to increasing mortality from harsh conditions ss ordered construction of an on site crematorium which was completed in may 1940 executions by shooting began at flossenburg on 6 february 1941 first victims were polish political prisoners victims were separated after evening roll call and read their sentence after a night in camp jail they were shot at firing range adjacent to crematorium after a mass execution of 80 polish prisoners on 8 september execution method was changed to lethal injection due to complaints from local residents of blood and body parts washing up in nearby streams primary victims were polish political prisoners and soviet prisoners of war doctors who had participated in aktion t4 mass killings toured several concentration camps to select ill inmates to be transported to euthanasia centers they visited flossenburg in march 1942 thousands of prisoners who were worn out by forced labor were sent to death camps such as majdanek and auschwitz one transport from flossenburg to auschwitz arrived on 5 december 1943 with more than 250 of 948 prisoners dead by 18 february only 393 survived women unable to work were often deported to concentration camp rate of executions increased during final months of camp ss liquidated prisoners who they suspected might try to escape or organize resistance most of victims were russians some of them were high profile prisoners who had been kept alive previously for interrogation during last days of camp s existence ss executed thirteen allied secret agents and seven prominent german anti nazis including former abwehr head wilhelm canaris and confessing church theologian dietrich bonhoeffer in all ss had executed at least 2 500 people at flossenburg final months thumb flossenburg fence

gross rosen of 3 000 on one transport only 1 000 arrived alive influx of prisoners caused conditions to worsen and death rate to increase dramatically 3 370 prisoners died between mid january and 13 april as there was not enough space in infirmary for all of sick prisoners commandant max koegel ordered hundreds of sick prisoners sent to bergen belsen in april in order to cope with disorder he founded a camp police force composed of ethnic german prisoners mostly criminals these prisoners mistreated non german prisoners during last months of camp s existence many of prisoners were idle because no raw materials for their work had arrived because of its location near border of protectorate flossenburg was destination for evacuation transports from buchenwald concentration camp when allies neared camp in mid april at least 6 000 prisoners from buchenwald arrived at flossenburg between 16 and 20 april many of jews were sent on to theresienstadt ghetto while non jewish prisoners
