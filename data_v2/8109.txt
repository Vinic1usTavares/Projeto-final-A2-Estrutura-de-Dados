mulsanne corner allowing lotterer to attack him entering dunlop bridge audis passed no 5 toyota of sebastien buemi for fourth and fifth conway overtook bernhard on way into first mulsanne chicane for second and took lead from jani at eighth lap s conclusion duval passed bernhard for third place while lotterer began a sequence of pit stops to change to dry compound tyres soon after after pit stops lotterer moved to front of race with hartley in second and duval third after both toyotas had slow stops lotterer extended his advantage to seven seconds before entering pit lane for an unscheduled stop he was pushed into his garage for a change of turbocharger and repairs to his car s rear hydraulics system promoting hartley to lead duval retook first by passing hartley on pit lane straight but lost position to him at mulsanne corner when a short rain shower fell lmp2 lead was taken by roberto merhi s no 44 manor at start of hour after he switched to intermediate tyres during first lap of competitive racing in lmgte pro makowiecki s no 92 porsche was 13 8 seconds ahead of richard westbrook s no 69 ford westbrook eroded makowiecki s advantage by going two seconds per lap faster than him he took class lead on approach to mulsanne corner before second hour was over battle for outright lead continued to be a multi car duel between representatives of three manufacturers as they were separated by less than three seconds this fluctuated due to various levels of traffic webber s no 1 porsche and kobayashi s no 6 toyota exchanged lead through following pit stop cycle and next three hours as toyotas were on track longer this meant they ran a lap more at full speed in their attempt at making one less stop later in race lead of lmgte pro was left to vilander s risi ferrari after briscoe relieved westbrook in no 69 ford vilander pulled away from briscoe whose performance faded in early phase of his first stint and he was caught by joey hand s sister no 68 car which was on

way through slower traffic matteo malucelli returned no 82 ferrari back to front of lmgte pro after passing two class leading fords of dixon and stefan mucke malucelli was later demoted from top of lmgte pro to third when sebastien bourdais and later dixon got ahead of him kobayashi and later sarrazin took overall lead from bernhard after a local slow zone procedure was activated for trackside officials to recover taittinger s no 28 pegasus morgan misjudged braking point for right hand mulsanne corner and was beached in gravel trap bernhard lost forty seconds to kobayashi because he lost

no 78 kcmg entry exchanged class lead until lamy s no 98 aston martin broke up monopoly midway through seventh hour when he overtook christian ried for second and began to draw closer to long as night fell on circuit battle for overall victory was left to both toyotas and porsches because duval s no 8 audi dropped off pace in fifth jani lapped more than a second faster than his teammate bernhard and overtook him for second on 120th lap this came as audis were instructed by race control to enter their garages for repairs to their number lighting systems repairs to both audis took less than six minutes each and team s drivers rejoined in same positions they were in earlier tsugio matsuda s no 47 kcmg car suffered an apparent power failure and pulled off to side of circuit on straight linking

second soon after passing kraihamer s no 13 rebellion for fifth fassler s no 7 audi developed a hybrid system issue that forced its return to pit lane lmgte am lead changed midway through twelfth hour from khalid al qubaisi s no 88 abu dhabi proton porsche to bell s no 62 scuderia corsa ferrari not long after stevens no 26 g drive oreca served a one minute stop and go penalty for speeding in a slow zone he fell a further minute and a half behind hirakawa s no 46 tds racing car but stayed in third place in lmp2 several lmgte cars took opportunity to change brake discs at this point in morning including lmgte pro leading risi ferrari of fisichella halfway through 13th hour kobayashi relinquished no 6 toyota s hold on first to lieb s no 2 porsche for five laps when he made an unscheduled pit stop to repair minor left hand side bodywork damage lieb could not establish a healthy advantage as a local slow zone procedure was needed for no 13 rebellion of tuscher who retired just before

puncture he was forced into pit lane for a replacement wheel and fuel davidson s no 5 toyota inherited second he started closing up to his teammate kobayashi before lieb retook lead through following pit stop cycle morning and early afternoon a series of incidents in lmgte pro and lmp2 during first hours of morning prompted localised slow zone procedures and later fourth deployment of safety cars

car separated lmp1 field as conway s and buemi s toyotas made pit stops after racing resumed they slipstreamed one another in slower traffic on mulsanne straight and buemi overtook conway around outside for second conway and buemi retook first and second when jani s no 2 porsche made a pit stop from lead by close of 17th hour and emerged close behind pair outright leaders settled down as 18th hour approached two toyotas opened up a healthy advantage over jani s no 2 porsche he could not match their pace after his race long speed advantage had been nullified at that point muller s no 68 ford fell back from battle for lead of lmgte pro with no 82 risi ferrari of malucelli on 245th lap muller was penalised with a drive through penalty for having engine running during his refuelling pit stop he responded by going a second per lap faster than malucelli it lowered his lead in lmgte pro to seven seconds going into next pit stop phase hand later relieved muller in no 68 ford and got car back to front of lmgte pro by overtaking malucelli on first part of mulsanne straight he began to pull clear with four and a half hours remaining lieb s no 2 porsche returned to outright lead but he ceded it to davidson s faster no 5 toyota on approach to mulsanne corner sister no 6 toyota had an anxious moment when kobayashi lost control of car on way into karting corner and came to a rest in gravel trap he returned to third without needing external aid but lost 20 seconds to teammate davidson pressure put on ford by ferrari in lmgte pro eased when vilander pirouetted rear of no 82 car leaving porsche curves he kept second in class despite getting temporarily beached in gravel trap kobayashi bowed out of battle for outright victory when he went to his garage to fix no 6 toyota s floor which was damaged during night when it hit a slower car and have a precautionary cooling system check done so it could get to end of race although repairs to car lost it three laps to davidson s sister no 5 toyota it retained its hold on third as no 8 audi was ten laps adrift in fourth davidson and later nakajima matched jani s pace he could not get a consistent rate of lap times or get closer to front of pack this was after porsche changed its strategy to match one employed by toyota throughout event which had no 2 car stay on track for fourteen lap stints fuel mileage was also a concern for lmgte pro leaders as briscoe s no 69 ford stopped one lap later than all other cars in class that drew him closer to vilander s no 82 risi ferrari as hand s sister no 68 ford was responding to his pace during 22nd hour mathias lauda s no 98 aston martin pulled off behind left hand concrete wall on approach to porsche curves with a terminal gearbox problem soon after that s no

had a mechanical failure in final six minutes that stopped japanese manufacturer from taking its first le mans victory with six minutes remaining nakajima s no 5 toyota was ahead of jani s no 2 porsche by seventy seconds and looked set to clinch manufacturer s first overall le mans victory but nakajima slowed to less than on mulsanne straight due to a failure of connector line linking turbocharger and intercooler that caused car to suddenly lose control over turbocharger and reduced horsepower nakajima slowed even more two minutes later and stopped no 5 toyota after start finish line as car s power gave out entirely jani overcame gap and overtook nakajima seconds later to take chequered flag for no 2 porsche and marque s eighteenth overall victory at le mans it was jani and lieb s first le mans victory and dumas second after triumphing in sister no 6 toyota of sarrazin conway and kobayashi finished three laps behind in second while no 8 audi of duval di grassi and jarvis

times for a total of 51 laps post race top three finishers in all four categories appeared on podium to collect their trophies and at their own separate press conferences lieb said of no 2 porsche s outright victory last quadruple stint i did was really on edge even first three stints were quite difficult with overtaking in traffic and taking risks in last one i then also had to save fuel and especially front tyres that began to lose performance i gave everything i had and now i think i have to digest what all has happened today kobayashi said performance of no 6 toyota demonstrated its strong pace but that team was not happy with second place unfortunately our second position was not what we wanted we are here to win so i am not really happy his co driver conway spoke of his mixed feelings over result i have mixed feelings second is okay but we are all gutted for car 5 they drove a great race it s okay to get one car on podium but we wanted more third placed di grassi described audi s race as horrible and said improved competition from porsche and toyota would require his team to improve for rest of season to finish on podium is a nice reward but this race performance is not audi with how many times we went into garage how many repairs we had to do and how much time we spent stopped we have to improve a lot we have to beat others on track mechanical failure of no 5 toyota in closing minutes overshadowed event toyota team principal hughes de was visibly distraught and tearful over manufacturer being denied a maiden victory at le mans he said you cannot accept that three minutes before flag and just in front of you you cannot believe it we are just dreaming it is so hard to accept it other motorsport people including jarvis jani webber and head of audi motorsport wolfgang ullrich expressed their sympathy to toyota following completion of an initial investigation into failure five days later toyota denied any connection to similar engine problems cars had at
