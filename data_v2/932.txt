deep impact was a nasa space probe launched from cape canaveral air force station on january 12 2005 it was designed to study interior composition of comet tempel 1 9p tempel by releasing an impactor into comet at 05 52 utc on july 4 2005 impactor successfully collided with comet s nucleus impact excavated debris from interior of nucleus forming an impact crater photographs taken by spacecraft showed comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud obscuring view of impact crater previous space missions to comets such as giotto deep space 1 and stardust were fly by missions these missions were able to photograph and examine only surfaces of cometary nuclei and even then from considerable distances deep impact mission was first to eject material from a comet s surface and mission garnered considerable publicity from media international scientists and amateur astronomers alike upon completion of its primary mission proposals were made to further utilize spacecraft consequently deep impact flew by earth on december 31 2007 on its way to an extended mission designated epoxi with a dual purpose to study extrasolar planets and comet hartley 2 103p hartley communication was unexpectedly lost in august 2013 while craft was heading for another asteroid flyby scientific goals deep impact mission was planned to help answer fundamental questions about comets which included what makes up composition of comet s nucleus what depth crater would reach from impact and where comet originated in its formation by observing composition of comet astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on differences between interior and exterior makeup of comet observations of impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine answers to these questions mission s principal investigator was michael a hearn an astronomer at university of maryland he led science team which included members from cornell university university of maryland university of arizona brown university belton space exploration initiatives jpl university of hawaii saic ball aerospace and max planck institut fur physik spacecraft design and instrumentation left thumb upright spacecraft overview spacecraft consists of two main sections copper core smart impactor that impacted comet and flyby section which imaged comet from a safe distance during encounter with tempel 1 flyby spacecraft is about long wide and high it includes two solar panels a debris shield and several science instruments for imaging infrared spectroscopy and optical navigation to its destination near comet spacecraft also carried two cameras high resolution imager hri and medium resolution imager mri hri is an imaging device that combines a visible light camera with a filter wheel and an imaging infrared spectrometer called spectral imaging module or sim that operates on a spectral band from 1 05 to 4 8 micrometres it has been optimized for observing comet s nucleus mri is backup device and was used primarily for navigation during final 10 day approach it also has a filter wheel with a slightly different set of filters impactor section of spacecraft contains an instrument that is optically identical to mri called impactor targeting sensor its but without filter wheel its dual purpose was to sense impactor s trajectory which could then be adjusted up to four times between release and impact and to image comet from close range as impactor neared comet s surface this camera took high resolution pictures of nucleus as good as that were transmitted in real time to flyby spacecraft before it and impactor were destroyed final image taken by impactor was snapped only 3 7 seconds before impact impactor s payload dubbed cratering mass was 100 copper with a weight of 100 kg including this cratering mass copper formed 49 of total mass of impactor with aluminium at 24 of total mass this was to minimize interference with scientific measurements since copper was not expected to be found on a comet scientists could ignore copper s signature in any spectrometer readings instead of using explosives it was also cheaper to use copper as payload explosives would also have been superfluous at its closing velocity of 10 2 km s impactor s kinetic energy was equivalent to 4 8 tonnes of tnt considerably more than its actual mass of only 372 kg mission coincidentally shared its name with 1998 film deep impact in which a comet strikes earth mission profile thumb left cameras of flyby spacecraft hri at right mri at left

174 days to reach comet tempel 1 at a cruising speed of once spacecraft reached vicinity of comet on july 3 2005 it separated into impactor and flyby sections impactor used its thrusters to move into path of comet impacting 24 hours later at a relative speed of impactor delivered s of kinetic energy equivalent of 4 7 tons of tnt scientists believed that energy of high velocity collision would be sufficient to excavate a crater up to wide larger than bowl of roman colosseum size of crater was still not known one year after impact 2007 stardust spacecraft s next mission determined crater s diameter to be just minutes after impact flyby probe passed by nucleus at a close distance of taking pictures of crater position ejecta plume and entire cometary nucleus entire event was also photographed by earth based telescopes and orbital observatories including hubble chandra spitzer and xmm newton impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board europe s rosetta spacecraft which was about from comet at time of impact rosetta determined composition of gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by impact mission events thumb 250px animation of deep impact trajectory from january 12 2005 to august 8 2013 before launch a comet impact mission was first proposed to nasa in 1996 but at time nasa engineers were skeptical that target could be hit in 1999 a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal dubbed deep impact was accepted and funded as part of nasa s discovery program of low cost spacecraft two spacecraft impactor and flyby and three main instruments were built and integrated by ball aerospace technologies in boulder colorado developing software for spacecraft took 18 months and application code consisted of 20 000 lines and 19 different application threads total cost of developing spacecraft and completing its mission reached launch and commissioning phase probe was originally scheduled for launch on december 30 2004 but nasa officials delayed its launch in order to allow more time for testing software it was successfully launched from cape canaveral on january 12 2005 at 1 47 pm est 1847 utc by a delta ii rocket deep impact state of health was uncertain during first day after launch shortly after entering orbit around sun and deploying its solar panels probe switched itself to safe mode cause of problem was simply an incorrect temperature limit in fault protection logic for spacecraft s rcs thruster catalyst beds spacecraft s thrusters were used to spacecraft following third stage separation on january 13 2005 nasa announced that probe was out of safe mode and healthy on february 11 2005 deep impact rockets were fired as planned to correct spacecraft s course this correction was so precise that next planned correction maneuver on march 31 2005 was unnecessary and canceled commissioning phase verified that all instruments were activated and checked out during these tests it was found that hri images were not in focus after it underwent a bake out period after mission members investigated problem on june 9 2005 it was announced that by using image processing software and mathematical technique of deconvolution hri images could be corrected to restore much of resolution anticipated cruise phase thumb comet tempel 1 imaged on april 25 2005 by deep impact spacecraft cruise phase began on march 25 2005 immediately after commissioning phase was completed this phase continued until about 60 days before encounter with comet tempel 1 on april 25 2005 probe acquired first image of its target at a distance of on may 4 2005 spacecraft executed its second trajectory correction maneuver burning its rocket engine for 95 seconds spacecraft speed was changed by rick project manager for mission at nasa s jet propulsion laboratory reacted to maneuver stating that spacecraft performance has been excellent and this burn was no different it was a textbook maneuver that placed us right on money approach phase approach phase extended from 60 days before encounter may 5 2005 until five days before encounter sixty days out was earliest time that deep impact spacecraft was expected to detect comet with its mri camera in fact comet was spotted ahead of schedule 69 days before impact see cruise phase above this milestone marks beginning of an intensive period of observations to refine knowledge of comet s orbit and study comet s rotation activity and dust environment on june 14 and 22 2005 deep impact observed two outbursts of activity from comet latter being six times larger than former spacecraft studied images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position don yeomans a mission co investigator for jpl pointed out that it takes 7 1 2 minutes for signal to get back to earth so you cannot joystick this thing you have to rely on fact that impactor is a smart spacecraft as is flyby spacecraft so you have to build in intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing on june 23 2005 first of two final trajectory correct maneuvers targeting maneuver was successfully executed a velocity change was needed to adjust flight path towards comet and target impactor at a window in space about wide impact phase thumb deep impact comet encounter sequence impact phase began nominally on june 29 2005 five days before impact impactor successfully separated from flyby spacecraft on july 3 at 6 00 utc 6 07 utc ert first images from instrumented impactor were seen two hours after separation flyby spacecraft performed one of two divert maneuvers to avoid damage a 14 minute burn was executed which slowed down spacecraft it was also reported that communication link between flyby and impactor was functioning as expected impactor executed three correction maneuvers in final two hours before impact impactor was maneuvered to plant itself in front of comet so that tempel 1 would collide with it impact occurred at 05 45 utc 05 52 utc ert up to three minutes one way light time 7m 26s on morning of july 4 2005 within one second of expected time for impact impactor returned images as late as three seconds before impact most of data captured was stored on board flyby spacecraft which radioed approximately 4 500 images from hri mri and its cameras to earth over next few days energy from collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and comet shone six times brighter than normal a mission timeline is located at impact phase timeline nasa results thumb left mission team members celebrate after impact with comet mission control did not become aware of impactor s success until five minutes later at 05 57 utc don yeomans confirmed results for press we hit it just exactly where we wanted to and jpl director charles stated success exceeded our expectations in post impact briefing on july 4 2005 at 08 00 utc first processed images revealed existing craters on comet nasa scientists stated they could not see new crater that had formed from impactor but it was later discovered to be about 100 meters wide and up to deep lucy mcfadden one of co investigators of impact stated we didn t expect success of one part of mission bright dust cloud to affect a second part seeing resultant crater but that is part of fun of science to meet with unexpected analysis of data from swift x ray telescope showed that comet continued outgassing from impact for 13 days with a peak five days after impact a total of of water and between of dust were lost from impact initial results were surprising as material excavated by impact contained more dust and less ice than had been expected only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material in addition material was finer than expected scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand other materials found while studying impact included clays carbonates sodium and crystalline silicates which were found by studying spectroscopy of impact clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space observations also revealed that comet was about 75 empty space and one astronomer compared outer layers of comet to same makeup of a snow bank astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets to determine if they share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced at time of solar system s formation thumb before and after comparison images from deep impact and stardust showing crater formed by deep impact on right hand image astronomers hypothesized based on its interior chemistry that comet formed in uranus and neptune oort cloud region of solar system a comet which forms farther from sun is expected to have greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures such as ethane which was present in tempel 1 astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to tempel 1 are likely to have formed in same region crater because quality of images of crater formed during deep impact collision was not satisfactory on july 3 2007 nasa approved new exploration of tempel 1 or next mission mission utilized already existing stardust spacecraft which had studied comet wild 2 in 2004 stardust was placed into a new orbit so that it passed by tempel 1 at a distance of approximately on february 15 2011 at 04 42 utc this was first time that a comet was visited by two probes on separate occasions 1p halley had been visited by several probes within a few weeks in 1986 and it provided an opportunity to better observe crater that was created by deep impact as well as observing changes caused by comet s latest close approach to sun on february 15 nasa scientists identified crater formed by deep impact in images from stardust crater is estimated to be in diameter and has a bright mound in center likely created when material from impact fell back into crater public interest media coverage thumb image of impact which was widely circulated in media impact was a substantial news event reported and discussed online in print and on television there was a genuine suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over result of impact various experts debated whether impactor would go straight through comet and out other side would create an impact crater would open up a hole in interior of comet and other theories however twenty four hours before impact flight team at jpl began privately expressing a high level of confidence that barring any unforeseen technical glitches spacecraft would intercept tempel 1 one senior personnel member stated all we can do now is sit back and wait everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done in final minutes as impactor hit comet more than 10 000 people watched collision on a giant movie screen at hawaii s waikiki beach experts came up with a range of soundbites to summarize mission to public iwan williams of queen mary university of london said it was like a mosquito hitting a 747 what we ve found is that mosquito didn t splat on surface it s actually gone through windscreen one day after impact marina bay a russian astrologer sued nasa for for impact which ruin ed natural balance of forces in universe her lawyer asked public to volunteer to help in claim by declaring impact changed magnetic properties of comet and this could have affected mobile telephony here on earth if your phone went down this morning ask yourself why and then get in touch with us on august 9 2005 court of moscow ruled against bay although she did attempt to appeal result one russian physicist said that impact had no effect on earth and change to orbit of comet after collision was only about 10 cm 3 9 in send your name to a comet campaign thumb left cd containing 625 000 names is added to impactor mission was notable for one of its promotional campaigns send your name to a comet visitors to jet propulsion laboratory s website were invited to submit their name between may 2003 and january 2004 and names gathered some 625 000 in all were then burnt onto a mini cd which was attached to impactor dr don yeomans a member of spacecraft s scientific team stated this is an opportunity to become part of an extraordinary space mission when craft is launched in december 2004 yours and names of your loved ones can hitch along for ride and be part of what may be best space fireworks show in history idea was credited with driving interest in mission reaction from china chinese researchers used deep impact mission as an opportunity to highlight efficiency of american science because public support ensured possibility of funding long term research by contrast in china public usually has no idea what our scientists are doing and limited funding for promotion of science weakens people s enthusiasm for research two days after us mission succeeded in having a probe collide with a comet china revealed a plan for what it called a more clever version of mission landing a probe on a small comet or asteroid to push it off course china said it would begin mission after sending a probe to moon contributions from amateur astronomers thumb deep impact participation certificate of maciej since observing time on large professional telescopes such as keck or hubble is always scarce deep impact scientists called upon advanced amateur student and professional astronomers to use small telescopes to make long term observations of target comet before and after impact purpose of these observations was to look for volatile outgassing dust coma development and dust production rates dust tail development and jet activity and outbursts by mid 2007 amateur astronomers had submitted over a thousand ccd images of comet one notable amateur observation was by students from schools in hawaii working with us and uk scientists who during press conference took live images using faulkes automatic telescope in hawaii students operated telescope over internet and were one of first groups to get images of impact one amateur astronomer reported seeing a structureless bright cloud around comet and an estimated 2 magnitude increase in brightness after impact another amateur published a map of crash area from nasa images musical tribute deep impact mission coincided with celebrations in los angeles area marking 50th anniversary of rock around clock by bill haley his comets becoming first rock and roll single to reach no 1 on recording sales charts within 24 hours of mission s success a 2 minute music video produced by martin lewis had been created using images of impact itself combined with computer animation of deep impact probe in flight interspersed with footage of bill haley his comets performing in 1955 and surviving original members of comets performing in march 2005 video was posted to nasa s website for a couple of weeks afterwards on july 5 2005 surviving original members of comets ranging in age from 71 84 performed a free concert for hundreds of employees of jet propulsion laboratory to help them celebrate mission s success this event received worldwide press attention in february 2006 international astronomical union citation that officially named asteroid included a reference to jpl concert extended mission deep impact embarked on an extended mission designated epoxi extrasolar planet observation and deep impact extended investigation to visit other comets after being put to sleep in 2005 upon completion of tempel 1 mission aol news nasa spaceship captures images of a bizarre comet november 4 2010 by traci watson contributing editor comet boethin plan its first extended visit was to do a flyby of comet boethin but with some complications on july 21 2005 deep impact executed a trajectory correction maneuver that allows spacecraft to use earth s gravity to begin a new mission in a path towards another comet original plan was for a december 5 2008 flyby of comet boethin coming within of comet michael a hearn deep impact team leader explained we propose to direct spacecraft for a flyby of comet boethin to investigate whether results found at comet tempel 1 are unique or are also found on other comets 40 million mission would provide about half of information as collision of tempel 1 but at a fraction of cost deep impact would use its spectrometer to study comet s surface composition and its telescope for viewing surface features however as december 2007 earth gravity assist approached astronomers were unable to locate comet boethin which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed consequently its orbit could not be calculated with sufficient precision to permit a flyby flyby of comet hartley 2 thumb comet hartley 2 on november 4 2010 in november 2007 jpl team targeted deep impact toward comet hartley 2 however this would require an extra two years of travel for deep impact including earth gravity assists in december 2007 and december 2008 on may 28 2010 a burn of 11 3 seconds was conducted to enable june 27 earth fly by to be optimized for

in february 2013 deep impact observed comet ison comet remained observable until march 2013 contact lost and end of mission on september 3 2013 a mission update was posted to epoxi mission status website stating communication with spacecraft was lost some time between august 11 and august 14 last communication was on august 8 team on august 30 determined cause of problem team is now trying to determine how best to try to recover communication on september 10 2013 a deep impact mission status report explained that mission controllers believe computers on spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves and so are unable to issue any commands to vehicle s thrusters as a result of this problem communication with spacecraft was explained to be more difficult as orientation of vehicle s antennas is unknown additionally solar panels on vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power on september 20 2013 nasa abandoned further attempts to contact craft according to chief scientist a hearn reason for software malfunction was a y2k like problem august 11 2013 00 38 49 was 232 tenth seconds from january 1 2000 leading to speculation that a system on craft tracked time in one tenth second increments since january 1 2000 and stored it in an unsigned 32 bit integer which then overflowed at this time similar to year 2038 problem see also lunar crater
