witchcraft punishable by death patrick stewart 2nd earl of orkney known as black patie had control of orkney in 1594 at time of balfour s trial patie was convinced that his younger brothers especially john stewart earl of carrick were plotting to kill him patie discovered poison in possession of one of john s servants thomas paplay who after being tortured for eleven days confessed and implicated

extracted balfour was tried found guilty of witchcraft and sentenced to death just as paplay had done balfour retracted her confession immediately before her execution on 16 december 1594 publicly proclaiming her innocence and detailing tortures carried out on her and members of her family she was executed at gallow ha in kirkwall on 16 december 1594 background islanders of orkney had a long tradition of belief in broadly construed forms of witchcraft sorcery and supernatural creatures magical powers were accepted as part of general lifestyle and were not questioned witch hunts in scotland began in about 1550 parliament of mary queen of scots passed scottish witchcraft act in 1563 making witchcraft convictions subject to capital punishment although orkney archipelago was officially under norwegian law until 1611 it had been held by scotland from 1468 under rule of scottish earls patrick stewart 2nd earl of orkney known as black patie had control of islands in 1594 at time of first witch trials stewart family had a lot of ill feeling towards each other patie had an acrimonious relationship with his father and showed a particular animosity towards his younger brothers especially john stewart earl of carrick whom patie was convinced intended to have him murdered he had found thomas paplay john s servant with poison paplay was tortured for eleven days until he confessed naming allison balfour among conspirators he retracted his confession just before his execution only sparse information is available on witch trials in orkney before 1612 but details of balfour s conviction have been described by academic historian julian goodare as one of scotland s most frequently cited witchcraft cases balfour lived in an area of stenness known as ireland with her aged spouse taillifeir and her children a natural healer of some repute she had been asked for advice on how best to cast a spell on black patie by his brothers and their friends who were plotting to kill him first of several alleged consultations took place in october 1593 outcomes of which are unknown but black patie suffered no apparent ill effects nevertheless balfour was arrested and transported to kirkwall to be tried in december 1594 case was unusual as it was instigated purely on authority of patie whereas most scottish witch trials required a commission of justiciary most witch trials were held in st magnus cathedral where prisoners may also have been incarcerated but balfour was held in kirkwall castle orcadian historian ernest marwick speculates that torture may have taken place in cathedral balfour was interrogated for two days by henry colville of a minister and close friend of patie torture colville was attempting to gain sufficient evidence from balfour to enable patie to take action against his brother john stewart earl of carrick she was subjected to brutal torture for a period of forty eight hours with colville assuming roles of interrogator and spiritual comforter her legs were enclosed in a contraption called a device made of iron that could be heated by a furnace until victim s flesh started to burn when she lost consciousness as she did several times device was removed until she could be roused and torture resumed as balfour continued to protest her innocence colville turned his attention to her husband her son and her seven year old daughter taillifeir her husband was tortured in front of her by use of lang irons although it is unclear exactly what type of device this was marwick describes them as being fetters but historian sigurd characterises them as a method of pressing by placing of stones on victims body when balfour still would not confess she was forced to watch her son having his legs put into an iron boot device which stretched from his knee to his ankle was struck fifty seven times with a large hammer boots inflict severe crushing and mutilation to flesh and bones balfour reached her breaking point when colville tortured her daughter he placed young girl s hands in also called pulverising child s fingers colville assured balfour that she would not be executed if she confessed she relented and finally colville secured enough of an admission of guilt for court to be able to sentence her execution and aftermath despite colville s pledge balfour was found guilty of conspiring to murder by use of witchcraft and was sentenced to be strangled and burned on 16 december 1594 balfour was taken to gallow ha in kirkwall to be executed before strangulation she was required to make a declaration in front of gathered crowd and five ministers including colville for notary public instead she proclaimed her innocence and detailed tortures carried out against her and her family immediately prior to balfour s sentence being enacted attempts were made to have her implicate laird of stenhouse patrick bellenden in conspiracy by questioning her about a piece of wax he had given her it had been retrieved from her purse when she was arrested and her inquisitors considered it was to make an effigy she denied their claims stating it was to produce a treatment for lady bellenden s colic long standing acrimony between patie and his brothers continued unabated on 24 june 1596 john stewart earl of carrick was accused at justiciary court in edinburgh of scheming with balfour to poison his brother patie john stewart defended himself by asserting that confession should be ignored as it was retracted and had only been obtained under torture he was found not guilty colville had continued to support patie and during 1595 was appointed patie s depute three weeks after john stewart s acquittal colville was attending to business on patie s behalf at nesting in shetland stewart together with a group of his friends who for a variety of reasons also despised colville sailed from montrose to shetland replenishing supplies en route at orkney they landed on shetland at tingwall and made their way overland to where colville was staying it is uncertain which member of group and slew him in july 1596 but on 14 october that year stewart was tried for murder and once again acquitted
