revolution pcusa was organized in philadelphia to provide national leadership for presbyterians in new nation in 1861 presbyterians in southern united states split from denomination because of disputes over slavery politics and theology precipitated by american civil war they established presbyterian church in united states often simply referred to as southern presbyterian church due to its regional identification pcusa was commonly described as northern presbyterian church despite pcusa s designation as a northern church it was once again a national denomination in its later years over time traditional calvinism played less of a role in shaping church s doctrines and practices it was influenced by arminianism and revivalism early in 19th century liberal theology late in 19th century and neo orthodoxy by mid 20th century theological tensions within denomination were played out in fundamentalist modernist controversy of 1920s and 1930s a conflict that led to development of

synods in 1706 seven ministers led by francis established first presbytery in north america presbytery of philadelphia presbytery was primarily created to promote fellowship and discipline among its members and only gradually developed into a governing body initially member congregations were located in new jersey pennsylvania delaware and maryland further growth led to creation of synod of philadelphia known as general synod in 1717 synod s membership consisted of all ministers and one lay elder from every congregation synod still had no official confessional statement church of scotland and irish synod of ulster already required clergy to subscribe to westminster confession in 1729 synod passed adopting act which required clergy to assent to westminster confession and larger and shorter catechisms however subscription was only required for those parts of confession deemed an essential and necessary article of faith ministers could declare any scruples to their presbytery or synod which would then decide if minister s views were acceptable while crafted as a compromise adopting act was opposed by those who favored strict adherence to confession old side new side controversy 1730 1758 during 1730s and 1740s presbyterian church was divided over impact of first great awakening drawing from scotch irish revivalist tradition evangelical ministers such as william and gilbert tennent emphasized necessity of a conscious conversion experience and need for higher moral standards among clergy other presbyterians were concerned that revivalism presented a threat to church order in particular practice of itinerant preaching across presbytery boundaries and tendency of revivalists to doubt conversion experiences of other ministers caused controversy between supporters of revivalism known as new side and their conservative opponents known as old side while old side and new side disagreed over possibility of immediate assurance of salvation controversy was not primarily theological both sides believed in justification by faith predestination and that regeneration occurred in stages in 1738 synod moved to restrict itinerant preaching and to tighten educational requirements for ministers actions new side resented tensions between two sides continued to escalate until synod of may 1741 which ended with a definite split between two factions old side retained control of synod of philadelphia and it immediately required unconditional subscription to westminster confession with no option to state scruples new side founded synod of new york new

for founding princeton university originally college of new jersey primarily to train ministers in 1746 by 1758 both sides were ready for reconciliation over years new side revivalism had become less

1789 in early 1770s american presbyterians were initially reluctant to support american independence but in time many presbyterians came to support revolutionary war after battles of lexington and concord synod of new york and philadelphia published a letter in may 1775 urging presbyterians to support second continental congress while remaining loyal to george iii in one sermon john witherspoon president of princeton preached that cause in which america is now in arms is cause of justice of liberty and of human nature witherspoon and 11 other presbyterians were signatories to declaration of independence after war many presbyterian leaders felt need to adopt a new organizational structure synod of new york and philadelphia was intended to be an annual gathering of members of all presbyteries and one elder from every congregation over half members however were frequently absent due to long travel distances and this prevented synod from functioning effectively in 1785 a proposal for creation of a general assembly went before synod yet convening of one was delayed due to necessity of having to write a constitution a constitution which officers could not initially agree upon in 1788 synod adopted a constitution modeled on church of scotland in which power was centralized in general assembly constitution also included provisions of church of scotland s barrier act of 1697 which required general assembly to receive approval of a majority of presbyteries before making major changes to church s constitution and doctrine constitution included westminster

adequate visitation and preaching for frontier congregations along with eliminating rivalry between two denominations large growth rate of presbyterian church in northeast was in part due to adoption of congregationalist settlers along western frontier not unlike circuit riders in episcopal and methodist traditions presbyteries often sent out licentiates to minister in multiple congregations that

native americans and inhabitants of central and south america these denominations also established a united domestic missionary society to station missionaries within united states in 1826

was one such revival that first grew out of meetings led by presbyterian minister james most famous camp meeting of second great awakening cane ridge revival in kentucky occurred during a traditional scottish communion season under leadership of local presbyterian minister barton w stone over 10 thousand people came to cane ridge to hear sermons from presbyterian as well as methodist and baptist preachers like first great awakening presbyterian ministers were divided over their assessment of fruits of new wave of revivals many pointed to excesses displayed by some participants as signs that revivals were theologically compromised such as groans laughter convulsions and jerks see religious ecstasy holy laughter and slain in spirit there was also concern over tendency of revivalist ministers to advocate free will teaching of arminianism thereby rejecting calvinist doctrines of predestination facing charges of heresy for their arminian beliefs presbyterian ministers richard and john thompson along with barton w stone and two other ministers chose to withdraw from kentucky synod and form independent springfield presbytery in 1803 these ministers would later dissolve springfield presbytery and become founders of american restoration movement from which christian church disciples of christ and churches of christ denominations originate meanwhile cumberland presbytery also within kentucky synod faced a shortage of ministers and decided to license clergy candidates who were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to westminster confession in 1805 synod suspended many of these ministers even bringing heresy charges against a number of them and by 1806 synod had dissolved presbytery in 1810 ministers dissatisfied with actions of synod formed cumberland presbyterian church cpc cpc subscribed to a modified form of westminster confession that rejected calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement church growth in northeast was also accompanied by revivalism while calmer and more reserved than those in south revivals of second great awakening transformed religion in northeast and they were often led by presbyterians and congregationalists plan of union led to spread of new england theology also known as new divinity and new haven theology originally conceived by congregationalists new england theology modified and softened traditional calvinism rejecting doctrine of imputation of adam s sin adopting governmental theory of atonement and embracing a greater emphasis on free will

three synods in new york and one synod in ohio along with 28 presbyteries 509 ministers and 60 thousand church members one fifth of pcusa s membership were excluded from church new school leaders reacted by meeting in auburn new york and issuing auburn declaration a 16 point defense of their calvinist orthodoxy when general assembly met in may 1838 at philadelphia new school commissioners

of philadelphia and new york had expressed moderate abolitionist sentiments in 1787 when it recommended that all its members use most prudent measures consistent with interests and state of civil society in countries where they live to procure eventually final abolition of slavery in america at same time presbyterians in south were content to reinforce status quo in their religious teaching such as in negro catechism written by north carolina presbyterian minister henry pattillo in pattillo s catechism slaves were taught that their roles in life had been ordained by god in 1795 general assembly ruled that slaveholding was not grounds for excommunication but also expressed support for eventual abolition of slavery later general assembly called slavery a gross violation of most precious and sacred rights of human nature as utterly inconsistent with law of god nevertheless in 1818 george bourne an abolitionist and presbyterian minister serving in virginia was defrocked by his southern presbytery in retaliation for his strong criticisms of christian slaveholders general assembly was increasingly reluctant to address issue preferring to take a moderate stance in debate but by 1830s tensions over slavery were increasing at same time church was dividing over old school new school controversy conflict between old school and new school factions merged with slavery controversy new school s enthusiasm for moral reform and voluntary societies was evident in its increasing identification with abolitionist movement old school however was convinced that general assembly and larger church should not legislate on moral issues that were not explicitly addressed in bible this effectively drove majority of southern presbyterians to support old school faction first definitive split over slavery occurred within new school presbyterian church in 1858 southern synods and presbyteries belonging to new school withdrew and established pro slavery united synod of

social services to union soldiers during civil war furthermore both schools boldly proclaimed righteousness of union cause and engaged in speculation about role of a newly restored america in ushering in millennium this was in effect old school s repudiation of its teaching against involving church in political affairs a majority of old school leaders in north were convinced of orthodoxy of new school some within old school chiefly princeton theologian charles hodge claimed that there were still ministers within new school who adhered to new haven theology nevertheless old and new school

strauss began questioning long held assumptions about bible at forefront of controversy in pcusa was charles a briggs a professor at pcusa s union theological seminary in new york while briggs held to traditional christian teaching in many areas such as his belief in virgin birth of jesus conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs that had to change over time he did not believe that pentateuch was authored by moses or that book of isaiah had a single author in addition he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of future in 1891 briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed bible contained errors a position many in church considered contrary to westminster confession s doctrines of verbal inspiration and biblical inerrancy in response 63 presbyteries petitioned general assembly to take action against briggs 1891 general assembly vetoed his appointment to union theological seminary s chair of biblical studies and two years later briggs was found guilty of heresy and suspended from ministry ultimately union theological seminary refused to remove briggs from his position and severed its ties to presbyterian church in 1892 conservatives in general assembly were successful in adopting portland deliverance a statement named for assembly s meeting place portland oregon deliverance reasserted church s belief in biblical inerrancy and required any minister who could not affirm bible as only infallible rule of faith and practice to withdraw from presbyterian ministry portland deliverance would be used to convict briggs

general assembly in 1903 two chapters on holy spirit and love of god and missions were added to confession and a reference to pope being anti christ was deleted most objectionable to conservatives a new declaratory statement was added to clarify church s doctrine of election conservatives criticized declaratory statement and claimed that it promoted arminianism 1903 revision of westminster confession eventually led a large number of congregations from arminian leaning cumberland presbyterian church to reunite with pcusa in 1906 while overwhelmingly approved reunion caused controversy within pcusa due to concerns over doctrinal compatibility and racial segregation in cumberland presbyterian church warfield was a strong critic of merger on doctrinal grounds northern presbyterians such as francis james grimke and herrick johnson objected to creation of racially segregated presbyteries in south a concession demanded by cumberland presbyterians as price for reunion despite these objections merger was overwhelmingly approved social gospel and evangelical movements thumb 185px henry sloane coffin on cover of time magazine november 15 1926 by early 20th century social gospel

and briggs heresy trial of 1893 in 1909 conflict was further exacerbated when presbytery of new york granted licenses to preach to a group of men who could not affirm virgin birth of jesus presbytery s action was appealed to 1910 general assembly which then required all ministry candidates to affirm five essential or fundamental tenets of christian faith biblical inerrancy virgin birth substitutionary atonement bodily resurrection and miracles of christ these themes were later expounded upon in fundamentals a series of essays financed by wealthy presbyterians milton and lyman stewart while authors were drawn from wider evangelical community a large proportion were presbyterian including warfield william erdman charles erdman and robert elliott speer in 1922 prominent new york minister harry emerson fosdick who was baptist but serving as pastor of new york s first presbyterian church by special arrangement preached a sermon entitled shall fundamentalists win challenging what he perceived to be a rising tide of intolerance against liberal or modernist theology within denomination in response conservative presbyterian minister clarence e macartney preached a sermon called shall unbelief win in which he warned that liberalism would lead to a christianity without worship without god and without jesus christ j gresham machen of princeton theological seminary also responded to fosdick with his 1923 book christianity and liberalism arguing that liberalism and christianity were two different religions 1923 general assembly reaffirmed five fundamentals and ordered presbytery of new york to ensure that first presbyterian church conformed to westminster confession a month later presbytery licensed two ministers who could not affirm virgin birth and in february 1924 it acquitted fosdick who subsequently left his post in presbyterian church that same year a group of liberal ministers composed a statement defending their theological views known as auburn affirmation due to fact that it was based on work of robert hastings nichols of auburn seminary citing adopting act of 1729 affirmation claimed for pcusa a heritage of doctrinal liberty it also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of general assembly and a majority of presbyteries therefore according to affirmation general assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to five fundamentals 1925 general assembly faced threat of schism over actions of presbytery of new york attempting to situation general assembly

his colleagues founded westminster theological seminary further controversy would erupt over state of church s missionary efforts sensing a loss of interest and support for foreign missions nondenominational laymen s foreign mission inquiry published re thinking missions a laymen s inquiry after one hundred years in 1932 which promoted universalism and rejected uniqueness of christianity because inquiry had been initially supported by pcusa many conservatives were concerned that re thinking missions represented views of pcusa s board of foreign missions even after board members affirmed their belief in jesus christ as only lord and saviour some conservatives remained skeptical and such fears were reinforced by modernist missionaries including celebrated author pearl s buck while initially evangelical buck s religious views developed over time to deny divinity of christ in 1933 machen and other conservatives founded independent board for presbyterian foreign missions a year later general assembly declared independent board unconstitutional and demanded that all church members cut ties with it machen refused to obey and his ordination was suspended in 1936 afterwards

were seen as failings of liberalism namely an overemphasis on divine immanence and goodness of humanity along with subordination of american protestantism to secularism science and american culture neo orthodox theologians instead emphasized divine transcendence and sinfulness of humanity from 1940s into 1950s neo orthodoxy set tone at presbyterian seminaries prominent presbyterian theologians of this era include elmer george and joseph at same time evangelicalism was continuing to influence presbyterian church in late 1940s efforts of christian educator henrietta mears at first

denomination was formed by 1858 union of covenanter and seceder presbyterians between 1937 and 1955 pcusa had been discussing merger negotiations with upcna presbyterian church in united states and even episcopal church before settling on upcna merger within upcna there was decreasing support for merger amidst conservative reservations over pcusa s decision to ordain women to office of minister

presbyterian church as a calvinist church presbyterian church in usa shared a common theological heritage with other presbyterian and reformed churches bible was considered only infallible source of doctrine and practice presbyterian church also acknowledged several subordinate standards most important being westminster confession of faith as part of their ordination vows ministers and other church officers were required to sincerely receive and adopt confession of faith of this church as containing system of doctrine taught in holy scriptures in addition to confession of faith westminster shorter catechism and larger catechism were also used throughout denomination s existence a relatively uniform view of biblical authority and interpretation based on reformed scholasticism dominated presbyterian thought until 1930s in reaction to scientific revolution doctrine of biblical infallibility as found in confession of faith was transformed into biblical inerrancy idea that bible is without error in matters of science and history this approach to biblical interpretation was accompanied by scottish common sense realism which dominated princeton harvard and other american colleges in 18th and 19th centuries when applied to biblical interpretation common sense philosophy encouraged theologians to assume that people in all times and cultures thought in similar ways therefore it was believed that a modern interpreter could know mind of biblical writers regardless of differences in culture and context this form of biblical literalism was standard teaching in presbyterian colleges and seminaries rise of higher criticism in late 1800s posed a challenge to this dominant view by arguing that bible was composed of strands of material written by ancient near eastern people whose world view and manner of thought was formulated in language structures and cultural contexts very different from those of nineteenth century americans a division emerged between a majority who held that inerrancy was an essential doctrine and a growing minority that believed it actually undermined scriptural authority for faith and life beginning in 1892 general assembly sought to combat liberal theology by specifying beliefs that every minister should affirm from 1910 to 1927 confession of faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs biblical inerrancy virgin birth substitutionary atonement bodily resurrection and miracles of christ faced with possible schism general assembly opted for theological decentralization after 1927 it was determined that general assembly could not define essential beliefs without first amending church s constitution which allowed a greater degree of toleration for alternative interpretations of confession outcome of fundamentalist modernist controversy was that church ultimately accepted moderate liberalism in order to maintain peace just as liberal theology was gaining acceptance in 1930s however a new theological movement emerged as some liberals became disenchanted with optimism of their tradition in face of world war i great depression and rise of european fascism neo orthodox looked back to bible and protestant reformers of 16th century in order to construct a more sturdy theology able to address crisis of western culture unlike liberals who tended to view bible as a record of humanity s evolving religious consciousness neo orthodox understood bible to be instrument through which god spoke and revealed himself in person of jesus christ to humanity at same time neo orthodoxy was distinguished from fundamentalism in its acceptance of biblical criticism and rejection of biblical inerrancy while bible was an adequate witness to one revelation of god jesus christ it was a fallible document written by fallible men neo orthodoxy was also characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence renewed affirmation of total depravity and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within church by 1940s neo orthodoxy and closely related biblical theology movement had become unifying doctrinal consensus within pcusa
