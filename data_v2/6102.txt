red billed quelea quelea random house webster s unabridged dictionary quelea quelea also known as red billed weaver or red billed dioch is a small approximately long and weighing migratory sparrow like bird of weaver family ploceidae native to sub saharan africa it was named by linnaeus in 1758 who considered it a bunting but ludwig reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to new genus quelea three subspecies are recognised with quelea quelea quelea occurring roughly from senegal to chad q q aethiopica from sudan to somalia and tanzania and q q lathamii from gabon to mozambique and south africa non breeding birds have light underparts striped brown upper parts yellow edged flight feathers and a reddish bill breeding females attain a yellowish bill breeding males have a black or rarely white facial mask surrounded by a purplish pinkish rusty or yellowish wash on head and breast species avoids forests deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern south africa it constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches sugar cane or reeds it breeds in very large colonies it feeds primarily on seeds of annual grasses but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops therefore it is sometimes called africa s feathered locust usual pest control measures are spraying or detonating fire bombs in enormous colonies during night extensive control measures have been largely unsuccessful in limiting quelea population when food runs out species migrates to locations of recent rainfall and plentiful grass seed hence it exploits its food source very efficiently it is regarded as most numerous undomesticated bird on earth with total post breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1 5 billion individuals it feeds in huge flocks of millions of individuals with birds that run out of food at rear flying over entire group to a fresh feeding zone at front creating an image of a rolling cloud conservation status of red billed quelea is least concern according to iucn red list taxonomy and naming thumb left etching by george edwards published in red billed quelea was one of many birds described originally by linnaeus in landmark 1758 10th edition of his systema naturae classifying it in bunting genus emberiza he gave it binomial name of emberiza quelea he incorrectly mentioned that it originated in india probably because ships from east indies picked up birds when visiting african coast during their return voyage to europe it is likely that he had seen a draft of sive synopsis methodica avium in ordines genera species a book written by mathurin jacques brisson that was to be published in 1760 and which contained a black and white drawing of species erroneous type locality of india was corrected to africa in 12th edition of systema naturae of 1766 and brisson was cited brisson mentions that bird originates from senegal where it had been collected by michel adanson during his 1748 1752 expedition he called bird a bec rouge du senegal in french and passer in latin both meaning red billed senegalese sparrow also in 1766 george edwards illustrated species in colour based on a live male specimen owned by a mrs clayton in surrey he called it brazilian sparrow despite being unsure whether it came from brazil or angola in 1850 ludwig reichenbach thought species was not a true bunting but rather a weaver and created genus name quelea as well as new combination q quelea white faced morph was described as a separate species q three subspecies are recognised in field these are distinguished by differences in male breeding plumage nominate subspecies quelea quelea quelea is native to west and central africa where it has been recorded from mauritania western and northern senegal gambia central mali burkina faso southwestern and southern niger northern nigeria cameroon south central chad and northern central african republic loxia lathamii was described by andrew smith in 1836 but later assigned to q quelea as its subspecies lathamii it ranges across central and southern africa where it has been recorded from southwestern gabon southern congo angola except northeast and arid coastal southwest southern democratic republic of congo and mouth of congo river zambia malawi and western mozambique across to namibia except coastal desert and central southern and eastern south africa ploceus aethiopicus was described by carl jakob sundevall in 1850 but later assigned to q quelea as its subspecies aethiopica it is found in eastern africa where it occurs in southern sudan eastern south sudan ethiopia and eritrea south to northeastern parts of democratic republic of congo uganda kenya central and eastern tanzania and northwestern and southern somalia formerly two other subspecies have been described q quelea was described by phillip clancey in 1960 on basis of more greyish nonbreeding plumage of populations of wetter habitats of northeastern south africa swaziland and southern mozambique however further analysis indicated no clear distinction in plumage between it and q quelea lathamii with no evidence of genetic isolation hence it is not recognised as distinct q quelea intermedia described by anton reichenow in 1886 from east africa is regarded a synonym of subspecies aethiopica etymology and vernacular names linnaeus himself did not explain name quelea quelea quelea is locally called domo in swahili in in shona in in and in tsonga language m w jeffreys suggested that term came from medieval latin meaning quail linking prodigious numbers of queleas to hordes of quail that fed israelites during exodus from egypt subspecies lathamii is probably named in honor of ornithologist john latham name of subspecies aethiopica refers to ethiopia and its type was collected in neighbouring province in today s sudan red billed quelea has been designated official name by international ornithological committee ioc other names in english include black faced dioch cardinal common dioch latham s weaver bird pink billed weaver quelea finch quelea weaver red billed dioch red billed weaver russ weaver south african dioch sudan dioch and uganda dioch phylogeny based on recent dna analysis red billed quelea is sister group of a clade that contains both other remaining species of genus quelea namely cardinal quelea q and red headed quelea q genus belongs to group of true weavers subfamily ploceinae and is most closely related to foudia a genus of six or seven species that occur on islands of western indian ocean these two genera are in turn sister clade to asian species of genus ploceus following tree represents current insight of relationships between species of quelea and their closest relatives interbreeding between red billed and red headed queleas has been observed in captivity description red billed quelea is a small sparrow like bird approximately long and weighing with a heavy cone shaped bill which is red in females outside breeding season and males or orange to yellow females during breeding season over 75 of males have a black facial mask comprising a black forehead cheeks lores and higher parts of throat occasionally males have a white mask mask is surrounded by a variable band of yellow rusty pink or purple white masks are sometimes bordered by black this colouring may only reach lower throat or extend along belly with rest of underparts light brown or whitish with some dark stripes upperparts have light and dark brown longitudinal stripes particularly at and are paler on rump tail and upper wing are dark brown flight feathers are edged greenish or yellow eye has a narrow naked red ring and a brown iris legs are orangey in colour bill is bright raspberry red outside breeding season male lacks bright colours it has a grey brown head with dark streaks whitish chin and throat and a faint light stripe above eyes at this time bill becomes pink or dull red and legs turn flesh coloured females resemble males in non breeding plumage but have a yellow or orangey bill and eye ring during breeding season at other times female bill is pink or dull red newborns have white bills and are almost naked with some wisps of down on top of head and shoulders eyes open during fourth day at same time as first feathers appear older nestlings have a horn coloured bill with a hint of lavender though it turns orange purple before post juvenile moult young birds change feathers two to three months after hatching after which plumage resembles that of non breeding adults although head is grey cheeks whitish and wing coverts and flight feathers have buff margins at an age of about five months they moult again and their plumage starts to look like that of breeding adults with a pinkish purple bill different subspecies are distinguished by different colour patterns of male breeding plumage in typical subspecies q quelea quelea breeding males have a buff crown nape and underparts and black mask extends high up forehead in q quelea lathamii mask also extends high up forehead but underparts are mainly white in q quelea aethiopica mask does not extend far above bill and underparts may have a pink wash there is much variability within subspecies and some birds cannot be ascribed to a subspecies based on outward appearance alone because of interbreeding specimens intermediate between subspecies may occur where ranges of subspecies overlap such as at lake chad female pin tailed whydah could be mistaken for red billed quelea in non breeding plumage since both are sparrow like birds with conical red coloured bills but whydah has a whitish brow between a black stripe through eye and a black stripe above sound flying flocks make a distinct sound due to many wing beats after arriving at roost or nest site birds keep moving around and make a lot of noise for about half an hour before settling in both males and females call male sings in short bursts starting with some chatter followed by a warbling tweedle toodle tweedle distribution and habitat red billed quelea is mostly found in tropical and subtropical areas with a seasonal semi arid climate resulting in dry grassland including sahel and its distribution covers most of sub saharan africa it avoids forests however including miombo woodlands and rain forests such as those in central africa and is generally absent from western parts of south africa and arid coastal regions of namibia and angola it was introduced to island of reunion in 2000 occasionally it can be found as high as above sea level but mostly resides below it visits agricultural areas where it feeds on cereal crops although it is thought to prefer seeds of wild annual grasses it needs to drink daily and can only be found within about distance of nearest body of water it is found in wet habitats congregating at shores of waterbodies such as lake during flooding it needs shrubs reeds or trees to nest and roost red billed queleas migrate seasonally over long distances in anticipation of availability of their main natural food source seeds of annual grasses presence of these grass seeds is result of beginning of rains weeks earlier and rainfall varies in a seasonal geographic pattern temporarily wet areas do not form a single zone that periodically moves back and forth across entirety of sub saharan africa but rather consist of five or six regions within which wet areas move or jump red billed quelea populations thus migrate between temporarily wet areas within each of these five to six geographical regions each of subspecies as distinguished by different male breeding plumage is confined to one or more of these geographical regions in nigeria nominate subspecies generally travels southwards during start of rains in north during june and july when grass seed germinates and is no longer eaten by queleas when they reach river valley for instance rainy season has already passed and grass has produced new seeds after about six weeks birds migrate northwards to find a suitable breeding area nurture a generation and then repeat this sequence moving further north some populations may also move northwards when rains have started to eat remaining seeds in senegal migration is probably between southeast and northwest in eastern africa subspecies aethiopica is thought to consist of two sub populations one moves from central tanzania to southern somalia to return to breed in tanzania in february and march followed by successive migrations to breed ever further north season s last usually occurring in central kenya during may second group moves from northern and central sudan and central ethiopia in may and june to breed in southern sudan south sudan southern ethiopia and northern kenya moving back north from august to october in southern africa total population of subspecies q quelea lathamii in october converges on zimbabwean highveld in november part of population migrates to northwest to northwestern angola while remainder migrates to southeast to southern mozambique and eastern south africa but no proof has been found that these migration cohorts are genetically or morphologically divergent ecology and behaviour red billed quelea is regarded as most numerous undomesticated bird on earth with total post breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1 1 2 billion individuals species is specialised on feeding on seeds of annual grass species which may be ripe or still green but have not germinated yet since availability of these seeds varies with time and space occurring in particular weeks after local off set of rains queleas migrate as a strategy to ensure year round food availability consumption of a lot of food with a high energy content is needed for queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas when breeding it selects areas such as lowveld with thorny or spiny vegetation typically acacia species below elevation while foraging for food they may fly each day and return to roosting or nesting site in evening small groups of red billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds ploceus and bishops euplectes and in western africa they may join sudan golden sparrow passer luteus and various estrildids red billed queleas may also roost together with weavers estrildids and barn swallows their life expectancy is two to three years in wild but one captive bird lived for eighteen years breeding thumb left two males of subsp lathamii at their nest site red billed quelea needs of precipitation to breed with nest building usually commencing four to nine weeks after onset of rains nests are usually built in stands of thorny trees such as umbrella thorn acacia blackthorn mellifera and cinerea but sometimes in sugar cane fields or reeds colonies can consist of millions of nests in densities of 30 000 per ha 12 000 per acre over 6000 nests in a single tree have been counted at in zimbabwe one colony was long and wide in southern africa suitable branches are stripped of leaves a few days in advance of offset of nest construction male starts nest by creating a ring of grass by twining strips around both branches of a hanging forked twig and from there bridging gaps in circle his beak can reach having one foot on each of branchlets using same footholds and same orientation throughout building process two parallel stems of reeds or sugar cane can also be used to attach nest from they use both their bills and feet in adding initial knots needed as soon as ring is finished male displays trying to attract a female after which nest may be completed in two days nest chamber is created in front of ring entrance may be constructed after egg laying has started while male works from outside a finished nest looks like a small oval or globular ball of grass around 18 cm 7 in high and 16 cm 6 in wide with a 2 5 cm 1 in wide entrance high up one side sheltered by a shallow awning about six to seven hundred fresh green grass strips are used for each nest this species may nest several times per year when conditions are favourable in breeding season males are diversely coloured these differences in plumage do not signal condition probably serving instead for recognition of individual birds however intensity of red on bills is regarded an indicator of animal s quality and social dominance red billed quelea males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle there are usually three eggs in each clutch though full range is one to five of approximately long and in diameter eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour sometimes with some dark spots some clutches contain six eggs but large clutches may be result of other females dumping an egg in a stranger s nest both sexes share incubation of eggs during day but female alone does so during cool night and feeds during day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain development of embryo breeding cycle of red billed quelea is one of shortest known in any bird incubation takes nine or ten days after chicks hatch they are fed for some days with protein rich insects later nestlings mainly get seeds young birds fledge after about two weeks in nest they are sexually mature in one year feeding thumb left resting in branches during of red billed queleas usually feed on ground with birds in rear constantly leap frogging those in front to exploit next strip of fallen seeds this behaviour creates impression of a rolling cloud and enables efficient exploitation of available food birds also take seeds from grass ears directly they prefer grains of in size red billed queleas feed mainly on seeds from a wide range of species including annual grasses of genera echinochloa panicum setaria sorghum and one survey at lake chad showed that two thirds of seeds eaten belonged to only three species african wild rice oryza barthii sorghum and jungle rice echinochloa colona when supply of these seeds runs out seeds of cereals such as barley teff sorghum sorghum bicolor manna setaria italica millet panicum rice oryza sativa wheat triticum oats avena as well as buckwheat and sunflower helianthus annuus are eaten on a large scale red billed queleas have also been observed feeding on crushed corn from cattle feedlots but entire maize kernels are too big for them to swallow a single bird may eat about in seeds each day as much as half of diet of nestlings consists of insects such as grasshoppers ants beetles bugs caterpillars flies and termites as well as snails and spiders insects are generally eaten during breeding season though winged termites are eaten at other times breeding females consume snail shell fragments and calcareous grit presumably to enable egg shell formation one colony in namibia of an estimated five million adults and five million chicks was calculated to consume roughly of insects and of grass seeds during its breeding cycle at sunrise they form flocks that co operate to find food after a successful search they settle to feed in heat of day they rest in shade preferably near water and preen birds seem to prefer drinking at least twice a day in evening they once again fly off in search of food predators and parasites thumb right flocking at a enemies of red billed quelea include other birds snakes warthogs squirrels galagos monkeys mongooses civets foxes jackals cats lions and leopards bird species preying on queleas included lanner falcon tawny eagle and marabou stork cuckoo is a brood parasite that probably lays eggs in nests of queleas some predators such as snakes raid nests and eat eggs and chicks nile crocodiles sometimes attack drinking queleas and an individual in ethiopia hit birds out of vegetation on bank into water with its tail subsequently eating them queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by african helmeted turtles in etosha among invertebrates that kill and eat youngsters are armoured bush cricket and scorpion internal parasites found in queleas include haemoproteus and plasmodium interactions with humans red billed quelea is caught and eaten in many parts of africa around lake chad three traditional methods are used to catch red billed queleas trappers belonging to tribe use triangular hand held nets which are both selective and efficient each team of six trappers caught about twenty thousand birds each night an estimated five to ten million queleas are trapped near n djamena each year representing a market value of approximately us 37 500 75 000 between 13 june and 21 august 1994 alone 1 2 million queleas were caught birds were taken from roosts in trees during moonless period each night feathers were plucked and carcasses fried following morning dried in sun and transported to city to be sold on market sara people use standing fishing nets with a very fine mesh while masa and fishermen cast nets over groups of birds impact of hunting on quelea population about 200 million individuals in lake chad basin is deemed insignificant woven traps made from star grass cynodon are used to catch hundreds of these birds daily in district tanzania guano is collected from under large roosts in nigeria and used as a fertiliser tourists like to watch large flocks of queleas such as during visits of kruger national park birds themselves eat pest insects such as migratory locusts and moth species helicoverpa armigera and animal s large distribution and population resulted in a conservation status listed as least concern on iucn red list aviculture red billed quelea is sometimes kept and bred in captivity by hobbyists it thrives if kept in large and high cages with space to fly to minimise risk of obesity a sociable bird red billed quelea tolerates mixed species aviaries keeping many individuals mimics its natural occurrence in large flocks this species withstands frosts but requires shelter from rain and wind affixing hanging branches such as hawthorn in cage facilitates nesting adults are typically given a diet of tropical seeds enriched with grass seeds augmented by living insects such as mealworms spiders or boiled shredded egg during breeding season fine stone grit and calcium sources such as shell grit and provide nutrients as well if provided with material like fresh grass or coconut fibre they can be bred pest management sometimes called africa s feathered locust red billed quelea is considered a serious agricultural pest in sub saharan africa in particular they eat wheat in dry season rice in early rainy season and sorghum millet in rainy season an individual red billed quelea eats around of grain in a day hence a flock of 2 million individuals not an unusual size can consume of grain in a day or in a month their wide range enormous population and fecundity make control difficult traditional methods to protect crops are mainly used in subsistence farming when crop is vulnerable people go into fields making noise utilising a range of techniques from yelling to banging tins small stones or bits of dry mud are aimed at birds using catapults one person can protect about one hectare 2 1 2 acre but this method is highly labour intensive because birds are active from dawn to dusk and crops may need protection for an entire month scarecrows are also effective though only if moved every two days to avoid birds getting used to them in large scale farms growing cash crops firecrackers exploders or other automated noisemaking devices are used firing as often as every five minutes during daylight hours governments of botswana ethiopia kenya south africa sudan tanzania and zimbabwe have regularly made attempts to lessen quelea populations most common method to kill members of problematic flocks was by spraying organophosphate from air on breeding colonies and roosts in botswana and zimbabwe spraying was also executed from ground vehicles and manually kenya and south africa regularly used fire bombs attempts during 1950s and 60s to eradicate populations at least regionally failed consequently management is at present directed at removing those congregations that are likely to attack vulnerable fields references external links category agricultural pests red billed quelea category birds of sub saharan africa red billed quelea
