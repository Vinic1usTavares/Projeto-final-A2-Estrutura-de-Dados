authorized construction of 30 new light cruisers by 1904 herwig p 42 s filled requirements for first ten vessels design for bremen class was an improved version of preceding gazelle class improvements chiefly being in size and speed to accommodate more powerful propulsion system a third funnel was added armored deck was also thickened significantly fourth ship of class lubeck was fitted with steam turbines so quality of turbine engines could be compared with otherwise identical vessels gardiner p 259 bremen class was followed by which was very similar to bremens including same armament and like bremens one ship of class was equipped with turbine engines while rest had traditional triple expansion engine gardiner gray p 157 bremen class marked a change in german cruiser naming conventions

watertight compartments hulls also had a double bottom that ran for 56 percent of length of hull groner p 102 all seven ships were good sea boats but they were crank and rolled up to twenty degrees they were also very wet at high speeds and suffered from a slight weather helm nevertheless ships turned tightly and were very maneuverable in a hard turn their speed fell up to 35 percent they had a transverse metacentric height of ships had a standard crew of fourteen officers and between 274 and 287 enlisted men though later in their careers these figures increased to 19 and 330 respectively bremen class ships carried a number of smaller boats including one picket boat one pinnace two cutters two yawls and one dinghy groner p 103 machinery with exception of lubeck ships propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines designed to give for a top speed of lubeck was instead fitted with a pair of parsons steam turbines rated at and a top speed of though all seven ships exceeded these speeds on trials all seven ships had ten coal fired marine type water tube boilers which were trunked into three funnels amidships ships carried up to of coal which gave first three ships a range of at less efficient turbine engines cut her cruising radius to while last three ships of class had a longer range at groner pp 102 103 bremen and hamburg had three generators that produced a total output of 111 kilowatts at 110 volts rest of ships had two generators rated at 90 kilowatts at same voltage armament and armor thumb 10 5 cm gun without its gun shield on board bremen

with coal bunkers conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof ships guns were protected by 50 mm thick shields construction thumb berlin after her modernization in 1921 1923 seven ships of bremen
