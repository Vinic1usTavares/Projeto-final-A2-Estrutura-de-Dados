comprehensive limitation pact signed by two superpowers and anti ballistic missile treaty which banned development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at kremlin nixon and kissinger planned to link arms control to detente and to resolution of other urgent problems through what nixon called linkage david tal argues linkage between strategic arms limitations and outstanding issues such as middle east berlin and foremost vietnam thus became central to nixon s and kissinger s policy of detente through employment of linkage they hoped to change nature and course of u s foreign policy including u s nuclear disarmament and arms control policy and to separate them from those practiced by nixon s predecessors they also intended through linkage to make u s arms control policy part of detente his policy of linkage had in fact failed it failed mainly because it was based on flawed assumptions and false premises foremost of which was that soviet union wanted strategic arms limitation agreement much more than united states did david tal absolutes and stages in making and application of nixon s salt policy diplomatic history 37 5 2013 1090 1116 quoting pp 1091 1092 nixon himself later wrote w e decided to link progress in such areas of soviet concern as strategic arms limitation and increased trade with progress in areas that were important to mideast and berlin this concept became known as linkage seeking to foster better relations with united states china and soviet union both cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy during previous two years nixon had made

june 1974 as part of nixon doctrine u s avoided giving direct combat assistance to its allies and instead gave them assistance to defend themselves during nixon administration u s greatly increased arms sales to middle east particularly israel iran and saudi arabia nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in middle east but support was not unconditional nixon believed israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that united states should encourage it president believed that except during suez crisis u s had failed to intervene with israel and should use leverage of large u s military aid to israel to urge parties to negotiating table arab israeli conflict was not a major focus of nixon s attention during his first term for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelection on october 6 1973 an arab coalition led by egypt and syria supported with arms and materiel by soviet union attacked israel in yom kippur war israel suffered heavy losses and nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses cutting through inter departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations more than a week later by time u s and soviet union began negotiating a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis when israel gained upper hand egyptian president sadat requested a joint u s ussr peacekeeping mission which u s refused when soviet premier brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily nixon ordered u s military to placing all u s military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war this was closest that world had come to nuclear war since cuban missile crisis brezhnev backed down as a result of nixon s actions because israel s victory was largely due to u s support arab opec nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to u s resulting in 1973 oil crisis embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in united states in late 1973 and was eventually ended by oil producing nations as peace in middle east took hold after war and under nixon s presidency u s reestablished relations with egypt for first time since 1967 nixon used middle east crisis to restart stalled middle east peace negotiations he wrote in a confidential memo to kissinger on october 20 i believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in middle east i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by i now consider a permanent middle east settlement to be most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves tyler patrick 2010 p 161 nixon made

team owner bob short arms folded and baseball commissioner bowie kuhn hand on mouth can also be seen marine corps aide to president jack brennan sits in uniform behind nixon at time nixon took office in 1969 inflation was at 4 7 percent its highest rate since korean war great society had been enacted under johnson which together with vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits unemployment was low but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixon s major economic goal was to reduce inflation most obvious means of doing so was to end war this could not be accomplished overnight and u s economy continued to struggle through 1970 contributing to a lackluster republican performance in midterm congressional elections democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixon s presidency according to political economist nigel bowles in his 2011 study of nixon s economic record new president did little to alter johnson s policies through first year of his presidency nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection as part of his new federalism views he proposed grants to states but these proposals were for most part lost in congressional budget process however nixon gained political credit for advocating them in 1970 congress had granted president power to impose wage and price freezes though democratic majorities knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use authority with inflation unresolved by august 1971 and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed dollar to float against other currencies and ended convertibility of dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation s defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since one they favored was one they had designed but which president had appropriated for himself nixon s policies dampened inflation through 1972 although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into ford administration after nixon won re election inflation was returning he reimposed price controls in june 1973 price controls became unpopular with public and businesspeople who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to price board bureaucracy controls produced food shortages as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss despite failure to control inflation controls were slowly ended and on april 30 1974 their statutory authorization lapsed governmental initiatives and organization thumb president nixon delivers 1971 state of union address at u s capitol

states post office department which in 1971 became government run united states postal service nixon was a late supporter of conservation movement environmental policy had not been a significant issue in 1968 election and candidates were rarely asked for their views on subject nixon broke new ground by discussing environmental policy in his state of union speech in 1970 he saw that first earth day in april 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced formation of environmental protection agency epa he relied on his domestic advisor john ehrlichman who favored protection of natural resources to keep him out of trouble on environmental issues other initiatives supported by nixon included clean air act of 1970 and occupational safety and health administration osha and national environmental policy act required environmental impact statements for many federal projects nixon vetoed clean water act of 1972 objecting not to policy goals of legislation but to amount of money to be spent on them which he deemed excessive after congress overrode his veto nixon impounded funds he deemed unjustifiable in 1971 nixon proposed health insurance reform a private health insurance employer mandate federalization of medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children and support for health maintenance organizations a limited hmo bill was enacted in 1973 in 1974 nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of medicaid by state run health

facilities as one policy initiative nixon called for more money for sickle cell research treatment and education in february 1971 and signed national sickle cell anemia control act on may 16 1972 while nixon called for increased spending on such high profile items as sickle cell disease and for a war on cancer at same time he sought to reduce overall spending at national institutes of health civil rights nixon presidency witnessed first large scale integration of public schools in south nixon sought a middle way between segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites hopeful of doing well in south in 1972 he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then soon after his inauguration he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders both white and black to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september 1970 less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by 1971 however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use some scholars such as james morton turner and john isenberg believe that nixon who had advocated for civil rights in his 1960 campaign slowed down desegregation as president appealing to racial conservatism of southern whites who were angered by civil rights movement this he hoped would boost his election chances in 1972 in addition to desegregating public schools nixon implemented philadelphia plan in 1970 first significant federal affirmative action program he also endorsed equal rights amendment after it passed both houses of congress in 1972 and went to states for ratification he also pushed for african american civil rights and economic equity through a concept known as black capitalism nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in 1968 though feminists criticized him for doing little to help era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions

ambitious plans for establishment of a permanent base on moon by end of 1970s and launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as 1981 nixon rejected both proposals due to expense nixon also canceled air force manned orbital laboratory program in 1969 because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost effective way to achieve same reconnaissance objective nasa cancelled last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for design and construction of space shuttle on may 24 1972 nixon approved a five year cooperative program between nasa and soviet space program culminating in 1975 joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space reelection watergate scandal and resignation 1972 presidential

ambitions goldwater had won several southern states by opposing civil rights act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate southerners nixon s efforts to gain southern support in 1968 were diluted by wallace s candidacy through his first term he pursued a southern strategy with policies such as his desegregation plans that would be broadly acceptable among southern whites encouraging them to realign with republicans in aftermath of civil rights movement he nominated two southern conservatives clement and g harrold carswell to supreme court but neither was confirmed by senate nixon entered

abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate missouri senator thomas eagleton dumped from ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression nixon was ahead in most polls for entire
