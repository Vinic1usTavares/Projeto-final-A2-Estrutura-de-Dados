battle of rowton heath also known as battle of rowton moor occurred on 24 september 1645 during english civil war fought by parliamentarians commanded by sydnam poyntz and royalists under personal command of king charles i it was a significant defeat for royalists with heavy losses and charles prevented from relieving siege of chester prior to battle charles had been attempting to link up with marquess of montrose in scotland following royalist defeat in battle of naseby although his attempts to do so were unsuccessful they were disruptive enough that committee of both kingdoms ordered sydnam poyntz to pursue king with approximately 3 000 horse after charles was informed that chester his only remaining port was under siege he marched there with intent of relieving defenders ordering 3 000 horse under command of marmaduke langdale to camp outside city while he and 600 others travelled into chester itself on 23 september 1645 intent was to attack besieging parliamentarians from both sides charles mistakenly believing that poyntz had failed to follow them in fact he was barely behind and moved to attack langdale s force in early hours of 24 september although langdale drove poyntz off parliamentarians besieging chester sent reinforcements and langdale was forced to retreat to rowton heath closer to chester and wait for his own reinforcements this force under charles gerard and lord bernard stewart was prevented from joining them and langdale was instead attacked by both poyntz s force and reinforcement after being driven off field and failing in an attempt to regroup at chester itself royalists retreated as dusk fell royalist casualties were high with 600 killed including stewart and 900 taken prisoner this defeat prevented charles from relieving defenders in chester which fell to parliamentarians on 3 february 1646 charles instead withdrew with approximately 2 400 remaining cavalry most of whom were destroyed by poyntz s ambush at sherburn in elmet on 15 october 1645 background following destruction of king charles i s main army at battle of naseby on 14 june 1645 first english civil war tilted decisively in favour of parliamentarians charles withdrew with his remaining forces to raglan castle in wales hoping to recruit new soldiers there and travel across bristol channel to link up with george goring only remaining royalist commander of a significant force defeat of goring at battle of langport on 10 july along with subsequent disintegration of new troops in south wales led to charles abandoning this plan barratt 1994 p 3 despite this and loss of much of northern england following battle of marston moor charles still had large numbers of soldiers in west of england and one of his supporters marquess of montrose was winning a string of victories across scotland royalist force attempted to join up with montrose in scotland in early august charles took 2 500 soldiers and marched north being forced to turn back at doncaster due to advance of david leslie and 4 000 cavalry clark 2010 p 115 charles s troops then made a raid into eastern association getting as far as huntington and forcing parliamentarians besieging hereford to withdraw in response committee of both kingdoms ordered sydnam poyntz to pursue king evading poyntz s forces charles again marched north on 18 september taking 3 500 cavalry under william vaughan and lord charles gerrard as far as river wye at at this point a messenger arrived to inform charles that part of outworks of chester were betrayed to enemy forcing him to change his plans and march towards chester barratt 1994 p 4 chester had come under siege during december 1644 with a loose blockade or formed around town with bristol now fallen to parliamentarians chester was last port under royalist control and crucial due to its links with recruiting efforts in ireland and north wales clark 2010 p 117 on 20 september 1645 a force of 500 horse 200 dragoons and 700 foot under command of michael jones attacked royalist barricades barratt 1994 p 8 and with defenders completely taken by surprise they fell back to inner city on 22 september parliamentarian artillery began bombarding city and after breaching walls and having a summons to surrender refused by defenders parliamentarians attacked in two places both were repulsed in one case due to defenders counter attacking on foot and in other due to inadequate length of attacker s scaling ladders preventing them from climbing wall despite this success attacking parliamentarian forces grew in strength while defenders were weary as such arrival of charles and his force on 23 september was met with delight barratt 1994 p 12 battle thumb 250px rowton moor plan charles s force consisted of 3 500 horse organised into four brigades largest grouping being 1 200 soldiers of northern horse under sir marmaduke langdale in addition there was gerard s brigade consisting of 800 men who had served under him in south wales sir william vaughan s 1 000 strong brigade and 200 members of life guards charles s personal bodyguard under lord bernard stewart although experienced troops were depleted in number and had low morale due to recent string of defeats charles and gerard evaded loose parliamentarian siege around city taking 600 men into chester while approximately 3 000 remaining cavalry under langdale crossed river dee at holt and bivouacked at hatton heath five miles to south of chester itself plan was to trap besiegers between two forces destroying them or forcing them to retreat as they numbered only 500 cavalry and 1 500 foot this was considered to be relatively simple barratt 1994 p 13 royalist plan failed to take into account poyntz and his 3 000 cavalry evidently they assumed he had lost track of them this assumption was mistaken and as charles entered chester poyntz s soldiers arrived in whitchurch approximately 15 miles from chester after hearing about situation poyntz promised to advance in morning with a considerable body of horse which encouraged parliamentarians around chester to continue resisting one of his messengers was intercepted by sir richard lloyd however who immediately sent a message to charles and langdale after a brief council of war they resolved that gerard s force and lifeguards along with 500 foot would advance to either join with langdale or prevent colonel jones s forces linking up with poyntz barratt 1994 pp 14 15 charles would remain in chester and watch ensuing battle from a tower in chester s defences later known as king charles tower pettifer 2002 p 15 hatton heath thumb left this 17th century building on side of a41 was used as a wound dressing station during battle langdale advanced northwards with 3 000 cavalry and at miller s heath on morning of 24 september he became aware of poyntz s force of 3 000 also moving north miller s heath was mainly made up of unenclosed heath traversed by whitchurch chester road which was surrounded by hedges langdale lined hedgerows with dragoons and dismounted troopers with carbines and due to inaccuracy of parliamentarian reconnaissance poyntz was unaware of langdale s presence until dragoons opened fire on his vanguard at approximately 7 00 am barratt 1994 p 15 as a result of poyntz s lack of preparation his force was strung out in a column because of boggy ground they could not easily dismount in addition poyntz had underestimated strength of royalists and tried attacking with those troops immediately available assuming they would be sufficient to charge and destroy enemy in this poyntz was mistaken due to entanglement of vanguard with royalist troops it was unable to make any significant progress and it took approximately half an hour of close quarters fighting in mouth of whitchurch chester road to force royalists back as parliamentarians deployed onto open ground to pursue royalists they were set on by a fresh group of troops and forced to repeat and with no reinforcements available poyntz retreated on parliamentarian side this skirmish led to deaths of 20 soldiers with a number of wounded and between 50 and 60 prisoners barratt 1994 p 17 royalists while losing fewer soldiers were now in a precarious position since reinforcements from chester were needed to follow up on success and defeat poyntz s force as such langdale sent lieutenant colonel jeffrey shakerley to report to charles requesting reinforcements shakerley arrived in chester and delivered his message after 15 minutes but no orders were issued for a further six hours after that barratt speculates that one reason could have been fatigue of royalist troops and another rivalries amongst royalist commanders gerard and digby opposed each other with other commanders disliking langdale and charles not being strong enough to stop disputes barratt 1994 pp 18 19 parliamentarians however did send support at approximately 2 00 pm chester forces dispatched 350 horse and 400 musketeers under colonels michael jones and john booth to reinforce poyntz rowton heath thumb upright phoenix tower on chester city walls where charles is said to have watched his army lose royalists in chester saw parliamentarian reinforcements under jones and booth advance and sent shakerley to warn langdale s force after receiving message langdale withdrew nearer to chester reforming at rowton heath an entirely open space at same time royalists in chester began to move with gerard advancing with 500 foot and 500 cavalry gerard hoped to attack jones s force from rear but parliamentarians responded by dispatching 200 cavalry and 200 infantry to prevent this with a shorter distance to travel this force met gerard on hoole heath and after a confused engagement in which lord bernard stewart was slain gerard s force was prevented from marching to langdale s aid instead jones and booth linked up with poyntz giving a combined parliamentarian force of 3 000 horse and 500 musketeers against a tired royalist army of approximately 2 500 horse at approximately 4 00 pm poyntz advanced covered by musketeers firing a full volley barratt 1994 p 20 despite langdale s attempt to counter charge royalists were soon outflanked with parliamentarian musketeers firing into rear of langdale s force royalists broke some escaping via holt bridge and others running towards chester on hoole heath these retreating soldiers met with part of gerard s force and made an initially successful counter attack before being forced back to walls of chester barratt 1994 p 21 there retreating cavalry choked up streets allowing parliamentarian musketeers to fire into confused mass of horsemen and leading to a rout kinross 1998 p 140 aftermath rowton heath has been called a major disaster for charles with casualties estimated at 600 dead and 900 injured including 50 members of life guard and lord bernard barratt 1994 p 22 parliamentarian losses were also heavy although unknown and battle did give chester some respite despite this charles withdrew next day with remaining 2 400 horse clark 2010 p 118 heading to denbigh castle before moving on to newark on trent carlton 1984 p 295 with this retreat chester was left without additional support and surrendered to parliamentarians on 3 february 1646 lehmberg 1996 p 34 remaining royalist cavalry were eventually destroyed in their entirety
