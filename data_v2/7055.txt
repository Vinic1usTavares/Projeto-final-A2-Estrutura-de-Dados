capitalize on success label pressured ben to hastily record follow up albums of music in same vein and cover songs as filler result was three albums within span of 18 months and a strain on his relationship with philips which ended after last of these albums 1965 s big ben was finished thumb left fellow tropicalia musician gilberto gil pictured in 1970 vouched for ben to be re signed by philips records for next few years ben performed as an independent artist his only album during this period o silencio no brooklin was released in 1967 on sao paulo based small market label artistas unidos and sold poorly while continuing to refine his idiosyncratic samba based style he occasionally recorded singles for artistas unidos and wrote songs some of which were recorded by mainstream acts such as os mutantes wilson simonal and elis regina this caught interest of philips which had experienced new leadership under former odeon records executive andre midani in early 1969 midani re signed ben to label after being persuaded by musicians gilberto gil and caetano veloso who told him they would promote singer whenever possible recording and production jorge ben was recorded at c b d in rio de janeiro and scatena in sao paulo for album ben chose songs he had been working on since previous year or two in studio he was accompanied on several performances by trio mocoto a vocal percussion group he had met while touring sao paulo s nightclub circuit in late 1960s philips records enlisted pianist jose briamonte to arrange an orchestral section for majority of songs with arrangements for only barbarella and descobri que eu sou um anjo done by rogerio duprat according to verve records album was produced with sound effects that were state of art at time musical style album s music is defined by what brazilian music aficionado greg caz called a patented hard strummed 4 4 samba groove that soon inspired a whole underground movement known as samba rock and characterized ben s recordings for next decade music journalist tom hull identified main elements of his lively samba rock synthesis to be trio mocoto s accompaniment and string arrangements of briamonte and duprat resulting in kind of tropical psychedelia attempted by contemporaries gil veloso and os mutantes commenting on individual tracks hull compared descobri que eu sou um anjo to a hard rocking outtake from 1967 love album forever changes and said take it easy my brother charles incorporates funk to overall sound briamonte and duprat s arrangements on album were found by allmusic s thom jurek to be key to ben s fusion of american soul music with samba and brazilian folk song structures from his past work according to website s alvaro neder this album and ben s follow up forca bruta 1970 represent his involvement in brazil s tropicalia cultural and musical movement thom n d jorge ben biography history allmusic retrieved 3 january 2019 themes thematically album explores romances with women and everyday brazilian life including football fandom in pais tropical he sings i live in a tropical country i m flamengo and i have a nega black woman named tereza his lyrics are often characterized by zany reflections repetition and nonsense words as caz described for jorge it s not so much about meaning of words as it is about their sound instead of writing 20 lines jorge often preferred to write two that sound very cool and repeat them ten times some songs reflect a burgeoning self awareness in ben s songwriting according to robert leaver of amoeba music s international records department album asserted ben s identity with confidence and exuberance of one who is comfortable in his own skin particularly in its exploration of afro brazilian perspectives portrays a black street market worker who transcends her social status when she performs as a carnival queen during brazilian carnivals she is described as a child of african nobles who by geographic mistake was born in born in brazil on carnival day its final verse quotes text from back cover of gil s 1968 self titled album praising black female beauty and as poet gil once said black is sum of all colors you black woman are colorful by nature jorge ben is strongly informed by african american soul music s ethos of racial pride self determination and collective struggle according to brazilian culture scholar christopher dunn who cited take it easy my brother charles as a prime example ben offers partly english language words of caution to his brother of color in song which caz said expresses a contemporary ethos in an unconventional manner according to one translation of its portuguese language verse ben sings thumb songs such as charles anjo 45 explore everyday life in brazil including favelas of rio de janeiro a street in photographed above character of charles is revisited on charles anjo 45 one of several songs on album that make allusions to favelas of brazil s poor non white population in song he is depicted as an underworld criminal figure from a rio favela robin hood of ghetto narrative follows his melancholic departure for prison and his celebrated return to neighborhood packaging thumb upright 0 6 flamengo logo shown on ben s guitar album cover was designed by brazilian artist guido alberi it is a cartoon illustration of ben surrounded by a psychedelic collage of tropical plants samba musicians superhuman women and flag of brazil singer is shown with broken manacles around his wrists a toucan resting on his bare shoulder and an acoustic guitar in hand guitar is decorated with logo of clube de do flamengo ben s favorite football team caz has described alberi s artwork as an iconic psychedelic tropicalia style cover painting while art designer pablo yglesias said it remains favorite cover for many listeners of musica popular brasileira according to yglesias either ben or alberi had drawn inspiration from rio de janeiro s neorealist art scene carioca which abandoned high art values of modernism in favor of a focus on ordinary urban life and experimentation with popular mass produced mediums such as newspaper photography graphic design and comics as a magical realist portrait cover mingles important issues of day personal emblems and symbols of his black brazilian identity while employing decidedly uptempo pop illustration he said ben s colorless features contrast remarkably with day glo rain forest world surrounding him reminding one of arduous road to self understanding and of racial equality broken manacles also echo this theme for yglesias who said they represent struggles faced by black people in brazil and elsewhere in world for back cover liner notes expressing approval of ben were written by philips producer armando pittigliani who had originally signed and later dropped singer during his first stint with label release and reception jorge ben was released on lp in november 1969 by philips records and became a commercial comeback for singer in months leading up to album s release several of its songs had become hit songs for other recording artists including wilson simonal pais tropical os do samba cade tereza and as a duo caetano veloso and gal costa que pena these songs later became commercial successes for ben when released as singles from this album pais tropical and que pena in particular have remained among his most famous songs according to leaver jorge ben became ben s most significant and commercially successful album to date album was released at height of controversial tropicalia movement and sociopolitical turmoil in dictatorial brazil whose government was censoring and arresting movement s more explicitly political artists veloso and gil were jailed temporarily before going into exile in england while ben had some of his songs banned from radio play at a renowned music festival ben was heckled for his performance of charles anjo 45 but song still impacted record charts and remained a staple of his repertoire album ultimately improved singer s standing in brazil s music community as jurek later wrote jorge ben was not well received in veja however reviewing for brazil s leading news magazine in december 1969 music journalist tarik de souza argued that ben had failed to project himself as a singer composer and guitarist he largely faulted philips for disregarding rhythmic appeal of ben s past success by hiring briamonte whose excessive preoccupation with melody and harmony resulted in orchestrations that suffocate songs although duprat s few arrangements were seen as magnificent album was reissued on cd in brazil during 1990s but eventually went out of print in 2008 dusty groove america released a remastered cd in united states a vinyl edition was issued for first time in u s in 2018 when verve and universal music enterprises remastered album in anticipation of its 50th anniversary track listing all songs were written by jorge ben
