thumb 300px m113s from 1st armoured personnel carrier squadron carrying soldiers of 6th battalion royal australian regiment in south vietnam during 1966 australian army has operated large numbers of m113 armoured personnel carriers since 1964 between 817 and 840 m113s were acquired between 1965 and 1979 comprising nine different variants a long running modernisation program which commenced in 1990s resulted in 431 being upgraded between 2007 and 2012 m113 has been main type of armoured fighting vehicle used by australian army for most of its career and has equipped dedicated armoured transport units and mechanised infantry formations it has also been used as a support vehicle by many other units type played an important role in australia s commitment to vietnam war between 1965 and 1972 small numbers of m113s were deployed to somalia during 1992 and 1993 and rwanda in 1994 and 1995 larger numbers of m113s operated in east timor between 1999 and 2002 despite upgrade program m113s are now becoming obsolete and army has not used them in recent deployments due to their vulnerability to attack a project to replace m113s with infantry fighting vehicles is underway and new vehicles are scheduled to enter service from 2025 acquisition thumb a former australian army alvis saracen these vehicles were first to be replaced with m113s m113s were acquired as part of an initiative launched by chief of general staff lieutenant general sir ragnar garrett in 1958 to modernise army s organisation and equipment so that it was compatible with those of australia s allies particularly united states army other new equipment issued to army during early 1960s as part of this program included fn fal rifles m60 machine guns m2a2 howitzers m40 recoilless rifles and mortars and radios 1 as part of adoption of pentropic organisation in 1960 army needed to acquire apcs for its armoured units this organisation included two apc regiments 12th 16th hunter river lancers and 8th 13th victorian mounted rifles each regiment was authorised 119 apcs a further two apcs were to be issued to each armoured regiment and nine were to form part of equipment of two divisional reconnaissance squadrons reconnaissance regiment in pentropic divisions combat support group was to have 25 apcs a formal weapons equipment policy statement specifying that army required tracked apcs was issued on 26 june 1960 statement called for army to acquire tracked apcs which were amphibious and could be carried by aircraft these vehicles were to replace army s wheeled scout cars and apcs which had been purchased in 1950s as well as obsolete afvs dating from second world war american m113 british fv432 and canadian bobcat were considered bobcat was least advanced and no prototype had been completed so it was rejected prior to trials being conducted from november 1962 to april 1963 two prototype and two production m113s were subjected to trials in hot and dry conditions at mount isa queensland and hot and wet conditions at mourilyan queensland british ministry of defence mod played an active role in these trials and it was particularly interested in outcomes of tropical trials of fv432 trials began with crew familiarisation and driver training on both types in innisfail area once this was complete four trial vehicles were driven in convoy to mount isa to conduct hot and dry trials these included automotive and physiological tests latter of particular interest to mod testing in extreme heat during this phase found poor ventilation of m113 took a heavy toll on crew and passengers of type and one driver lost in two hours fv432 s forced air ventilation system proved superior in this aspect at conclusion of this stage of trials vehicles were driven a longer route back to for hot and wet phase of trials at nearby mourilyan this phase included extensive driving through jungles and on sandy beaches amphibious testing and being left to elements unattended for 14 days m113 outperformed fv432 in almost every aspect tested its smooth sides and roof stowage proved far superior when driving through overgrown jungle lower track pressure and better track design proved superior on sand and it was significantly more waterproof when conducting amphibious trials whilst slightly slower in water m113 required significantly less time to prepare fv432 s amphibious preparations included removal of every inspection plate and erection of a large rubber flotation screen latter was seen as a major drawback as it completely blocked driver s vision and rubber screen was easily punctured by debris or vegetation trials demonstrated that m113 was much better suited to army s requirements than fv432 and accordingly m113 was selected for service despite this several improvements to type were recommended prior to final acceptance these modifications included installation on a ventilation system in coordination with engineers from vehicle s manufacturer fmc a ventilation system unique to australian vehicles was developed orders were placed during 1963 64 financial year at this time it was planned to retain m113s until 1995 m113a1 variant was ordered for army with first deliveries scheduled for 1964 this vehicle had a crew of two and could carry up to eleven passengers its armour provided protection against small arms and shrapnel while us army m113s were powered by a petrol engine australian army selected m113a1 variant which used general motors v6 diesel engines this was because variant had greater range diesel fuel was less likely to combust if apc was damaged in combat and same engine was used to power buses which meant that spare parts were readily available australian m113a1s were initially armed with a single pintle mounted 0 5 inch calibre m2 browning heavy machine gun deliveries of m113 began in 1964 but proved slow first m113s to arrive included specialist variants including fitters vehicles which carried maintenance personnel and mortar carriers they began to be issued to royal australian armoured corps raac units on 19 march 1965 m113s initially replaced army s alvis saracen wheeled apcs reserve citizen military forces cmf units were accorded a low priority with some not receiving m113s until late 1960s deliveries of m113s were completed in 1979 m113a1 variants and modifications m113a1 variants thumb a former australian army m557a1 armoured command vehicle original orders of m113s included several variants m125a1 these vehicles are fitted with a single 81 mm mortar and are based on m113a1 mortar is mounted inside rear hull on a turntable and racking is fitted inside vehicle for mortar ammunition m125a1 is armed with a m2 browning for self protection m113a1 fitters vehicle these vehicles are also based on m113a1 and are used to repair equipment in combat areas they are fitted with a hydraulic crane on their roof capable of lifting an engine and transmission pack vehicles also carry tools spare parts and technicians they are armed with a m2 browning m113 armoured recovery vehicle light this variant was used to recover other vehicles from field m557a1 armoured command vehicle this variant has a raised rear hull to accommodate working spaces for headquarters staff working space can be further extended by erecting a canvas tent m557a1 was originally armed with a 0 3 inch m1919 browning machine gun though a m60 machine gun was sometimes fitted instead m548 tracked load carrier m548 is an unarmoured logistics variant of m113 type was acquired to replace wheeled logistics carriers within armoured units vietnam era modifications operational experience in south vietnam rapidly demonstrated a need to provide armour protection for machine gun on m113s from august 1965 m113a1s began to be fitted with armoured shields these comprised a front plate and angled wings on each side they were built by army workshops in south vietnam to varying designs while shields provided some protection crew commander who operated machine gun remained totally exposed from sides and rear thumb left a retired m113a1 apc fitted with a t50 turret as an interim measure to improve protection 19 m113a1s in vietnam and one of these vehicles in australia were fitted with model 74c turrets between september and november 1966 these provided all round protection and were fitted with two m1919a4 browning machine guns turret was very cramped however and their traverse mechanisms rapidly wore out all of model 74c turrets had been withdrawn by december 1968 t50 turret was selected as standard turret for australian m113s trials of these turrets began in april 1966 and design was approved for service in late 1966 m113a1s fitted with t50 turrets began to arrive in south vietnam in august 1968 almost all of australian army s m113a1s were eventually fitted with these turrets turret was initially armed with two l3a3 machine guns an improved version of m1919a4 but some were later fitted with a m2 browning and an turret was regarded as unsatisfactory by soldiers as it was cramped and it proved difficult to keep guns aimed when vehicle was moving turret was also very slow to rotate which led to delays in engaging targets to free up space right hand side l3a3 machine gun was removed from all t50 turrets by early 1970 these guns were instead fitted to roof of turret using a pintle mount australian army is one of only two m113 operators to have fitted turrets to type combat experience also led to improvements to better protect m113s against land mines from july 1969 an armoured plate was welded to sponson above first three roadwheels on each side of vehicles this modification was eventually fitted to all australian m113s from may 1970 all of army s m113s were also fitted with a shock absorbing footrest for driver finally a 38 mm thick aluminium armoured plate was installed on underside of all m113s starting from august 1970 while plate added an extra in weight this was considered acceptable given improvement to crew protection in 1969 three m113a1s were modified in south vietnam to dedicated mine exploders these vehicles were fitted with a boom of truck tires on each side which were used detonate mines they were also later modified so that they could be driven from their turret apcs were operated by 1st field squadron which nicknamed them her majesty s apc hmapc flint hmapc steele and hmapc george these vehicles proved successful in helping to clear a large barrier minefield which had originally been laid by australian forces but was being used as a source of mines by communist forces fire support vehicles thumb alt colour photo of a green armoured fighting vehicle a m113a1 fire support vehicle on display at royal australian armoured corps memorial and army tank museum experience in south vietnam led to development of fire support variants of m113 armed with medium calibre guns these variants were unique to australia initial m113a1 fire support vehicles were fitted with turret from an alvis saladin armoured car this turret was armed with a 76 mm gun which could fire high explosive canister and smoke rounds a total of 15 of this variant were produced using all of australian army s m113a1 fire support vehicles began to be produced in 1970 these vehicles were converted from newly acquired m113a1s with installation of turret and armament being undertaken by 4 base workshop at victoria development of a second tranche of fire support vehicles began in 1972 when a requirement for further such afvs was issued it was decided that new afv would use turret of a scorpion fitted to chassis of a m113a1 apc prototype vehicles began to be constructed by ordnance factory in maribyrnong victoria during 1974 with three being completed in mid 1975 design was approved for production in 1978 and 45 additional fire support vehicles were eventually completed by converting newly acquired m113a1s type was later designated medium reconnaissance vehicle post vietnam modifications despite t50 turret s shortcomings it remained in service with all of m113a1 apcs for over 30 years a number of minor modifications were made to improve turret s performance but it was never considered genuinely satisfactory for instance turret lacked predictive gunsights and had no integral night vision capabilities an improved variant of turret was developed during 1990 and early 1991 this design sought to address problems with weapons mounting gunsight ammunition feed system variant also had improved elevation and transverse systems in late 1980s several m113a1 were modified to carry ground surveillance radars and an tas 6a thermal imaging units these vehicles were assigned to 2nd cavalry regiment s surveillance troop other variants between february and may 1965 a m113 command and reconnaissance vehicle on loan from us army was trialled near innisfail queensland two command and reconnaissance variants of armored fighting vehicle had previously been trialled in early 1964 these trials produced mixed results and it was decided to not purchase either afv during 1967 a m113a1 in south vietnam was fitted with a 7 62 mm gau 2b a minigun on an experimental basis gun was mounted on commander s cupola this was undertaken to improve vehicle s firepower gun proved unsatisfactory as it was very difficult to accurately aim and keep supplied with ammunition problems with aiming gun meant that it could not be safely used to support infantry it was also judged that few targets australian army was likely to encounter required this much firepower as a result project was abandoned in late 1971 a mine damaged m113a1 was converted to a mechanical training aid this comprised forward section of vehicle which was mounted on a stand so that instructors and students could easily observe its mechanical layout numbers total numbers of m113s acquired by australian army differ between sources variant acquired cecil houston

m113s began in 1980s but was abandoned in favour of upgrading type in october 1980 army initiated project waler which aimed to replace m113s with new light armoured vehicles by mid 1990s between 500 and 1 000 afvs were to be procured with army considering both wheeled and tracked armoured vehicles a total of 14 companies submitted proposals to target study phase of project which closed in february 1982 and three were selected for further consideration in july that year each of these proposals comprised four wheeled and tracked options project waler was cancelled in july 1985 with government deciding to upgrade m113 fleet instead minister for defence kim beazley stated that while designs under consideration for project waler would have been superior to m113 they would be very costly to procure canberra times reported that it had also proven difficult to tailor designs to australian conditions and that government regarded these afvs as being unsuitable to australia s needs work on upgrade project began in early 1990s 1992 defence review found that m113 fleet could remain viable until 2010 if vehicles were upgraded this finding was generally supported within army though there were concerns over whether it would be economic to retain m113s until 2010 department of defence agreed to a limited upgrade of 537 m113a1s in october 1992 and government approved project in november next year in 1994 army agreed to split project into two phases under phase 1 vehicles suspension and engine cooling systems would be upgrade to standard and they would be fitted with a new turret spall liners and a cooled drinking water system night vision goggles would also be acquired for m113 drivers and commanders as part of phase 2 vehicles would be upgraded further to standard which would involve fitting them with a new engine a new transmission system applique armour and a climate control system tenix defence was selected as prime contractor for phase 1 with contract being signed in may 1997 in november 1997 tenix proposed combining both phases of upgrade program department of defence accepted this proposal but further design and developmental work demonstrated that intended savings from combining phases would not eventuate as a result project was cancelled in october 2000 2000 defence white paper included a commitment to upgrade 350 m113s to improve their capabilities and retain type in service until around 2020 as part of development of a business case for upgrade consideration was given to replacing m113s with infantry fighting vehicles ifvs such as american m2 bradley these afvs were judged to be too expensive and too difficult to deploy cabinet approved m113 major upgrade project in june 2002 and a contract was signed with tenix next month while it was intended that upgraded m113s would begin to enter service in second half of 2006 technical problems with prototype vehicles led to delays these delays were in addition to those caused by problems with managing upgrade project which was subjected to extensive criticism in a 2005 australian national audit office report in 2008 government approved upgrade of a further 81 m113s taking total to 431 department of defence accepted first upgraded m113s in november 2007 next year parliamentary secretary for defence procurement announced that technical problems affecting vehicles had been resolved and upgrade project had been removed from defence projects of concern list last upgraded m113 was accepted in september 2012 m113s which were not upgraded were disposed of in 2000 a m113a1 which had been deployed to south vietnam rwanda and east timor was transferred to australian war memorial memorial later received a m577a1 as of 2016 a further 201 m113s were to be scrapped and

extensively upgraded m113a1 apc hulls m806as4 armoured recovery vehicle lights were converted from m806a1 armoured recovery vehicle lights all as4 variants have hulls being lengthened with addition of an extra road wheel common upgrades to all variants include new suspension a new power pack and engine addition of spall liners and applique armour increased external stowage and fuel tanks being moved from inside to outside hull all upgraded vehicles have been fitted with new t150f tracks and sprockets height and width of afvs was also increased these modifications added 2 5 tonnes of weight for variants and up to 5 5 tonnes for as4 variants a result of modifications was that afvs could no longer be transported by air or road without some elements being disassembled and fewer could be carried on ships afvs also lost their amphibious capabilities in 2019 two m113as4 apcs were converted to optionally crewed combat vehicles by bae systems australia these vehicles were used by army for trials to improve its understanding of how uncrewed vehicles could be used with head of project stating that we are using m113s because we have them in service and we understand them really well operational history vietnam war thumb australian soldiers patrolling with an m113a1 in august 1966 numbers deployed m113s were extensively used by australian army during vietnam war m113a1 m113a1 fitters vehicle m577a1 m125a1 and m113a1 fsv were deployed to south vietnam where they were employed in a wide range of roles a troop of eight m113a1s from 4th 19th prince of wales s light horse was assigned to first australian combat unit to deploy to south vietnam 1st battalion royal australian regiment 1 rar and left australia in may 1965 two other m113a1s were allocated to this force as a reserve further m113a1s and two m125a1 mortar carriers were dispatched in september that year apc force in south vietnam was expanded to a squadron in 1966 this force was initially designated 1st armoured personnel carrier squadron and was renamed a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment in september 1967 at time 1st armoured personnel carrier was established m113 fleet in south vietnam was increased with m113a1 fitters variants and m577a1 armoured command vehicles joining force squadron was redesignated b squadron 3rd cavalry regiment in mid 1969 and a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment in april 1971 while infantry units rotated in and out of south vietnam as formed bodies raac personnel were posted individually cavalry squadron usually comprised a squadron headquarters three cavalry troops a support troop and a light aid detachment each of cavalry troops was equipped with 12 m113a1s and was organised into a headquarters with four apcs and three sections each with three apcs tank squadron which also formed part of 1st australian task force was allocated two m113a1 apcs three m113a1 fitters vehicles and a m577a1 armoured command vehicle which supported centurion tanks during final stage of withdrawal of australian forces from south vietnam cavalry squadron was reduced to a single troop equipped with 12 m113a1s 6 fire support vehicles 2 and a from december 1971 role of this troop was to protect australian logistics base at vung tau last australian m113s left south vietnam in may 1972 overall 200 m113s were deployed to south vietnam this made type most numerous armoured fighting vehicle used by australian army during war m113s were returned to australia to be rebuilt after reaching a set mileage only three were deployed twice m113 variants deployed to south vietnam variant

used as armoured personnel carriers and transported troops in and out of battle in this role they were able to carry an infantry section with all of its combat equipment battle of long tan on 18 august 1966 was first major engagement involving australian m113a1s during this battle a troop of apcs carrying a company of infantry played a key role in preventing another australian infantry company from being overrun m113a1s operated in other roles these included escorting convoys conducting independent patrols and carrying supplies they were also employed in ambushes and cordon and search operations m113a1s supported artillery units by transporting l5 pack howitzers internally and towing larger m2a2 howitzers during later years of australian deployment to south vietnam when 1atf s area of operations was largely secure groups of m113a1s frequently operated without infantry in a reconnaissance role m113a1s proved to be highly effective as they provided mobility protection and firepower to support infantry operations however their thin armour left them vulnerable to mines and other anti tank weapons m125a1 mortar carriers were usually used to provide fire support for infantry with their 81mm mortar they were also often employed as armoured personnel carriers m113a1 fitters variants were assigned to light aid detachments which formed part of cavalry and tank squadrons they were operated by royal australian electrical and mechanical engineers personnel and were heavily employed at both australian army bases and in field during operations variant s crane proved particularly useful thumb left alt black and white photo of a tracked military vehicle with people sitting on top of it a m113a1 fitted with a gun shield in 1968 each cavalry and tank squadron headquarters was assigned a single m577a1 and a further five were allocated to headquarters of 1atf 547 signal troop 1atf s signals intelligence element was assigned an m577a1 from late 1968 and used it to support large scale operations radio fit outs differed between m577a1s depending on their assigned role m577a1s were often stationed at fire support bases and were rarely used in patrols and convoy escort tasks first m113a1 fsvs arrived in vietnam during july and august 1971 and were initially used to establish a fire support troop in a squadron 3rd cavalry regiment six were allocated to squadron and two others were held in reserve after centurion tanks were withdrawn in september 1971 fsvs were assigned to support infantry units they were used for patrols protecting land clearing teams and defending fixed positions and typically operated with m113a1s fsvs proved unsatisfactory as they were lightly armoured prone to throwing tracks and became bogged more easily than standard m113s fsvs also lacked gun sights for their main armament during first months of their deployment 1atf soon concluded that fsvs were almost useless and they never saw combat vehicles were withdrawn from south vietnam in february 1972 many of m113s deployed to south vietnam were damaged most frequently by mines in many cases damage could be repaired in theatre but 23 m113a1s and a m125a1 were written off hulls of most these afvs were shipped back to australia for disposal a further 28 m113s were returned to australia for repair after incurring damaged which was beyond capabilities of army workshops in south vietnam to handle of these m113s 15 had sustained such serious damage that they needed to be rebuilt using newly purchased hulls cavalry squadron incurred significant casualties with 20 of its members being killed including 17 killed in action and 110 seriously wounded in action this represented approximately one in seven of its members many others suffered minor injuries extensive training was undertaken in australia to prepare soldiers and units for service in south vietnam during 1969 alone m113s in australia were driven for during training soldiers were trained by squadron of 3rd cavalry regiment which was stationed in australia at time immediately before being posted to squadron in south vietnam after vietnam thumb alt colour photo of two tracked military

other than armoured regiments cmf raac units were authorised eight m113a1s to replace their obsolete armoured cars as well as a single m577a1 armoured command vehicle deliveries of these m113s were completed in 1972 by this time all cmf raac units had been organised as cavalry or apc formations m113a1 fsvs were used by regular cavalry regiments and armoured centre until 1979 when they were transferred to army reserve units australian army began to develop a mechanised infantry capability during late 1970s 5th 7th battalion royal australian regiment 5 7 rar began trialling mechanised tactics beginning in 1976 this reform aimed to improve mobility of unit and make better use of capabilities of apcs battalion was fully mechanised by mid 1977 in this role it was equipped with 72 m113s following sydney hilton hotel bombing in february 1978 5 7 rar s m113s were stationed along hume highway to protect national leaders as they travelled from sydney to bowral for commonwealth heads of government meeting there was scepticism within army headquarters over cost effectiveness of mechanisation and viability of maintaining only a single mechanised battalion at conclusion of mechanisation trial in mid 1978 only one company of 5 7 rar was retained as a mechanised unit with others reverting to light infantry in early 1983 a decision was made to permanently convert 5 7 rar to a fully mechanised unit battalion transitioned to this role between july 1983 and 1984 some supporting elements of 1st brigade were also mechanised 5 7 rar had completed its transformation to a mechanised battalion by 1986 as of early that year it was equipped with 56 m113a1 apcs 4 4 m113a1 fitters vehicles 3 1 m113 armoured recovery vehicle light and 7 tracked load carriers battalion

serious problems affecting their control differential this greatly disrupted training activities m113a1 fsvs were retired in 1986 and six of vehicles were sold to new zealand army after being converted back to standard m113a1s 1987 defence white paper called for number of m113s to be reduced to below 600 with some of remaining vehicles being upgraded white paper also recommended that 2nd cavalry regiment s m113s be replaced with wheeled vehicles aslav was selected for this role in 1992 2nd cavalry regiment was converted to aslavs during 1995 and 1996 m113a1 mrvs were withdrawn from service in late 1996 due to shortages of spare parts for their turrets and concerns that fumes ejected when their main gun was fired were toxic in 1993 b squadron 3 4th cavalry regiment was deployed to somalia to support 1 rar during operation solace unit was equipped with 36 m113a1 variants including 28 apcs and two m125a1 mortar carriers this deployment proved successful with vehicles being used in similar roles to those they had performed during vietnam war however squadron had difficulty maintaining m113s particularly due to a shortage of links for their caterpillar tracks three m113a1 apcs and a m113a1 fitters vehicle were deployed to rwanda between 1994 and 1995 these vehicles were used to protect australian army medical teams operating in country in september 1999 b squadron 3

advised a parliamentary committee that upgraded m113s would require additional protection to be able to serve in afghanistan and that aslavs and bushmaster protected mobility vehicles were best suited to conditions there department also noted that it was unlikely that m113s would ever be deployed to a place where there is sustained close combat expected on a daily basis replacement thumb a
