rosenqvist and bird were close behind one another and distanced themselves from rest of field rosenqvist quickly halved buemi s advantage and later eased off slightly to allow buemi to open his lead to a second rosenqvist also had slightly more electrical energy to use than buemi and was tempting buemi to use his fanboost buemi however could not use his fanboost because it was not programmed to work on car he was driving and rosenqvist made his attack for lead on lap 29 rosenqvist braked later than buemi for lead by using his extra electrical energy to steer left heading to end of backstraight and turn seven left hander with three laps to go mortara attempted to overtake his teammate engel who battled heidfeld and venturi pair made contact engel had little space to negotiate

filippi and mortara were final classified finishers post race top three drivers appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference rosenqvist spoke of his delight of returning to marrakesh after losing victory to buemi in 2016 race saying that he felt he was now settled into formula e and was no longer believed he was a rookie driver i was learning in beginning and losing here was our biggest lesson of year we realised we had a lot of work to do and a lot of things to improve buemi stated that he did not mind losing win to rosenqvist and spoke of his feeling that latter had payback after his victory in second berlin eprix previous year was revoked because of a sporting infringement when you lose a race you always end up a bit disappointed but everyone thought we had no pace and we were done and we came here had pole and finished second we showed everyone we re still there third place finisher bird revealed that his car was affected by a reoccurring issue since hong kong that could not be rectified and made decision not to replace affected component but still third place is strong points and it s a third place with a big issue i didn t think i was going to finish race in first car i thought i was going to be pulling over and retiring so actually we were quite relieved with full course yellow came and saved my bacon a little bit engel was perplexed with penalty imposed on him for contact with teammate mortara and heidfeld arguing that he was attempting to avoid any damage where possible by mounting kerbs on inside and held belief that heidfeld did not leave enough space for him to pass through abt was also annoyed with drive through penalty he incurred for his second lap clash with lynn and believed it was merely a racing incident and held belief that steward s judgement was harsh in an incident like this alex is going to say it is my fault and i will say it is more his fault because i think it was avoidable as i was already next to him when i made move and he turns in di grassi said that he believed that he would have kept with rosenqvist had he not suffered technical problems with his car as a worst case scenario a third place would have been easy to achieve if not a win audi team principal allan mcnish affirmed manufacturer would return to competitiveness in season s upcoming races but admitted his appointment at unreliability of team s cars he stated his belief this would invigorate a comeback we just have to fightback and dig in it s like le mans it only finishes at end of race it doesn t finish halfway through you have to have spirit to come back stronger and we will do that straightaway final positions moved rosenqvist to top of drivers championship for first time in his career with
