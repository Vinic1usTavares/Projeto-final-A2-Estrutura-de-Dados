hurricane richard was a damaging hurricane that affected areas of central america in october 2010 it developed on october 20 from an area of low pressure that had stalled in caribbean sea system moved to southeast before turning to west storm slowly organized and system intensified into a tropical storm initially richard only intensified slowly in an area of week steering currents however by october 23 wind shear diminished and storm intensified faster as it headed toward belize next day richard intensified into hurricane status and further into its peak intensity as a category 2 hurricane reaching maximum winds of 100 mph 150 km h hurricane made its only landfall on belize at peak intensity over land richard quickly weakened and later degenerated into a remnant low on october 25 hurricane richard caused an estimated 80 million 2010 usd in damages in its path much of which was in belize in honduras damage was mostly limited to power outages and landslides in belize most of damage was attributed to damage to crops power outages were also widespread across country two fatalities occurred in belize one direct and other indirect one person drowned after his ship capsized during storm and another was mauled to death by a jaguar that had escaped its cage meteorological history origins of hurricane richard can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off african coast on october 4 and moved westward stalling over venezuela on october 13 over next 3 days it drifted into extreme southwestern caribbean sea and soon developed an area of low pressure until it stalled just north of panama on october 16 national hurricane center nhc began to monitor that area of disturbed weather in association with a weak trough of low pressure over southwestern caribbean sea which persisted across region as hurricane paula dissipated over cuba on same day by october 17 easterly and northerly trade winds flowed into low producing a disorganized area of convection or thunderstorms across region for several days system moved generally west northwestward toward central america convection increased over low on october 18 and national hurricane center noted possibility of further organization due to favorable environmental conditions later that day it passed near eastern coast of nicaragua storm became more organized as it turned to a north northwest drift in northwestern caribbean sea hurricane hunters investigated system on october 19 and indicated development of a low level circulation as such nhc noted that storm was very close to tropical depression strength next day after system turned to east strong upper level wind shear impeded its further development but such conditions were expected to abate early on october 21 convection had organized and increased near center of circulation despite still being in an area of moderate wind shear due to organization nhc classified it as tropical depression nineteen about 125 miles 205 km south of grand cayman at time depression was drifting eastward located near base of a mid level trough and toward west of a subtropical ridge in hours after its formation center remained located along western portion of a cyclonically curved rainband as convection increased wind shear decreased and despite presence of dry air to its northwest depression intensified to tropical storm richard by 1500 utc on october 21 based on confirmation from hurricane hunters however post operational analysis revealed that depression became a tropical storm slightly earlier at 1200 utc thumb right tropical depression nineteen on october 20 shortly after being classified with a tiny circulation displaced just outside its convection alt a satellite image of a cluster of storms weakly circulating about a common center upon intensifying to tropical storm status richard was moving southeastward still in an area of weak steering currents and in midst of undergoing a loop in its track two hurricane models predicted for storm to intensify to major hurricane status over western caribbean official forecast was for storm to make landfall on belize with winds of 90 mph 150 km h as richard continued generally southward early on october 22 its convection became ragged and linear preventing any initial strengthening additionally circulation became elongated as thunderstorms deteriorated due to continued presence of dry air and wind shear after turning westward richard moved parallel just offshore honduras coast and its circulation became difficult to locate on satellite imagery on october 23 tropical storm richard began strengthening again after shear diminished and storm took advantage of warm waters of western caribbean later that day a mid level eye feature became evident on satellite imagery additionally outflow gradually improved and became more symmetrical throughout circulation on october 24 hurricane hunters indicated that richard attained hurricane status based on surface winds of 85 mph 140 km h in addition radar from belize at time indicated a nearly closed eyewall hurricane continued intensifying to peak winds of 100 mph 155 km h and minimum central pressure dropped to 977 millibars 28 9 inhg making it a category 2 hurricane despite fact that it was operationally classified as a category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph 150 km h and a pressure of 981 millibars 29 0 inhg at around utc on october 25 hurricane richard made landfall about 20 miles 35 km h south southeast of belize city belize at peak intensity and just after moving ashore eye briefly became better defined within a few hours however inner core lost definition as eye dissipated winds rapidly diminished and richard weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into northern guatemala by then there was little deep convection remaining and after emerging into bay of campeche richard degenerated into a remnant low on october 26 but then turned back east as system was forced to because of strong wind shear after storm reached yucatan peninsula system began turning north until it reached gulf of mexico remnants of hurricane richard continued to move north over gulf of mexico as it weakened until system dissipated completely late on october 27 preparations and impact honduras left thumb blustery conditions on island of roatan off northern coast of honduras starting late on october 21 government of honduras issued a tropical storm watch for then tropical storm richard which covered north coast of honduras from limon to border with nicaragua when richard finally began to head westward on october 22 tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warnings a hurricane watch was also issued for same location by 1500 utc on october 23 government of honduras had issued a tropical storm warning from limon heading westward toward puerto cortes tropical storm warning also included three bay islands of guanaja roatan and utila as richard was predicted to brush coast of honduras just offshore tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning at time richard had intensified into a hurricane it had moved away from eastern honduras and tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was discontinued from limon to border with nicaragua while hurricane richard was approaching belize on october 24 government of honduras discontinued all watches and warning that had been issued in association with storm as was no longer considered a possible threat for landfall while passing to north of country richard knocked down trees and power lines on northern honduras coast some power outages occurring in areas resulted from fallen power lines in addition mudslides triggered by rainfall cut off an estimated 15 000 people in 40 small towns four coastal honduran provinces were declared areas of maximum alert by government after storm offshore bay islands also experienced heavy rainfall due to richard winds on islands peaked at 58 mph 93 km h on roatan belize thumb right hurricane richard making landfall on belize on october 25 alt a black and white image of a tropical cyclone a small eye is visible government of belize began warning of threat of richard on october 22 starting with a tropical storm watch issued for entire east coast of country as tropical storm richard was rapidly intensifying tropical storm watch on coast of belize was replaced with a tropical storm warning which had been upgraded at 1500 utc october 23 only three hours after replacement of tropical storm watch to warning richard was nearing hurricane status and tropical storm warning in place on east coast of belize upgraded to a hurricane warning hurricane warning associated with hurricane richard remained in place for east coast of belize as landfall was occurring since storm made landfall to south southeast of belize city prior to storm s landfall an estimated 10 000 people took refuge in storm shelters and churches throughout belize hurricane richard damaged thousands of homes and leaving many without power belize zoo and tropical education center a major attraction for ecotourists and was in path and heavily damaged forcing it to close to remove debris and repair their animal exhibits overall damage was bz 33 8 million 17 4 million 2010 usd most of which from crop damage especially to citrus fruits entire grapefruit harvest was lost an estimated 25 of orange crops were lost and several large trees were downed in addition about 200 homes were destroyed mexico government of mexico also gave warnings of approaching richard first issuing a hurricane watch also east coast of yucatan peninsula from punta gruesa southward to city of chetumal which is on border with belize in addition to hurricane watch issued for that portion for yucatan peninsula a tropical storm warning was set in effect for same area although hurricane richard approached closely to mexican portion of yucatan peninsula there were no changes to watches and warning from 1500 utc october 23 to time of landfall in belize after hurricane richard made landfall in belize government of mexico discontinued hurricane watch from punta gruesa southward to chetumal although tropical storm warnings have been cancelled governor of quintana roo felix gonzalez canto declared chetumal as highest state of alert prior to richard however areas on northeastern coast of yucatan peninsula were put on only minimum alert by government see also timeline of 2010 atlantic hurricane season hurricane ernesto 2012 hurricane paula 2010 hurricane wilma hurricane earl 2016
