sorley maclean 26 october 1911 24 november 1996 was a scottish gaelic poet described by scottish poetry library as one of major scottish poets of modern era because of his mastery of his chosen medium and his engagement with european poetic tradition and european politics nobel prize laureate seamus heaney credited maclean with saving scottish gaelic poetry he was raised in a strict presbyterian family on island of raasay immersed in gaelic culture and literature from birth but abandoned religion for socialism in late 1930s he befriended many scottish renaissance figures such as hugh macdiarmid and douglas young he was wounded three times while serving in royal corps of signals during north african campaign maclean published little after war due to his perfectionism in 1956 he became head teacher at plockton high school where he advocated for use of gaelic language in formal education in his poetry maclean juxtaposed traditional gaelic elements with mainstream european elements frequently comparing highland clearances with contemporary events especially spanish civil war his work was a unique fusion of traditional and modern elements that has been credited with restoring gaelic tradition to its proper place and reinvigorating and modernizing gaelic language although his most influential works dain do eimhir and an cuilthionn were published in 1943 maclean did not become well known until 1970s when his works were published in english translation his later poem hallaig published 1954 achieved cult status outside gaelic speaking circles for its supernatural representation of a village depopulated in highland clearances and came to represent all scottish gaelic poetry in english speaking imagination biography early life sorley maclean was

chaluim ic chaluim ic iain ic tharmaid ic iain ic tharmaid he could not trace his genealogy with certainty to eighth generation at home he was steeped in gaelic culture and oral tradition especially old songs his mother a nicolson had been raised near portree although her family was of lochalsh origin her family had been involved in highland land league activism for tenant rights his father had been raised on raasay but his family was originally from north uist and before that probably mull both sides of family had been evicted during highland clearances of which many people in community still had a clear recollection both his mother s and father s families contained individuals who were considered accomplished by their communities whether through formal education or extensive knowledge of oral tradition what maclean learned of history of gaels especially of clearances had a significant impact on his worldview and politics on his mother s side were three noteworthy singers two pipers and a village bard of especial note was maclean s paternal grandmother mary matheson whose family had been evicted from lochalsh in 18th century until her death in 1923 she lived with family and taught maclean many traditional songs from kintail and lochalsh as well as skye as a child maclean enjoyed fishing trips with his aunt who taught him other songs unlike other members of his family maclean could not sing a fact that he connected with his impetus to write poetry calvinism thumb a sign requests that playground not be used on sunday maclean was raised in free presbyterian church of scotland which he described as strictest of calvinist fundamentalism calvinism taught that god would save a small portion of humanity elect while vast majority were doomed by sinfulness inherent in human nature only 5 of congregation took communion remainder were considered mere adherents who were probably destined for eternal torment in hell free presbyterians believed that free church was too lenient let alone church of scotland they prohibited any form of amusement on sabbath but had a rich tradition of unaccompanied psalm singing maclean later said that he had abandoned religion for socialism at age of twelve as he refused to accept that a majority of human beings were consigned to eternal damnation in 1941 he wrote that perhaps my obsession with cause of unhappy unsuccessful oppressed comes from this pessimism of calvinist tradition had a strong impact on his world view and he also retained a puritanical contempt for mere worldly riches and power later in life he had a complicated view of church and religion although he criticized church s suppression of gaelic song and oral tradition and negative effect of church teachings on some social groups especially women professor donald meek gd wrote that at times maclean seemed to articulate ideas of liberation theology maclean defended free presbyterian church against opponents who had little familiarity with it once describing free presbyterian elders as saintly just saintly men sometimes he altered his poetry to avoid offending religious members of his family he also admired literary sophistication and creativity of protestant sermons in gaelic wide vocabulary high register and passion of these sermons had a significant impact on his poetic style 1930s he was educated at raasay primary school and portree secondary school in 1929 he left home to attend university of edinburgh for economic reasons he chose to study english instead of celtic a decision he later regretted because i was interested only in poetry and only in some poetry at that he disliked head of english department herbert grierson who favoured different poets than maclean maclean felt that grierson imposed his aesthetic preferences on department maclean s academic work has been described as merely dutiful while at edinburgh maclean also took classes in celtic department then under william j watson he was involved in left wing politics literary circles and university shinty team maclean later described an occasion in which he had demonstrated against oswald mosley and british union of fascists according to celtic scholar emma maclean s education at edinburgh broadened his horizons and city itself was significant in his life while in edinburgh he observed urban poverty slums and overcrowding especially severe due to great depression after his graduation in 1933 with a first class degree he remained in edinburgh and studied at moray house teachers training college where he met hugh macdiarmid thumb left ruins of a stone house on mull in 1934 he returned to skye to teach english at portree high school after spanish civil war broke out in 1936 he considered volunteering to fight in international brigades according to his daughter he would have gone if not for family responsibilities at time his mother was seriously ill and his father s business was failing in january 1938 maclean accepted a teaching position at tobermory high school on mull where he stayed until december year he spent on mull had a profound effect on him because mull was still devastated from nineteenth century clearances in which many macleans had been evicted maclean later said i believe mull had much to do with my poetry its physical beauty so different from skye s with terrible imprint of clearances on it made it almost intolerable for a gael he believed that fascism was likely to emerge victorious in europe and was further dismayed by continuing decline of gaelic language between 1939 and 1941 he taught at boroughmuir high school in edinburgh and in hawick during this period he wrote most of poetry that would become dain do eimhir including epic an cuilthionn maclean cultivated friendships with scottish renaissance poets including macdiarmid robert garioch norman maccaig douglas young and george campbell hay maclean also a noted historian published two influential papers on nineteenth century gaelic poetry in transactions of in 1938 and 1939 which challenged celtic twilight view of gaelic literature maclean accused celtic with attributing to gaelic poetry very opposite of every quality which it actually has at which they only succeeded because they catered to a credulous english speaking audience he pointed out that apparent sentimentality or impotence of corpus of clearance poetry may have been an artefact of fact that landlords would not have preserved poetry critical of them his use of gaelic poetry as a potential source material for historical studies was extremely innovative at time world war ii thumb upright 0 8 a mine explodes during second battle of el alamein upon outbreak of war in 1939 maclean wanted to volunteer for cameron highlanders but was prevented due to shortage of teachers he was drafted into royal corps of signals in september 1940 and was sent overseas to north africa in december 1941 in north african campaign he served in royal horse artillery and was wounded on three occasions but on first two not severely enough to be classified as a casualty his military career ended in november 1942 during second battle of el alamein a land mine exploded near command post where maclean was working throwing him thirty feet through air he was wounded in leg and broke several bones in his feet maclean wrote a few poems about war in which he challenged traditional gaelic exaltation of heroism exemplified by lament for alasdair of glengarry he viewed physical courage as morally neutral since it was also valued by nazis and used for evil ends maclean returned to britain for convalescence in march 1943 he was discharged from raigmore hospital in inverness in august 1943 and released from army in september in fall of 1943 he resumed teaching at boroughmuir where he met renee cameron in 1944 they married on 24 july 1946 in inverness and had three daughters and six grandchildren according to friends their marriage was happy and peaceful as they complemented each other well and maclean mellowed with age and family life he had never been a member of communist party and soviet occupation of poland after war caused maclean to become disillusioned with soviet union and stalinism he retained his socialist world view and strong belief in social justice during this period he frequently reviewed poetry and continued to make friends in literary circles including younger poets iain crichton smith and george mackay brown he became particularly close to sydney goodsir smith who shared a flat with maclean and his family for more than a year in 1947 he was promoted to principal teacher of english at boroughmuir but maclean wanted to return to western highlands later life thumb left aerial view of plockton in 1971 in 1956 maclean was offered position of head teacher of plockton high school in wester ross not far from where his paternal grandmother s family had lived it was a difficult assignment as remote location was not attractive to teacher candidates and maclean frequently had to teach due to vacancies while at plockton he promoted use of scottish gaelic in formal education and campaigned for a highers exam for learners of gaelic before 1968 there was no separate exam for gaelic learners who had to compete with native speakers if they took gaelic highers maclean felt that this unfair policy discouraged many students from studying gaelic although he encouraged his students to take exam even if they were not native speakers in 1966 he presented a paper to gaelic society of inverness outlining practical issues in gaelic education maclean pointed out that in continental europe it was not uncommon to study three or four languages in school according to maclean scottish children would benefit from studying three languages in school alongside english and surely it is not expecting too much of gaelic patriotism to demand that gaelic should be one of three maclean set high academic expectations for his students and also promoted shinty in 1965 plockton team won cup for ross and cromarty maclean s many friends and visitors commented on his prodigious knowledge and deep interest in genealogy and local history he continued to participate in left wing politics eventually joining scottish labour party during his later years he published few poems due to his concern with quality and authenticity over quantity his family responsibilities and career left him little spare time to write maclean said that he had burned his poetry instead of publishing it because of his long years of grinding school teaching and his addiction to an impossible lyric ideal after his retirement in 1972 maclean moved to his great grandmother s house at in braes on skye with views over sound of raasay where he entertained frequently following english publication of his poetry he began to be in demand internationally for poetry readings for which he traveled to such places as rotterdam cape breton and berlin maclean was writer in residence at university of edinburgh from 1973 to 1975 where he reportedly kept an open door and warm welcome for aspiring gaelic poets later he was first filidh at recently founded sabhal mor ostaig a gaelic medium university on skye from 1975 to 1976 he was involved in founding institution and also served on its board in 1993 his daughter catriona died at age of 41 maclean and his wife helped to raise her three children poet died of natural causes on 24 november 1996 aged 85 at raigmore hospital in inverness poetry influences before he went to university maclean was writing in both english and gaelic after writing a gaelic poem a heron in 1932 he decided to write only in gaelic and burned his earlier poems maclean later said i was not one who could write poetry if it did not come to me in spite of myself and if it came it had to come in gaelic however it is also clear from his correspondence with macdiarmid that his choice was also motivated by his determination to preserve and develop gaelic language gaelic language had been in decline for several centuries 1931 census registered 136 135 gaelic speakers in scotland only 3 of scottish population despite his decision to write in language at times maclean doubted that gaelic would survive and his poetry would be appreciated for 1 500 years scottish gaelic literature had developed a rich corpus of song and poetry across literary sub literary and non literate registers it retained ability to convey an astonishingly wide range of human experience maclean s work drew on this inherited wealth of immemorial generations according to macinnes few people were as intimately familiar with entire corpus of gaelic poetry written and oral as maclean in particular maclean was inspired by intense love poetry of william ross written in eighteenth century of all poetry maclean held in highest regard scottish gaelic songs composed before nineteenth century by anonymous illiterate poets and passed down via oral tradition he once said that scottish gaelic song poetry was chief artistic glory of scots and of all people of celtic speech and one of greatest artistic glories of europe thumb members of xi international brigade at battle of maclean once said that various communist figures meant more to him than any poet writing to douglas young in 1941 that lenin stalin and dimitroff now mean more to me than prometheus and shelley did in my teens other left wing figures that inspired maclean included james connolly an irish trade union leader executed for leading easter rising john maclean scottish socialist and pacifist and john cornford julian bell and federico garcia lorca who were killed by francoist regime during spanish civil war many of these figures were not gaels and some critics have noted maclean s unusual generosity to non gaelic people in his work perhaps one uniting theme in his work is maclean s anti elitism and focus on social justice nevertheless maclean read widely and was influenced by poets from a variety of styles and eras of contemporary poets hugh macdiarmid ezra pound and william butler yeats had greatest impact after reading a drunk man looks at thistle by macdiarmid maclean decided to try his hand at extended narrative poetry resulting in unfinished an cuilthionn he was also influenced by metaphysical school however he disdained popular left wing poets of 1930s such as w h auden or stephen spender and sometimes regarded poetry as a useless aesthetic hobby dain do eimhir in 1940 eight of maclean s poems were printed in 17 poems for 6d along with scots poems by robert garioch pamphlet sold better than expected and was reprinted a few weeks later it received favourable reviews while maclean was in north africa he left his poetry with douglas young who had promised to help publish it in november 1943 poems were published as dain do eimhir was a sequence of sixty numbered poems with twelve missing of other poems most significant was long narrative poem an cuilthionn book marked a sharp break in style and substance of gaelic poetry from earlier eras in his poetry maclean emphasized struggle between love and duty which was personified in poet s difficulty in choosing between his infatuation with a female figure eimhir and what he sees as his moral obligation to volunteer in spanish civil war thumb left upright 1 2 cuillin inspired maclean s poetry book has been subject of scholarly debate attempting to explain why maclean s earlier poetry has had greatest influence derick thomson wrote that it is love poetry which is most timeless while maclean s political poetry has not aged as well according to maoilios caimbeul there is not and i doubt there will ever be a series of love poems that would have as much influence on gaelic literature ronald black suggested that duty is not a comprehensible emotion nowadays and therefore greatest universal in maclean s verse is depiction of that extraordinary psychosis which is called being in love however this type of commentary has been criticized as an attempt to maclean s work seamus heaney argued that eimhir was similar to beatrice in dante s divine comedy in that eimhir resolves at a symbolic level tensions which would otherwise be or wasteful scottish poet iain crichton smith said there is a sense in which spanish civil war does not form background to these poems but is protagonist maclean s work was innovative and influential because it juxtaposed elements from gaelic history and tradition with icons from mainstream european history he described his poetry as radiating from skye and west highlands to whole of europe by this juxtaposition he implicitly asserted value of gaelic tradition and right of gaels to participate as equals in broader cultural landscape according to john macinnes maclean put much denigrated gaelic language and tradition in its proper place which has a profound effect on gaelic speaking readers and is fundamental to their reading of his poetry an cuilthionn mountains of skye are used as a synecdoche for rifts in european politics and suffering of gaels due to highland clearances is compared to suffering of european people under and other fascist regimes maclean frequently compared injustice of highland clearances with modern day issues in his opinion greed of wealthy and powerful was responsible for many tragedies and social problems book won him recognition as major force in modern gaelic poetry according to cambridge companion to british poetry caimbeul writes that poems capture uncertainty pain yearning and search for stability that are at heart of modernism summarizing impact of book professor donald macaulay wrote after publication of this book gaelic poetry could never be same again recognition although his poetry had a profound impact on gaelic speaking world it was not until 1970s and 1980s that maclean s work became accessible in english translation his poetry was not very accessible to gaelic speakers either since dain do eimhir was not reprinted to english speakers maclean remained virtually unknown until 1970 when issue 34 of lines review was dedicated to his work and some of his poems were reproduced in anthology four points of saltire in preface to collection tom scott forcefully argued for merit of maclean s poetry iain crichton smith published an english translation of dain do eimhir in 1971 maclean was part of delegation that represented scotland at first cambridge poetry festival in 1975 establishing his reputation in england he was one of five gaelic poets to be anthologized in influential 1976 collection modern scottish gaelic poems with verse translations by authors maclean s verse translations were also included in later publications in 1977 canongate books published is de 1932 72 maclean changed ordering of dain do eimhir sequence altering many poems and omitting others in original version of an cuilthionn maclean had asked red army to invade scotland this passage was expunged among other alterations and omissions that led scottish poetry library to describe 1977 version as having been bowdlerized maclean said that he would only consent to publishing parts of his older work that he found tolerable critical acclaim and fame that maclean achieved was almost entirely from critics who did not understand his poetry in original gaelic in 1989 a further compilation of his poetry o choille gu bearradh from wood to ridge collected poems in gaelic and english won him lasting critical acclaim complete annotated editions of his work have since been published thumb left upright 1 2 hallaig raasay made famous by maclean s 1954 poem from early 1970s maclean was in demand internationally as a reader of his own poetry he would start a reading of a poem by describing images then read poem first in gaelic and again in english emphasizing that translations were not to be read as poems in themselves his readings were described as deeply moving even by listeners who did not speak gaelic according to seamus heaney maclean s voice had a certain bardic weirdness that sounded both stricken and enraptured gaelic poet george campbell hay wrote in a review that maclean is gifted with what welsh call power of elevated declamation and his declamation is full of feeling these readings helped establish his international reputation as a poet maclean s poetry was also translated into german and he was invited to poetry readings in germany and austria in english speaking world maclean s best known poem is hallaig a meditation on a raasay village which had been cleared of its inhabitants raasay was cleared between 1852 and 1854 most of its inhabitants were forced to emigrate many of maclean s relatives were affected and hallaig was one of villages to be depopulated poem was written a century later during maclean s time in edinburgh and originally published in 1954 in gaelic language magazine gairm beginning with famous line time deer is in wood of hallaig poem imagines village as it was before clearances with long dead eternally walking through trees it is also filled with local names of individuals and places which have deeper meanings to those intimately familiar with raasay oral tradition unlike most of maclean s output hallaig has no overt political references and never directly mentions eviction or clearance for this reason it was seen as politically safer than others of maclean s poems translated and promoted by irish nobel prize laureate seamus heaney hallaig achieved cult status and came to symbolize scottish gaelic poetry in english speaking imagination style maclean s poetry generally followed an older style of metre based on more dynamic patterns of oral tradition rather than strict static metres of written gaelic poetry of nineteenth century he frequently combined metrical and shifted in middle of a poem achieving sensuous effects that cannot be translated he typically used traditional vowel rhymes both internal and end rhymes that are ubiquitous in oral tradition but a few of his poems have less traditional rhyme schemes however he was flexible in his use of metre combining old and new in such a way that neither neutralizes each other extending rather than repudiating tradition in a way that is unique in gaelic poetry in macinnes analysis rhythmic patterns become a vital part of meaning of maclean s poetry over time his poems became less strict in their application of rhyme and metre according to macinnes labels such as classical and romantic which have been applied respectively to form and content of maclean s poetry are misleading because maclean did not limit himself by those styles despite maclean s reliance on oral tradition his poetry was not intended to be sung although he abandoned verbal codes and intricate symbolism of gaelic tradition maclean occasionally used outmoded devices such as repeating of adjectives thumb left sea is a recurring theme in gaelic poetry maclean s poetry frequently used gaelic themes and references such as place names trees and sea symbolism a knowledge of that tradition would bring additional interpretations and appreciation to a reading of maclean s poetry another important symbol in his work is face which represents romantic love according to john macinnes maclean s poetry exhibits virtually an entire spectrum of language some of his poetry is transparent to a fluent gaelic speaker but meaning of other poems needs to be untangled maclean coined very few neologisms however he revived or repurposed many obscure or archaic words maclean often said that he had heard these old words in presbyterian sermons according to macinnes and maoilios caimbeul maclean s revival of these old forgotten gaelic words revolutionized literary gaelic by adding senses and a newness and modernity caimbeul wrote that maclean s vocabulary is not simple but it is natural and arises naturally from everyday speech although mixed with other influences in contrast english translations were all written in a very straightforward style flattening language by necessity to choose one english word for ambiguity and connotations of gaelic one according to christopher whyte english translations produce an official interpretation one that restricts and deadens range of possible readings of poem english could not convey pop that maclean s revival of disused words brought to his gaelic poetry while gaelic poems were noted for their acoustic properties translations did not pay any particular attention to sound instead focusing narrowly on literal meaning maclean emphasized that his line by line translations were not poetry of prose translation of an cuilthionn that appeared in dain do eimhir he wrote my english version has not even merit of very strict literal accuracy as i find more and more when i look over it seamus heaney called translations cribs awards and honours in june 1987 maclean became first freeman of skye and lochalsh he received seven honorary degrees twice he was honorary head of gaelic society of inverness in 1970 and 1982 he was made honorary president of saltire society in 1985 in 1989 he became a fellow of royal society of literature next year he was named first university of edinburgh alumnus of year and awarded a queen s gold medal for poetry o choille gu bearradh was saltire society scottish book of year for 1990 and maclean won mcvitie s prize for scottish writer of year he became a fellow of educational institute of scotland in 1991 a fellow of royal society of edinburgh in 1992 an honorary fellow of royal incorporation of architects in scotland in 1996 and an honorary royal scottish academician same year he was nominated for nobel prize in literature in 1992 it has been suggested that he might have won if he had not written in such a marginalized language maclean is commemorated by a stone in court outside writers museum edinburgh unveiled in 1998 by iain crichton smith legacy hugh macdiarmid wrote a letter to maclean in 1977 a year before his death stating that he and maclean were best scottish poets of twentieth century macdiarmid and maclean influenced each other s work and maintained an extensive correspondence which has been published douglas young wrote that best poetry written in our generation in british isles has been in scottish gaelic by sorley maclean john macinnes called him a magisterial writer who pushed gaelic to its limits he said that it is truly astonishing that gaelic so long could have produced a writer like maclean who could not express what he had to say in any other language somhairle macgill eain needed gaelic and gaelic needed somhairle macgill eain according to iain crichton smith translator of maclean s poetry dain do eimhir was greatest gaelic book of this century an assessment with which christopher whyte agreed according to maoilios caimbeul maclean was best scottish gaelic poet of all time smith compared calibre of maclean s love poetry to that of and william butler yeats nobel prize laureate seamus heaney said that maclean had saved gaelic poetry for all time while acknowledging literary merit of maclean s work whyte suggested that it was unfortunate that in 1980s it stood in for all scottish gaelic poetry in anglophone world according to whyte maclean s poetry is comparatively elitist rather than populist and permeable only with difficulty to community which uses language in its day to day existence macinnes concedes that maclean does not cater to his readers however in his opinion it would be incorrect to call poetry elitist because of its artistic sincerity speaking with affective directness and a simple passionate intensity compounding difficulty is that traditional medium of gaelic poetry is song and many fluent speakers do not have strong reading skills in an effort to make maclean s work more accessible to scottish gaelic speakers sorley maclean trust commissioned several musicians to set some of maclean s poems to music thumb upright 1 2 maclean once gave a poetry reading at a runrig concert in gaelic speaking world maclean s influence has been pervasive and persistent poet aonghas macneacail started writing in english because my education gave me to believe that gaelic literature was dead he credited maclean with convincing him otherwise and inspiring him to write in gaelic gaelic rock band runrig once invited maclean to come onstage for a poetry reading however maclean had less impact on rural gaelic speaking communities novelist angus peter campbell wrote that he preferred work of local uist bards to maclean and he believed that other uist people felt same australian poet les murray acknowledged maclean s influence on his work a film hallaig was made in 1984 by timothy neat including a discussion by maclean of dominant influences on his poetry with commentary by smith and heaney and substantial passages from poem and other work along with extracts of gaelic song poem also forms part of lyrics of peter maxwell davies opera jacobite rising and maclean s own reading of it in english and in gaelic was sampled by martyn bennett in his album bothy culture for a track of same name a controversy erupted in 2000 when john macleod chief of clan macleod put black cuillin mountain range of skye on market in order to finance repair of dunvegan castle his real estate agency savills used excerpts from an cuilthionn to advertise property many people found this to be an inappropriate use of maclean s work savills apologized unreservedly which was accepted by renee maclean selected works poetry collections literary criticism references notes
