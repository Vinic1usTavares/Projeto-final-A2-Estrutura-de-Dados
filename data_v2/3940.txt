romeo and juliet is a tragedy written by william shakespeare early in his career about two young star crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families it was among shakespeare s most popular plays during his lifetime and along with hamlet is one of his most frequently performed plays today title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers romeo and juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity plot is based on an italian tale translated into verse as tragical history of romeus and juliet by arthur brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in palace of pleasure by william painter in 1567 shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded plot by developing a number of supporting characters particularly mercutio and paris believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595 play was first published in a quarto version in 1597 text of first quarto version was of poor quality however and later editions corrected text to conform more closely with shakespeare s original shakespeare s use of his poetic dramatic structure especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension his expansion of minor characters and his use of sub plots to embellish story has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters sometimes changing form as character develops romeo for example grows more adept at sonnet over course of play romeo and juliet has been adapted numerous times for stage film musical and opera venues during english restoration it was revived and heavily revised by william davenant david garrick s 18th century version also modified several scenes removing material then considered indecent and georg benda s romeo und julie omitted much of action and added a happy ending performances in 19th century including charlotte cushman s restored original text and focused on greater realism john gielgud s 1935 version kept very close to shakespeare s text and used elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance drama in 20th and into 21st century play has been adapted in versions as diverse as george cukor s 1936 film romeo and

juliet romeo and juliet borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity one of these is pyramus and thisbe from ovid s metamorphoses which contains parallels to shakespeare s story lovers parents despise each other and pyramus falsely believes his lover thisbe is dead of xenophon of ephesus written in 3rd century also contains several similarities to play including separation of lovers and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep one of earliest references to names montague and capulet is from dante s divine comedy who mentions montecchi montagues and cappelletti capulets in canto six of purgatorio however reference is part of a polemic against moral decay of florence lombardy and italian peninsula as a whole dante through his characters chastises german king albert i for neglecting his responsibilities towards italy you who are negligent and successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in lombardy history records name of family montague as being lent to such a political party in verona but that of capulets as from a cremonese family both of whom play out their conflict in lombardy as a whole rather than within confines of verona allied to rival political factions parties are grieving one lot already grieving because their endless warfare has led to destruction of both parties rather than a grief from loss of their ill fated offspring as play sets forth which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context earliest known version of romeo and juliet tale akin to shakespeare s play is story of mariotto and gianozza by salernitano in 33rd novel of his il published in 1476 salernitano sets story in siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime his version of story includes secret marriage colluding friar fray where a prominent citizen is killed mariotto s exile gianozza s forced marriage potion plot and crucial message that goes astray in this version mariotto is caught and beheaded and gianozza dies of grief luigi da porto 1485 1529 adapted story as giulietta e romeo and included it in his historia di due written in 1524 and published posthumously in 1531 in venice da porto drew on pyramus and thisbe s decameron and salernitano s mariotto e but it is likely that his story is also autobiographical present as a soldier at a ball on 26 february 1511 at a residence of savorgnan clan in udine following a peace ceremony with opposite strumieri da porto fell in love with lucina daughter of house but relationships of their mentors prevented advances next morning led an attack on city and many members of strumieri were murdered when years later half paralyzed from a battle wound he wrote giulietta e romeo in from where he could see castles of verona he dedicated novella to e madonna lucina savorgnan da porto presented his tale as historically true and claimed it took place at least a century earlier than salernitano had it in days verona was ruled by bartolomeo della porto does not specify which bartolomeo is intended whether bartolomeo i regnat 1301 1304 or bartolomeo ii regnat 1375 1381 though association of former with his patronage of dante who as seen above actually mentions and montecchi in his commedia makes him perhaps slightly more likely anglicized as prince escalus da porto gave romeo and juliet most of its modern form including names of lovers rival families of montecchi and capuleti and location in verona he named friar laurence frate lorenzo and introduced characters mercutio tybalt tebaldo count paris conti di faithful servant and giulietta s nurse da porto originated remaining basic elements of story feuding families romeo left by his mistress meeting giulietta at a dance at her house love scenes including balcony scene periods of despair romeo killing giulietta s cousin tebaldo and families reconciliation after lovers suicides in da porto s version romeo takes poison and giulietta stabs herself with his dagger in 1554 matteo bandello published second volume of his novelle which included his version of e romeo probably written between 1531 and 1545 bandello lengthened and weighed down plot while leaving storyline basically unchanged though he did introduce benvolio bandello s story was translated into french by pierre boaistuau in 1559 in first volume of his histories boaistuau adds much moralising and sentiment and characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts in his 1562 narrative poem tragical history of romeus and juliet arthur brooke translated boaistuau faithfully but adjusted it to reflect parts of chaucer s troilus and criseyde there was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on italian novelle italian tales were very popular among theatre goers and shakespeare may well have been familiar with william painter s 1567 collection of italian tales titled palace of pleasure this collection included a version in prose of romeo and juliet story named goodly history of true and constant love of romeo and shakespeare took advantage of this popularity merchant of venice much ado about nothing all s well that ends well measure for measure and romeo and juliet are all from italian novelle romeo and juliet is a dramatisation of brooke s translation and shakespeare follows poem closely but adds extra detail to both major and minor characters in particular nurse and mercutio christopher marlowe s hero and leander and dido queen of carthage both similar stories written in shakespeare s day are thought to be less of a direct influence although they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive date and text thumb left title page of first edition it is unknown when exactly shakespeare wrote romeo and juliet juliet s nurse refers to an earthquake she says occurred 11 years ago romeo and juliet i iii 23 this may refer to dover straits earthquake of 1580 which would date that particular line to 1591 other earthquakes both in england and in verona have been proposed in support of different dates but play s stylistic similarities with a midsummer night s dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594 95 place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595 one conjecture is that shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591 which he completed in 1595 shakespeare s romeo and juliet was published in two quarto editions prior to publication of first folio of 1623 these are referred to as q1 and q2 first printed edition q1 appeared in early 1597 printed by john danter because its text contains numerous differences from later editions it is labelled a so called bad quarto 20th century editor t j b spencer described it as a detestable text probably a reconstruction of play from imperfect memories of one or two of actors suggesting that it had been pirated for publication an alternative explanation for q1 s shortcomings is that play like many others of time may have been heavily edited before performance by playing company however theory formulated by alfred pollard that bad quarto was reconstructed from memory by some of actors is now under attack alternative theories are that some or all of bad quartos are early versions by shakespeare or abbreviations made either for shakespeare s company or for other companies in any event its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 latest possible date for play s composition thumb right upright 1 8 title page from first folio printed in 1623 superior q2 called play most excellent and lamentable tragedie of romeo and juliet it was printed in 1599 by thomas and published by cuthbert burby q2 is about 800 lines longer than q1 its title page describes it as newly corrected augmented and amended scholars believe that q2 was based on shakespeare s pre performance draft called his foul papers since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and false starts for speeches that were presumably struck through by author but erroneously preserved by typesetter it is a much more complete and reliable text and was reprinted in 1609 q3 1622 q4 and 1637 q5 in effect all later quartos and folios of romeo and juliet are based on q2 as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from q2 in later editions whether good or bad are likely to have arisen from editors or compositors not from shakespeare first folio text of 1623 was based primarily on q3 with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or q1 other folio editions of play were printed in 1632 f2 1664 f3 and 1685 f4 modern versions that take into account several of folios and quartos first appeared with nicholas rowe s 1709 edition followed by alexander pope s 1723 version pope began a tradition of editing play to add information such as stage directions missing in q2 by locating them in q1 this tradition continued late into romantic period fully annotated editions first appeared in victorian period and continue to be produced today printing text of play with footnotes describing sources and culture behind play themes and motifs scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific overarching theme to play proposals for a main theme include a discovery by characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil but instead are more or less alike awaking out of a dream and into reality danger of hasty action or power of tragic fate none of these have widespread support however even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that play is full of several small thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below love romeo and juliet is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme save that of young love romeo and juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love since it is such an obvious subject of play several scholars have explored language and historical context behind romance of play on their first meeting romeo and juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in shakespeare s day metaphor by using metaphors of saints and sins romeo was able to test juliet s feelings for him in a non threatening way this method was recommended by baldassare castiglione whose works had been translated into english by this time he pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation woman could pretend she did not understand him and he could retreat without losing honour juliet however participates in metaphor and expands on it religious metaphors of shrine pilgrim and saint were fashionable in poetry of time and more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous as concept of sainthood was associated with catholicism of an earlier age later in play shakespeare removes more daring allusions to christ s resurrection in tomb he found in his source work brooke s romeus and juliet thumb left watercolor by john massey wright of act ii scene ii balcony scene in later balcony scene shakespeare has romeo overhear juliet s soliloquy but in brooke s version of story her declaration is done alone by bringing romeo into scene to eavesdrop shakespeare breaks from normal sequence of courtship usually a woman was required to be modest and shy to make sure that her suitor was sincere but breaking this rule serves to speed along plot lovers are able to skip courting and move on to plain talk about their relationship agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night in final suicide scene there is a contradiction in message in catholic religion suicides were often thought to be condemned to hell whereas people who die to be with their loves under religion of love are joined with their loves in paradise romeo and juliet s love seems to be expressing religion of love view rather than catholic view another point is that although their love is passionate it is only consummated in marriage which keeps them from losing audience s sympathy play arguably equates love and sex with death throughout story both romeo and juliet along with other characters about it as a dark being often equating it with a lover capulet for example when he first discovers juliet s faked death describes it as having his daughter romeo and juliet ii v 38 42 juliet later erotically compares romeo and death right before her suicide she grabs romeo s dagger saying o happy dagger this is thy sheath there rust and let me die romeo and juliet v iii 169 170 fate and chance scholars are divided on role of fate in play no consensus exists on whether characters are truly fated to die together or whether events take place by a series of unlucky chances arguments in favour of fate often refer to description of lovers as star cross d this phrase seems to hint that stars have predetermined lovers future john w draper points out parallels between elizabethan belief in four humours and main characters of play for example tybalt as a interpreting text in light of humours reduces amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences still other scholars see play as a series of unlucky chances many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all but an emotional melodrama ruth nevo believes high degree to which chance is stressed in narrative makes romeo and juliet a lesser tragedy of happenstance not of character for example romeo s challenging tybalt is not impulsive it is after mercutio s death expected action to take in this scene nevo reads romeo as being aware of dangers of flouting social norms identity and commitments he makes choice to kill not because of a tragic flaw but because of circumstance duality light and dark scholars have long noted shakespeare s widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout play caroline spurgeon considers theme of light as symbolic of natural beauty of young love and later critics have expanded on this interpretation for example both romeo and juliet see other as light in a surrounding darkness romeo describes juliet as being like sun romeo and juliet ii ii brighter than a torch romeo and juliet i v 42 a jewel sparkling in night romeo and juliet i v 44 45 and a bright angel among dark clouds romeo and juliet ii ii 26 32 even when she lies apparently dead in tomb he says her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light romeo and juliet i v 85 86 juliet describes romeo as day in night and whiter than snow upon a raven s back romeo and juliet iii ii 17 19 this contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols contrasting love and hate youth and age in a metaphoric way sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony for example romeo and juliet s love is a light in midst of darkness of hate around them but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of feuding is done in broad daylight this paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to moral dilemma facing two lovers loyalty to family or loyalty to love at end of story when morning is gloomy and sun hiding its face for sorrow light and dark have returned to their proper places outward darkness reflecting true inner darkness of family feud out of sorrow for lovers all characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events and things return to natural order thanks to love and death of romeo and juliet light theme in play is also heavily connected to theme of time since light was a convenient way for shakespeare to express passage of time through descriptions of sun moon and stars time time plays an important role in language and plot of play both romeo and juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in face of harsh realities that surround them for instance when romeo swears his love to juliet by moon she protests o swear not by moon th inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable romeo and juliet ii ii 109 111 from very beginning lovers are designated as star cross d romeo and juliet i 0 6 referring to an belief associated with time stars were thought to control fates of humanity and as time passed stars would move along their course in sky also charting course of human lives below romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in stars movements early in play and when he learns of juliet s death he defies stars course for him another central theme is haste shakespeare s romeo and juliet spans a period of four to six days in contrast to brooke s poem s spanning nine months scholars such as g thomas believe that time was especially important to shakespeare in this play as he used references to short time for young lovers as opposed to references to long time for older generation to highlight a headlong rush towards doom romeo and juliet fight time to make their love last forever in end only way they seem to defeat time is through a death that makes them immortal through art time is also connected to theme of light and dark in shakespeare s day plays were most often performed at noon or in afternoon in broad daylight this forced playwright to use words to create illusion of day and night in his plays shakespeare uses references to night and day stars moon and sun to create this illusion he also has characters frequently refer to days of week and specific hours to help audience understand that time has passed in story all in all no fewer than 103 references to time are found in play adding to illusion of its passage criticism and interpretation critical history thumb right portrait of earliest recorded critic of play samuel pepys by john oil on canvas 1666 earliest known critic of play was diarist samuel pepys who wrote in 1662 it is a play of itself worst that i ever heard in my life poet john dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of play and its comic character mercutio shakespear show d best of his skill in his mercutio and he said himself that he was forc d to kill him in third act to prevent being killed by him criticism of play in 18th century was less sparse but no less divided publisher nicholas rowe was first critic to ponder theme of play which he saw as just punishment of two feuding families in mid century writer charles and philosopher lord kames argued that play was a failure in that it did not follow classical rules of drama tragedy must occur because of some character flaw not an accident of fate writer and critic samuel johnson however considered it one of shakespeare s most pleasing plays in later part of 18th and through 19th century criticism centred on debates over moral message of play actor and playwright david garrick s 1748 adaptation excluded rosaline romeo abandoning her for juliet was seen as fickle and reckless critics such as charles dibdin argued that rosaline had been purposely included in play to show how reckless hero was and that this was reason for his tragic end others argued that friar laurence might be shakespeare s spokesman in his warnings against undue haste with advent of 20th century these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as richard green moulton he argued that accident and not some character flaw led to lovers deaths dramatic structure in romeo and juliet shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have garnered praise from critics most notably abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy an example is punning exchange between benvolio and mercutio just before tybalt arrives before mercutio s death in act three play is largely a comedy after his accidental demise play suddenly becomes serious and takes on a tragic tone when romeo is banished rather than executed and friar laurence offers juliet a plan to reunite her with romeo audience can still hope that all will end well they are in a breathless state of suspense by opening of last scene in tomb if romeo is delayed long enough for friar to arrive he and juliet may yet be saved these shifts from hope to despair reprieve and new hope serve to emphasise tragedy when final hope fails and both lovers die at end shakespeare also uses sub plots to offer a clearer view of actions of main characters for example when play begins romeo is in love with rosaline who has refused all of his advances romeo s infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for juliet this provides a comparison through which audience can see seriousness of romeo and juliet s love and marriage paris love for juliet also sets up a contrast between juliet s feelings for him and her feelings for romeo formal language she uses around paris as well as way she talks about him to her nurse show that her feelings clearly lie with romeo beyond this sub plot of montague capulet feud whole play providing an atmosphere of hate that is main contributor to play s tragic end language shakespeare uses a variety of poetic forms throughout play he begins with a 14 line prologue in form of a shakespearean sonnet spoken by a chorus most of romeo and juliet is however written in blank verse and much of it in strict iambic pentameter with less rhythmic variation than in most of shakespeare s later plays in choosing forms shakespeare matches poetry to character who uses it friar laurence for example uses sermon and sententiae forms and nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech each of these forms is also moulded and matched to emotion of scene character occupies for example when romeo talks about rosaline earlier in play he attempts to use petrarchan sonnet form petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain as in romeo s situation with rosaline this sonnet form is used by lady capulet to describe count paris to juliet as a handsome man when romeo and juliet meet poetic form changes from petrarchan which was becoming archaic in shakespeare s day to a then more contemporary sonnet form using pilgrims and saints as metaphors finally when two meet on balcony romeo attempts to use sonnet form to pledge his love but juliet breaks it by saying dost thou love me romeo and juliet ii ii 90 by doing this she searches for true expression rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love juliet uses monosyllabic words with romeo but uses formal language with paris other forms in play include an epithalamium by juliet a rhapsody in mercutio s queen mab speech and an elegy by paris shakespeare saves his prose style most often for common people in play though at times he uses it for other characters such as mercutio humour also is important scholar molly identifies at least 175 puns and in text many of these jokes are sexual in nature especially those involving mercutio and nurse psychoanalytic criticism early psychoanalytic critics saw problem of romeo and juliet in terms of romeo s impulsiveness deriving from ill controlled partially disguised aggression which leads both to mercutio s death and to double suicide romeo and juliet is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of play make tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses norman holland writing in 1966 considers romeo s and juliet v i 1 11 as a realistic wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of romeo s adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral phallic and oedipal while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of author critics such as julia kristeva focus on hatred between families arguing that this hatred is cause of romeo and juliet s passion for each other that hatred manifests itself directly in lovers language juliet for example speaks of my only love sprung from my only hate romeo and juliet i v 137 and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of romeo s death this leads on to speculation as to playwright s psychology in particular to a consideration of shakespeare s grief for death of his son hamnet feminist criticism feminist literary critics argue that blame for family feud lies in verona s patriarchal society for coppelia kahn for example strict masculine code of violence imposed on romeo is main force driving tragedy to its end when tybalt kills mercutio romeo shifts into this violent mode regretting that juliet has made him so effeminate romeo and juliet iii i 112 in this view younger males become men by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers or in case of servants their masters feud is also linked to male virility as numerous jokes about aptly demonstrate juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others such as friar to solve her problems for her other critics such as callaghan look at play s feminism from a historicist angle stressing that when play was written feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and advent of capitalism at same time emerging puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with evils of female sexuality than those of earlier eras and more sympathetic towards love matches when juliet dodges her father s attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for she is challenging patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time queer theory thumb right playbill from a 1753 production at theatre royal in drury lane starring david garrick a number of critics have found character of mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for romeo jonathan goldberg examined sexuality of mercutio and romeo utilising queer theory in queering renaissance 1994 comparing their friendship with sexual love mercutio in friendly conversation mentions romeo s phallus suggesting traces of homoeroticism an example is his joking wish to raise a spirit in his mistress circle letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjured it down romeo and juliet ii i 24 26 romeo s homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to rosaline a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring as benvolio argues she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate shakespeare s procreation sonnets describe another young man who like romeo is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual goldberg believes that shakespeare may have used rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way in this view when juliet says that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet romeo and juliet ii ii 43 44 she may be raising question of whether there is any difference between beauty of a man and beauty of a woman balcony scene balcony scene was introduced by da porto in 1524 he had romeo walk frequently by her house sometimes climbing to her chamber window and wrote it happened one night as love ordained when moon shone unusually bright that whilst romeo was climbing balcony young lady opened window and looking out saw him after this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other a few decades later bandello greatly expanded this scene diverging from familiar one julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking romeo to come to her window with a rope ladder and he climbs balcony with help of his servant julia and nurse servants discreetly withdraw after this nevertheless in october 2014 lois leveen speculated in atlantic that original shakespeare play did not contain a balcony word did not exist in english language until two years after shakespeare s death balcony was certainly used in thomas otway s 1679 play history and fall of caius marius which had borrowed much of its story from romeo and juliet and placed two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between romeo and juliet leveen suggested that during 18th century david garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of romeo and juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition legacy shakespeare s day thumb right richard burbage probably first actor to portray romeo romeo and juliet ranks with hamlet as one of shakespeare s most performed plays its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories even in shakespeare s lifetime it was extremely popular scholar gary taylor measures it as sixth most popular of shakespeare s plays in period after death of christopher marlowe and thomas kyd but before ascendancy of ben jonson during which shakespeare was london s dominant playwright date of first performance is unknown first quarto printed in 1597 says that it hath been often and with great applause plaid setting first performance before that date lord chamberlain s men were certainly first to perform it besides their strong connections with shakespeare second quarto actually names one of its actors will kemp instead of peter in a line in act five richard burbage was probably first romeo being company s actor and master robert goffe a boy first juliet premiere is likely to have been at theatre with other early productions at curtain romeo and juliet is one of first shakespearean plays to have been performed outside england a shortened and simplified version was performed in nordlingen in 1604 restoration and 18th century theatre all theatres were closed down by puritan government on 6 september 1642 upon restoration of monarchy in 1660 two patent companies king s company and duke s company were established and existing theatrical repertoire divided between them thumb left mary saunderson probably first woman to play juliet professionally sir william davenant of duke s company staged a 1662 adaptation in which henry harris played romeo thomas betterton mercutio and betterton s wife mary saunderson juliet she was probably first woman to play role professionally another version closely followed davenant s adaptation and was also regularly performed by duke s company this was a tragicomedy by james howard in which two lovers survive thomas otway s history and fall of caius marius one of more extreme of restoration adaptations of shakespeare debuted in 1680 scene is shifted from renaissance verona to ancient rome romeo is marius juliet is lavinia feud is between patricians and plebeians juliet lavinia wakes from her potion before romeo marius dies otway s version was a hit and was acted for next seventy years his innovation in closing scene was even more enduring and was used in adaptations throughout next 200 years theophilus cibber s adaptation of 1744 and david garrick s of 1748 both used variations on it these versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at time for example garrick s version transferred all language describing rosaline to juliet to heighten idea of faithfulness and downplay love at first sight theme in 1750 a battle of romeos began with spranger barry and susannah maria arne mrs theophilus cibber at covent garden versus david garrick and george anne bellamy at drury lane earliest known production in north america was an amateur one on 23 march 1730 a physician named bertrand placed an advertisement in gazette newspaper in

later performances to return to original storyline professional performances of shakespeare in mid 19th century had two particular features firstly they were generally star vehicles with supporting roles cut or marginalised to give greater prominence to central characters secondly they were pictorial placing action on spectacular and elaborate sets requiring lengthy pauses for scene changes and with frequent use of tableaux henry irving s 1882 production at lyceum theatre with himself as romeo and ellen terry as juliet is considered an archetype of pictorial style in 1895 sir johnston forbes robertson took over from irving and laid groundwork for a more natural portrayal of shakespeare that remains popular today forbes robertson avoided of irving and instead portrayed a down to earth

mercutio on stage john gielgud s new theatre production in 1935 featured gielgud and laurence olivier as romeo and mercutio exchanging roles six weeks into run with peggy ashcroft as juliet gielgud

increased historical realism in later productions olivier later compared his performance and gielgud s john all spiritual all spirituality all beauty all abstract things and myself as all earth blood humanity i ve always felt that john missed lower half and that made me go for other but whatever it was when i was playing romeo i was carrying a torch i was trying to sell realism in shakespeare

communicate with modern world he argued a production is only correct at moment of its correctness and only good at moment of its success brook excluded final reconciliation of families from his performance text throughout century audiences influenced by cinema became less willing to accept actors distinctly older than teenage characters they were playing a significant example of more youthful casting was in franco zeffirelli s old vic production in 1960 with john stride and judi dench which would serve as basis for his 1968 film zeffirelli borrowed from brook s ideas altogether removing around a third of play s text to make it more accessible in an interview with times he stated that play s twin themes of love and total breakdown of understanding between two generations had contemporary relevance recent performances often set play in contemporary world for example in 1986 royal shakespeare company set play in modern verona switchblades replaced swords feasts and balls
