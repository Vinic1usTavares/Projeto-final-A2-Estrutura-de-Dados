neptune is eighth and farthest known planet from sun in solar system in solar system it is fourth largest planet by diameter third most massive planet and densest giant planet neptune is 17 times mass of earth slightly more massive than its near twin uranus neptune is denser and physically smaller than uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere neptune orbits sun once every 164 8 years at an average distance of it is named after roman god of sea and has astronomical symbol a stylised version of god neptune s trident neptune is not visible to unaided eye and is only planet in solar system found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation unexpected changes in orbit of uranus led alexis bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet position of neptune was subsequently calculated from bouvard s observations independently by john couch adams and urbain le verrier after his death neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 september 1846 by johann galle within a degree of position predicted by le verrier its largest moon triton was discovered shortly thereafter though none of planet s remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until 20th century planet s distance from earth gives it a very small apparent size making it challenging to study with earth based telescopes neptune was visited by voyager 2 when it flew by planet on 25 august 1989 advent of hubble space telescope and large ground based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar like jupiter and saturn neptune s atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen though it contains a higher proportion of ices such as water ammonia and methane however similar to uranus its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock uranus and neptune are normally considered ice giants to emphasise this distinction traces of methane in outermost regions in part account for planet s blue appearance in contrast to hazy relatively featureless atmosphere of uranus neptune s atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns for example at time of voyager 2 flyby in 1989 planet s southern hemisphere had a great dark spot comparable to great red spot on jupiter these weather patterns are driven by strongest sustained winds of any planet in solar system with recorded wind speeds as high as because of its great distance from sun neptune s outer atmosphere is one of coldest places in solar system with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching temperatures at planet s centre are approximately neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system labelled arcs which was discovered in 1984 then later confirmed by voyager 2 history discovery thumb left upright galileo galilei some of earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope galileo s drawings on 28 december 1612 and 27 january 1613 contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be position of neptune on both occasions galileo seems to have mistaken neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close in conjunction to jupiter in night sky hence he is not credited with neptune s discovery at his first observation in december 1612 neptune was almost stationary in sky because it had just turned retrograde that day this apparent backward motion is created when earth s orbit takes it past an outer planet because neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle motion of planet was far too slight to be detected with galileo s small telescope in 2009 a study suggested that galileo was at least aware that star he had observed had moved relative to fixed stars in 1821 alexis bouvard published astronomical tables of orbit of neptune s neighbour uranus subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from tables leading bouvard to that an unknown body was perturbing orbit through gravitational interaction in 1843 john couch adams began work on orbit of uranus using data he had he requested extra data from sir george airy astronomer royal who supplied it in february 1844 adams continued to work in 1845 46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet thumb upright left urbain le verrier in 1845 46 urbain le verrier independently of adams developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots in june 1846 upon seeing le verrier s first published estimate of planet s longitude and its similarity to adams s estimate airy persuaded challis to search for planet challis vainly scoured sky throughout august and september meanwhile le verrier by letter urged berlin observatory astronomer johann gottfried galle to search with observatory s refractor heinrich d arrest a student at observatory suggested to galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of sky in region of le verrier s predicted location with current sky to seek displacement characteristic of a planet as opposed to a fixed star on evening of 23 september 1846 day galle received letter he discovered neptune just northeast of phi aquarii 1deg from where le verrier had predicted it to be about 12deg from adams prediction and on border of aquarius and capricornus according to modern iau constellation boundaries challis later realised that he had observed planet twice on 4 and 12 august but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up to date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations in wake of discovery there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between french and british over who deserved credit for discovery eventually an international consensus emerged that le verrier and adams deserved joint credit since 1966 dennis rawlins has questioned credibility of adams s claim to co discovery and issue was re evaluated by historians with return in 1998 of neptune papers historical documents to royal observatory greenwich after reviewing documents they suggest that adams does not deserve equal credit with le verrier for discovery of neptune that credit belongs only to person who succeeded both in predicting planet s place and in convincing astronomers to search for it naming shortly after its discovery neptune was referred to simply as planet exterior to uranus or as le verrier s planet first suggestion for a name came from galle who proposed name janus in england challis put forward name oceanus moore 2000 206 claiming right to name his discovery le verrier quickly proposed name neptune for this new planet though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by french bureau des longitudes in october he sought to name planet le verrier after himself and he had loyal support in this from observatory director francois arago this suggestion met with stiff resistance outside france french almanacs quickly reintroduced name herschel for uranus after that planet s discoverer sir william herschel and for new planet struve came out in favour of name neptune on 29 december 1846 to saint petersburg academy of sciences soon neptune became internationally accepted name in roman mythology neptune was god of sea identified with greek poseidon demand for a mythological name seemed to be in keeping with nomenclature of other planets all of which except for earth were named for deities in greek and roman mythology most languages today use some variant of name neptune for planet indeed in chinese vietnamese japanese and korean planet s name was translated as sea king star in mongolian neptune is called dalain van dalain van reflecting its namesake god s role as ruler of sea in modern greek planet is called poseidon poseidonas poseidonas greek counterpart of neptune see also greek article about planet in hebrew rhb from a biblical sea monster mentioned in book of psalms was selected in a vote managed by academy of hebrew language in 2009 as official name for planet even though existing latin term neptun is commonly used in maori planet is called named after maori god of sea appendix 5 planetary linguistics nineplanets org in nahuatl planet is called named after rain god tlaloc in thai neptune is referred both by its westernised name dao and is also named dao ketu star of ketu after descending lunar node ketu ketu who plays a role in hindu astrology status from its discovery in 1846 until discovery of pluto in 1930 neptune was farthest known planet when pluto was discovered it was considered a planet and neptune thus became second farthest known planet except for a 20 year period between 1979 and 1999 when pluto s elliptical orbit brought it closer than neptune to sun discovery of kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to debate whether pluto should be considered a planet or as part of kuiper belt in 2006 international astronomical union defined word planet for first time reclassifying pluto as a dwarf planet and making neptune once again outermost known planet in solar system physical characteristics thumb a size comparison of neptune and earth neptune s mass of 1 kg is intermediate between earth and larger gas giants it is 17 times that of earth but just 1 19th that of jupiter mass of earth is 5 kg giving a mass ratio mass of uranus is 8 kg giving a mass ratio mass of jupiter is 1 kg giving a mass ratio mass values from its gravity at 1 bar is 11 15 m s2 1 14 times surface gravity of earth and surpassed only by jupiter neptune s equatorial radius of 24 764 km is nearly four times that of earth neptune like uranus is an ice giant a subclass of giant planet because they are smaller and have higher concentrations of volatiles than jupiter and saturn in search for extrasolar planets neptune has been used as a metonym discovered bodies of similar mass are often referred to as neptunes just as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as jupiters internal structure neptune s internal structure resembles that of uranus its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10 of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20 of way towards core where it reaches pressures of about 10 gpa or about 100 000 times that of earth s atmosphere increasing concentrations of methane ammonia and water are found in lower regions of atmosphere thumb left internal structure of neptune mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 earth masses and is rich in water ammonia and methane as is customary in planetary science this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot dense fluid this fluid which has a high electrical conductivity is sometimes called a water ammonia ocean mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions and deeper down superionic water in which oxygen crystallises but hydrogen ions float around freely within oxygen lattice at a depth of 7 000 km conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on jupiter saturn and uranus very high pressure experiments at lawrence livermore national laboratory suggest that top of mantle may be an ocean of liquid carbon with floating solid diamonds core of neptune is likely composed of iron nickel and silicates with an interior model giving a mass about 1 2 times that of earth pressure at centre is 7 mbar 700 gpa about twice as high as that at centre of earth and temperature may be 5 400 k atmosphere thumb combined colour and near infrared image of neptune showing bands of methane in its atmosphere and four of its moons proteus larissa galatea and despina thumb a time lapse video of neptune and its moons at high altitudes neptune s atmosphere is 80 hydrogen and 19 helium a trace amount of methane is also present prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm in red and infrared portion of spectrum as with uranus this absorption of red light by atmospheric methane is part of what gives neptune its blue hue although neptune s vivid azure differs from uranus s milder cyan because neptune s atmospheric methane content is similar to that of uranus some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to neptune s colour neptune s atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions lower troposphere where temperature decreases with altitude and stratosphere where temperature increases with altitude boundary between two tropopause lies at a pressure of stratosphere then gives way to thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10 5 to 10 4 bars 1 to 10 pa thermosphere gradually transitions to exosphere thumb bands of high altitude clouds cast shadows on neptune s lower cloud deck models suggest that neptune s troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude upper level clouds lie at pressures below one bar where temperature is suitable for methane to condense for pressures between one and five bars 100 and 500 kpa clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form above a pressure of five bars clouds may consist of ammonia ammonium sulfide hydrogen sulfide and water deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about where temperature reaches underneath clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found high altitude clouds on neptune have been observed casting shadows on opaque cloud deck below there are also high altitude cloud bands that wrap around planet at constant latitude these circumferential bands have widths of 50 150 km and lie about 50 110 km above cloud deck these altitudes are in layer where weather occurs troposphere weather does not occur in higher stratosphere or thermosphere unlike uranus neptune s composition has a higher volume of ocean whereas uranus has a smaller mantle neptune s spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane such as ethane and stratosphere is also home to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide stratosphere of neptune is warmer than that of uranus due to elevated concentration of hydrocarbons for reasons that remain obscure planet s thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of about 750 k planet is too far from sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation one candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in planet s magnetic field other candidates are gravity waves from interior that dissipate in atmosphere thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust magnetosphere neptune resembles uranus in its magnetosphere with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its rotational axis at 47deg and offset at least 0 55 radii or about 13 500 km from planet s physical centre before voyager 2 arrival at neptune it was hypothesised that uranus s tilted magnetosphere was result of its sideways rotation in comparing magnetic fields of two planets scientists now think extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in planets interiors this field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of electrically conducting liquids probably a combination of ammonia methane and water resulting in a dynamo action dipole component of magnetic field at magnetic equator of neptune is about 14 0 14 g dipole magnetic moment of neptune is about 2 2 t m3 14 mt where rn is radius of neptune neptune s magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non dipolar components including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed dipole moment in strength by contrast earth jupiter and saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments and their fields are less tilted from polar axis large quadrupole moment of neptune may be result of offset from planet s centre and geometrical constraints of field s dynamo generator neptune s bow shock where magnetosphere begins to slow solar wind occurs at a distance of 34 9 times radius of planet magnetopause where pressure of magnetosphere counterbalances solar wind lies at a distance of 23 26 5 times radius of neptune tail of magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times radius of neptune and likely much farther climate thumb great dark spot top scooter middle white cloud and small dark spot bottom with contrast exaggerated neptune s weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems with winds reaching speeds of almost nearly reaching supersonic flow more typically by tracking motion of persistent clouds wind speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m s in easterly direction to 325 m s westward at cloud tops prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m s along equator to 250 m s at poles most of winds on neptune move in a direction opposite planet s rotation burgess 1991 64 70 general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs retrograde rotation at lower latitudes difference in flow direction is thought to be a skin effect and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes at 70deg s latitude a high speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m s neptune differs from uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on neptune during its 1989 flyby but no comparable phenomena on uranus during its 1986 fly by abundance of methane ethane and acetylene at neptune s equator is 10 100 times greater than at poles this is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at equator and subsidence near poles because photochemistry cannot account for distribution without meridional circulation in 2007 it was discovered that upper troposphere of neptune s south pole was about 10 k warmer than rest of its atmosphere which averages approximately temperature differential is enough to let methane which elsewhere is frozen in troposphere escape into stratosphere near pole relative hot spot is due to neptune s axial tilt which has exposed south pole to sun for last quarter of neptune s year or roughly 40 earth years as neptune slowly moves towards opposite side of sun south pole will be darkened and north pole illuminated causing methane release to shift to north pole because of seasonal changes cloud bands in southern hemisphere of neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo this trend was first seen in 1980 and is expected to last until about 2020 long orbital period of neptune results in seasons lasting forty years storms in 1989 great dark spot an anti cyclonic storm system spanning 13 000 x 6 600 km was discovered by nasa s voyager 2 spacecraft storm resembled great red spot of jupiter some five years later on 2 november 1994 hubble space telescope did not see great dark spot on planet instead a new storm similar to great dark spot was found in neptune s northern hemisphere scooter is another storm a white cloud group farther south than great dark spot this nickname first arose during months leading up to voyager 2 encounter in 1989 when they were observed moving at speeds faster than great dark spot and images acquired later would subsequently reveal presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by voyager 2 small dark spot is a southern cyclonic storm second most intense storm observed during 1989 encounter it was initially completely dark but as voyager 2 approached planet a bright core developed and can be seen in most of highest resolution images neptune s dark spots are thought to occur in troposphere at lower altitudes than brighter cloud features so they appear as holes in upper cloud decks as they are stable features that can persist for several months they are thought to be vortex structures often associated with dark spots are brighter persistent methane clouds that form around tropopause layer persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism internal heating thumb upright four images taken a few hours apart with nasa esa hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 neptune s more varied weather when compared to uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating although neptune lies over 50 farther from sun than uranus and receives only 40 its amount of sunlight two planets surface temperatures are roughly equal upper regions of neptune s troposphere reach a low temperature of at a depth where atmospheric pressure equals temperature is deeper inside layers of gas temperature rises steadily as with uranus source of this heating is unknown but discrepancy is larger uranus only radiates 1 1 times as much energy as it receives from sun whereas neptune radiates about 2 61 times as much energy as it receives from sun neptune is farthest planet from sun yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive fastest planetary winds seen in solar system depending on thermal properties of its interior heat left over from neptune s formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain uranus s lack of internal heat while preserving apparent similarity between two planets de pater and jack j 2001 planetary sciences 1st edition p 224 orbit and rotation thumb left neptune red arc completes one orbit around sun centre for every 164 79 orbits of earth light blue object represents uranus average distance between neptune and sun is about 30 1 astronomical units au and it completes an orbit on average every 164 79 years subject to a variability of around 0 1 years perihelion distance is 29 81 au aphelion distance is 30 33 au jean meeus astronomical algorithms richmond

orbit since its discovery in 1846 although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in sky because earth was in a different location in its 365 26 day orbit because of motion of sun in relation to barycentre of solar system on 11 july neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to sun if more common heliocentric coordinate system is used discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011 bill at jpl numbers generated using solar system dynamics group horizons on line ephemeris system elliptical orbit of neptune is inclined 1 77deg compared to that of earth axial tilt of neptune is 28 32deg which is similar to tilts of earth 23deg and mars 25deg as a result neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to earth long orbital period of neptune means that seasons last for forty earth years its sidereal rotation period day is roughly 16 11 hours because its axial tilt is comparable to earth s variation in length of its day over course of its long year is not any more extreme because neptune is not a solid body its atmosphere undergoes differential rotation wide equatorial zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours which is slower than 16 1 hour rotation of planet s magnetic field by contrast reverse is true for polar regions where rotation period is 12 hours this differential rotation is most pronounced of any planet in solar system and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear orbital resonances thumb a diagram showing major orbital resonances in kuiper belt caused by neptune highlighted regions are 2 3 resonance plutinos nonresonant classical belt and 1 2 resonance neptune s orbit has a profound impact on region directly beyond it known as kuiper belt kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds similar to asteroid belt but far larger extending from neptune s orbit at 30 au out to about 55 au from sun much in same way that jupiter s gravity dominates asteroid belt shaping its structure so neptune s gravity dominates kuiper belt over age of solar system certain regions of kuiper belt became destabilised by neptune s gravity creating gaps in kuiper belt s structure region between 40 and 42 au is an example there do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can survive for age of solar system these resonances occur when neptune s orbital period is a precise fraction of that of object such as 1 2 or 3 4 if say an object orbits sun once for every two neptune orbits it will only complete half an orbit by time neptune returns to its original position most heavily populated resonance in kuiper belt with over 200 known objects is 2 3 resonance objects in this resonance complete 2 orbits for every 3 of neptune and are known as plutinos because largest of known kuiper belt objects pluto is among them although pluto crosses neptune s orbit regularly 2 3 resonance ensures they can never collide 3 4 3 5 4 7 and 2 5 resonances are less populated neptune has a number of known trojan objects occupying both sun neptune and lagrangian points gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing neptune in its orbit respectively neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1 1 resonance with neptune some neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits and are likely to have formed alongside neptune rather than being captured first object identified as associated with neptune s trailing lagrangian point was neptune also has a temporary quasi satellite object has been a quasi satellite of neptune for about 12 500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12 500 years formation and migration thumb a simulation showing outer planets and kuiper belt a before jupiter and saturn reached a 2 1 resonance b after inward scattering of kuiper belt objects following orbital shift of neptune c after ejection of scattered kuiper belt bodies by jupiter formation of ice giants neptune and uranus has proven difficult to model precisely current models suggest that matter density in outer regions of solar system was too low to account for formation of such large bodies from traditionally accepted method of core accretion and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation one is that ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive ob star an alternative concept is that they formed closer to sun where matter density was higher and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after removal of gaseous protoplanetary disc this hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured due to its ability to better explain occupancy of populations of small objects observed in trans neptunian region current most widely accepted explanation of details of this hypothesis is known as nice model which explores effect of a migrating neptune and other giant planets on structure of kuiper belt moons thumb upright natural colour view of neptune with proteus top larissa lower right and despina left from hubble space telescope neptune has 14 known moons hubble space telescope discovers fourteenth tiny moon orbiting neptune space military and medicine news com au 16 july 2013 retrieved on 28 july 2013 triton is largest neptunian moon comprising more than 99 5 of mass in orbit around neptune mass of triton 2 14 kg combined mass of 12 other known moons of neptune 7 53 kg or 0 35 mass of rings is negligible and it is only one massive enough to be spheroidal triton was discovered by william lassell just 17 days after discovery of neptune itself unlike all other large planetary moons in solar system triton has a retrograde orbit indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place it was probably once a dwarf planet in kuiper belt it is close enough to neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration it will eventually be torn apart in about 3 6 billion years when it reaches roche limit in 1989 triton was coldest object that had yet been measured in solar system with estimated temperatures of neptune s second known satellite by order of discovery irregular moon nereid has one of most eccentric orbits of any satellite in solar system eccentricity of 0 gives it an apoapsis that is seven times its periapsis distance from neptune thumb upright left neptune s moon proteus thumb a composite hubble image showing hippocamp with other previously discovered inner moons in neptune s ring system 232x232px from july to september 1989 voyager 2 discovered six moons of neptune of these irregularly shaped proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity although second most massive neptunian moon it is only 0 25 mass of triton neptune s innermost four moons naiad thalassa despina and galatea orbit close enough to be within neptune s rings next farthest out larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star this occultation had been attributed to ring arcs but when voyager 2 observed neptune in 1989 larissa was found to have caused it five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 a new moon and smallest yet hippocamp was found in 2013 by combining multiple hubble images because neptune was roman god of sea neptune s moons have been named after lesser sea gods planetary rings thumb neptune s rings neptune has a planetary ring system though one much less substantial than that of saturn rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon based material which most likely gives them a reddish hue three main rings are narrow adams ring 63 000 km from centre of neptune le verrier ring at 53 000 km and broader fainter galle ring at 42 000 km a faint outward extension to le verrier ring has been named lassell it is bounded at its outer edge by arago ring at 57 000 km first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by edward guinan in early 1980s analysis of this data along with newer observations led to hypothesis that this ring might be incomplete evidence that rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar occultation in 1984 when rings obscured a star on immersion but not on emersion images from voyager 2 in 1989 settled issue by showing several faint rings outermost ring adams contains five prominent arcs now named courage liberte egalite 1 egalite 2 and fraternite courage liberty equality and fraternity existence of arcs was difficult to explain because laws of motion would predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short timescales astronomers now estimate that arcs are corralled into their current form by gravitational effects of galatea a moon just inward from ring earth based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that neptune s rings are much more unstable than previously thought images taken from w m keck observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in rings when compared to images by voyager 2 in particular it seems that liberte arc might disappear in as little as one century observation alt neptune visible in night sky thumb right in 2018 european southern observatory developed unique laser based methods to get clear and high resolution images of neptune from surface of earth neptune brightened significantly between 1980 and 2000 apparent magnitude currently ranges from 7 67 to 7 89 with a mean of 7 78 and a standard deviation of 0 06 prior to 1980 planet was as faint as magnitude 8 0 neptune is too faint to be visible to naked eye and can be outshone by jupiter s galilean moons dwarf planet ceres and asteroids 4 vesta 2 pallas 7 iris 3 juno and 6 hebe see respective articles for magnitude data a telescope or strong binoculars will resolve neptune as a small blue disk similar in appearance to uranus moore 2000 207 because of distance of neptune from earth its angular diameter only ranges from 2 2 to 2 4 arcseconds smallest of solar system planets its small apparent size makes it challenging to study visually most telescopic data was fairly limited until advent of hubble space telescope and large ground based telescopes with adaptive optics ao in 1977 for example even rotation period of neptune remained uncertain first scientifically useful observation of neptune from ground based telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from hawaii first ground based adaptive optics observations of neptune and proteus planetary space science vol 45 no 8 pp 1031 36 1997 neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence combined with technological advancements ground based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it both hubble and adaptive optics telescopes on earth have made many new discoveries within solar system since mid 1990s with a large increase in number of known satellites and moons around outer planet among others in 2004 and 2005 five new small satellites of neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered uranus and neptune reports on astronomy 2003 2005 pp 147f from earth neptune goes through apparent retrograde motion every 367 days resulting in a looping motion against background stars during each opposition these loops carried it close to 1846 discovery coordinates in april and july 2010 and again in october and november 2011 neptune s 164 year orbital period means that planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each constellation of zodiac in 2011 it completed its first full orbit of sun since being discovered and returned to where it was first spotted 2deg northeast of iota aquarii due to precession of equinoxes position of iota aquarii has shifted 2deg west from where it was in 1846 so that planet returned to exact location of its discovery on 25 september 2011 rather than 164th anniversary two days earlier as of 2019 it is within 1deg of phi aquarii observation of neptune in radio frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field in infrared part of spectrum neptune s storms appear bright against cooler background allowing size and shape of these features to be readily tracked exploration thumb left a voyager 2 mosaic of triton voyager 2 is only spacecraft that has visited neptune spacecraft closest approach to planet occurred on 25 august 1989 because this was last major planet spacecraft could visit it was decided to make a close flyby of moon triton regardless of consequences to trajectory similarly to what was done for voyager 1s encounter with saturn and its moon titan images relayed back to earth from voyager 2 became basis of a 1989 pbs all night program neptune all night during encounter signals from spacecraft required 246 minutes to reach earth hence for most part voyager 2 mission relied on preloaded commands for neptune encounter spacecraft performed a near encounter with moon nereid before it came within 4 400 km of neptune s atmosphere on 25 august then passed close to planet s largest moon triton later same day burgess 1991 46 55 spacecraft verified existence of a magnetic field surrounding planet and discovered that field was offset from centre and tilted in a manner similar to field around uranus neptune s rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and voyager 2 also showed that neptune had a surprisingly active weather system six new moons were discovered and planet was shown to have more than one ring flyby also provided first accurate measurement of neptune s mass which was found to be 0 5 percent less than previously calculated

probes mission that does cassini level science another more recent proposal was for argo a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019 that would visit jupiter saturn neptune and a kuiper belt object
