toucan barbet semnornis ramphastinus is a barbet native to western ecuador and colombia along with prong billed barbet it forms family semnornithidae and is closely related to toucans it is a medium sized barbet with a robust yellow bill it has striking plumage having a black head with grey throat and nape red breast and upper belly yellow lower belly and grey wings and tail toucan barbet is native to humid montane forests where it occupies all levels of canopy and is found in both primary and secondary forests as well as forest edges it is social living in small family groups which work together to defend their territories and raise chicks communally it feeds on fruit and a range of animal prey with insects being an important part of diet of chicks it sometimes joins mixed species feeding flocks chicks are raised in cavities dug into large usually dead trees young toucan barbets are preyed upon by plate billed mountain toucans species is considered to be near threatened mainly due to trapping for cage bird trade it has also declined due to habitat loss particularly loss of large trees in which to breed although species is adaptable if left unmolested taxonomy and systematics toucan barbet was described by scottish naturalist william jardine who placed it in new genus specific name ramphastinus is modern latin for toucan like based on linnaeus genus 1758 in 1899 charles richmond of united states national museum discovered that genus name was preoccupied meaning it had been used earlier for another genus and placed toucan barbet and its sister species prong billed barbet semnornis in a new genus pan after ancient god of forest following year richmond issued a correction as name he had chosen was itself preoccupied by chimpanzees and erected a new genus semnornis for two species historically toucan barbet was placed with other barbets in large family this family included african and asian representatives dna studies published in 1994 and 1999 and an examination of morphology of family in 1988 found that this arrangement was paraphyletic as new world barbets are more closely related to toucans family ramphastidae than they are to old world barbets in particular a close phylogenetic relationship between genus semnornis which contains toucan barbet and toucans was found two lineages were more closely related to each other than even semnornis and other new world barbets this led to a breakup of barbet family and separate lineages are now considered to be distinct families toucan barbet is together with prong billed barbet now placed into family semnornithidae an alternative arrangement is to combine all barbets and toucans into a single family which due to priority would be toucan family ramphastidae two described subspecies are nominate race found in ecuador and subspecies s r caucae from columbia s r caucae named for cauca in columbia was described in 1941 by swedish ornithologist and explorer nils description thumb toucan barbet has a robust bill toucan barbet is a medium sized robust barbet of long and weighing beak is robust with a yellow maxilla and a light green mandible both with dark ends it is pronged at end though prongs are not noticeable in field plumage is colourful and includes a black crown mask and thin cervical collar species has long occipital feathers and a conspicuous white stripe behind eyes which has a bright red colored iris nape of neck is golden brown and becomes yellow towards rump throat upper breast and sides of nape are grayish blue lower breast and middle belly are bright red while lower belly is yellowish green wings and tail are grey subspecies s r caucae is very similar to nominate race but has less extensive red on breast both sexes are almost identical except for female s plumage being slightly less bright and female lacks tuft on black plumage of nape immature birds are duller than adults and do not develop prongs until they are 4 months old habitat and distribution thumb cloud forest in ecuador species is native to humid forests of western andes from andean slopes of northwest ecuador to southwest colombia at altitudes of it uses all forest strata showing some preference for upper canopy of forest and species also uses secondary forest and forest edge habitats evidence suggests that these birds are very specific in choosing trees for nesting it usually prefers old trees in family lauraceae as nesting trees of sufficient diameter are not very common in these forests habitat loss through logging is impacting species behavior and ecology toucan barbet is usually found in pairs or small groups perched silently on long horizontal branches making them hard to find unless active or singing flight is characterized by being hurried and noisy it usually lives in small groups of three to six individuals species is territorial with territories ranging between with an average of most of territory consists of mature forest although species can adapt to live in forests with small areas of secondary forest or pastures toucan barbet groups show a marked territorial behavior towards other groups or species which is usually made clear by loud duets of breeding pairs and it is actively protected by breeding pair by chasing of intruders family group s helpers assist in this especially near nest in absence of interference these groups can occupy a particular territory for a year or longer calls and displays toucan barbet calls are unmistakable composed of loud shrieks that travel long distances it is usually sung in duet by breeding pair simultaneously or in syncope by both sexes during breeding season usually for territorial display frequency of calls changes with each season being more common at beginning of year and declining in frequency after april toucan barbet can also produce clicking sounds when nests are threatened by predators or competitor species that might steal nesting site members of group make a rattling call followed by pecking and knocking wood to drive competitor or predator away if this fails group will begin to mob intruder mobbing behavior is more common if a group is involved as opposed to just a pair feeding thumb toucan barbet feeding in ecuador species is frugivorous feeding on a variety of fruits mixed with other foods a comparison of diets of new world barbets found they were more frugivorous than other barbets and their diets were more similar to those of toucans 62 different species of fruit from 20 families have been reported as being eaten fruits of trees have been shown to be especially important as food sources as well as other food taken includes insects such as termites small reptiles nectar tree sap and flower petals exact composition of diet varies by season with insects being more commonly taken in april diet of nestlings has more insect prey than that of adults with 54 being fruit and 42 being insects toucan barbet forages for 12 hours of day around its territory foraging from ground level to up into canopy it forages in small groups of up to six birds and sometimes forms mixed flocks with tyrant flycatchers warblers tanagers and other frugivores breeding toucan barbet is unusual among frugivorous birds in that it breeds cooperatively with several helpers aiding dominant breeding pair with incubation and raising young groups are larger outside reproductive season but generally shrink to three individuals in season usually composed of previous immature offspring that stay with their parents and help with new hatchlings after breeding season group increases due to greater acceptance of non family members these helpers significantly increase reproductive success of breeding pair breeding season of toucan barbet is from february through to october pairs may have two or even three broods per year toucan barbet carves out holes in tree trunks with its powerful beak in which it roosts and nests nesting holes are usually dug into dead trees usually snags with broken trunks or more rarely in a dead branch in a living tree both sexes incubated eggs in nesting sites without helpers males took more of incubation and brooding duties than females incubation period lasts 15 days and hatchlings fledge after 45 days juveniles look very much like adults but have paler colors and black irises juveniles plumage is kept for at least 2 months after fledging predators and parasites thumb plate billed mountain toucans are nest predators of toucan barbets toucan barbet competes with plate billed mountain toucans for nesting sites and that species also preys on young toucan barbets in nest white faced capuchins and neotropical dwarf squirrels are also treated as threats to nesting sites by family groups little is known of its parasites but feather mites of genera and ramphastobius specifically ramphastobius have been found on them conservation species is classified as near threatened by iucn though still fairly common locally its populations have decreased due to habitat loss accelerated by massive logging operations deforestation cattle grazing and mining illegal trapping for local and international cage bird trade is considered to be main threat to this species as it is adaptable and can tolerate some habitat modification if left unmolested heavy trapping pressure and habitat fragmentation due to forest clearing are thought to be responsible for some localised extinctions of this species references external links toucan barbet calls xeno canto toucan barbet category birds of colombian andes
