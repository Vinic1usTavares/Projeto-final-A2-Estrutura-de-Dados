first acoustic guitar he bought his first electric guitar and built his own amplifier one story of how barrett acquired nickname syd is that at age of 14 he was named after an old local cambridge jazz double bassist sid beat barrett which claims syd barrett changed spelling to differentiate himself from his namesake mason nick inside out a personal history of pink floyd weidenfeld nicolson 2004 another account is that when he was 13 his schoolmates nicknamed him syd after he showed up to a field day at abington scout site wearing a flat cap instead of his scout beret because syd was a working class name he used both names interchangeably for several years his sister rosemary said he was never syd at home he would never have allowed it he was a scout with 7th cambridge troop and went on to be a patrol leader at one point at morley memorial junior school he was taught by mother of future pink floyd bassist roger waters later in 1957 he attended cambridgeshire high school for boys with waters his father died of cancer on 11 december 1961 less than a month before barrett s 16th birthday on this date barrett left entry in his diary blank by this time his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers eager to help her son recover from his grief barrett s mother encouraged band in which he played geoff mott and mottoes a band which barrett formed to perform in their front room waters and barrett were childhood friends and waters often visited such gigs at one point waters organised a gig a cnd benefit at friends meeting house on 11 march 1962 but shortly afterwards geoff mott joined boston crabs and mottoes broke up in september 1962 barrett had taken a place at cambridge technical college art department where he met david gilmour in late 1962 and early 1963 beatles made an impact on barrett and he began to play beatles songs at parties and at picnics in 1963 barrett became a rolling stones fan and with then girlfriend libby gausden saw them perform at a village hall in cambridgeshire at this point barrett started writing songs one friend recalls hearing effervescing elephant later to be recorded on his solo album barrett also around this time barrett and gilmour occasionally played acoustic gigs together barrett had played bass guitar with those without in mid 1963 and bass and guitar with blues next summer in 1964 barrett and gausden saw bob dylan perform after this performance barrett was inspired to write bob dylan blues barrett now thinking about his future decided to apply for camberwell college of arts in london barrett enrolled in college in summer of 1964 to study painting pink floyd years 1965 1968 starting in 1964 band that would become pink floyd evolved through various line up and name changes including abdabs screaming abdabs sigma 6 and in 1965 barrett joined them as tea set sometimes spelled t set when they found themselves playing a concert with another band of same name barrett came up with pink floyd sound also known as pink floyd blues band later pink floyd during 1965 they went into a studio for first time when a friend of richard wright s gave band free time to record during this summer barrett had his first lsd trip in garden of friend dave gale with ian moore and storm thorgerson during one trip barrett and another friend paul ended up naked in bath reciting no rules no rules that summer as a result of continued drug use band became absorbed in sant mat a sikh sect storm thorgerson then living on earlham street and barrett went to a london hotel to meet sect s guru thorgerson managed to join sect barrett however was deemed too young to join thorgerson sees this as a deeply important event in barrett s life as he was extremely upset by rejection while living near his friends barrett decided to write more songs bike was written around this time london underground blackhill enterprises and gigs while pink floyd began by playing cover versions of american r b songs by 1966 they had carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll which drew as much from improvised jazz after bob klose departed from band band s direction changed however change was not instantaneous with more improvising on guitars and keyboards drummer nick mason reflected it always felt to me that most of ideas were emanating from syd at time at this time barrett s reading reputedly included grimm s fairy tales tolkien s hobbit and lord of rings carlos castaneda s teachings of don juan and i ching during this period barrett wrote most of songs for pink floyd s first album and also songs that would later appear on his solo albums in 1966 a new rock concert venue ufo pronounced as you foe opened in london and quickly became a haven for british psychedelic music pink floyd house band was its most popular attraction and after making appearances at rival roundhouse manning 2006 p 2010 p 115 became most popular musical group of london underground psychedelic music scene by end of 1966 pink floyd had gained a reliable management team in andrew king and peter jenner towards end of october 1966 pink floyd with king and jenner set up blackhill enterprises to manage group s finances blackhill was staffed by lodgers jenner found in his road house and among others barrett s flatmate peter wynne wilson who became road manager however since he had more experience in lighting he was also lighting assistant king and jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal so at end of october they booked a session at thompson private recording studio in hemel hempstead king said of demos that was first time i realised they were going to write all their own material syd just turned into a songwriter it seemed like overnight king and jenner befriended american expatriate joe boyd promoter of ufo club who was making a name for himself as one of more important entrepreneurs on british music scene newly hired booking agent bryan morrison and boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings from morrison s agency band played a gig outside london for first time in november band performed first of many strangely named concerts music for simian hominids a multimedia event arranged by group s former landlord mike leonard at hornsey college of art they performed at free school for following two weeks before performing at versus ian smith event at roundhouse in december arranged by majority rule for rhodesia campaign and an oxfam benefit at albert hall band s biggest venue up to this point tonite lets all make love in london at beginning of 1967 barrett was dating jenny spires who would later marry future stars member jack monck however unknown to barrett spires had an affair with peter whitehead spires convinced whitehead who thought band sounded like bad schoenberg to use pink floyd in a film about swinging london scene so at cost of ps80 in january whitehead took band into john wood s sound techniques in chelsea with promoter joe boyd in tow here band recorded a 16 minute version of interstellar overdrive and another composition nick s boogie whitehead had filmed this recording which was used in film tonite let s all make love in london and later on video release of london 66 67 whitehead later commented about band that they were just completely welded together just like a jazz group piper at gates of dawn boyd attempted to sign band with polydor records however morrison had convinced king and jenner to try to start a bidding war between polydor and emi in late january boyd produced a recording session for group with them returning to sound techniques in chelsea again after bidding war idea was finished pink floyd signed with emi unusual for time deal included recording an album which meant band had unlimited studio time at emi studios in return for a smaller royalty percentage band then attempted to re record arnold layne but boyd version from january was released instead band s first studio album piper at gates of dawn was recorded intermittently between february and july 1967 in studio 3 at abbey road studios and produced by former beatles engineer norman smith by time album was released on 4 august arnold layne which was released months earlier on 11 march had reached number 20 on british singles charts despite being banned by radio london and follow up single see emily play had peaked at number 6 album was successful in uk hitting number 6 on british album charts their first three singles including their third apples and oranges were written by barrett who also was principal visionary author of their critically acclaimed 1967 debut album of eleven songs on piper barrett wrote eight and co wrote another two emi records ltd piper at gates of dawn insert health problems and departure from pink floyd through late 1967 and early 1968 barrett became increasingly erratic partly as a consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs such as lsd there is also speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia once described as joyful friendly and extroverted he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn and experienced hallucinations disorganized speech memory lapses intense mood swings and periods of catatonia although changes began gradually he went missing for a long weekend and according to several friends including wright came back a completely different person one of striking features of his change was development of a blank dead eyed stare he did not recognise old friends and often did not know where he was while on a tour of los angeles barrett is said to have exclaimed gee it sure is nice to be in las vegas many reports described him on stage strumming one chord through entire concert or not playing at all at a show at fillmore in san francisco during a performance of interstellar overdrive barrett slowly detuned his guitar audience seemed to enjoy such antics unaware of rest of band s consternation interviewed on pat boone s show during this tour barrett s reply to boone s questions was a blank and totally mute stare according to mason syd wasn t into moving his lips that day barrett exhibited similar behaviour during band s first appearance on dick clark s popular tv show american bandstand although surviving footage of this appearance shows barrett miming his parts of song competently during a group interview afterwards when asked two questions by clark barrett s answers were terse almost to point of rudeness though clark noted they had flown non stop from london to los angeles during this time barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick before a performance in late 1967 barrett reportedly crushed mandrax tablets and a tube of into his hair which subsequently melted down his face under heat of stage lighting making him look like a candle mason disputed mandrax portion of this story stating that syd would never waste good during their uk tour with jimi hendrix in november 1967 guitarist david o list from nice substituted for barrett on several occasions when he was unable to perform or failed to appear sometime around christmas barrett s schoolfriend david gilmour was asked to join band as a second guitarist to cover for barrett with idea of retaining a five member line up of band for a handful of shows gilmour played and sang while barrett wandered around on stage occasionally joining playing other band members soon grew tired of barrett s antics and on 26 january 1968 when waters was driving on way to a show at southampton university band elected not to pick barrett up one person in car said shall we pick syd up and another said let s not bother as barrett had up until then written bulk of band s material initial plan was to keep him in group as a non touring member as beach boys had done with brian wilson but this proved impractical gilmour subsequently became a full time member of band according to waters barrett came to what was to be their last practice session with a new song he had dubbed have you got it yet song seemed simple enough when he first presented it but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn they eventually realised that while they were practising it barrett kept changing arrangement he would then play it again with arbitrary changes and sing have you got it yet eventually they realised they never would and that they were simply bearing brunt of barrett s idiosyncratic sense of humour dilorenzo kris syd barrett careening through life trouser press february 1978 pp 26 32 waters called it a real act of mad genius thumb right barrett during music video for jugband blues barrett did not contribute material to band after a saucerful of secrets was released in 1968 of songs he wrote for pink floyd after piper at gates of dawn only one jugband blues made it to band s second album apples and oranges became a less than successful single and two others scream thy last scream and vegetable man were never officially released until 2016 in early years 1965 1972 box set as they were deemed too dark and unsettling feeling guilty for ousting their friend members of pink floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell barrett that he was no longer in band according to rick wright who lived with barrett at time wright had awful job of telling barrett that he was going out to buy cigarettes while he went off to play a gig he would return hours later to find barrett in same position sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers an incident later referenced in pink floyd s wall emerging from catatonia and unaware that a long period of time had elapsed barrett would ask have you got cigarettes barrett supposedly spent time outside recording studio in reception area waiting to be invited in he also showed up to a few gigs and glared at gilmour barrett played slide guitar on remember a day which had been first attempted during piper sessions and also played on set controls for heart of sun 1993 guitar world interview with david gilmour on 6 april 1968 group officially announced barrett was no longer a member same day band s contract with blackhill enterprises was terminated considering barrett to be musical brains of band blackhill enterprises retained barrett solo years 1968 1972 after leaving pink floyd barrett was out of public eye for a year dark star syd barrett clash music 27 june 2011 then in 1969 at behest of emi and harvest records he embarked on a brief solo career releasing two solo albums madcap laughs and barrett both 1970 and a single octopus some songs terrapin maisie and bob dylan blues reflected barrett s early interest in blues madcap laughs after barrett left pink floyd jenner followed suit he led barrett into emi studios to record some tracks in may that would later be released on barrett s first solo album madcap laughs however jenner said i had seriously underestimated difficulties of working with him by sessions of june and july most of tracks were in better shape however shortly after july sessions barrett broke up with girlfriend lindsay corner and went on a drive around britain in his mini ending up in psychiatric care in cambridge during new year 1969 a somewhat recovered barrett had taken up tenancy in a flat on egerton gardens south kensington london with post modernist artist duggie fields here barrett s flat was so close to gilmour s that gilmour could look right into barrett s kitchen deciding to return to music barrett contacted emi and was passed to malcolm jones then head of emi s new prog rock label harvest after norman smith and jenner declined to produce barrett s record jones produced it barrett wanted to recover jenner produced sessions recordings several of tracks were improved upon jones produced sessions started in april 1969 at emi studios after first of these sessions barrett brought in friends to help out humble pie drummer jerry shirley and jokers wild gilmour s old band drummer willie wilson for sessions gilmour played bass talking to barrett wasn t easy said jones it was a case of following him not playing with him they were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind a few tracks on album feature overdubs by members of band soft machine during this time barrett also played guitar on sessions for soft machine founder kevin ayers debut lp joy of a toy although his performance on religious experience later titled singing a song in morning was not released until album was reissued in 2003 one time barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off for an afternoon drive however he followed pink floyd to ibiza according to legend he skipped check ins and customs ran onto runway and attempted to flag down a jet one of his friends j ryan eaves bass player for short lived but influential manchester band york s ensemble later spotted him on a beach wearing messed up clothes and with a carrier bag full of money by this point during trip barrett had asked gilmour for his help in recording sessions after two of gilmour waters produced sessions they remade one track from soft machine overdubs and recorded three tracks these sessions came to a minor halt when gilmour and waters were mixing pink floyd s newly recorded album ummagumma to barrett s dismay however through end of july they managed to record three more tracks problem with recording was that songs were recorded as barrett played them live in studio on released versions a number of them have false starts and commentaries from barrett despite track being closer to complete and better produced gilmour and waters left jones produced track opel off madcap gilmour later said of sessions for madcap laughs upon album s release in january 1970 malcolm jones was shocked by substandard musicianship on gilmour and waters produced songs i felt angry it s like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind gilmour said perhaps we were trying to show what syd was really like but perhaps we were trying to punish him waters was more positive syd is a genius barrett said it s quite nice but i d be very surprised if it did anything if i were to drop dead i don t think it would stand as my last statement evelyn iggy eskimo rose 1947 2017 appeared nude on back of album s inner sleeve barrett second album barrett was recorded more sporadically than first with sessions taking place between february and july 1970 album was produced by david gilmour and featured gilmour on bass guitar richard wright on keyboard and humble pie drummer jerry shirley first two songs attempted were for barrett to play and or sing to an existing backing track however gilmour thought they were losing barrett ness one track rats was originally recorded with barrett on his own that would later be overdubbed by musicians despite changing tempos shirley said of barrett s playing he would never play same tune twice sometimes syd couldn t play anything that made sense other times what he d play was absolute magic at times barrett who experienced synaesthesia would say perhaps we could make middle darker and maybe end a bit middle afternoonish at moment it s too windy and icy these sessions were happening while pink floyd had just begun to work on atom heart mother on various occasions barrett went to spy on band as they recorded their album wright said of barrett sessions performances despite numerous recording dates for his solo albums barrett undertook very little musical activity between 1968 and 1972 outside studio on 24 february 1970 he appeared on john peel s bbc radio programme top gear playing five songs only one of which had been previously released three would be re recorded for barrett album while song two of a kind was a one off performance possibly written by richard wright barrett was accompanied on this session by gilmour and shirley who played bass and percussion respectively gilmour and shirley also backed barrett for his one and only live concert during this period gig took place on 6 june 1970 at olympia exhibition hall as part of a music and fashion festival trio performed four songs terrapin gigolo aunt effervescing elephant and octopus poor mixing left vocals barely audible until part way through last number at end of fourth song barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off stage performance has been bootlegged barrett made one last appearance on bbc radio recording three songs at their studios on 16 february 1971 all three came from barrett album after this session he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year although in an extensive interview with mick rock and rolling stone in december he discussed himself at length showed off his new 12 string guitar talked about touring with jimi hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with later years 1972 2006 stars and final recordings in february 1972 after a few guest spots in cambridge with ex pink fairies member twink on drums and jack monck on bass using name last minute put together boogie band backing visiting blues musician eddie guitar burns and also featuring henry cow guitarist fred frith trio formed a short lived band called stars though they were initially well received at gigs in dandelion coffee bar and town s market square one of their gigs at corn exchange in cambridge with mc5 proved to be disastrous a few days after this final show twink recalled that barrett stopped him on street showed him a scathing review of gig they had played and quit on spot despite having played at least one subsequent gig at same venue supporting free from his emi contract on 9 may 1972 barrett signed a document that ended his association with pink floyd and any financial interest in future recordings barrett attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by pete brown and former cream bassist jack bruce in october 1973 brown arrived at show late and saw that bruce was already onstage along with a guitarist i vaguely recognised playing horace silver tune later in show brown read out a poem which he dedicated to syd because he s here in cambridge and he s one of best songwriters in country when to his surprise guitar player from earlier in show stood up and said no i m not by end of 1973 barrett had returned to live in london staying at various hotels and in december of that year settling in at chelsea cloisters he had little contact with others apart from his regular visits to his management s offices to collect his royalties and occasional visit from his sister rosemary in august 1974 jenner persuaded barrett to return to abbey road studios in hope of recording another album according to john leckie who engineered these sessions even at this point syd still looked like he did when he was younger long haired sessions lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs barrett recorded 11 tracks only one of which to be titled was if you go don t be slow once again barrett withdrew from music industry but this time for good he sold rights to his solo albums back to record label and moved into a london hotel during this period several attempts to employ him as a record producer including one by jamie reid on behalf of sex pistols and another by damned who wanted him to produce their second album were all fruitless withdrawal to cambridge in 1978 when barrett s money ran out he moved back to cambridge to live with his mother he returned to live in london again in 1982 but lasted only a few weeks and soon returned to cambridge permanently barrett walked from london to cambridge until his death barrett received royalties from his work with pink floyd from each compilation and some of live and studio albums and singles that featured his songs gilmour said i made sure money got to him in 1996 barrett was inducted into rock and roll hall of fame as a member of pink floyd he did not attend ceremony according to a 2005 profile in book madcap by biographer and journalist tim willis barrett who had reverted to using his original name of roger continued to live in his late mother s semi detached home and had returned to painting creating large abstract canvases he was also said to have been an avid gardener and his main point of contact with outside world was his sister rosemary who lived nearby he was reclusive and his physical health declined as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes although barrett had not appeared or spoken in public since mid 1970s reporters and fans still travelled to cambridge seeking him despite public appeals from his family apparently barrett did not like being reminded about his musical career and other members of pink floyd had no direct contact with him however he did visit his sister s house in november 2001 to watch bbc omnibus documentary made about him reportedly he found some of it a bit noisy enjoyed seeing mike leonard of leonard s lodgers again calling him his teacher and enjoyed hearing see emily play again barrett made a final public acknowledgement of his musical past in 2002 his first since 1970s when he autographed 320 copies of photographer mick rock s book psychedelic renegades which contained a number of photos of barrett rock was perhaps last person in music industry with whom barrett kept in contact in 1971 rock conducted barrett s final interview before his retirement from music industry a few years later barrett subsequently visited rock in london several times for tea and conversation through 1978 they had not spoken in more than twenty years when rock approached barrett to autograph his photography book and barrett uncharacteristically agreed having reverted to his birth name roger from his stage name syd many years before he autographed book barrett death and aftermath barrett died at home in cambridge on 7 july 2006 aged 60 from

on alternative and punk music in general according to critic john harris to understand his place in modern music you probably have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside what remained of psychedelic 1960s given that clash and sex pistols had made brutal social commentary obligatory there seemed little room for any of creative exotica that had defined love decade until slowly but surely singing about dead end lives and dole queues began to pall and at least some of previous generation were rehabilitated barrett was best example having crashed out of pink floyd before advent of indulgent progressive rock and succumbed to a fate that appealed to punk generation s nihilism he underwent a revival barrett s decline had a profound effect on roger waters songwriting and theme of mental illness permeated pink floyd s later albums particularly 1973 s dark side of moon and 1975 s wish you were here which was a deliberate and affectionate tribute to barrett song shine on you crazy diamond and also 1979 s wall wish you were here partly about barrett borrows imagery of a steel rail from barrett s solo song if it s in you from madcap laughs album in
