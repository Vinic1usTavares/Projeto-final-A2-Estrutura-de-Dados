cyclone ernest was one of two intense tropical cyclones in 2004 05 south west indian ocean cyclone season eighth tropical disturbance of season ernest formed from a persistent area of thunderstorms in central indian ocean it initially moved southwestward intensifying into tropical storm ernest on january 20 while moving into mozambique channel after hitting mayotte storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph 10 minute winds off western coast of madagascar ernest weakened slightly before striking southwest portion of that country on january 23 producing widespread flooding and gusty winds next day cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on january 25 on mayotte ernest produced peak wind gusts of 98 km h 61 mph storm drew moisture away from malawi causing a nine day period of dry conditions a few days after ernest struck madagascar tropical storm felapi affected same region and produced further flooding combined effects of storms killed 78 people and left over 32 000 homeless widespread crop damage sparked food protests although world food programme provided an emergency supply of rice to affected residents meteorological history an area of convection persisted on january 16 to west of diego garcia and that day meteo france mf classified system as tropical disturbance 08 system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear it developed outflow and gradually organized prompting joint typhoon warning center jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on january 17 that day mf discontinued advisories after system briefly halted its development trend disturbance continued its movement to west southwest and on january 19 began intensifying that day jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 12s to north of northern coast of madagascar after continued development mf upgraded system to tropical storm ernest on january 20 after attaining tropical storm status ernest entered mozambique channel and turned to southwest it developed outflow on opposite sides of storm and an eye gradually became evident while strengthening ernest moved over mayotte and passed southeast of comoros by late on january 20 storm rapidly intensified over warm waters into a tropical cyclone equivalent of a 120 km h 75 mph hurricane around that time ernest had turned to south along western periphery of a ridge on january 22 mf upgraded storm into an intense tropical cyclone with peak winds of 165 km h 105 mph 10 minute winds when it was located off west coast of madagascar at around same time jtwc estimated ernest attained peak winds of 185 km h 115 mph 1 minute sustained while at peak intensity ernest was a small cyclone with gales extending 130 km 80 mi outward from well defined eye after maintaining peak winds for about 12 hours cyclone began weakening while turning to southeast on january 23 ernest made landfall on southwest coast of madagascar at itampolo with winds estimated at 130 km h 80 mph cyclone accelerated to southeast across island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm late on january 23 jtwc issued its last advisory after ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone early next day mf declared ernest extratropical and continued tracking it until storm dissipated on january 25 in southern indian ocean impact and aftermath storm first struck mayotte affecting island with gale force gusts for about six hours sustained winds reached 78 km h 48 mph and wind gusts peaked at 98 km h 61 mph effects on island were minimal cyclone ernest indirectly affected malawi located inland in southeast africa storm s circulation removed moisture from country and prevented any rainfall from occurring in southern part of country during a nine day period in southern madagascar cyclone produced high winds and heavy rainfall highest rainfall was a 24 hour total of and highest wind gust was both of which observed in toliara many fishermen in area were not aware of storm s approach and several of them died as a result about five days after cyclone ernest struck madagascar tropical storm felapi struck same general area causing additional flooding combined effects of ernest and felapi killed 39 people injured 104 and left 214 people missing as of february 25 2005 later death toll was finalized at 78 in international disaster database storms damaged 5 792 buildings and there were 32 191 people left homeless floods damaged about 4 483 hectares 11 078 acres of crop fields in southern madagascar portions of country faced shortages of rice due to crop damage from ernest as well as from cyclone gafilo in previous year this caused prices to increase resulting in street protests as a result world food programme provided 45 tons of rice to affected residents although persistent flooding disrupted relief work in general damage from ernest and felapi were less than that from gafilo in previous year madagascar s national emergency centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims references external links joint typhoon warning center jtwc meteo
