uganda tanzania war of 1978 79 included an air campaign as air forces of uganda and tanzania battled for air superiority and launched bombing raids in general conflict was focused on air to ground attacks and ground based anti aircraft fire only one dogfight is known to have occurred uganda army air force dominated air space during initial ugandan invasion of northwestern tanzania but achieved little due to bad co ordination with ground forces and a general lack of planning at same time it suffered increasingly heavy losses as pilots deserted and tanzanian anti aircraft defenses became more effective initiative thus switched to tanzania air defence command which supported country s counter offensive into uganda in conflict s later stages libyan arab republic air force intervened on side of uganda but failed to make a tangible impact uganda army air force was eventually destroyed on 7 april 1979 when tanzanian ground forces overran its main air base at entebbe remaining ugandan loyalist air pilots subsequently joined libyan military background to uganda tanzania war in 1971 colonel idi amin launched a military coup that overthrew president of uganda milton obote precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring tanzania tanzanian president julius nyerere had close ties with obote and had supported his socialist orientation amin installed himself as president of uganda and ruled country under a repressive dictatorship nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of new government and offered asylum to obote and his supporters with approval of nyerere these ugandan exiles organised a small army of guerillas and attempted unsuccessfully to invade uganda and remove amin in 1972 amin blamed nyerere for backing and arming his enemies and retaliated by bombing tanzanian border towns subsequent mediation resulted in signing of mogadishu agreement which established a demilitarised zone at border and required that both countries refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each others governments nevertheless relations between two presidents remained tense nyerere frequently denounced amin s regime and amin made repeated threats to invade tanzania uganda also disputed its border with tanzania claiming that kagera salient a stretch of land between official border and kagera river 18 miles to south should be placed under its jurisdiction maintaining that river made for a more logical border circumstances immediately surrounding outbreak of uganda tanzania war in 1978 remain unclear opposing forces uganda thumb left uganda s suicide strike command was equipped with mig 21s mig example pictured in service of bangladesh air force uganda army air force uaaf was established in 1964 with israeli aid its first aircraft was consequently of israeli origin and its initial pilots trained in israel as uganda s government forged closer links with eastern bloc uaaf began to acquire more aircraft as well as support in training from soviet union czechoslovakia and libya israeli aid initially continued as well uaaf was gradually expanded and several air bases were built following amin s coup in 1971 ugandan military began to deteriorate international support for amin s regime eroded over next years israel turned from an ally into an enemy and relations with soviet union and czechoslovakia worsened as well though they were not completely severed foreign supply of aircraft and spare parts for uaaf was gradually cut off as result it became increasingly difficult to maintain uaaf s fighters at same time tribalism corruption and repeated purges negatively affected military s combat capabilities furthermore israeli initiated operation entebbe resulted in destruction of a quarter of uaaf in 1976 amin s regime subsequently received a substantial number of replacement mig 21s from soviet union and libya by late 1978 uaaf was commanded by lieutenant colonel christopher gore and consisted of several dozen mig 21mfs mig 21ums mig 17s and mig some of available aircraft were not combat ready however and were abandoned during uganda tanzania war without seeing action lack of spare parts especially affected mig 15s and mig 17s uaaf was split into three fighter squadrons lieutenant colonel andrew mukooza commanded mig 17 squadron while lieutenant colonel ali kiiza led mig 21 squadron which was called suicide strike command and nicknamed at least some of suicide strike command s pilots were possibly libyan trained palestinians palestine liberation organization plo was known to train pilots for its own air force in uganda ugandan military also possessed a single lockheed c 130 hercules cargo transport overall uaaf employed about 600 personnel in addition ugandan military possessed man portable air defense systems manpads and nine radar stations for air defence tanzania thumb right tanzanian mig 21s at mwanza air base in 2010 tanzania established its air force as air wing kiswahili wa anga of tanzania people s defence force s tpdf air defence command in 1965 as it was following an international policy of non alignment tanzania procured aircraft and trainers from a variety of countries most notably china canada and soviet union by 1978 tanzanian air wing possessed 14 mig 21mfs two mig 21ums 22 shenyang j 5s f 5 12 shenyang j 6s f 6 as well as several transport and trainer aircraft furthermore country s air defence had access to sa 3 surface to air missiles sa 7 manpads 14 5mm and 37mm anti aircraft guns and ground support equipment including early warning radars air wing was eventually organised into three kikosi cha jeshi or kj brigades with each brigade focusing on one particular element of air warfare aircraft and helicopters 601 kj technical support 602 kj and air defence 603 kj fighter aircraft unit of 601 kj known as squadron 601 was based at mwanza air base mig 21s and air force base f 5s f 6s in 1978 air defence command employed approximately 1 000 personnel air campaign invasion of kagera in early september 1978 tanzanians noticed a high volume of ugandan air reconnaissance flights by middle of month ugandan aircraft began crossing into tanzanian airspace ugandan troops made their first incursion into tanzania on 9 october 1978 when a motorised detachment entered a tanzanian village only to be repulsed by artillery next day uaaf mig fighters bombed forests in kagera salient without effect on 18 october ugandan migs bombed bukoba capital of west lake region despite facing ineffectual tanzanian anti aircraft fire bombings caused little damage however explosions reverberations shattered windows and incited population to panic on 25 october uganda army attempted to invade northern tanzania ground attack was repulsed by artillery but uaaf migs continued to cross into tanzanian airspace where they were again harassed by ineffectual anti aircraft fire ugandan migs bombed bukoba and kyaka bridge a key crossing over kagera river on 21 and 27 october most of their bombs hit forests but one barely missed bukoba s hospital second attack prompted bukoba s residents to flee town thumb left tanzanian sa 7 manpad example pictured teams shot down several ugandan migs during war on 28 october first tanzanian reinforcements arrived in war zone among them was a team of six soldiers equipped with sa 7 manpads who took up position at kyaka and waited for enemy aircraft to enter their range at same time uaaf was ordered to bomb tanzania s field tactical headquarters at pilots selected for mission were lieutenant david omita lieutenant atiku lieutenant abusala and possibly lieutenant walugembe flying mig 21s they carried out sortie but as they returned to uganda crossed into air space protected by sa 7 team tanzanians promptly hit right wing of omita s plane he managed to safely eject just before his mig exploded and parachuted into a forest from there he managed to escape to mutukula in uganda amin s government admitted loss but downplayed it by claiming to have shot down several tanzanian fighters which had allegedly attempted to bomb ugandan cities furthermore amin promoted omita atiku abusala and walugembe to rank of captain on 30 october ugandan army launched a second invasion of northern tanzania tanzanian forces were overwhelmed and quickly withdrew south of kagera river fearing that tpdf could stage a counter attack across kyaka bridge ugandan commanders ordered it to be destroyed uaaf attacked crossing from 1 to 3 november these air strikes either missed or proved ineffective in contrast tanzanian sa 7 team advanced up to bridge and reportedly shot down several ugandan migs during these days after repeated failures by their air force ugandans finally employed a mining specialist who successfully destroyed kyaka bridge meanwhile tpdf s high command decided to redeploy a squadron of f 6s to mwanza as fighters approached air base on 3 november however they entered air space protected by a tanzanian sa 3 team as well as anti aircraft artillery latter had not been informed about redeployment and mistook f 6s for enemy fighters opening fire one aircraft was hit and its pilot akiirusha was killed another fighter diverted from its course and crashed after running out of fuel though its pilot safely ejected other f 6s braved anti aircraft fire and successfully landed at mwanza a monument was later built in honor of akiirusha several other tanzanian aircraft mostly migs were lost due to other accidents during war on 2 november nyerere declared war on uganda after some probes tpdf launched a counter offensive to retake kagera salient on 23 november encountering little resistance four uaaf migs carried out air strikes on that day two bombed landing strip at bukoba without causing much damage while two others were hit by anti aircraft fire during an attack on mwanza air base one plane crashed and its pilot atiku was taken prisoner after ejecting other mig was badly damaged by a sa 7 but its pilot ali kiiza successfully returned to entebbe air base mig 17 squadron commander andrew mukooza also flew an attack against targets in northern tanzania and was almost shot down by anti aircraft missiles ugandan government again claimed to have successfully defeated a tanzanian bombing raid during this time in fact no tanzanian aircraft entered ugandan air space until 1979 disintegration of uganda army air force thumb left map of uganda tanzania war following reconquest of kagera tpdf began to prepare an offensive into uganda uaaf had lost several fighters up to this point and opted to fly no more attacks into tanzania as result it missed opportunity to disrupt assembly of tanzanian troops as they amassed along border a large scale tanzanian artillery bombardment began on 25 december uaaf was ordered to respond but its attacks failed to destroy tanzanian artillery instead another ugandan mig was shot down by sa 7s in january 1979 tpdf began its advance into uganda on 21 january capturing and destroying border town of mutukula tanzanians then constructed an air strip in locale so transport aircraft could resupply troops at front lines after an initial rest and further preparations tanzanian forces along with allied ugandan rebels resumed their offensive uaaf continued to attack tanzanian led ground forces and supply bases during this time while tpdf s air wing began to make its first incursions into ugandan air space most fierce air combat of war occurred during battle of simba hills from 11 february 1979 uaaf repeatedly attacked tpdf troops at simba hills encountering heavy resistance from sa 7 teams tpdf later claimed to have shot down 19 ugandan aircraft tanzanian air wing also bombed ugandan positions during battle after two days of fighting simba hills fell to tanzanian led forces tpdf also captured lukoma air strip which had been used by uaaf migs to stage raids in tanzanian territory two ugandan mig 21s attacked lukoma air strip on 14 february in an attempt to destroy tanzanian transport aircraft raid was easily repelled by tpdf as tanzanian migs and ground forces responded and forced ugandans to flee on 27 february four uaaf mig 21s attempted to bomb mutukula air strip but three were reportedly shot down by sa 7s with one ugandan pilot taken prisoner following its devastating losses during february 1979 uaaf was effectively eliminated as a fighting force although it continued to fly missions in march only known dogfight of war took place as a tanzanian fighter shot down a uaaf mig 21 near along masaka road ugandan pilot was killed while successful tanzanian pilot remains unidentified on 4 march uaaf migs were fielded against ugandan rebels who were conducting a raid on border town of tororo forcing them to retreat into kenya by this point uaaf increasingly suffered from loss of manpower through deaths defections and desertions its commander christopher gore either fled to sudan or was killed in an ambush leaving andrew mukooza as acting commander of force an ugandan soldier interviewed by drum magazine stated that two pilots deserted with their mig 21s while others suffered from mental breakdowns according to ugandan journalist timothy kalyegira kiiza was one of those who reportedly deserted during war s later stages following kiiza s disappearance at least some ugandan soldiers falsely believed that he had been shot down in combat and died a lack of spare parts and competent mechanics further undermined uaaf s capabilities reportedly grounding remaining mig 15s and mig 17s libyan intervention and end of air campaign thumb right libyan tupolev tu 22 bomber in 1977 faced with repeated defeats amin s regime was in a critical position in response its ally libya intervened in war during second half of february sending an expeditionary force to bolster ugandan military libyan arab republic air force laraf ultimately flew in 4 500 troops as well as armour artillery and a substantial amount of supplies whether libyan force included a substantial number of combat aircraft is unknown according to africa research bulletin reliable reports indicated that libyans sent six dassault mirages and seven mig 21s to uganda historians tom cooper and adrien fontanellaz have argued that it is unlikely that libyan mig or dassault mirage 5 fighters were sent to uganda as these short range aircraft would have been forced to refuel several times to travel to eastern africa no such refueling stops for libyan fighter aircraft were reported it has been confirmed however that two to four libyan tupolev tu 22 bombers deployed to nakasongola air base in early march according to german newspaper der spiegel amin also asked japan s government to loan him kamikaze fighters in order to use them against tanzanians ugandan president was known for his eccentric and cruel humor so it is unclear if it was a serious request remnants of uaaf along with libyan bombers flew a number of unsuccessful air strikes during march and early april 1979 on 29 march one of strangest incidents of war took place as libyan president muammar gaddafi ordered one of tu 22s to attack mwanza this was supposed to intimidate tanzanian government into calling off invasion of uganda libyan bomber approached over lake victoria and aimed at destroying fuel depot at mwanza but completely missed its target its five anti personnel rockets instead hit saa island game sanctuary slightly injuring one worker and killing six antelopes as well as several birds another air strike by libyan tu 22s aimed at a military base south of ugandan tanzanian border was carried out just as poorly this time bombs fell close to town of in another country namely burundi following failed attacks several ugandan and libyan aircraft relocated from entebbe to airbases at nakasongola and gulu tanzanian air wing retaliated by successfully bombing fuel depots at kampala jinja and tororo on 1 april one air strike coincidentally hit and destroyed libya uganda development bank in jinja by chance amin was in town at time and panicked when bomb hit according to eyewitnesses he ran into street screaming destruction of development bank led many ugandan soldiers to believe that tanzanians had acquired special munitions that could hit select targets on command tanzanian mig 21 jets also raided entebbe air base strafing runway and setting part of terminal ablaze but ultimately failing to cause enough damage to halt libyan air lift in support of amin s regime radio uganda later announced that amin had said attacks by so called tanzanian air force will not escape a very heavy punishment radio uganda also claimed that amin said that bombings do not worry him at all and repeated that nyerere will regret consequences tpdf also attempted to disrupt libyan airlift by tricking incoming planes into landing at mwanza by sending messages to them on entebbe air base s radio frequency tanzanians ended this practice after one attempt having mistakenly misdirected and seized a belgian sabena cargo plane thumb left entebbe airport in 1994 after occupying mpigi tanzanian ground forces observed a high level of air traffic at entebbe air base and a large number of troops gathered around it their commanders decided to secure it before attacking kampala to end libya s support of uganda and eliminate hostile forces gathered there tanzanians started an artillery barrage on 6 april causing mukooza to flee via helicopter lieutenant colonel cyril orambi was left in command of entebbe air base on next day battle of entebbe took place and resulted in a decisive tanzanian victory a dozen uaaf mig fighters and one uganda airlines boeing 707 were disabled in attack and left on runway while a libyan c 130 laraf c 130h 116 was destroyed by an rpg 7 anti tank grenade launcher as it attempted to take off nine or ten fighters were deemed functional enough to be seized as war prizes they were flown to mwanza but one crashed on landing killing pilot next morning 200 365 uaaf personnel led by orambi surrendered to tpdf battle marked de facto end of uaaf most of its aircraft were destroyed or captured and air force personnel that managed to escape to air fields in jinja and nakasongola spread panic among ugandan forces there mass desertions and defections were consequence leaving mukooza with no means to continue fight with libyan forces having suffered heavily during battle nyerere decided to allow them to flee kampala and quietly exit war without further humiliation he sent a message to gaddafi explaining his decision saying that libyan troops could be airlifted out of uganda unopposed from airstrip in jinja most of them withdrew to kenya and ethiopia where they were repatriated tanzanian jets struck several military installations in kampala before ground attack on ugandan capital commenced one tanzanian fighter was reportedly shot down by ugandan anti aircraft fire over lake victoria during this time several members of uaaf were captured during fall of kampala on 10 11 april 1979 they were subsequently imprisoned in bukoba nakasongola air base was found deserted by tanzanian forces later that month they seized amin s personal gulfstream executive jet some ugandan mig pilots fled country two ugandan pilots deserted with their aircraft around mid april one landing and surrendering with his family at entebbe while other sought refuge at kilimanjaro international airport in tanzania mukooza surrendered on 24 april but was murdered by ugandan rebels in contrast kiiza was employed by new tanzanian backed ugandan government about 30 ugandan pilots were in soviet union for training when uganda tanzania war broke out after amin s government was overthrown they opted not to return to uganda and instead joined laraf war ended on 3 june 1979 when tanzanian ground troops secured last unoccupied portion of ugandan territory aftermath and analysis uaaf was left completely destroyed by war post war ugandan government attempted to rebuild air force over immediate following years but struggled due to lack of funds and only managed to acquire a few helicopters american journalist john darnton observed that war had proven that uaaf was a paper tiger american intelligence analyst kenneth m pollack praised libyan airlift in uganda as an impressive operation but criticised libya s incompetent deployment of aircraft in combat and its failure to use aerial reconnaissance renewed internal conflict stymied any efforts to properly restore a ugandan air force for decades by 1994 ugandan people s defence air force still suffered from shortages in equipment and manpower and was limited to just 100 personnel notes references citations works cited category
