railways when hays became general manager of gtr in 1896 it was near bankruptcy and under performing its rival canadian pacific railway cpr on advice of american financier j pierpont morgan gtr board selected hays as general manager to bring more aggressive american business practices to company he reorganized management of company and successfully negotiated running rights with cpr he also brought more efficiency to handling of accounts built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives these changes produced an era of greater success for railroad transcontinental railway right thumb 300px charles melville hays at time western prairies were being rapidly settled hays wanted to capitalize on trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad within borders of canada to run 3 600 miles from moncton new brunswick to prince rupert british columbia in 1900 he introduced a proposal to extend lines of grand trunk western an american subsidiary from chicago to winnipeg and thence to pacific however he was turned down by railroad s directors in london later that year hays left gtr to work for southern pacific but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation he returned to gtr to find that president sir charles rivers wilson had convinced board of directors to pursue transcontinental railway meanwhile government under sir wilfrid laurier had also decided to back project plans to construct transcontinental line were announced on november 24 1902 hays plan involved creation of a subsidiary line from winnipeg to prince rupert with government building line from new brunswick to winnipeg cabinet became weary of hays demands for subsidies but after negotiations between government and hays aided by railroad s president rivers wilson national transcontinental railway act was passed in 1903 it enabled incorporation of grand trunk pacific railway gtp government s portion of line would be called national transcontinental railway ntr there were problems with some of hays policies regarding gtp firstly he had planned to buy out canadian northern railway cnor but company resisted and instead provided competition secondly hays lacked support from board of directors in london he wanted to link gtr with gtp but board would not back this plan he thus proceeded on his own authority making commitments that would ultimately ruin both gtp and gtr thirdly hays faced opposition to his choice of prince rupert on island b c for western terminal because there was not much traffic there hays preferred location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in asia hays made construction of mainline his priority failing to develop feeder lines cnor and cpr joined forces to gain control of prairie traffic competition among three railroads led to canada s ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one this was to result in gtp s being starved of traffic even though it was arguably best of three it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable after construction on gtp began in 1905 hays started grand trunk pacific development company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along route of railway including melville saskatchewan which was named after him hays vision went beyond building of railway he also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across rocky mountains he hired famed architect francis from cpr to design a grand hotel chateau prince rupert at westernmost stop on railway in 1909 only 3000 people lived in prince rupert but anticipation of railroad caused it to grow rapidly despite rapidly rising cost of property and muddy environs city was incorporated in 1910 after rivers wilson retired as railroad s president in 1909 hays was appointed to fill position by 1910 grand trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in united states a strike put a stop to construction hays finally gave into workers demands but failed to re hire 250 previously fired strikers despite promising to do so he also denied workers their pensions causing one member of parliament to describe him as heartless cruel and tyrannical by 1912 cost of constructing railway was increasing with rising wages and price increases on materials while government refused to allow a rate increase another reason for mounting costs was hays insistence on building to very highest standards meanwhile cnor and cpr monopolized traffic in west in addition grand trunk which would be leasing ntr from government was responsible for paying back construction cost of that line hays began to fear insolvency titanic in april 1912 hays was in london soliciting financial support for gtp he was anxious to get back to canada for opening of chateau laurier in ottawa ontario named after prime minister laurier gala opening of this hotel was set for april 25 1912 hays had also received news that his daughter louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy additionally he might have had business with j bruce ismay chairman of white star line in any case ismay had invited hays to join

his son in law and his secretary remained and perished when ship sank along with 1 500 other titanic passengers and crew hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on evening of disaster deploring way steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever faster vessels he is said to have commented time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster one
