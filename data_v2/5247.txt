vitamin c also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate is a vitamin found in various foods and sold as a dietary supplement it is used to prevent and treat scurvy vitamin c is an essential nutrient involved in repair of tissue and enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters it is required for functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function it also functions as an antioxidant current evidence does not support its use for prevention of common cold there is however some evidence that regular use may shorten length of colds it is unclear whether supplementation affects risk of cancer cardiovascular disease or dementia it may be taken by mouth or by injection vitamin c is generally well tolerated large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort headache trouble sleeping and flushing of skin normal doses are safe during pregnancy united states institute of medicine recommends against taking large doses vitamin c was discovered in 1912 isolated in 1928 and in 1933 was first vitamin to be chemically produced it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system vitamin c is available as an inexpensive generic and over counter medication partly for its discovery albert szent gyorgyi and walter norman haworth were awarded 1937 nobel prizes in physiology and medicine and chemistry respectively foods containing vitamin c include citrus fruits kiwifruit broccoli brussels sprouts raw bell peppers and strawberries prolonged storage or cooking may reduce vitamin c content in foods biology significance vitamin c is an essential nutrient for certain animals including humans term vitamin c encompasses several vitamers that have vitamin c activity in animals ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements these release ascorbate upon digestion ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in body since forms according to ph oxidized forms of molecule such as dehydroascorbic acid are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents vitamin c functions as a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions in animals and humans that mediate a variety of essential biological functions including wound healing and collagen synthesis in humans vitamin c deficiency leads to impaired collagen synthesis contributing to more severe symptoms of scurvy another biochemical role of vitamin c is to act as an antioxidant a reducing agent by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non enzymatic reactions doing so converts vitamin c to an oxidized state either as acid or dehydroascorbic acid these compounds can be restored to a reduced state by glutathione and nadph dependent enzymatic mechanisms in plants vitamin c is a substrate for ascorbate peroxidase this enzyme utilizes ascorbate to neutralize excess hydrogen peroxide h2o2 by converting it to water h2o deficiency scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin c without this vitamin collagen made by body is too unstable to perform its function and several other enzymes in body do not operate correctly scurvy is characterized by spots on and bleeding under skin spongy gums corkscrew hair growth and poor wound healing skin lesions are most abundant on thighs and legs and a person with ailment looks pale feels depressed and is partially immobilized in advanced scurvy there are open suppurating wounds loss of teeth bone abnormalities and eventually death human body can store only a certain amount of vitamin c and so body stores are depleted if fresh supplies are not consumed notable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy were been conducted on conscientious objectors during world war ii in britain and on iowa state prisoners in late 1960s to 1980s men in prison study developed first signs of scurvy about four weeks after starting vitamin c free diet whereas in earlier british study six to eight months were required possibly due to pre loading of this group with a 70 mg day supplement for six weeks before scorbutic diet was fed men in both studies had blood levels of ascorbic acid too low to be accurately measured by time they developed signs of scurvy these studies both reported that all obvious symptoms of scurvy could be completely reversed by supplementation of only 10 mg a day uses thumb alt rows and rows of pill bottles on shelves vitamin c supplements at a drug store vitamin c has a definitive role in treating scurvy which is a disease caused by vitamin c deficiency beyond that a role for vitamin c as prevention or treatment for various diseases is disputed with reviews reporting conflicting results a 2012 cochrane review reported no effect of vitamin c supplementation on overall mortality it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines as one of most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system scurvy disease scurvy is caused by vitamin c deficiency and can be prevented and treated with vitamin c containing foods or dietary supplements it takes at least a month of little to no vitamin c before symptoms occur early symptoms are malaise and lethargy progressing to shortness of breath bone pain bleeding gums susceptibility to bruising poor wound healing and finally fever convulsions and eventual death until quite late in disease damage is reversible as healthy collagen replaces defective collagen with vitamin c treatment can be orally or by intramuscular or intravenous injection scurvy was known to hippocrates in classical era disease was shown to be prevented by citrus fruit in an early controlled trial by a royal navy surgeon james lind in 1747 and from 1796 lemon juice was issued to all royal navy crewmen infection thumb upright nobel linus pauling advocated taking vitamin c for common cold in a 1970 book effect of vitamin c on common cold has been extensively researched earliest publication of a controlled clinical trial appears to be from 1945 researchers continued to work on this question but research interest and public interest spiked after linus pauling two time awardee of nobel prize chemistry prize 1954 peace prize 1962 started publishing research on topic and also published a book vitamin c and common cold in 1970 a revised and expanded edition vitamin c common cold and flu was published in 1976 research on vitamin c in common cold has been divided into effects on prevention duration and severity a cochrane review which looked at least 200 mg day concluded that vitamin c taken on a regular basis was not effective in prevention of common cold at least 1000 mg day also made no difference however taking vitamin c on a regular basis did reduce average duration by 8 in adults and 14 in children and also reduced severity of colds a subset of trials reported that supplementation reduced incidence of colds by half in marathon runners skiers or soldiers in subarctic conditions another subset of trials looked at therapeutic use meaning that vitamin c was not started unless people started to feel beginnings of a cold in these vitamin c did not impact duration or severity an earlier review stated that vitamin c did not prevent colds did reduce duration did not reduce severity authors of cochrane review concluded that given consistent effect of vitamin c on duration and severity of colds in regular supplementation studies and low cost and safety it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them vitamin c distributes readily in high concentrations into immune cells has antimicrobial and natural killer cell activities promotes lymphocyte proliferation and is consumed quickly during infections effects indicating a prominent role in immune system regulation european food safety authority found a cause and effect relationship exists between dietary intake of vitamin c and functioning of a normal immune system in adults and in children under three years of age cancer there are two approaches to question of whether vitamin c has an impact on cancer first within normal range of dietary intake without additional dietary supplementation are people who consume more vitamin c at lower risk for developing cancer and if so does an orally consumed supplement have same benefit second for people diagnosed with cancer will large amounts of ascorbic acid administered intravenously treat cancer reduce adverse effects of other treatments and so prolong survival and improve quality of life a 2013 cochrane review found no evidence that vitamin c supplementation reduces risk of lung cancer in healthy people or those at high risk due to smoking or asbestos exposure a second meta analysis found no effect on risk of prostate cancer two meta analyses evaluated effect of vitamin c supplementation on risk of colorectal cancer one found a weak association between vitamin c consumption and reduced risk and other found no effect from supplementation a 2011 meta analysis failed to find support for prevention of breast cancer with vitamin c supplementation but a second study concluded that vitamin c may be associated with increased survival in those already diagnosed under rubric of orthomolecular medicine intravenous vitamin c is a contentious adjunctive cancer therapy widely used in and integrative oncology settings with oral administration absorption efficiency decreases as amounts increase intravenous administration bypasses this doing so makes it possible to achieve plasma concentrations of 5 to 10 liter mmol l which far exceed approximately 0 2 mmol l limit from oral consumption theories of mechanism are contradictory at high tissue concentrations ascorbic acid is described as acting as a pro oxidant generating hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to kill tumor cells same literature claims that ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant thereby reducing adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy research continues in this field but a 2014 review concluded currently use of high dose intravenous vitamin c as an anticancer agent cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial a 2015 review added there is no high quality evidence to suggest that ascorbate supplementation in cancer patients either enhances antitumor effects of chemotherapy or reduces its toxicity evidence for ascorbate s anti tumor effects was limited to case reports and observational and uncontrolled studies cardiovascular disease a 2013 meta analysis found no evidence that vitamin c supplementation reduces risk of myocardial infarction stroke cardiovascular mortality or all cause mortality however a second analysis found an inverse relationship between circulating vitamin c levels or dietary vitamin c and risk of stroke a meta analysis of 44 clinical trials has shown a significant positive effect of vitamin c on endothelial function when taken at doses greater than 500 mg per day endothelium is a layer of cells that line interior surface of blood vessels endothelial dysfunction is implicated in many aspects of vascular diseases researchers noted that effect of vitamin c supplementation appeared to be dependent on health status with stronger effects in those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease brain function a 2017 systematic review found lower vitamin c concentrations in people with cognitive impairment including alzheimer s disease and dementia compared to people with normal cognition cognitive testing however relied on mini mental state examination which is only a general test of cognition indicating an overall low quality of research assessing potential importance of vitamin c on cognition in normal and impaired people a review of nutrient status in people with alzheimer s disease reported low plasma vitamin c but also low blood levels of folate vitamin b12 and vitamin e other diseases studies examining effects of vitamin c intake on risk of alzheimer s disease have reached conflicting conclusions maintaining a healthy dietary intake is probably more important than supplementation for achieving any potential benefit a 2010 review found no role for vitamin c supplementation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis vitamin c supplementation does not prevent or slow progression of age related cataract side effects vitamin c is a water soluble vitamin with dietary excesses not absorbed and excesses in blood rapidly excreted in urine so it exhibits remarkably low acute toxicity more than two to three grams may cause indigestion particularly when taken on an empty stomach however taking vitamin c in form of sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate may minimize this effect other symptoms reported for large doses include nausea abdominal cramps and diarrhea these effects are attributed to osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin c passing through intestine in theory high vitamin c intake may cause excessive absorption of iron a summary of reviews of supplementation in healthy subjects did not report this problem but left as untested possibility that individuals with hereditary might be adversely affected there is a longstanding belief among mainstream medical community that vitamin c increases risk of kidney stones reports of kidney stone formation associated with excess ascorbic acid intake are limited to individuals with renal disease reviews state that data from epidemiological studies do not support an association between excess ascorbic acid intake and kidney stone formation in apparently healthy individuals although one large multi year trial did report a nearly two fold increase in kidney stones in men who regularly consumed a vitamin c supplement diet

and vegetables vitamin is most widely taken nutritional supplement and is available in a variety of forms including tablets drink mixes and in capsules plant sources while plant foods are generally a good source of vitamin c amount in foods of plant origin depends on variety of plant soil condition climate where it grew length of time since it was picked storage conditions and method of preparation following table is approximate and shows relative abundance in different raw plant sources as some plants were analyzed fresh while others were dried thus artificially increasing

approx 70 kg will manufacture more than 13 300 mg of vitamin c per day in normal health and levels manyfold higher when faced with stress animal sourced foods do not provide much vitamin c and what there is is largely destroyed by heat of cooking for example raw chicken liver contains 17 9 mg 100 g but fried content is reduced to 2 7 mg 100 g chicken eggs contain no vitamin c raw or cooked vitamin c is present in human breast milk at 5 0 mg 100 g and 6 1 mg 100 g in one tested sample of infant formula but cow s milk contains only 1 0 mg 100 g food preparation vitamin c chemically decomposes under certain conditions many of which may occur during cooking of food vitamin c concentrations in various food substances decrease with time in proportion to temperature at which they are stored cooking can reduce vitamin c content of vegetables by around 60 possibly due to increased enzymatic destruction longer cooking times may add to this effect another cause of vitamin c loss from food is leaching which transfers vitamin c to cooking water which is and not consumed broccoli may retain vitamin c during cooking or storage more than most vegetables supplements vitamin c dietary supplements are available as tablets capsules drink mix packets in multi vitamin mineral formulations in antioxidant formulations and as crystalline powder vitamin c is also added to some fruit juices and juice drinks tablet and capsule content ranges from 25 mg to 1500 mg per serving most commonly used supplement compounds are ascorbic acid sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate vitamin c molecules can also be bound to fatty acid palmitate creating ascorbyl palmitate or else incorporated into liposomes food fortification in 2014 canadian food inspection agency evaluated effect of fortification of foods with ascorbate in guidance document foods to which vitamins mineral nutrients and amino acids may or must be added voluntary and mandatory fortification was described for various classes of foods among foods classified for mandatory fortification with vitamin c were fruit flavored drinks mixes and concentrates foods for a low energy diet meal replacement products and evaporated milk food additives ascorbic acid and some of its salts and esters are common additives added to various foods mostly to retard oxidation relevant european food additive e numbers are

ascorbate approved for use as a food additive in eu u s u s food and drug administration and australia and new zealand calcium ascorbate approved for use as a food additive in eu u s and australia and new zealand potassium ascorbate approved in australia and new zealand but not in u s fatty acid esters of ascorbic acid such as ascorbyl palmitate approved for use as a food additive in eu u s and australia and new zealand pharmacology pharmacodynamics vitamin c specifically in form of ascorbate performs numerous physiological functions in human body by serving as an enzyme substrate and or cofactor and an electron donor these functions include synthesis of collagen carnitine and neurotransmitters synthesis and catabolism of tyrosine and metabolism of during biosynthesis ascorbate acts as a reducing agent donating electrons and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states vitamin c functions as a cofactor for following enzymes three groups of enzymes prolyl 3 hydroxylases prolyl 4 hydroxylases and lysyl hydroxylases that are required for hydroxylation of proline and lysine in synthesis of collagen these reactions add hydroxyl groups to amino acids proline or lysine in collagen molecule via prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase both requiring vitamin c as a cofactor role of vitamin c as a cofactor is to oxidize prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase from fe to fe and to reduce it from fe to fe hydroxylation allows collagen molecule to assume its triple helix structure and thus vitamin c is essential to development and maintenance of scar tissue blood vessels and cartilage two enzymes e n trimethyl l lysine hydroxylase and g hydroxylase that are necessary for synthesis of carnitine carnitine is essential for transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for atp generation hypoxia inducible factor proline dioxygenase enzymes isoforms and dopamine beta hydroxylase participates in biosynthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine alpha peptide hormones by removing residue from their c terminal glycine residues this increases peptide hormone stability and activity pharmacokinetics absorption from u s national institutes of health in humans approximately 70 90 of vitamin c is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30 180 mg day however at doses above 1 000 mg day absorption falls to less than 50 it is transported through intestine via both glucose sensitive and glucose insensitive mechanisms so presence of large quantities of sugar in intestine can slow absorption ascorbic acid is absorbed in body by both active transport and simple diffusion sodium dependent active transport sodium ascorbate co transporters svcts and transporters are two transporter proteins required for active absorption and import reduced form of ascorbate across plasma membranes and are glucose transporters and transfer only dehydroascorbic acid dha form of vitamin c although dehydroascorbic acid is absorbed in higher rate than ascorbate amount of dehydroascorbic acid found in plasma and tissues under normal conditions is low as cells rapidly reduce dehydroascorbic acid to ascorbate transport svcts appear to be predominant system for vitamin c transport in body notable exception being red blood cells which lose proteins during maturation in both vitamin c synthesizers example rat and non synthesizers example human cells with few exceptions maintain ascorbic acid concentrations much higher than approximately 50 micromoles liter umol l found in plasma for example ascorbic acid content of pituitary and adrenal glands can exceed 2 000 umol l and muscle is at 200 300 umol l known functions of ascorbic acid do not require such high concentrations so there may be other as yet unknown functions consequences of all this organ content is that plasma vitamin c is not a good indicator of whole body status and people may vary in amount of time needed to show symptoms of deficiency when consuming a diet very low in vitamin c excretion excretion can be as ascorbic acid via urine in humans during times of low dietary intake vitamin c is reabsorbed by kidneys rather than excreted only when plasma concentrations are 1 4 mg dl or higher does re absorption decline and excess amounts pass freely into urine this salvage process delays onset of deficiency ascorbic acid also converts reversibly to dehydroascorbate dha and from that compound non reversibly to 2 3 and then oxalate these three compounds are also excreted via urine humans are better than guinea pigs at converting dha back to ascorbate and thus take much longer to become vitamin c deficient chemistry name vitamin c always refers to of ascorbic acid and its oxidized forms such as dehydroascorbate dha therefore unless written otherwise ascorbate and ascorbic acid refer in nutritional literature to ascorbate and ascorbic acid respectively ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid structurally related to glucose in biological systems ascorbic acid can be found only at low ph but in solutions above ph 5 is predominantly found in ionized form ascorbate all of these molecules have vitamin c activity and thus are used synonymously with vitamin c unless otherwise specified numerous analytical methods have been developed for ascorbic acid detection for example vitamin c content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring volume of sample required to a solution of and then calibrating results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin c testing for levels simple tests are available to measure levels of vitamin c in urine and in serum or blood plasma however these reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content it has been observed that while serum or blood plasma concentrations follow a circadian rhythm or reflect short term dietary impact content within tissues is more stable and can give a better view of availability of ascorbate within entire organism however very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses biosynthesis vast majority of animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin c through a sequence of enzyme driven steps which convert monosaccharides to vitamin c yeasts do not make ascorbic acid but rather its acid in plants this is accomplished through conversion of mannose or galactose to ascorbic acid in animals starting material is glucose in some species that synthesize ascorbate in liver including mammals and perching birds glucose is extracted from glycogen ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis dependent process in humans and in animals that cannot synthesize vitamin c enzyme gulonolactone oxidase that catalyses last step in biosynthesis is highly mutated and non functional animal pathway thumb upright 1 75 vitamin c biosynthesis in vertebrates biosynthesis of ascorbic acid in vertebrates starts with formation of udp glucuronic acid udp glucuronic acid is formed when udp glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by enzyme udp glucose 6 dehydrogenase udp glucose 6 dehydrogenase uses co factor nad as electron acceptor transferase udp glucuronate removes a ump and with cofactor adp removes final phosphate leading to glucuronic acid aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using enzyme glucuronate reductase and cofactor nadph yielding gulonic acid this is followed by lactone carbonyl on c1 and hydroxyl group on c4 gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen catalyzed by enzyme gulonolactone oxidase which is nonfunctional in humans and other haplorrhini primates and cofactor fad this reaction produces 2 2 keto gulonolactone which spontaneously undergoes to form ascorbic acid figure 2 in natural history of ascorbic acid in evolution of mammals and primates and its significance for present day man stone i orthomolecular psychiatry 1972 1 82 89 some mammals have lost ability to synthesize vitamin c including simians and tarsiers which together make up one of two major primate suborders haplorrhini this group includes humans other more primitive primates strepsirrhini have ability to make vitamin c synthesis does not occur in most bats nor in species in rodent family that includes guinea pigs and capybaras but does occur in other rodents including rats and mice reptiles and older orders of birds make ascorbic acid in their kidneys recent orders of birds and most mammals make ascorbic acid in their liver a number of species of passerine birds also do not synthesize but not all of them and those that do not are not clearly related there is a theory that ability was lost separately a number of times in birds in particular ability to synthesize vitamin c is presumed to have been lost and then later re acquired in at least two cases ability to synthesize vitamin c has also been lost in about 96 of fish teleosts most tested families of bats order chiroptera including major insect and fruit eating bat families cannot synthesize vitamin c a trace of gulonolactone oxidase was detected in only 1 of 34 bat species tested across range of 6 families of bats tested there are at least two species of bats frugivorous bat rousettus and insectivorous bat hipposideros armiger that retain or regained their ability of vitamin c production some of these species including humans are able to make do with lower levels available from their diets by recycling oxidised vitamin c most simians consume vitamin in amounts 10 to 20 times higher than that recommended by governments for humans this discrepancy constitutes much of basis of controversy on current recommended dietary allowances it is countered by arguments that humans are very good at conserving dietary vitamin c and are able to maintain blood levels of vitamin c comparable with simians on a far smaller dietary intake perhaps by recycling oxidized vitamin c plant pathways thumb upright 1 75 vitamin c biosynthesis in plants there are many different biosynthesis pathways for ascorbic acid in plants most of these pathways are derived from products found in glycolysis and other pathways for example one pathway goes through plant cell wall polymers plant ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway most principal seems to be galactose galactose reacts with enzyme galactose dehydrogenase whereby lactone ring opens and forms again but with lactone between carbonyl on c1 and hydroxyl group on c4 resulting in galactonolactone galactonolactone then reacts with mitochondrial galactonolactone dehydrogenase to produce ascorbic acid ascorbic acid has a negative feedback on galactose dehydrogenase in spinach ascorbic acid by embryo of dicots plants is a well established mechanism of iron reduction and a step obligatory for iron uptake all plants synthesize ascorbic acid ascorbic acid functions as a cofactor for enzymes involved in photosynthesis synthesis of plant hormones as an antioxidant and also regenerator of other antioxidants plants use multiple pathways to synthesize vitamin c major pathway starts with glucose fructose or mannose all simple sugars and proceeds to l galactose l galactonolactone and ascorbic acid there is feedback regulation in place in that presence of ascorbic acid inhibits enzymes in synthesis pathway this process follows a diurnal rhythm so that enzyme expression peaks in morning to support biosynthesis later on when mid day sunlight intensity demands high ascorbic acid concentrations minor pathways may be specific to certain parts of plants these can be either identical to vertebrate pathway including glo enzyme or start with and get to ascorbic acid via l acid to l galactonolactone evolution ascorbic acid is a common enzymatic cofactor in mammals used in synthesis of collagen as well as a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species ros given that ascorbate has these important functions it is surprising that ability to synthesize this molecule has not always been conserved in fact anthropoid primates cavia guinea pigs teleost fishes most bats and some birds have all independently lost ability to internally synthesize vitamin c in either kidney or liver in all of cases where genomic analysis was done on an ascorbic acid origin of change was found to be a result of loss of function mutations in gene that codes for l g lactone oxidase enzyme that catalyzes last step of ascorbic acid pathway outlined above one explanation for repeated loss of ability to synthesize vitamin c is that it was result of genetic drift assuming that diet was rich in vitamin c natural selection would not act to preserve it in case of simians it is thought that loss of ability to make vitamin c may have occurred much farther back in evolutionary history than emergence of humans or even apes since it evidently occurred soon after appearance of first primates yet sometime after split of early primates into two major suborders haplorrhini which cannot make vitamin c and its sister suborder of non tarsier prosimians strepsirrhini wet nosed primates which retained ability to make vitamin c according to molecular clock dating these two suborder primate branches parted ways about 63 to 60 million years ago approximately three to five million years later 58 million years ago only a short time afterward from an evolutionary perspective infraorder tarsiiformes whose only remaining family is that of tarsier tarsiidae branched off from other since tarsiers also cannot make vitamin c this implies mutation had already occurred and thus must have occurred between these two marker points 63 to 58 million years ago it has also been noted that loss of ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels inability to break down uric acid also a characteristic of primates uric acid and ascorbate are both strong reducing agents this has led to suggestion that in higher primates uric acid has taken over some of functions of ascorbate industrial production vitamin c is produced from glucose by two main routes reichstein process developed in 1930s uses a single pre fermentation followed by a purely chemical route modern two step fermentation process originally developed in china in 1960s uses additional fermentation to replace part of later chemical stages reichstein process and modern two step fermentation processes use as starting material and convert it to sorbose using fermentation modern two step fermentation process then converts sorbose to 2 keto l gulonic acid through another fermentation step avoiding an extra intermediate both processes yield approximately 60 vitamin c from glucose feed in 2017 china produced about 95 of world supply of ascorbic acid vitamin c which is china s most exported vitamin having total revenue of us 880 million in 2017 due to pressure on chinese industry to discontinue burning coal normally used for vitamin c manufacturing price of vitamin c rose three fold in 2016 alone to us 12 per kg history folk medicine need to include fresh plant food or raw animal flesh in diet to prevent disease was known from ancient times native people living in marginal areas incorporated this into their medicinal lore for example spruce needles were used in temperate zones in infusions or leaves from species of drought resistant trees in desert areas in 1536 french explorer jacques cartier exploring st lawrence river used local natives knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy he boiled needles of arbor vitae tree to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin c per 100 grams scurvy at sea left thumb upright citrus fruits were among first sources of vitamin c available to ships surgeons in 1497 expedition of vasco da gama curative effects of citrus fruit were known as they sailed farther up east coast of africa they met local traders who traded them fresh oranges within six days of eating oranges da gama s crew recovered fully and he noted it pleased god in his mercy that all our sick recovered their health for air of place is very good infantile scurvy a historical perspective later a portuguese planted fruit trees and vegetables in saint helena a stopping point for homebound voyages from asia which sustained passing ships on returning lopes ship had left him on st helena where with admirable sagacity and industry he planted vegetables and nurseries with which passing ships were marvellously sustained there were wild groves of oranges lemons and other fruits that ripened all year round large pomegranates and figs santa helena a forgotten portuguese discovery harold livermore estudos em a luis antonio de oliveira ramos de da universidade do porto 2004 pp 630 631 authorities occasionally recommended plant food to prevent scurvy during long sea voyages john woodall first surgeon to british east india company recommended preventive and curative use of lemon juice in his 1617 book surgeon s mate john woodall mate london england edward griffin 1617 p 89 from page 89 or juice of lemons is most precious help that ever was discovered against scurvy to be drunk at all times in 1734 dutch writer johann bachstrom gave firm opinion that scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food and greens johann friedrich bachstrom observationes circa observations on scurvy leiden lugdunum batavorum netherlands conrad 1734 p 16 from page 16 sed ex nostra causa quae est absentia a vegetabilibus but this misfortune is explained very well by our supposed cause which is absence of lack of and abstinence from fresh vegetables scurvy had long been a principal killer of sailors during long sea voyages according to jonathan lamb in 1499 vasco da gama lost 116 of his crew of 170 in 1520 magellan lost 208 out of 230 all mainly to scurvy thumb upright james lind a british royal navy surgeon who in 1747 identified that a quality in fruit prevented scurvy in one of first recorded controlled experiments first attempt to give scientific basis for cause of this disease was by a ship s surgeon in royal navy james lind while at sea in may 1747 lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day in addition to normal rations while others continued on cider vinegar sulfuric acid or seawater along with their normal rations in one of world s first controlled experiments results showed that citrus fruits prevented disease lind published his work in 1753 in his treatise on scurvy in 1757 edition of his work lind discusses his experiment starting on page 149 fresh fruit was expensive to keep on board whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed vitamin especially if boiled in copper kettles it was 1796 before british navy adopted lemon juice as standard issue at sea in 1845 ships in west indies were provided with lime juice instead and in 1860 lime juice was used throughout royal navy giving rise to american use of nickname limey for british captain james cook had previously demonstrated advantages of carrying sour krout on board by taking his crews to hawaiian islands without losing any of his men to scurvy for this british admiralty awarded him a medal name antiscorbutic was used in eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for foods known to prevent scurvy these foods included lemons limes oranges sauerkraut cabbage malt and portable soup in 1928 canadian arctic anthropologist vilhjalmur stefansson showed that inuit avoid scurvy on a diet of largely raw meat later studies on traditional food diets of yukon first nations dene inuit and metis of northern canada showed that their daily intake of vitamin c averaged between 52 and 62 mg day comparable with estimated average requirement discovery thumb left alt two yellow and one red pepper with dozens of 500 mg white vitamin tablets in front of them albert szent gyorgyi wrote that he won a nobel prize after he found a way to mass produce vitamin c for research purposes when he lived in szeged which had become center of paprika red pepper industry vitamin c was discovered in 1912 isolated in 1928 and synthesized in 1933 making it first vitamin to be synthesized shortly thereafter reichstein succeeded in synthesizing vitamin in bulk by what is now called reichstein process this made possible inexpensive mass production of vitamin c in 1934 hoffmann la roche trademarked synthetic vitamin c under brand name and began to market it as a dietary supplement in 1907 a laboratory animal model which would help to identify antiscorbutic factor was discovered by norwegian physicians axel holst and theodor frolich who when studying shipboard beriberi fed guinea pigs their test diet of grains and flour and were surprised when scurvy resulted instead of beriberi by luck this species did not make its own vitamin c whereas mice and rats do in 1912 polish biochemist casimir funk developed concept of vitamins one of these was thought to be anti scorbutic factor in 1928 this was referred to as water soluble c although its chemical structure had not been determined thumb right upright albert szent gyorgyi pictured here in 1948 was awarded 1937 nobel prize in medicine for his discoveries in connection with biological combustion processes with special reference to vitamin c and catalysis of fumaric acid from 1928 to 1932 albert szent gyorgyi and joseph l svirbely s hungarian team and charles glen king s american team identified anti scorbutic factor szent gyorgyi isolated hexuronic acid from animal adrenal glands and suspected it to be antiscorbutic factor in late 1931 szent gyorgyi gave svirbely last of his adrenal derived hexuronic acid with suggestion that it might be anti scorbutic factor by spring of 1932 king s laboratory had proven this but published result without giving szent gyorgyi credit for it this led to a bitter dispute over priority in 1933 walter norman haworth chemically identified vitamin as hexuronic acid proving this by synthesis in 1933 haworth and szent gyorgyi proposed that l hexuronic acid be named a scorbic acid and chemically ascorbic acid in honor of its activity against scurvy term s etymology is from latin a meaning away or off from while scorbic is from medieval latin pertaining to scurvy cognate with old norse french dutch and low german partly for this discovery szent gyorgyi was awarded 1937 nobel prize in medicine and haworth shared that year s nobel prize in chemistry in 1957 j j burns showed that some mammals are susceptible to scurvy as their liver does not produce enzyme gulonolactone oxidase last of chain of four enzymes that synthesize vitamin c american biochemist irwin stone was first to exploit vitamin c for its food preservative properties he later developed theory that humans possess a mutated form of gulonolactone oxidase coding gene in 2008 researchers at university of montpellier discovered that in humans and other primates red blood cells have evolved a mechanism to more efficiently utilize vitamin c present in body by recycling oxidized dehydroascorbic acid dha back into ascorbic acid for reuse by body mechanism was not found to be present in mammals that synthesize their own vitamin c large doses vitamin c is a term describing consumption or injection of vitamin c in doses comparable to or higher than amounts produced by livers of mammals which are able to synthesize vitamin c theory behind this although not actual term was described in 1970 in an article by linus pauling briefly his position was that for optimal health humans should be consuming at least 2 300 mg day to compensate for inability to synthesize vitamin c recommendation also fell into consumption range for gorillas a non synthesizing near relative to humans a second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter umol l once consumption exceeds 1 250 milligrams as noted government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110 mg day and normal plasma is approximately 50 umol l so normal is about 25 of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in proposed range pauling popularized concept of high dose vitamin c as prevention and treatment of common cold in 1970 a few years later he proposed that vitamin c would prevent cardiovascular disease and that 10 grams day initially 10 days administered intravenously and thereafter orally would cure late stage cancer mega dosing with ascorbic acid has other champions among them chemist irwin stone and controversial matthias rath and patrick holford who both have been accused of making unsubstantiated treatment claims for treating cancer and hiv infection mega dosing theory is to a large degree discredited modest benefits are demonstrated for common cold benefits are not superior when supplement intakes of more than 1 000 mg day are compared to intakes between 200 and 1 000 mg day and so not limited to mega dose range theory that large amounts of intravenous ascorbic acid can be used to treat late stage cancer is some forty years after pauling s seminal paper still considered unproven and still in need of high quality research however a lack of conclusive evidence has not stopped individual physicians from prescribing intravenous ascorbic acid to thousands of people with cancer society and culture in february 2011 swiss post issued a postage stamp bearing a depiction of a model of a molecule of vitamin c to mark international
