gilli was an eleventh century hebridean chieftain whose career coincided with an era of orcadian overlordship in kingdom of isles according to mediaeval saga tradition gilli was a brother in law of sigurdr hlodvisson earl of orkney having married latter s sister hvarflod traditionally regarded as one of most powerful orcadian earls sigurdr appears to have extended his authority into isles in late tenth century gilli apparently acted as sigurdr s viceroy or tributary earl in region time frame of gilli s apparent authority in isles is uncertain and may date as early as reign of gudrodr haraldsson king of isles or as late as period following death of this man s eventual successor rognvaldr gudrodarson king of isles gilli s name is probably gaelic in origin and he seems to have seated himself on either coll or colonsay islands in inner hebrides it is possible that gilli is identical to gilla ciarain mac glun iairn an ui imair dynast who was slain at battle of clontarf in 1014 if not another possibility is that he was father of a certain conamal conmael who was killed in 980 earl in hebrides thumb upright alt map of britain and ireland locations relating to gilli s life and
