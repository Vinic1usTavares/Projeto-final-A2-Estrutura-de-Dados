shows glure concocts a dog show with a special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both american kennel club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing tasks of a british working sheepdog trial initially it seems like only dog who meets requirements is glure s recently purchased blue merle champion lochinvar iii however mistress is able to command lad through motions of trial lochinvar works primarily by hand signal so when glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through trial dog stops working and waits for glure s hand shaking to be explained dog is

fight lad manages to get close enough to house for bruce to hear battle and alert master and mistress master is forced to kill rex after crazed dog turns on him after four weeks recovering from his wounds lad is able to go outside again and wolf steps aside for him acknowledging he is still leader of place s dogs themes thumb right terhune wrote his stories in company of his collies including lad who is lying on ground in this photo alt a man sits on a swing writing on a crude desk two dogs rough collies sit on his left another lies on ground at his feet lad stories tended to follow a persistent formula that terhune used throughout most of his fiction main character was a noble almost saintly character that could engage in battle exact vengeance as needed and displayed supernatural intelligence loyalty and understanding of needs of his owners lad generally did battle with some villain human or another dog in defense of a helpless human or animal within each story terhune would speak in a positive authoritative tone while dispensing various tidbits of information about canine behavior and thought processes injecting himself and his wife anice into novel terhune positioned character of master as a just strict well intentioned but often rather bumbling man who could be overly sentimental and was balanced by wise calm and patient mistress one core theme of lad a dog is obtaining of perfect obedience without use of force through story characters attempts at explaining lad s inexplicable actions using mythologies of atavism terhune reflects his own views of an ideal relationship between a parent and child namely an ideology of noble instinct tempered by inflexible training an unknown third person narrator also reflects terhune s perspective and values regarding violence which is both repelled and embraced reflecting patriarchy and idea of a living creature that obeys unquestioningly and unhesitatingly novel indicates that perfect obedience and submission to a master s will can be obtained without needing violence or force indeed terhune regularly decries use of physical punishment to gain obedience for example in story his little son lad takes over raising of his son using an even tempered rational training system that reflects discipline and firm in end lad is stated to have a stronger love based relationship with his son versus that of pup with his mother temperamental lady lady raised their son using physical force to impose her will and thus after she leaves for a period she is forgotten by him as he holds no love for her within novel law forbids violence between inhabitants of place despite its seemingly unyielding nature it is in fact broken several times though always with good reason in story his mate lad meets and later must win heart of his mate lady lad is clearly enthralled by adult lady s sexual appeal as terhune seems reluctant to note facts of canine mating lady is never stated to actually go into heat instead relationship is framed within context of a human courtly love triangle when showy knave comes to place and lady forgets lad and fawns on new arrival when lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle master breaks rules against violence and intends to beat her lad in turn breaks rules of perfect obedience and growls becoming object of punishment and taking beating in her stead at end of story when master realizes he was mistaken he apologizes to lad for beating wrong dog despite novel s overall theme of nonviolence master s unreasonable attachment to bird becomes motivation for his cruelty toward helpless dogs yet lad perceives master s actions as reasonable and functional though numerous tenets of law forbid violence in various forms if dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with any amount of violence this change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in master and his having a childish fixation on having his own way showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered everyday life throughout many of stories a consistent theme is master s imposition of will behind which is blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants dogs of place are trained and commanded to control any violent outbursts against place s occupants or guests yet lad s engaging acceptable targets is written to glamorize use of violence throughout novel lad is victorious in battles against two thieves a runaway bull an invading negro and four other dogs including a battle against two dogs at once each of battles is referred to as a death match with intricate detail on tactics and strengths of a fighting collie terhune paints him as a noble savage who is human like but better than human and who worships and is worshiped by his humans another theme frequently reflected is that of breeding in several senses pedigree an inborn sense of manners and behavior and sex showcasing contemporary views of entitlement and noblesse oblige novel reflects terhune s place as a member of aristocracy and attempts to justify natural rights of well bred place is owned by a rich family that needs to be guarded against threats by foreigners thieves of all varieties negroes poachers and homeless within novel terhune notes provisions of guest law which reflect a fear of flotsam of american polity in character hamilcar q glure shows his dislike for nouveaux riches those with new money over those born and bred into wealth novel also focuses on competition in venues of dog shows and combat within novel despite disliking shows and being an old style collie lad s sheer noble nature enables him to win despite going preferences for more superficial qualities lad obeys law in part because of his heredity as a purebred and master considers himself a thoroughbred due to his having certain race characteristics that are ingrained in his blood frequently terhune references atavism attributing lad s calling upon hereditary instincts to presence of a strain of wolf in brains of all collies this idea also reflects power of humans over nature history albert payson terhune was an established newspaperman and author of several books in various genres including histories and thrillers when he penned his first canine short story his mate ray long then editor for red book magazine had jokingly suggested he write a story about lad one afternoon when reticent dog put his head on long s knee after having snubbed familiar visitor for last year having already tried to market idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years terhune readily agreed first story featured three rough collies lad lady and knave and used a similar formula to his previous works an average male lad protects a beautiful female lady from a larger villain knave long purchased work for red book for 200 and it was published in january 1916 issue four magazines requested similar stories and terhune complied finding them easy to write and sell additional stories all featuring lad and titled lad stories were published in saturday evening post ladies home journal hartford courant and atlantic monthly though red book remained his most consistent publisher by 1918 stories had grown in popularity and terhune was paid an average of 1 000 each for tales with some selling for as much as 2 500 though marketed as fiction even people who were acquainted with terhunes and lad reportedly believed that stories were real thumb upright left alt three graphics panel at top of a magazine page

story an advertisement in red book magazine 1918 for one of terhune s short stories on lad in 1918 long began urging terhune to publish a book of his dog stories though terhune himself was not convinced at first he considered them to be nothing more than hack writing and inferior to his other works even after long convinced him of public s love of works terhune initially did nothing towards goal later that year doubleday page which had published terhune s last novel fortune wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it wanting to escape from that publisher due to dismal performance of fortune terhune decided to follow long s suggestion so he could use book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation after he collected together twenty lad stories he had written so far he reorganized them into chapters and submitted book he was unsurprised that it was rejected but in rejection letter company referred to alfred ollivant s 1898 novel bob and jack london s 1903 novel call of wild as superior pieces of work as terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers he became determined that lad a dog would be published e p dutton s john macrae who was a known dog lover found stories simple but charming and felt public would like them greatly lad a dog was published by dutton in april 1919 a year after real life lad s death terhune continued receiving royalties for novel up through his own death his wife anice terhune ceased receiving royalties after she surrendered rights to them along with those of bruce and his dog in exchange for e p dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work across line a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband with this agreement dutton became sole owners of copyright to lad a dog macrae later decided that agreement was not completely fair to anice and modified it to provide her a payment of 100 a month for rest of her life likely exceeding profits they earned on novels as years passed real life lad thumb upright right alt a rectangular stone slab bearing lad s name and dates of birth and death lies above a rectangular plot of earth lined with concrete flowers are planted on grave and around slab lad s grave in sunnybank available evidence indicates that real lad was born in december 1902 and passed through hands of at least two owners before coming to sunnybank an article in a terhune family scrapbook indicates that he was likely a mature dog by time he arrived possibly not until after albert payson terhune had purchased pompton lakes new jersey property from his mother in 1909 unlike fictional lad he was not registered with american kennel club and was not a show dog his pedigree was reportedly lost by one of his previous owners though there was no doubt he was a purebred collie at one point terhune s wife anice claimed lad had twenty champion collies in his pedigree but this has never been confirmed on july 4 1917 lad was entered into a dog show despite having no papers on his pedigree it was only show he ever attended and he won veteran cup as in novel lad was extremely even hostile ly reserved with strangers wanting little to do with anyone outside of family terhune donated some of earnings from magazine stories to red cross and blue cross in lad s name earning collie honorary crosses of both groups when lad was fifteen he lost his hearing after which other dogs in residence began ignoring him and vice versa lad died on september 3 1918 having had a tumor in his heart for five years before his death lad s obituary was carried on a multi page spread of september 14 1918 issue of field and fancy magazine he was buried near driveway of sunnybank with honorary crosses he was awarded he was mourned by thousands of fans who had read terhune s stories with dozens of readers primarily children visiting sunnybank to see lad s grave in one season over 1 700

restore lad s grave which had fallen into disrepair and to aid in maintaining grounds of sunnybank reception original lad stories were well received by readers of their respective magazines after appearance of his mate in red book readers began demanding further stories editor ray long who initially purchased his mate considered story in day of battle to be one of top twenty to appear in red book during his time as its editor success of stories propelled terhune to fame enabling him to purchase sunnybank from his mother and quit a loathed job working for a newspaper to become a full time freelance writer although novel was initially ignored by critics within weeks it had become a hit according to terhune biographer it received praise from most of important critics of time american

released an unabridged audiobook edition in 1997 on cassette tape in 2006 alcazar released a cd version veteran dog breeders of times were primary critics of novel chastising terhune s depiction of an unrealistically perfect collie that would mislead public into believing such a dog could exist anniversary and subsequent editions featuring a sable and white collie also drew criticism from loyal readers as it did not resemble lad new york times book review reviewer alden welch felt full novel would surely appeal not only to all lovers and masters of dogs but to many who have never owned any and who have no general and indiscriminate liking for them he found stories interesting and a most welcome addition to dog literature praising novel as most delightfully written of terhune s works to date in 1968 sports illustrateds robert h boyle stated that terhune s stories were responsible for many of active collie breeders at time getting involved in sport calling author a godlike figure and hero of goggle eyed youngsters of 1920s 30s and even into 40s in comparing work to popular collie character lassie boyle noted that rather than having lassie s seeming immortality terhune s dogs led epic lives and they had epic deaths in fall 1996 issue of raritan quarterly review stephen d cox freely admitting to never having read book nonetheless called terhune a hack writer who lacked storytelling skill and denounced lad a dog as non literature with sentences that are insufferably stilted and hammy and have a tendency to wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions terming it a socially interesting work he concedes that novel has maintained intense and long lasting interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and desire to have a collie dog he quotes irving author of terhune s biography master of sunnybank stating that lad became dog we always wanted to have and never did maybe even more than that maybe he became friend we always waited to find or even brother or father in you re only young twice children s literature and film timothy morris felt novel had dated badly due to changes in american society and while he stated that he enjoyed work in comparing it to anna sewell s black beauty he faults lad a dog for lacking an autobiographical frame and for leaving readers guessing as to what is happening sequels and adaptations

death was published in george h doran in 1922 like first it went on to become a best seller praised by both new readers and existing fans critics however gave it more mixed reviews though some praised
