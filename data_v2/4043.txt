b calling it offbeat and cute zack handlen from a v club was mixed writing that handling of rape case left a bad taste in my mouth and that resolution was a bit fuzzy john keegan from critical myth gave episode a mixed review and awarded it a 6 10 noting overall this episode focused on a very interesting concept but execution of that concept is so hopelessly convoluted that it s lost in shuffle however using disturbing and abusive atmosphere of a nursing home as a setting provides chills without addition of sinister spirits so on a gut level episode works well sarah stegall awarded episode three stars out of five and noted could have gotten five stars out of five but that episode s lack of closure and presence of too many questions left unresolved caused it to be less than one of best episodes robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen gave episode a largely critical review and rated it one star out of five two referred to entry as idiot s version of earlier episode one breath shearman and pearson derided how episode handled rape element noting that there s a sour atmosphere to whole proceedings pointing out that only scully shows slightest concern that a woman s been sexually assaulted however two called ghost effects eerie but concluded that scripting was very stupid shearman and pearson p 41
