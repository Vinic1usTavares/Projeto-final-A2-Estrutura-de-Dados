lafayette dollar was a silver coin issued as part of united states participation in paris world s fair of 1900 depicting gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette with george washington and designed by chief engraver charles e barber it was only u s silver dollar commemorative prior to 1983 and first u s coin to depict american citizens beginning in 1898 prominent americans sought to erect in paris a monument to lafayette a frenchman who fought in american revolutionary war among these supporters was chicago businessman ferdinand peck whom president william mckinley chose as commissioner general to exposition peck made monument proposal a part of american plans for paris and appointed lafayette memorial commission to raise funds for it a part of this fundraising was one dollar commemorative coin approved by congress on march 3 1899 conjoined busts of washington and lafayette appear on obverse barber stated that bases for his work were a sculpture of washington by jean antoine houdon and an 1824 medal of lafayette by francois augustin caunois for reverse he used an early sketch of planned monument designed by paul wayland bartlett whose last name appears on base of statue on reverse coins did not sell out and 14 000 were later melted by united states treasury lafayette dollar is valued from several hundred dollars to tens of thousands depending on condition background gilbert du motier de la fayette was born on september 6 1757 to a noble french family when boy was less than two years old his father was killed at battle of minden making toddler a wealthy nobleman young marquis married in 1774 in 1775 while on military duty in metz lafayette heard of rebellion against british rule in north america young officer quickly came to believe that american cause was noble on learning that second continental congress lacked funds lafayette hired a ship at his own expense and in 1777 sailed for america though he initially received a cold reception from congress so many foreign officers had sought to be a part of continental army that its commanding general george washington asked that no more be engaged lafayette s application which sought no pay met with eventual success congress had received a letter from american envoy to france benjamin franklin stating that lafayette s family was wealthy and influential franklin urged congress to accommodate lafayette and also keep him safe and out of action lest his death harm american cause congress dutifully voted in july 1777 to commission lafayette as a major general and sent him to meet washington two men formed a very close relationship despite a quarter century difference in age franklin s wish to keep lafayette safe was frustrated by young man s desire to be where battles raged and he was wounded at battle of brandywine in september 1777 france soon entered war on american side and was instrumental in victory lafayette helped lead decisive yorktown campaign leading to surrender of british lieutenant general lord cornwallis lafayette returned to france after 1781 a national hero in both countries he returned to united states in 1784 his last visit for 40 years in france he involved himself in politics favoring a constitutional monarchy he was given office and commands after french revolution but was captured by austrians in 1792 remaining in captivity for five years after napoleon arranged his release lafayette remained on his estates and away from politics during emperor s rule after restoration of monarchy in 1815 he again engaged himself in politics sitting in chamber of deputies in 1824 american congress voted unanimously to have president james monroe invite lafayette to return as guest of nation marquis and his son george washington lafayette arrived in new york city to mammoth celebrations over next year and a half lafayette visited all 24 states he was given innumerable honors and gifts including land in florida marquis returned to france in 1825 and died in 1834 one of only eight people to be made an honorary citizen of united states according to arnie slabaugh in his book on commemorative coins lafayette became so popular and respected in both countries that friendship he helped cement between two nations has extended to this day inception in march 1898 a resolution was introduced in congress for a commission to erect a monument to lafayette in paris on behalf of united states bill passed senate and hearings were held before house committee on foreign affairs chicago businessman and philanthropist ferdinand peck testified in support of bill which though favored by committee was not considered by house due to higher priorities during spanish american war later in 1898 president william mckinley appointed peck as united states commissioner general to 1900 exposition universelle a world s fair to be held in paris france peck revived lafayette proposal as part of american participation in fair and created a lafayette memorial commission to supervise monument project commission was to ensure that monument was unveiled on july 4 1900 both independence day and also united states day at exposition on september 1 1898 peck appointed a number of prominent americans to commission including iowa senator william b allison secretary of state william r day archbishop john ireland and reverend edward everett hale commission s officers included treasurer comptroller of currency and future vice president of united states charles g dawes and secretary robert j thompson fundraising to build lafayette monument was a major component of commission s work and it sought to involve american schools and schoolchildren in project october 19 1898 117th anniversary of cornwallis s surrender at yorktown was proclaimed first lafayette day by 42 governors or commissioners of education of states or territories although president mckinley did not issue a similar proclamation he did praise plan in a letter printed in press special ceremonies in honor of lafayette along with appropriate lesson plans were observed in many schools and pupils were called upon to donate cents in honor of french patriot a total of 45 858 30 was obtained from events at schools those institutions were furnished on next lafayette day intended to be annual with ornate receipts signed by dawes and meant as to descend to posterity another proposed means of paying for statue was a commemorative coin in early 1899 commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of 50 000 in form of 100 000 commemorative half dollars that could be sold to public at a premium such a method had helped to finance though with mixed success 1893 world s columbian exposition in chicago instead congress passed and mckinley signed on march 3 1899 a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50 000 silver one dollar pieces to be granted to commission bullion for striking was to be purchased on open market and was not to come from mint s remaining stocks acquired pursuant to repealed sherman silver purchase act though mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904 congress placed a ceiling on cost of silver at 25 000 in event united states treasury bought 38 675 875 troy ounces of silver for 23 032 80 designs were to be selected by mint director with approval of secretary of treasury preparation thumb left mint director george e roberts on his mint medal designed by chief engraver charles e barber once bill passed bureau of mint chief engraver charles e barber took personal charge of project seeking to avoid delays and disputes that had marked two previous commemoratives columbian half dollar and isabella quarter on march 24 1899 mint director george e roberts wrote in a letter that lafayette memorial commission was contemplating having on one side of coin a representation of new monument barber responded following day to philadelphia mint superintendent henry boyer referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of monument by april 12 1899 chief engraver had obtained from commission secretary thompson a preliminary sketch of monument an equestrian statue by paul bartlett barber sketched other designs including one with lafayette s 1784 prayer for prosperity of united states he also created one showing a standing figure of lafayette based on a statement by thompson that they might omit horse barber s concepts showing an equestrian statue for one side and jugate heads of lafayette and washington for other would form basis for eventual coin roberts quickly approved barber s sketch of two heads and without consulting commission leaked information to american journal of numismatics which printed it in its april 1899 issue on may 23 1899 barber wrote to roberts that he planned to base washington bust on obverse on well known 1785 bust of first president by jean antoine houdon and upon an early medallic use of houdon bust 1786 washington before boston medal by pierre simon benjamin duvivier lafayette bust also on obverse was to be based on an 1824 medal of lafayette by francois augustin caunois thumb right caunois s medal of lafayette peck and other commission members were not satisfied with design proposals and suggested some of their own barber denigrated these in a letter to roberts on june 8 peck had proposed that only faces of washington and lafayette be shown with no depiction of rest of head barber stated i am of opinion that heads of washington and lafayette should be treated from sculptor s standpoint and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with position they fill in nation s history which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon at instructions of roberts barber went to new york and met with peck over two days on june 14 and 15 afterwards barber reported to mint director i think we will hear no more of lafayette prayer and that peck now appreciated that space available for a design even on a silver dollar largest us coin was limited and as it is desire of committee commission to have monument displayed prayer will have to find some other place although barber indicated that decision of commission to represent statue without its pedestal represented progress toward point where he might engrave dies i learned in new york that work of sculptor must be submitted to a committee in paris who will have entire charge of monument and sculptor s work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets approval of this committee of frenchmen to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900 on june 20 1899 barber submitted final designs for coin they were approved by director roberts on july 1 this did not put an end to over what should be on coin commission wished to have coins dated 1900 but have them to sell as early as possible in 1899 secretary of treasury lyman gage insisted on provision of coinage act of 1873 that required date of production to appear on coins in end matter was compromised pieces were struck in december 1899 not distributed until following month and inscription paris 1900 appears on coins design thumb left peter krider s yorktown centennial medal 1881 obverse of lafayette dollar features jugate or conjoined heads of washington and lafayette slabaugh noted barber s account that busts were based on sculpture by houdon and medal by caunois but possibly these did have some effect on design but it has always been my belief that immediate source or idea for design was yorktown centennial medal of 1881 swiatek and breen contended that although ultimate ancestor of barber s depiction of washington was houdon bust source of lafayette bust and format of obverse was beyond doubt peter l krider s yorktown centennial medal 1881 krider a philadelphia engraver not employed by mint issued a number of tokens and medals in 1870s and 1880s united states of america and lafayette dollar appear at top and bottom of obverse of coin reverse is based on an early sketch of statue of lafayette by bartlett it depicts a mounted statue of lafayette riding left barber s monogram does not appear on coin but name bartlett is inscribed on base of statue also on base and extending below it is a palm branch reverse inscription erected by youth of united states in honor of gen lafayette paris 1900 is a tribute to school fundraising efforts that took place in 1898 swiatek and breen pointed out that even if one grants that 1900 date was intended to be that of exposition and erection of statue coins would still violate 1873 act that required date of mintage to appear on coins and thus lafayette dollars are technically undated and therefore illegal thumb right obverse of washington before boston medal was first medallic use of houdon s bust on reverse lafayette holds a sword extended upwards bartlett described version of statue that barber worked from lafayette is represented in statue as a fact and a symbol offering his sword and services to american colonists in cause of liberty he appears as emblem of aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by france to our forefathers swiatek and breen noted we may take lafayette s pose on statue as depicted on coin to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against enemy note his sheathed sword like a highland pipe major s baton serving as a standard rather than brandished unsheathed as a weapon barber s design for lafayette dollar has often been criticized swiatek and breen complained about lifeless head of president washington q david bowers stated that shallow relief of barber s work is but a travesty of krider s extremely detailed high relief artistry according to don taxay when one compares barber s portraits to those by du and caunois it is clear why sculptor and barber enemy saint gaudens used to refer contemptuously to commercial medalists of mint difference here is not merely in relief but in elementary modeling skill art historian cornelius vermeule stated that lafayette dollar lacks quaint dated appeal of isabella quarter or amusing originality of columbian half dollar despite necessity for low relief jugate busts are too linear reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size words paris 1900 might have been enough at most addition of from youth of united states would have conveyed matter production and aftermath all lafayette dollars were struck at philadelphia mint on december 14 1899 centennial of death of george washington philadelphia public ledger reported once ceremony at philadelphia mint had concluded striking of lafayette dollar continued on an older coinage press capable of minting eighty pieces per minute or 4 800 per hour a total of 50 026 pieces were struck including 26 coins laid aside for inspection and testing at 1900 meeting of united states assay commission thumb left casket in which first lafayette dollar was presented to french president emile loubet first columbian half dollar had been sold for 10 000 an offer of 5 000 was made but declined for first lafayette dollar to be struck which was designated for presentation to french president thompson designated a special commissioner of united states for purpose took casket to france aboard s s la champagne ceremony was originally scheduled for february 22 1900 washington s birthday but was not held until march 3 when thompson presented casket and coin to french president emile loubet two objects are now in louvre commission was plagued by a number of financial difficulties in january 1900 sculptor charles henry niehaus questioned why 150 000 was fundraising target of commission as no equestrian statue had ever cost more than half that commission was sued by architect henry demanding fees for designing a pedestal for bartlett s statue out of court settlement reimbursed him for his expenses thumb right upright paul bartlett s statue of lafayette in paris commission was tardy in giving final order for statue to bartlett so late that it was impossible to have final bronze piece ready in time a one third model was only completed in may according to q david bowers french are at home in such problems commission was able to have a full sized plaster model ready by july 4 by sawing scale model in pieces and distributing them to various workshops that made enlargements in plaster brought together plaster pieces fitted perfectly this assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in place du carrousel on july 4 1900 afterwards bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of design and changed them his bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from statue depicted on coin changes made included elimination of lafayette s three cornered hat and position of raised arm and sword statue stood there for almost eighty years but was displaced in 1980s during excavations for i m pei s glass pyramid at louvre it now stands on cours la reine in paris along river seine once coins were minted commission began sales at 2 each after february 1900 when commission moved its offices from chicago to paris sales were handled by american trust savings bank of chicago only small numbers were sold to coin collectors sales conducted through bank continued for several years prices initially dropped on secondary market pieces could be purchased for 1 10 in 1903 and thousands may have been released into circulation or were spent by purchasers in hard times by 1920 market price passed original issue price and thereafter prices rose steadily reaching 3 50 by 1930 5 at height of commemorative coin boom in july 1936 13 by 1950 55 by 1960 and 650 by 1975 fourteen thousand pieces were returned to treasury and were held in 1 000 sacks this followed poor sales of new coin in paris only 1 800 sold there some 10 000 were returned to united states they were held for many years in 1945 omaha coin dealer aubrey beebe learned about coins from government records and enquired only to be told that coins had been recently melted lafayette dollar is first american coin to depict a us citizen after lafayette piece mint did not again strike a commemorative silver dollar until 1983 s los angeles olympics dollar collecting in 1925 numismatist george h clapp discovered a lafayette dollar that slightly differed from published descriptions he researched matter further over following decade and discovered two additional varieties these exist because multiple dies for both obverse and reverse were used in striking lafayette piece and dies were not identical swiatek writing in 2012 noted a fifth die combination he had discovered and examined images of hundreds of lafayette dollars he owned or that were on internet he reported that two varieties combined for more than 90 of specimens with remaining ones much rarer because of this he speculated that dollars were struck on at least two machines not one as usually reported with rarer varieties result of replacement dies being inserted as original ones wore out differences are minor for example whether m in america is raised or even with a that precedes it on obverse and details of palm branch on reverse and coin is rarely collected by die type meaning that little premium value attaches to less common varieties r s yeoman s deluxe edition of a guide book of united states coins issued in 2018 lists lafayette dollar at 485 in almost uncirculated au 50 ranging upwards to 15 000 in near pristine ms 66 one in ms 67 condition sold in 2015 for 73 438 most lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as pieces were mechanically ejected from press into a hopper and no attempt was made to preserve their appearance for collectors although whether specimen is well struck or not rarely affects value clearly struck specimens will show engraving line separating lafayette s boot from rest of his uniform and details of lower part of his clothing will also be distinct highest points on coin at which wear should be most apparent are washington s cheekbone on obverse and face of lafayette on reverse coin has been counterfeited from time to time various techniques have also been used to make genuine specimens shinier to deceive collectors including polishing a process that damages their surfaces and patina references and bibliography books category currencies
