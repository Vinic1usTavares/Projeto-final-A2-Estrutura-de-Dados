thumb an injection moulding machine thumb simplified diagram of process injection moulding uk spelling or injection molding u s spelling is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mould or mold injection moulding can be performed with a host of materials mainly including metals for which process is called die casting glasses elastomers confections and most commonly thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers material for part is fed into a heated barrel mixed using a helical shaped screw and injected forced into a mould cavity where it cools and hardens to configuration of cavity after a product is designed usually by an industrial designer or an engineer moulds are made by a mould maker or from metal usually either steel or aluminium and precision machined to form features of desired part injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts from smallest components to entire body panels of cars advances in 3d printing technology using that do not melt during injection moulding of some lower temperature thermoplastics can be used for some simple injection moulds parts to be injection moulded must be very carefully designed to facilitate moulding process material used for part desired shape and features of part material of mould and properties of moulding machine must all be taken into account versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities applications injection moulding is used to create many things such as wire spools packaging bottle caps automotive parts and components toys pocket combs some musical instruments and parts of them one piece chairs and small tables storage containers mechanical parts including gears and most other plastic products available today injection moulding is most common modern method of manufacturing plastic parts it is ideal for producing high volumes of same object process characteristics thumb 150px thermoplastic resin pellets for injection moulding injection moulding uses a ram or screw type plunger to force molten plastic material into a mould cavity this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to contour of mould it is most commonly used to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers with volume used of former being considerably higher thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics that make them highly suitable for injection moulding such as ease of versatility for a wide variety of applications and ability to soften and flow on heating thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from injection barrel in a timely manner chemical crosslinking may occur causing screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging injection moulding machine injection moulding consists of high pressure injection of raw material into a mould which shapes polymer into desired form moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities in multiple cavity moulds each cavity can be identical and form same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle moulds are generally made from tool steels but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications aluminium moulds are typically ill suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances as they have inferior mechanical properties and are more prone to wear damage and deformation during injection and clamping cycles however aluminium moulds are cost effective in low volume applications as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fabricate when thermoplastics are molded typically raw material is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw upon entrance to barrel temperature increases and van der waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened as a result of increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states this process reduces its viscosity which enables polymer to flow with driving force of injection unit screw delivers raw material forward mixes and thermal and viscous distributions of polymer and reduces required heating time by mechanically shearing material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to polymer material feeds forward through a check valve and collects at front of screw into a volume known as a shot a shot is volume of material that is used to fill mould cavity compensate for shrinkage and provide a cushion approximately 10 of total shot volume which remains in barrel and prevents screw from bottoming out to transfer pressure from screw to mould cavity when enough material has gathered material is forced at high pressure and velocity into part forming cavity exact amount of shrinkage is a function of resin being used and can be relatively predictable to prevent spikes in pressure process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95 98 full cavity where screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control often injection times are well under 1 second once screw reaches transfer position packing pressure is applied which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials packing pressure is applied until gate cavity entrance solidifies due to its small size gate is normally first place to solidify through its entire thickness once gate solidifies no more material can enter cavity accordingly screw reciprocates and acquires material for next cycle while material within mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable this cooling duration is dramatically reduced by use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller once required temperature has been achieved mould opens and an array of pins sleeves strippers etc are driven forward to article then mould closes and process is repeated for a two shot mould two separate materials are incorporated into one part this type of injection moulding is used to add a soft touch to knobs to give a product multiple colours or to produce a part with multiple performance characteristics injection molding meridian products corporation retrieved april 26 2016 for thermosets typically two different chemical components are injected into barrel these components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions that eventually crosslinks material into a single connected network of molecules as chemical reaction occurs two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid solidification in injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions therefore minimising thermoset curing within barrel is vital this typically means that residence time and temperature of chemical precursors are minimised in injection unit residence time can be reduced by minimising barrel s volume capacity and by maximising cycle times these factors have led to use of a thermally isolated cold injection unit that injects reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould which increases rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component after part has solidified valves close to isolate injection system and chemical precursors and mould opens to eject moulded parts then mould closes and process repeats pre moulded or machined components can be inserted into cavity while mould is open allowing material injected in next cycle to form and solidify around them this process is known as insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials this process is often used to create plastic parts with protruding metal screws so they can be fastened and repeatedly this technique can also be used for in mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers a parting line sprue gate marks and ejector pin marks are usually present on final part none of these features are typically desired but are unavoidable due to nature of process gate marks occur at gate that joins melt delivery channels sprue and runner to part forming cavity parting line and ejector pin marks result from minute wear gaseous vents clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion and or dimensional differences of mating surfaces contacting injected polymer dimensional differences can be attributed to non uniform pressure induced deformation during injection machining tolerances and non uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components which experience rapid cycling during injection packing cooling and ejection phases of process mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion these factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in cost of design fabrication processing and quality monitoring skillful mould and part designer positions these aesthetic in hidden areas if feasible history american inventor john wesley hyatt together with his brother isaiah patented first injection moulding machine in 1872 u s patent dated 19 november 1872 this machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today it worked like a large hypodermic needle using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould industry progressed slowly over years producing products such as collar stays buttons and hair combs german chemists arthur eichengrun and theodore becker invented first soluble forms of cellulose acetate in 1903 which was much less flammable than cellulose nitrate it was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded arthur eichengrun developed first injection moulding press in 1919 in 1939 arthur eichengrun patented injection moulding of cellulose acetate industry expanded rapidly in 1940s because world war ii created a huge demand for inexpensive mass produced products in 1946 american inventor james watson hendry built first screw injection machine which allowed much more precise control over speed of injection and quality of articles produced this machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected in 1970s hendry went on to develop first gas assisted injection moulding process which permitted production of complex hollow articles that cooled quickly this greatly improved design flexibility as well as strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time cost weight and waste by 1979 plastic production overtook steel production and by 1990 aluminium molds were widely used in injection molding today screw injection machines account for vast majority of all injection machines plastic injection moulding industry has evolved over years from producing combs and buttons to producing a vast array of products for many industries including automotive medical aerospace consumer products toys plumbing packaging and construction examples of polymers best suited for process most polymers sometimes referred to as resins may be used including all thermoplastics some thermosets and some elastomers since 1995 total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year there were approximately 18 000 materials available when that trend began available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials so product designers can choose material with best set of properties from a vast selection major criteria for selection of a material are strength and function required for final part as well as cost but also each material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account other considerations when choosing an injection molding material include flexural modulus of elasticity or degree to which a material can be bent without damage as well as heat deflection and water absorption common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of thermosetting plastics while nylon polyethylene and polystyrene are thermoplastic until comparatively recently plastic springs were not possible but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting outdoor equipment webbing equipment thumb paper clip mould opened in moulding machine nozzle is visible at right injection moulding machines consist of a material hopper an injection ram or screw type plunger and a heating unit also known as platens they hold moulds in which components are shaped presses are rated by tonnage which expresses amount of clamping force that machine can exert this force keeps mould closed during injection process tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9 000 tons with higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations total clamp force needed is determined by projected area of part being moulded this projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1 8 to 7 2 tons for each square centimetre of projected areas as a rule of thumb 4 or 5 tons in2 can be used for most products if plastic material is very stiff it requires more injection pressure to fill mould and thus more clamp tonnage to hold mould closed required force can also be determined by material used and size of part larger parts require higher clamping force mould mould or die are common terms used to describe tool used to produce plastic parts in moulding since moulds have been expensive to manufacture they were usually only used in mass production where thousands of parts were being produced typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel pre hardened steel aluminium and or beryllium copper alloy choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics in general steel moulds cost more to construct but their longer lifespan offsets higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out pre hardened steel moulds are less wear resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components their typical steel hardness is 38 45 on rockwell c scale hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 rockwell c hrc aluminium moulds can cost substantially less and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even hundreds of thousands of parts beryllium copper is used in areas of mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see most shear heat generated moulds can be manufactured either by cnc machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes mould design thumb standard two plates tooling core and cavity are inserts in a mould base family mould of five different parts mould consists of two primary components injection mould a plate and ejector mould b plate these components are also referred to as moulder and plastic resin enters mould through a sprue or gate in injection mould sprue bushing is to seal tightly against nozzle of injection barrel of moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from barrel into mould also known as cavity sprue bushing directs molten plastic to cavity images through channels that are machined into faces of a and b plates these channels allow plastic to run along them so they are referred to as runners molten plastic flows through runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into cavity geometry to form desired part thumb right 250px sprue runner and gates in actual injection moulding product amount of resin required to fill sprue runner and cavities of a mould comprises a shot trapped air in mould can escape through air vents that are ground into parting line of mould or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than holes retaining them if trapped air is not allowed to escape it is compressed by pressure of incoming material and squeezed into corners of cavity where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns surrounding plastic material to allow for removal of moulded part from mould mould features must not overhang one another in direction that mould opens unless parts of mould are designed to move from between such overhangs when mould opens using components called lifters sides of part that appear parallel with direction of draw axis of cored position hole or insert is parallel to up and down movement of mould as it opens and closes are typically angled slightly called draft to ease release of part from mould insufficient draft can cause deformation or damage draft required for mould release is primarily dependent on depth of cavity deeper cavity more draft necessary shrinkage must also be taken into account when determining draft required if skin is too thin then moulded part tends to shrink onto cores that form while cooling and cling to those cores or part may warp twist blister or crack when cavity is pulled away a mould is usually designed so that moulded part reliably remains on ejector b side of mould when it opens and draws runner and sprue out of a side along with parts part then falls freely when ejected from b side tunnel gates also known as submarine or mould gates are located below parting line or mould surface an opening is machined into surface of mould on parting line moulded part is cut by mould from runner system on ejection from mould ejector pins also known as knockout pins are circular pins placed in either half of mould usually ejector half which push finished moulded product or runner system out of a mould ejection of article using pins sleeves strippers etc may cause undesirable impressions or distortion so care must be taken when designing mould standard method of cooling is passing a coolant usually water through a series of holes drilled through mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway coolant absorbs heat from mould which has absorbed heat from hot plastic and keeps mould at a proper temperature to solidify plastic at most efficient rate to ease maintenance and venting cavities and cores are divided into pieces called inserts and sub assemblies also called inserts blocks or chase blocks by substituting interchangeable inserts one mould may make several variations of same part more complex parts are formed using more complex moulds these may have sections called slides that move into a cavity perpendicular to draw direction to form overhanging part features when mould is opened slides are pulled away from plastic part by using stationary angle pins on stationary mould half these pins enter a slot in slides and cause slides to move backward when moving half of mould opens part is then ejected and mould closes closing action of mould causes slides to move forward along angle pins some moulds allow previously moulded parts to be reinserted to allow a new plastic layer to form around first part this is often referred to as this system can allow for production of one piece tires and wheels thumb two shot injection moulded from a computer keyboard two shot or multi shot moulds are designed to within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units this process is actually an injection moulding process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error in first step base colour material is moulded into a basic shape which contains spaces for second shot then second material a different colour is injection moulded into those spaces and keys for instance made by this process have markings that cannot wear off and remain legible with heavy use a mould can produce several copies of same parts in a single shot number of impressions in mould of that part is often incorrectly referred to as cavitation a tool with one impression is often called a single impression cavity mould a mould with two or more cavities of same parts is usually called a multiple impression cavity mould some extremely high production volume moulds like those for bottle caps can have over 128 cavities in some cases multiple cavity tooling moulds a series of different parts in same tool some toolmakers call these moulds family moulds as all parts are related e g plastic model kits mould storage manufacturers go to great lengths to protect custom moulds due to their high average costs perfect temperature and humidity level is maintained to ensure longest possible lifespan for each custom mould custom moulds such as those used for rubber injection moulding are stored in temperature and humidity controlled environments to prevent warping tool materials tool steel is often used mild steel aluminium nickel or epoxy are suitable only for prototype or very short production runs modern hard aluminium and 2024 alloys with proper mould design can easily make moulds capable of 100 000 or more part life with proper mould maintenance thumb right 300px beryllium copper insert yellow on injection moulding mould for abs resin machining moulds are built through two main methods standard machining and edm standard machining in its conventional form has historically been method of building injection moulds with technological developments cnc machining became predominant means of making more complex moulds with more accurate mould details in less time than traditional methods electrical discharge machining edm or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making as well as allowing formation of shapes that are difficult to machine process allows pre hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften mould followed by heat treatment to harden it again edm is a simple process in which a shaped electrode usually made of copper or graphite is very slowly lowered onto mould surface over a period of many hours which is immersed in paraffin oil kerosene a voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of mould surface in inverse shape of electrode cost number of cavities incorporated into a mould directly correlate in moulding costs fewer cavities require far less tooling work so limiting number of cavities lowers initial manufacturing costs to build an injection mould as number of cavities play a vital role in moulding costs so does complexity of part s design complexity can be incorporated into many factors such as surface finishing tolerance requirements internal or external threads fine detailing or number of undercuts that may be incorporated further details such as undercuts or any feature that needs additional tooling increases mould cost surface finish of core and cavity of moulds further influences cost rubber injection moulding process produces a high yield of durable products making it most efficient and cost effective method of moulding consistent processes involving precise temperature control significantly reduces all waste material injection process thumb video explanation thumb small injection moulder showing hopper nozzle and die area with injection moulding granular plastic is fed by a forced ram from a hopper into a heated barrel as granules are slowly moved forward by a screw type plunger plastic is forced into a heated chamber where it is melted as plunger advances melted plastic is forced through a nozzle that rests against mould allowing it to enter mould cavity through a gate and runner system mould remains cold so plastic solidifies almost as soon as mould is filled injection moulding cycle sequence of events during injection mould of a plastic part is called injection moulding cycle cycle begins when mould closes followed by injection of polymer into mould cavity once cavity is filled a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage in next step screw turns feeding next shot to front screw this causes screw to retract as next shot is prepared once part is sufficiently cool mould opens and part is ejected scientific versus traditional moulding traditionally injection portion of moulding process was done at one constant pressure to fill and pack cavity this method however allowed for a large variation in dimensions from cycle to cycle more commonly used now is scientific or decoupled moulding a method pioneered by inc in this injection of plastic is decoupled into stages to allow better control of part dimensions and more cycle to cycle commonly called shot to shot in industry consistency first cavity is filled to approximately 98 full using velocity speed control although pressure should be sufficient to allow for desired speed pressure limitations during this stage are undesirable once cavity is 98 full machine switches from velocity control to pressure control where cavity is packed out at a constant pressure where sufficient velocity to reach desired pressures is required this lets workers control part dimensions to within thousandths of an inch or better different types of injection moulding processes although most injection moulding processes are covered by conventional process description above there are several important moulding variations including but not limited to die casting metal injection moulding thin wall injection moulding injection moulding of liquid silicone rubber reaction injection moulding a more comprehensive list of injection moulding processes may be found here complete guide for plastic injection moulding process troubleshooting like all industrial processes injection moulding can produce flawed parts in field of injection moulding troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with design of mould or characteristics of process itself trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine appropriate specifications to use in injection process when filling a new or unfamiliar mould for first time where shot size for that mould is unknown a technician tool setter may perform a trial run before a full production run they start with a small shot weight and fills gradually until mould is 95 to 99 full once they achieve this they apply a small amount of holding pressure and increase holding time until gate freeze off solidification time has occurred gate freeze off time can be determined by increasing hold time and then weighing part when weight of part does not change gate has frozen and no more material is injected into part gate solidification time is important as this determines cycle time and quality and consistency of product which itself is an important issue in economics of production process holding pressure is increased until parts are free of sinks and part weight has been achieved moulding defects injection moulding is a complex technology with possible production problems they can be caused either by defects in moulds or more often by moulding process itself moulding or layered zone on surface of or material is too hot often caused by a lack of cooling around tool or a faulty heater burn burn gas burn gas marks blow or brown burnt areas on part located at furthest points from gate or where air is lacks venting injection speed is too high color streaks us colour streaks uk localised change of isn t mixing properly or material has run out and it s starting to come through as natural only previous coloured material dragging in nozzle or check valve or foreign material different colour matter seen in product weakening material introduced by bad recycling or regrind policy may include floor sweepings dust and debris mica like layers formed in part of material e g pp mixed with abs very dangerous if part is being used for a safety critical application as material has very little strength when delaminated as materials cannot bond material in thin layer exceeding normal part is over packed or parting line on tool is damaged too much injection speed material injected clamping force too low can also be caused by dirt and contaminants around tooling surfaces embedded particle burnt material or other embedded in on tool surface contaminated material or foreign debris in barrel or too much shear heat burning material prior to injection flow off tone wavy lines or speeds too slow plastic has cooled down too much during injection injection speeds should be set as fast as is appropriate for process and material used gate or blush pattern around gate normally only an issue on hot runner speed is too fast gate sprue runner size is too small or melt mold temp is too low deformed by turbulent flow of material poor tool design gate position or runner injection speed set too high poor design of gates which causes too little die swell and result jetting knit lines on backside of core pins or windows in parts that look like just lines caused by melt front flowing around an object standing proud in a plastic part as well as at end of fill where melt front comes together again can be minimised or eliminated with a mould flow study when mould is in design phase once mould is made and gate is placed one can minimise this flaw only by changing melt and mould temperature polymer breakdown from hydrolysis oxidation etc excess water in granules excessive temperatures in barrel excessive screw speeds causing high shear heat material being allowed to sit in barrel for too long too much regrind being used sink marks sinks localised depression in thicker zones holding time pressure too low cooling time too short with hot runners this can also be caused by gate temperature being set too high excessive material or walls too thick short fill or short of material injection speed or pressure too low mould too cold lack of gas vents splay marks splash mark or silver streaks usually appears as silver streaks along flow pattern however depending on type and colour of material it may represent as small bubbles caused by trapped moisture moisture in material usually when hygroscopic resins are dried improperly trapping of gas in rib areas due to excessive injection velocity in these areas material too hot or is being sheared too much or long like remnant from previous shot transfer in new temperature too high gate hasn t frozen off no decompression of screw no sprue break poor placement of heater bands inside tool space within part air pocket is commonly used lack of holding pressure holding pressure is used to pack out part during holding time filling too fast not allowing edges of part to set up also mould may be out of registration when two halves don t centre properly and part walls are not same thickness provided information is common understanding correction lack of pack not holding pressure pack pressure is used to pack out even though is part during holding time filling too fast does not cause this condition as a void is a sink that did not have a place to happen in other words as part shrinks resin separated from itself as there was not sufficient resin in cavity void could happen at any area or part is not limited by thickness but by resin flow and thermal conductivity but it is more likely to happen at thicker areas like ribs or bosses additional root causes for voids are un melt on melt pool weld line meld line transfer line where two flow fronts or material temperatures set too low material is cold when they meet so they don t bond time for transition between injection and transfer to packing and holding is too early is too short material is too hot lack of cooling around tool incorrect water temperatures parts bow inwards towards hot side of tool uneven shrinking between areas of part fusion of two fluid flows a state before weld line gap in between part due to improper gate location in complex design parts including excess of holes multipoint gates to be provided process optimization proper air venting methods such as industrial ct scanning can help with finding these defects externally as well as internally tolerances moulding tolerance is a specified allowance on deviation in parameters such as dimensions weights shapes or angles etc to maximise control in setting tolerances there is usually a minimum and maximum limit on thickness based on process used injection moulding typically is capable of tolerances equivalent to an it grade of about 9 14 possible tolerance of a thermoplastic or a thermoset is 0 008 to 0 002 inches in specialised applications tolerances as low as 5 um on both diameters and linear features are achieved in mass production surface finishes of 0 0500 to 0 1000 um or better can be obtained rough or pebbled surfaces are also possible moulding type typical mm possible mm thermoplastic 0 500 0 200 thermoset 0

a mobile inspection system to examine multiple parts more quickly in addition to mounting inspection systems on automatic devices multiple axis robots can remove parts from mould and position them for further processes specific instances include removing of parts from mould immediately after parts are created as well as applying machine vision systems a robot grips part after ejector pins have been extended to free part from mould it then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system choice depends upon type of product as well as general layout of manufacturing
