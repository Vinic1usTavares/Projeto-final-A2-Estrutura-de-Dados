involving both of them was more evidence that writers have been listening to fans gq writer dan said parks and recreation appeared to be approaching early simpsons levels in its absurdity and comic pacing he suggested this could be due to use of mike scully a veteran comic writer with animated series as a consulting producer on parks and recreation in an article reflecting on parks and recreation second season which became critically acclaimed following poor season one reviews slate magazine writer jonah weiner said plot of camel can be read as something of a season 2 mission statement weiner compared leslie s decision to submit quirky collage rather than safer bet as reflective of parks and recreation writing staff s apparent decision to ride their whims rather than tamp them down for something more readily recognizable as a hit sitcom dvd release camel along with other 23 second season episodes of parks and recreation was released on a four disc dvd set in united
