thallium is a chemical element with symbol tl and atomic number 81 it is a gray post transition metal that is not found free in nature when isolated thallium resembles tin but discolors when exposed to air chemists william crookes and claude auguste lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861 in residues of sulfuric acid production both used newly developed method of flame spectroscopy in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line thallium from greek meaning a green shoot or twig was named by crookes it was isolated by both lamy and crookes in 1862 lamy by electrolysis and crookes by precipitation and melting of resultant powder crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at international exhibition which opened on 1 may that year mining and smelting magazine ed henry curwen salmon vol iv july dec 1963 p 87 thallium tends to oxidize to 3 and 1 oxidation states as ionic salts 3 state resembles that of other elements in group 13 boron aluminium gallium indium however 1 state which is far more prominent in thallium than elements above it recalls chemistry of alkali metals and thallium i ions are found geologically mostly in potassium based ores and when ingested are handled in many ways like potassium ions k by ion pumps in living cells commercially thallium is produced not from potassium ores but as a byproduct from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores approximately 60 70 of thallium production is used in electronics industry and remainder is used in pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing it is also used in infrared detectors radioisotope thallium 201 as soluble chloride tlcl is used in small nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test soluble thallium salts many of which are nearly tasteless are toxic and they were historically used in rat poisons and insecticides use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries because of their toxicity thallium poisoning usually results in hair loss although this characteristic symptom does not always surface because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon thallium has gained notoriety as poisoner s poison and inheritance powder alongside arsenic characteristics a thallium atom has 81 electrons arranged in electron configuration xe of these three outermost electrons in sixth shell are valence electrons due to inert pair effect 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and it is more difficult to get them involved in chemical bonding than for heavier elements thus very few electrons are available for metallic bonding similar to neighboring elements mercury and lead and hence thallium like its congeners is a soft highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304 degc greenwood and earnshaw pp 222 224 a number of standard electrode potentials depending on reaction under study are reported for thallium reflecting greatly decreased stability of 3 oxidation state 0 73 tl3 3 e tl 0 336 tl e tl thallium is first element in group 13 where reduction of 3 oxidation state to 1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions since bond energies decrease down group with thallium energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining 3 state is not always enough to outweigh energy needed to involve 6s electrons greenwood and earnshaw pp 224 7 accordingly thallium i oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium iii oxide and hydroxide are more acidic showing that thallium conforms to general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states thallium is malleable and sectile enough to be cut with a knife at room temperature it has a metallic luster that when exposed to air quickly tarnishes to a bluish gray tinge resembling lead it may be preserved by immersion in oil a heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air in presence of water thallium hydroxide is formed sulfuric and nitric acids dissolve thallium rapidly to make sulfate and nitrate salts while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium i chloride layer isotopes thallium has 41 isotopes which have atomic masses that range from 176 to 216 and 205tl are only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium is most stable radioisotope with a half life of 3 78 years it is made by neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor most useful radioisotope half life 73 hours decays by electron capture emitting x rays 70 80 kev and photons of 135 and 167 kev in 10 total abundance therefore it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose it is most popular isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests compounds thallium iii thallium iii compounds resemble corresponding aluminium iii compounds they are moderately strong oxidizing agents and are usually unstable as illustrated by positive reduction potential for tl3 tl couple some mixed valence compounds are also known such as and which contain both thallium i and thallium iii thallium iii oxide is a black solid which decomposes above 800 degc forming thallium i oxide and oxygen simplest possible thallium compound is too unstable to exist in bulk both due to instability of 3 oxidation state as well as poor overlap of valence 6s and 6p orbitals of thallium with 1s orbital of hydrogen trihalides are more stable although they are chemically distinct from those of lighter group 13 elements and are still least stable in whole group for instance thallium iii fluoride has b structure rather than that of lighter group 13 trifluorides and does not form complex anion in aqueous solution trichloride and tribromide disproportionate just above room temperature to give and thallium triiodide contains linear triiodide anion and is actually a thallium i compound greenwood and earnshaw p 239 thallium iii sesquichalcogenides do not exist greenwood and earnshaw p 254 thallium i thallium i halides are stable in keeping with large size of tl cation chloride and bromide have caesium chloride structure while fluoride and iodide have distorted sodium chloride structures like analogous silver compounds tlcl and tli are photosensitive greenwood and earnshaw p 241 stability of thallium i compounds demonstrates its differences from rest of group a stable oxide hydroxide and carbonate are known as are many chalcogenides greenwood and earnshaw pp 246 7 double salt has been shown to have hydroxyl centred triangles of thallium as a recurring motif throughout its solid structure metalorganic compound thallium ethoxide is a heavy liquid r 3 49 g cm 3 m p 3 degc often used as a basic and soluble thallium source in organic and organometallic chemistry organothallium compounds organothallium compounds tend to be thermally unstable in concordance with trend of decreasing thermal stability down group 13 chemical reactivity of tl c bond is also lowest in group especially for ionic compounds of type thallium forms stable tl ch3 2 ion in aqueous solution like isoelectronic hg ch3 2 and pb ch3 2 2 it is linear and are like corresponding gallium and indium compounds flammable liquids with low melting points like indium thallium cyclopentadienyl compounds contain thallium i in contrast to gallium iii greenwood and earnshaw pp 262 4 history thallium greek meaning a green shoot or twig liddell henry george and scott robert eds thallos in a greek english lexicon oxford university press was discovered by william crookes and claude auguste lamy working independently both using flame spectroscopy crookes was first to publish his findings on march 30 1861 crookes william march 30 1861 on existence of a new element probably of sulphur group chemical news vol 3 pp 193 194 reprinted in crookes william may 18 1861 further remarks on supposed new metalloid chemical news vol 3 p 303 crookes william june 19 1862 preliminary researches on thallium proceedings of royal society of london vol 12 pages 150 159 lamy a may 16 1862 de l existence d un nouveau metal le thallium comptes rendus vol 54 pages 1255 1262 name comes from thallium s bright green spectral emission lines after publication of improved method of flame spectroscopy by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff and discovery of caesium and rubidium in years 1859 to 1860 flame spectroscopy became an approved method to determine composition of minerals and chemical products crookes and lamy both started to use new method crookes used it to make spectroscopic determinations for tellurium on selenium compounds deposited in lead chamber of a sulfuric acid production plant near in harz mountains he had obtained samples for his research on selenium cyanide from august hofmann years earlier by 1862 crookes was able to isolate small quantities of new element and determine properties of a few compounds claude auguste lamy used a spectrometer that was similar to crookes to determine composition of a selenium containing substance which was deposited during production of sulfuric acid from pyrite he also noticed new green line in spectra and concluded that a new element was present lamy had received this material from sulfuric acid plant of his friend fred kuhlmann and this by product was available in large quantities lamy started to isolate new element from that source fact that lamy was able to work ample quantities of thallium enabled him to determine properties of several compounds and in addition he prepared a small ingot of metallic thallium which he prepared by remelting thallium he had obtained by electrolysis of thallium salts as both scientists discovered thallium independently and a large part of work especially isolation of metallic thallium was done by lamy crookes tried to secure his own priority on work lamy was awarded a medal at international exhibition in london 1862 for discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest crookes also received a medal thallium for discovery of new element controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863 most of discussion ended after crookes was elected fellow of royal society in june 1863 dominant use of thallium was use as poison for rodents after several accidents use as poison was banned in united states by presidential executive order in february 1972 in subsequent years several other countries also banned its use occurrence and production although thallium is a modestly abundant element in earth s crust with a concentration estimated to be about 0 7 mg kg mostly in association with potassium based minerals in clays soils and granites thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources major source of thallium for practical purposes is trace amount that is found in copper lead zinc and other heavy metal sulfide ores thumb left alt a close view of a rock crusted with groups of glassy lustrous silvery blue hutchinsonite in tight clusters of loosely aligned needle like crystals among smaller clusters of tiny orange brown crystals crystals of hutchinsonite tlpbas5s9 thallium is found in minerals hutchinsonite tlpbas5s9 and lorandite thallium also occurs as a trace element in iron pyrite and thallium is extracted as a by product of roasting this mineral for production of sulfuric acid thallium can also be obtained from smelting of lead and zinc ores manganese nodules found on ocean floor contain some thallium but collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive there is also potential for damaging oceanic environment in addition several other thallium minerals containing 16 to 60 thallium occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony arsenic copper lead and or silver these minerals are rare and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium deposit in southern macedonia was only area where thallium was actively mined this deposit still contains an estimated 500 tonnes of thallium and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals for example lorandite united states geological survey usgs estimates that annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10 metric tonnes as a by product from smelting of copper zinc and lead ores thallium is either extracted from dusts from smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected at end of smelting process raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is first step thallium is leached either by use of a base or sulfuric acid from material thallium is precipitated several times from solution to remove impurities at end it is converted to thallium sulfate and thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates production of thallium decreased by about 33 in period from 1995 to 2009 from about 15 metric tonnes to about 10 tonnes since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content it would be possible to increase production if a new application such as a hypothetical thallium containing high temperature superconductor becomes practical for widespread use outside of laboratory applications historic uses odorless and tasteless thallium sulfate was once widely used as rat poison and ant killer since 1972 this use has been prohibited in united states due to safety concerns many other countries followed this example in subsequent years thallium salts were used in treatment of ringworm other skin infections and to reduce night sweating of tuberculosis patients this use has been limited due to their narrow therapeutic index and development of improved medicines for these conditions optics thallium i bromide and thallium i iodide crystals have been used as infrared optical materials because they are harder than other common infrared optics and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths trade name krs 5 refers to this material thallium i oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic thallium has been used in production of high density glasses that have low melting points in range of 125 and 150 degc these glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices electronics thumb right alt a heavily pitted blackish cylindrical rod with extensive crumbling brown and white corrosion corroded thallium rod thallium i sulfide s electrical conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light therefore making this compound useful in thallium selenide has been used in a bolometer for infrared detection doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance thus it is used in trace amounts in selenium rectifiers another application of thallium doping is sodium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices in these sodium iodide crystals are doped with a small amount of thallium to improve their efficiency as scintillation generators some of electrodes in dissolved oxygen analyzers contain thallium high temperature superconductivity research activity with thallium is ongoing to develop high temperature superconducting materials for such applications as magnetic resonance imaging storage of magnetic energy magnetic propulsion and electric power generation and transmission research in applications started after discovery of first thallium barium calcium copper oxide superconductor in 1988 thallium cuprate superconductors have been discovered that have transition temperatures above 120 k some mercury doped thallium cuprate superconductors have transition temperatures above 130 k at ambient pressure nearly as high as world record holding mercury medical before widespread application of technetium 99m in nuclear medicine radioactive isotope thallium 201 with a half life of 73 hours was main substance for nuclear nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease cad this isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator which is similar to technetium 99m generator generator contains lead 201 half life 9 33 hours which decays by electron capture to thallium 201 lead 201 can be produced in a cyclotron by bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by p 3n and d 4n reactions thallium 201 production from harvard medical school s joint program in nuclear medicine thallium stress test a thallium stress test is a form of scintigraphy in which amount of thallium in tissues correlates with tissue blood supply viable cardiac cells have normal na k ion exchange pumps tl cation binds k pumps and is transported into cells exercise or induces widening vasodilation of arteries in body this produces coronary steal by areas where arteries are maximally dilated areas of infarct or ischemic tissue will remain cold pre and post stress thallium may indicate areas that will benefit from myocardial revascularization redistribution indicates existence of coronary steal and presence of ischemic coronary artery disease other uses a mercury thallium alloy which forms a eutectic at 8 5 thallium is reported to freeze at 60 degc some 20 degc below freezing point of mercury this alloy is used in thermometers and low temperature switches in organic synthesis thallium iii salts as thallium or triacetate are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics ketones and olefins among others thallium is a constituent of alloy in anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths to increase speed of plating and to reduce grain size within gold layer a saturated solution of equal parts of thallium i formate tl and thallium i tl in water is known as clerici solution it is a mobile odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing concentration of thallium salts with a density of 4 25 g cm3 at 20 degc clerici solution is one of heaviest aqueous solutions known it was used in 20th century for measuring density of minerals by flotation method but its use has discontinued due to high toxicity and of solution thallium iodide is frequently used as an additive in metal halide lamps often together with one or two halides of other metals it allows optimization of lamp temperature and color rendering and shifts spectral output to green region which is useful for underwater lighting toxicity thallium and its compounds are extremely toxic and should be handled with care there are numerous recorded cases of fatal thallium
