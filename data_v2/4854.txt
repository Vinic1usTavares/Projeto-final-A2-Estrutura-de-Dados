historian john fennell an expert on kievan rus and early russian history and one well versed in primary sources calls many of these figures into doubt saying numbers given in russian sources there are no mongol or polovtsian sources at least none that have survived and other sources from other cultures if they exist are rather dubious are formulaic or exaggerated and chronicles contradict themselves john fennell crisis of medieval russia 1200 1304 pp 66 68 information given in novgorod first chronicle and primary chronicle would imply a total of 11 000 soldiers for rus forces but
