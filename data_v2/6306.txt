throughout franchise writer and executive producer maurice hurley thought that heart of glory was closest experience he had on show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script he later credited fellow executive producer rick berman with helping to write script for heart of glory saying when i had a problem i could go in and we could sit there close door yell and scream i d pace he d make suggestions two of us made stories work in that room that had to be shot within a couple of days we were under enormous time pressure and we were working hand in glove we had a wonderful time on that show especially hurley wrote screenplay in two days from a story created by herbert wright and d c fontana nemecek 2003 p 52 because of delays klingon language portions of script didn t make any actual sense in translation and were simply klingon sounding words created by hurley story explained lt worf s background for first time in series including story of romulan betrayal at which saw death of his parents while his foster parents were first mentioned in this episode they were not seen until fourth season episode family and his stepbrother didn t appear on show until seventh season episode homeward michael dorn was pleased with outcome of this episode as he felt it showed producers that fans were just as interested in his character as others in main cast he felt that it could have been taken further and wanted there to be an epic battle at end of episode gross altman 1993 p 165 klingon battlecruiser seen in heart of glory was footage re used from star trek motion picture while freighter was a general model which would come to be reused throughout next generation and other star trek television series thumb left scene where lieutenant worf confronts korris used camera angles not previously seen on series director rob bowman made bold decisions in designing confrontation sequence scripted version showed fight between worf and korris taking place entirely on first deck of engineering section instead bowman had them fight on upper deck and using camera angles never before seen on show filmed vertical sequences in that part of set he also altered script so that konmel needed to be hit by three phaser blasts bowman used a steadicam to film scenes on freighter in order to give a rough effect to footage nemecek 2003 p 53 he was pleased with outcome describing it as easiest of all of next generation episodes he directed he said that it was a show where every hand we had was a 21 it just worked guest stars in this episode included robert bauer as kunivas who had previously been in a band with michael dorn stuntman dennis madalone made his second appearance in next generation with this episode having previously appeared earlier in season in where no one has gone before he would continue to appear as various crewmen through rest of series heart of glory was only appearance in next generation for actor vaughn armstrong he would however go on to play a further eleven different roles in star trek franchise including as recurring character of admiral maxwell forrest in star trek enterprise reception heart of glory was first broadcast in united states

episode symbiosis received a higher rating by end of season critical response several reviewers re watched episode after end of series keith decandido reviewed episode for tor com in july 2011 decandido is a novelist and has produced works based in star trek universe and describes himself as klingon guy as far as star trek novelists are concerned however he was not overly pleased with episode describing plot as being slow and saying that michael dorn s acting skills at this point were mediocre but would get much much better later in series he praised david froman as k nera describing him as having tremendous presence and thought that although vaughn armstrong was excellent as admiral forrest in enterprise in this early episode he was overly histrionic he described overhead shot of worf after death of korris as just silly and thought that episode overall was a forgettable mess he gave it a rating of four out of ten zack handlen writing for a v club in may 2010 thought that first act of heart of glory was slow but it improved after that and said that while it s not exactly a tear jerker it allows worf dignity character needs to work he had mixed feelings about klingon death ritual but felt that it was justified at end of episode as complex nature of character of korris made sense of loss feel earned he gave episode a grade of b michelle erica green watched episode for treknation in august 2007 and described it as one of her favourite episodes from first season she thought it laid groundwork for later episodes in next generation deep space nine and voyager regarding klingon culture however she felt that drama seemed artificial and that writers forced a situation where worf had to kill one of klingons as if justifying brutality as necessary for good of starfleet jamahl epsicokhan at his website jammer s reviews also thought that drama with worf deciding whether or not to join klingons was problematic he thought it was hard to believe that crew seemed to know worf as little as they did at this point in series but praised it for being starting point for all future klingon based stories in franchise he gave it a score of three out of four home media release first home media release of heart of glory was on vhs cassette appearing on november 11 1992 in united states and canada episode was later included on star trek next generation
