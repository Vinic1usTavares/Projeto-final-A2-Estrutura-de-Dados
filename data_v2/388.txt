svirepy was one of 18 s officially known as project 7u built for soviet navy during late 1930s although she began construction as a project 7 svirepy was completed in 1941 to modified project 7u design with her sea trials cut short by beginning of operation barbarossa in june svirepy was assigned to baltic fleet and fought in gulf of riga and defense of tallinn estonia providing naval gunfire support to soviet troops escaping relatively unscathed from evacuation of latter she provided fire support during siege of leningrad though seeing little activity after repairs in early 1942 postwar destroyer continued to serve with baltic fleet spending much of late 1940s and early 1950s under refit before being scrapped in late 1950s design and description originally built as a gnevny class ship svirepy and her sister ships were completed to modified project 7u design after joseph stalin general secretary of communist party of soviet union ordered that latter be built with their boilers arranged en echelon instead of linked as in gnevnys so that a ship could still move with one or two boilers disabled rohwer monakov p 52 balakin p 8 like gnevnys project 7u destroyers had an overall length of and a beam of but they had a reduced draft of at deep load ships were slightly overweight displacing at standard load and at deep load crew complement of storozhevoy class numbered 207 in peacetime but this increased to 271 in wartime as more personnel were needed to operate additional equipment balakin pp 30 44 yakubov worth p 101 each ship had a pair of geared steam turbines each driving one propeller rated to produce using steam from four water tube boilers which designers expected would exceed speed of project 7s because there was additional steam available svirepny herself reached during her sea trials in 1943 variations in fuel oil capacity meant that range of project 7us varied from at svirepny reached at that speed yakubov worth pp 101 106 107 project 7u class ships mounted four b 13 guns in two pairs of superfiring single mounts fore and aft of superstructure anti aircraft defense was provided by a pair of 34 k aa guns in single mounts and three 21 k aa guns
