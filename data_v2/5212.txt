contemporary chronicle which reported king s fear that roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to empress matilda stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over castles and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects chibnall empress matilda p 79 alexander was imprisoned in oxford in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad kealey roger of salisbury p 185 since work of henry of huntingdon who wrote in years before 1154 and who regarded stephen s actions as treachery against clergy that earned him punishment from god alexander s
