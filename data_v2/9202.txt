million or 3 7 million by west german news magazine stern which sold serialisation rights to several news organisations one of publications involved was sunday times who asked their independent director historian hugh trevor roper to authenticate diaries he did so pronouncing them genuine at press conference to announce publication trevor roper announced that on reflection he had changed his mind and other historians also raised questions concerning their validity rigorous forensic analysis which had not been performed previously quickly confirmed that diaries were fakes kujau born and raised in east germany had a history of petty crime and deception in mid 1970s he began selling nazi memorabilia which he was smuggling from east but found he could raise prices by forging additional authentication details to link ordinary souvenirs to nazi leaders he began forging paintings by hitler and an increasing number of notes poems and letters until he produced his first diary in mid to late 1970s west german journalist with stern who discovered diaries and was involved in their purchase was gerd heidemann who had an obsession with nazis when stern started buying diaries heidemann

extremely valuable documents which would show posterity truth of my actions apart from this quoted sentence there is no indication of what was in boxes last of crash s two survivors died in april 1980 and bormann had died after leaving berlin bunker following hitler s suicide on 30 april 1945 in decades following war possibility of a hidden cache of private papers belonging to hitler became according to journalist robert harris a tantalizing state of affairs that was to provide perfect scenario for forgery konrad kujau konrad kujau was born in 1938 in lobau near dresden in what would become east germany his parents a shoemaker and his wife had both joined nazi party in 1933 boy grew up believing in nazi ideals and idolising hitler germany s defeat and hitler s suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for nazi cause he held a series of menial jobs until 1957 when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with theft of a microphone from lobau youth club he fled to stuttgart west germany and soon drifted into temporary work and petty crime after running a dance bar during early 1960s with his girlfriend edith lieblang whom he later married kujau began to create a fictional background for himself he told people that his real name was peter fischer changed his date of birth by two years and altered story of his time in east germany by 1963 bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties and kujau started his career as a counterfeiter forging 27 deutsche marks dm worth of luncheon vouchers he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison on his release he and his wife formed lieblang cleaning company although it provided little income for them in march 1968 at a routine check at kujau s lodgings police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to stuttgart s prison thumb alt a man in his fifties balding and portly is shown smiling to left of camera konrad kujau in 1992 in 1970 kujau visited his family in east germany and discovered that many of locals held nazi memorabilia contrary to laws of communist government he saw an opportunity to buy material cheaply on black market and make a profit in west where increasing demand among stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times amount he would pay trade was illegal in east germany and export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned among items smuggled out of east germany were weapons in 1974 kujau rented a shop into which he placed his nazi memorabilia outlet also became venue for late night drinking sessions with friends and fellow collectors including wolfgang schulze who lived in us and became kujau s agent there kujau inflated value of items in his shop by forging additional authentication details for example a genuine first world war helmet worth a few marks became considerably more valuable after kujau forged a note indicating that hitler had worn it at ypres in late october 1914 in addition to notes by hitler he produced documents supposedly handwritten by bormann rudolf hess heinrich himmler hermann goring and joseph goebbels he forged passable imitations of his subjects genuine handwriting but rest of work was crude kujau used modern stationery such as letraset to create and he tried to make his products look suitably old by pouring tea over them mistakes in spelling or grammar were relatively common particularly when he forged in english a supposed copy of 1938 munich agreement between hitler and neville chamberlain read in part we regard signet last night and anglo german naval agreement as symbolic of desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another againe in mid to late 1970s kujau an able amateur artist turned to producing paintings which he claimed were by hitler who had been an amateur artist as a young man having found a market for his forged works kujau created hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in such as cartoons nudes and men in action all subjects that hitler never painted nor would want to paint according to charles hamilton a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery these paintings were often accompanied by small notes purportedly from hitler paintings were profitable for kujau to explain his access to memorabilia he invented several sources in east germany including a former nazi general director of a museum and his own brother whom he re invented as a general in east german army having found success in passing off his forged notes as those of hitler kujau grew more ambitious and copied by hand text from both volumes of mein kampf even though originals had been completed by typewriter kujau also produced an introduction to a third volume of work he sold these manuscripts to one of his regular customers fritz stiefel a collector of nazi memorabilia who accepted them and many other kujau products as genuine kujau also began forging a series of war poems by hitler which were so amateurish that kujau later conceded that a fourteen year old collector would have recognised it as a forgery gerd heidemann gerd heidemann was born in hamburg in 1931 during rise of hitler his parents remained apolitical but heidemann like many other young boys joined hitler youth after war he trained as an electrician and pursued an interest in photography he began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for deutsche presse and keystone news agencies as well as some local hamburg papers he had his first work published in stern in 1951 and four years later joined paper as a full time member of staff from 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across africa and middle east he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked such as search for identity of german writer b although he was an excellent researcher his colleagues called him bloodhound he would not know when to stop investigating which led to other writers having to finish off stories from large quantities of notes on behalf of stern in january 1973 heidemann photographed carin ii a yacht that formerly belonged to goring boat was in a poor state of repair and expensive to maintain but heidemann took a mortgage on his hamburg flat and purchased it while researching history of yacht heidemann interviewed goring s daughter edda after which couple began an affair through this relationship and his ownership of boat he was introduced to a circle of former nazis he began to hold parties on carin ii with former ss generals karl wolff and wilhelm mohnke as guests of honour wolff and mohnke were witnesses at heidemann s wedding to his third wife in 1979 couple went on honeymoon to south america accompanied by wolff where they met more ex nazis including walter rauff and klaus barbie who were both wanted in west for war crimes purchase of yacht caused heidemann financial problems and in 1976 he agreed terms with gruner jahr sterns parent company to produce a book based on conversations he was having with former soldiers and ss men when book went unwritten material provided by former ss officers was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers to pay for boat s upkeep in june 1978 he advertised boat for sale asking 1 1 million dms he received no offers mohnke recommended that heidemann speak to jakob tiefenthaeler a nazi memorabilia collector and a former member of ss tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy yacht but was happy

finally he sprinkled tea over pages and bashed diaries against his desk to give them an aged look kujau showed first volume to stiefel who was impressed and thought it a genuine hitler diary stiefel wanted to buy it but when forger refused pair agreed that collector could have it on loan in june 1979 stiefel asked a former nazi party archivist august priesack to verify authenticity of diary which he subsequently did priesack showed diary to eberhard jackel of university of stuttgart who also thought diary to be genuine and wanted to edit it for publication news of diary s existence soon began to filter through to collectors of hitler memorabilia at end of 1979 tiefenthaeler contacted heidemann to say that stiefel had shown him around his collection which included a hitler diary only one kujau had forged to that point according to hamilton discovery inflamed heidemann almost to madness and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop stiefel showed heidemann diary in stuttgart in january 1980 telling him it was from a plane crash in east germany although he refused to tell journalist name of his source collector spoke to kujau to see if he would meet heidemann but forger repeatedly refused heidemann s requests for nearly a year heidemann returned to stern offices and spoke to his editor but both koch and nannen refused to discuss potential story with him telling him to work on other features only person who was interested was walde who worked with heidemann to find source of diaries their searches for kujau proved fruitless so they looked into crash heidemann who had read baur s autobiography knew of gundlfinger s flight and made a connection between operation seraglio and diary in november 1980 two journalists travelled to dresden and located graves of flight s crew in january 1981 tiefenthaeler gave kujau s telephone number to heidemann telling journalist to ask for mr fischer one of kujau s aliases during subsequent phone call kujau told heidemann that there were 27 volumes of hitler s diaries original manuscript of unpublished third volume of mein kampf an opera by young hitler called wieland blacksmith numerous letters and unpublished papers and several of hitler s paintings most of which were still in east germany heidemann offered two million dms for entire collection and guaranteed secrecy until everything had been brought over border although pair did not agree to a deal they agreed to foundations of a deal according to harris kujau s condition was that he would only deal directly with heidemann something that suited journalist as a way of keeping other members of stern away from story heidemann and walde produced a prospectus for internal discussion outlining what was available for purchase and costs document signed by heidemann finished with a veiled threat if our company thinks that risk is too great i suggest that i should seek out a publishing company in united states which could put up money and ensure that we get german publication rights pair did not show prospectus to anyone at stern but instead presented it to gruner jahr s deputy managing director dr jan hensmann and manfred fischer they also requested a 200 000 mark deposit from publisher to secure rights with kujau after a meeting that lasted a little over two hours and with no recourse to an expert or historian deposit was authorised as soon as meeting ended at about 7 pm heidemann travelled to stuttgart with deposit money to meet kujau acquisition at that first meeting on 28 january 1981 which lasted over seven hours heidemann offered kujau a deposit of only 100 000 dms to agree deal which kujau did not accept at a second meeting following day reporter revealed an additional lure he had brought with him a uniform which he said was goring s kujau tentatively agreed to provide diaries and told heidemann that he would call him as soon as he could arrange to receive them from east germany as a sign of good faith heidemann lent uniform to forger to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from top nazis for his part kujau gave journalist a painting purportedly by hitler both painting and uniform were fakes thumb upright left alt a man in his eighties with thin grey hair facing to right of viewer he wears a dark suit and tie eberhard jackel historian who initially thought that hitler s poems and diaries were genuine but changed his mind a week later kujau met jackel and alex kuhn in connection with poems he had forged and sold to stiefel these had been published by jackel and kuhn in 1980 but one historian pointed out that one of poems could not have been produced by hitler as it had been written by poet menzel jackel was concerned that poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by hitler many of other pieces in stiefel s collection were similarly verified so doubts began to surface over these too kujau claimed ignorance saying he was only middleman but told them that heidemann a reputed journalist had seen crash site from which papers originated jackel advised stiefel to have his collection forensically examined and passed 26 suspect poems to hamburg district attorney for investigation gruner jahr also knew about problems with poems and that source had been kujau but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in east germany unconnected to diaries and they continued with their deal ten days after meeting with jackel and kuhn kujau had prepared three further diaries contents were copied from a range of books newspapers and magazines covering hitler s life primary among them was two volume work by historian max domarus hitler speeches and proclamations 1932 45 which presents hitler s day to day activities many of diary s entries were lists of nazi party promotions and official engagements although kujau created some personal information about hitler in diaries this was in opinion of both harris and hamilton trivia he began working to a schedule of producing three diaries a month he later stated that he managed to produce one of volumes in three hours on a separate occasion he wrote three diaries in three days on 17 february 1981 kujau flew to stuttgart and gave heidemann three recently prepared diaries for which heidemann gave him 35 000 dms this was a great deal less than 120 000 dms to 40 000 dms per diary promised to kujau in first meeting from which heidemann would also claim a 10 commission reduction in funds was explained by a need to get an expert opinion on authenticity of diaries and balance was later paid following day reporter delivered diaries to gruner jahr in subsequent meeting with walde hensmann sorge and fischer heidemann and walde again insisted on secrecy about project to ensure their acquisition of all diaries it was agreed that not even editors of stern should be told of discovery more importantly according to harris it was decided that they should not have material examined by a forensic scientist or historian until every diary had been obtained fischer committed company to future purchases by immediately allocating one million dm to project company also set up a dedicated unit to deal with diaries in an annex to main gruner jahr offices it was headed by walde and consisted of an assistant two secretaries and heidemann on receipt of diaries they were photocopied and transcribed from gothic script into modern german heidemann also entered into a private contract with gruner jahr which was kept secret from company s legal and personnel departments it contained a deal for him to publish books through company at a generous royalty rate and agreed that ten years after publication original diaries would be given to heidemann for research purposes to be handed on to west german government on his death he was also to be given a bonus of 300 000 dms for recovering first eight diaries delivery of diaries continued although there were tensions between heidemann and kujau partly owing to journalist s domineering personality and duplicity because of nature of transactions there were no receipts provided by heidemann to gruner jahr and business was conducted by company on basis of trust by end of february 1981 680 000 dms had been paid for diaries only around half of which was received by kujau heidemann had pocketed rest defrauding both his employer and forger in process despite self imposed restrictions of secrecy placed on small circle inside gruner jahr heidemann could not resist showing one of volumes to mohnke as entry referred to ss leibstandarte adolf hitler mohnke s former regiment heidemann read out three entries from diaries from 15 17 and 18 march which concerned visits made by hitler to regiment while in lichterfelde and friesenstrasse barracks mohnke informed him that entries were inaccurate saying that lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by troops on that date that regimental name used in diary was introduced much later and that so far as he knew hitler never visited friesenstrasse barracks heidemann was unmoved by his friend s revelations and posited that hitler had probably written what he was planning to do not what he had done harris suggests that this showed that journalist had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about diaries circle of those at gruner jahr who knew about diaries grew in may 1981 when fischer decided to look into complicated copyright circumstances surrounding hitler s property he discussed matter with company s legal advisor andreas ruppert who advised speaking to werner maser a historian who acted as a trustee on such matters to hitler family heidemann visited maser in june 1981 and came to a deal that enabled journalist and stern for a payment of 20 000 dms to retain rights to all discovered or purchased documents or notes in hand of adolf hitler which have so far not yet been published after twelve diaries had been delivered to gruner jahr heidemann informed his employers that price had risen from 85 000 dms to 100 000 dms per diary reason given by heidemann was that east german general smuggling diaries was now having to bribe more people additional money was retained by heidemann and not passed on to kujau journalist was starting to lead a profligate lifestyle on his illicit profits including two new cars a bmw convertible and a porsche for a combined total of 58 000 dms renting two new flats on hamburg s exclusive and jewellery he also spent considerable sums acquiring new nazi memorabilia some were genuine such as wolff s ss honour dagger others were purchased from kujau including 300 forged oil paintings drawings and sketches kujau claimed were by hitler other items carrying notes by kujau attesting to their authenticity included a gun described as that used by hitler to commit suicide and a flag identified as blood flag carried in hitler s failed munich beer hall putsch of 1923 and stained by blood of nazis shot by police purchases of diaries continued throughout mid to late 1981 gruner jahr gave heidemann 345 000 dms on 29 july and a further 220 000 dms a week later which brought total up to 1 81 million dms since start of year this sum had purchased 18 diaries for company schulte hillen new managing director signed an authorisation for a further million dms for future purchases just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600 000 dms after heidemann told him that cost of diaries had now risen to 200 000 dms each heidemann also passed on news that there were more than 27 diaries in mid december 1982 author and future holocaust denier david irving was also involved in tracking existence of diaries written by hitler priesack had previously told irving of existence of one of diaries with a collector in stuttgart in a visit to priesack to assess his collection of nazi documents irving found out stiefel s phone number from which he worked out address he also obtained photocopies of some of diary pages from priesack irving visited stiefel unannounced and tried to find out name of source but collector misled him as to origin irving examined priesack s photocopies and saw a number of problems including spelling mistakes and change in writing style between certain words initial testing and verification steps towards publication in april 1982 walde and heidemann contacted josef henke and klaus of german federal archives and max frei sulzer former head of forensic department of zurich police for assistance in authenticating diaries they did not specifically mention diaries but referred generally to new material they also did not give forensic specialists an entire diary but removed one page only for comparison purposes they also provided experts with other samples of hitler s writing a handwritten draft for a telegram this was from heidemann s own collection and had also been forged by kujau within days walde provided further documents for comparison all kujau forgeries walde then flew to us and commissioned ordway hilton another forensic expert none of those involved were experts in examining nazi documents and hilton could not read german sterns management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source or to provide experts with a complete diary which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material from samples provided experts concluded that handwriting was genuine hilton subsequently reported that there was just no question that both documents he had were written by same person whom he assumed to be hitler purchase of diaries continued and by june 1982 gruner jahr possessed 35 volumes in early 1983 company took decision to work towards a publication date for diaries to ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns stern issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties newsweek time paris match and a syndicate of papers owned by murdoch stern rented a large vault in a swiss bank they filled space with nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts first historian to examine diaries was hugh trevor roper who was cautious but impressed with volume of documentation in front of him as background to acquisition was explained to him he became less doubtful he was falsely informed that paper had been chemically tested and been shown to be pre war and he was told that stern knew identity of officer who had rescued documents from plane and had stored them ever since by end of meeting he was convinced that diaries were genuine and later said who i asked myself would forge sixty volumes when six would have served his purpose in an article in times on 23 april 1983 he wrote upright thumb alt a colour photograph of a balding and grey haired man facing camera gerhard weinberg who considered diaries genuine when verifying them for newsweek and then changed his mind i am now satisfied that documents are authentic that history of their wanderings since 1945 is true and that standard accounts of hitler s writing habits of his personality and even perhaps of some public events may in consequence have to be revised day after trevor roper gave his opinion of authenticity rupert murdoch and his negotiation team arrived in zurich a deal was provisionally agreed for 2 5 million for us serialisation rights with an additional 750 000 for british and commonwealth rights while discussions between murdoch and sorge were taking place diaries were examined by broyle and his newsweek team after lengthy negotiation broyle was informed that minimum price stern would consider was 3 million americans returned home informing hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days when broyle contacted germans he offered amount subject to authentication by their chosen expert gerhard weinberg in 1952 weinberg a cautious and careful historian had written guide to captured german documents for use by us military work is described by hamilton as definitive in its scope of subject weinberg travelled to zurich and like trevor roper was impressed and reassured by range of items on show he was also partly persuaded by trevor roper s endorsement of diaries authenticity weinberg commented that notion of anyone forging hundreds even thousands of pages of handwriting was hard to credit newsweek verbally accepted hensmann s offer and he in turn informed murdoch giving him option to raise his bid murdoch was furious having considered handshake agreement in zurich final on 15 april 1983 murdoch with mark edmiston president of newsweek met schulte hillen who unexpectedly and without explanation went back on all previous verbal and therefore to his mind non binding agreements and told them price was now 4 25 million murdoch and edmiston refused to accede to new price and both left managers of stern with no publishing partners backtracked on their statements and came to a second deal with murdoch who drove price down paying 800 000 for us rights and 400 000 for british and australian rights further deals were done in france with paris match for 400 000 in spain with grupo zeta for 150 000 in netherlands for 125 000 in norway for 50 000 and in italy with panorama for 50 000 newsweek did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on

on evening of 23 april presses began rolling for following day s edition of sunday times after an evening meeting of editorial staff giles phoned trevor roper to ask him to write a piece rebutting

heidemann for name of his source journalist refused and gave a different story of how diaries had been acquired trevor roper was suspicious and questioned reporter closely for over an hour heidemann accused historian of acting exactly like an officer of british army in 1945 at a subsequent dinner historian was evasive when asked by stern executives what he was going to say at announcement following day at press conference both trevor roper and weinberg expressed their doubts at authenticity and stated that german experts needed to examine diaries to confirm whether works were genuine trevor roper went on to say that his doubts sprung from lack of proof that these books were same ones as had been on crashed plane in 1945 he finished his statement by saying that i regret that normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop leading article in guardian described his public reversal as showing moral courage irving who had been described in introductory statement by koch as a historian with no reputation to lose stood at microphone for questions and asked how hitler could have written his diary in days following 20 july plot when his arm had been damaged he denounced diaries as forgeries and held aloft photocopied pages he had been given from priesack he asked if ink in diaries had been tested but

edition on 28 april which provided hitler s purported views on flight of hess to england and holocaust following day heidemann again met with kujau and bought last four diaries from him on following sunday 1 may 1983 sunday times published further stories providing background to diaries linking them more closely to plane crash in 1945 and providing a profile of heidemann that day when daily express rang irving for a further comment on diaries he informed them that he now believed diaries to be genuine times ran story of irving s u turn following day irving explained that stern had shown him a diary from april 1945 in which writing sloped downwards from left to right and script of which got smaller along line at a subsequent press conference irving explained that he had been examining diaries of dr theodor morell hitler s personal doctor in which morell diagnosed as having parkinson s disease a symptom of which was to write in way text appeared in diaries harris posits that further motives may also have played a part lack of reference to holocaust in diaries may have been perceived by irving as supporting evidence for his thesis put forward in his book hitler s war that holocaust took place without hitler s knowledge same day hagen visited and was told of their findings ultraviolet light had shown a fluorescent element to paper which should not have been present in an old document and that bindings of one of diaries included polyester which had not been made before 1953 research in archives also showed a number of errors findings were partial only and not conclusive more volumes were provided to aid analysis when hagen reported back to stern management an emergency meeting was called and schulte hillen demanded identity of heidemann s source journalist relented and provided provenance of diaries as kujau had given it to him harris describes how a bunker mentality descended on stern management as instead of accepting truth of s findings they searched for alternative explanations as to how post war whitening agents could have been used in wartime paper paper then released a statement defending their position which harris judges was resonant with hollow bravado while koch was touring us giving interviews to most of major news channels he met kenneth w rendell a handwriting expert in studios of cbs and showed him one of volumes rendell s first impression was that diaries were forged he later reported that everything looked wrong including new looking ink poor quality paper and signatures that were terrible renditions of hitler s rendell concludes diaries were not particularly good fakes calling them bad forgeries but a great hoax he states that with exception of imitating hitler s habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote across page forger failed to observe or to imitate most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting on 4 may fifteen volumes of diaries were removed from swiss bank vault and distributed to various forensic scientists four went to and eleven went to swiss specialists in st gallen initial results were ready on 6 may which confirmed what forensic experts had been telling management of stern for last week diaries were poor forgeries with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime germany measurements had been taken of evaporation of chloride in ink which showed diaries had been written within previous two years there were also factual errors including some from domarus s that kujau had copied before passing news to stern had already informed government saying it was a ministerial matter managers at stern tried to release first press statement that acknowledged forensic findings and stated that diaries were forged but official government announcement was released five minutes before stern s arrests and trial once government announcement appeared on television kujau took his wife and mistress to austria he introduced latter to edith as his cleaner after he saw a news report a few days later naming him as forger and hearing that stern had paid nine million dms he first phoned his lawyer and then hamburg state prosecutor forger agreed to hand himself in at border between austria and west germany following day when police raided his house they found several notebooks identical to those used in fraud kujau continued to use a variation of story he had told heidemann that of obtaining diaries from east but he was bitter that journalist was still at liberty and had withheld so much of stern s money from him after thirteen days on 26 may he wrote a full confession stating that heidemann knew all along that diaries were forgeries heidemann was arrested that evening following a police investigation that lasted over a year on 21 august 1984 trial against heidemann and kujau opened in hamburg both men were charged with defrauding stern of 9 3 million dms despite seriousness of charges facing two men hamilton considers that it also appeared clear that trial was going to be a farce a real slapstick affair that would enrage judge and amuse entire world proceedings lasted until july 1985 when both men were sent to prison four years and eight months for heidemann four years and six months for kujau in september one of supporting magistrates overseeing case was replaced after he fell asleep three days later court were amused to see pictures of idi amin s underpants which heidemann had framed on his wall at times case denigrated into a match between kujau and heidemann in his summing up judge hans ulrich schroeder said that negligence of stern has persuaded me to soften sentences against two main co conspirators heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1 7 million dms from stern kujau guilty of receiving 1 5 million dms
