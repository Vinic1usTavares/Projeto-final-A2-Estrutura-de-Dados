hurricane ingrid was one of two tropical cyclones along with hurricane manuel to strike mexico within a 24 hour period first such occurrence since 1958 ingrid was ninth named storm and second hurricane of 2013 atlantic hurricane season it formed on september 12 in gulf of mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned manuel in eastern pacific after initially moving westward toward veracruz ingrid turned northeastward away from coast favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on september 14 and next day ingrid attained peak winds of 140 km h 85 mph subsequently increased wind shear weakened convection as storm turned more to northwest and west on september 16 ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico as a strong tropical storm and dissipated next day hurricane was also last one to form in gulf of mexico until hurricane hermine in 2016 combined impacts of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected two thirds of mexico killing 192 people and causing mxn 75 billion or roughly us 5 7 billion in damage most of effects were due to manuel though ingrid was directly responsible for at least 32 deaths and 20 billion mxn us 1 5 billion in damage two storms precipitated of water equivalent of filling every dam in mexico rainfall from storm peaked at in tuxpan veracruz rains caused widespread flooding damaging at least 14 000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges in tamaulipas where storm made landfall rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers effects of storm spread into south texas causing high tides and some flooding after storm mexican government declared several municipalities to be in states of emergency relief agencies distributed food and aid to hardest hit areas although in tamaulipas residents had to rely on assistance from local gulf cartel names ingrid and manuel were both later retired due to their impacts meteorological history on august 28 a tropical wave exited west coast of africa which moved westward across atlantic ocean without development on september 2 an area of convection or thunderstorms developed along northern portion of wave but was eventually absorbed into tropical storm gabrielle north of puerto rico wave continued westward through caribbean sea into a large area of cyclonic flow at surface which extended across central america into eastern pacific around september 9 broad system developed two areas of disturbed weather one in eastern pacific would become hurricane manuel and other developing over northwestern caribbean latter system slowly organized developing a low pressure area on september 11 subsequently system moved over yucatan peninsula although land interaction prevented immediate development conditions favored further development in bay of campeche early on september 12 low emerged into bay and at 1800 utc national hurricane center nhc assessed that tropical depression ten developed about east northeast of veracruz this was confirmed by a hurricane hunters flight indicating presence of a closed low level circulation on september 13 convection and organization increased and depression strengthened into tropical storm ingrid while weak steering currents resulted in little movement of cyclone partially due to presence of nearby hurricane manuel in eastern pacific basin on other side of mexico significant wind shear existed in vicinity of ingrid nonetheless strong convection and intermittent development of an eye allowed for strengthening of storm on september 14 ingrid strengthened into a hurricane second of season that afternoon around that time hurricane turned sharply northeastward due to a trough over eastern mexico and a ridge over southeastern united states additional strengthening took place thereafter and ingrid reached a peak intensity of 140 km h 85 mph early on september 15 while starting to move northward and begin a northwest turn towards mexican coastline afterward ingrid reached peak winds shear increased and began to weaken hurricane as it approached mexican coast center became displaced to edge of convection and nhc forecaster daniel brown noted that ingrid did not resemble a classic hurricane in satellite pictures at around 1115 utc on september 16 ingrid made landfall just south of la pesca tamaulipas in northeastern mexico after having weakened into a strong tropical storm with 100 km h 65 mph winds near landfall hurricane hunters reported flight level winds of 120 km h 75 mph which after adjusting to surface winds confirmed weakening storm moved ashore less than 24 hours after tropical storm manuel struck pacific coast of mexico on michoacan making it first time since 1958 that tropical cyclones struck both coasts of country within one day ingrid rapidly weakened into a tropical depression over land and although convection temporarily reorganized circulation dissipated on september 17 preparations and impact right thumb satellite image of developing tropical storms ingrid centered over bay of campeche and manuel located southwest of mexico several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were posted in anticipation of storm upon development of ingrid into a tropical cyclone at 2100 utc on september 12 government of mexico issued a tropical storm warning from coatzacoalcos to nautla veracruz at 1500 utc on september 13 tropical storm warning was extended northward to cabo rojo veracruz with a tropical storm watch northward to la pesca tamaulipas later a hurricane warning was issued between cabo rojo to la pesca with a tropical storm watch to bahia tamaulipas pemex oil company operated by mexican government evacuated workers from three platforms in gulf of mexico due to storm in tamaulipas classes were canceled in 27 municipalities and all classes were temporarily canceled throughout veracruz threat of storm caused events for mexican independence day to be canceled after a restriction on news in 2010 due to local drug war members of a citizen alert system in tamaulipas used twitter to notify about flooding missing people and need for assistance early in its duration ingrid produced tropical storm force winds along coast of veracruz while making landfall it also brought tropical storm force winds along northeastern mexican coast sustained winds at la pesca peaked at with gusts to nhc remarked that ingrid likely caused above normal tides in northeastern mexico but there was no data to back up statement interacting with hurricane manuel on pacific coast and broad cyclonic flow ingrid dropped heavy rainfall across eastern mexico primarily in tabasco veracruz and tamaulipas states in tuxpan veracruz rainfall totaled over 10 days while at presa vicente guerrero dam in tamaulipas precipitation reached surface runoff from storm spread to pacific coast of mexico producing flooding in guerrero in combination with manuel impacts from both storms produced 162 billion m3 5 7 trillion cu ft of water equivalent of filling every dam in country combined effects of hurricanes ingrid and manuel affected about two thirds of mexico rains from ingrid caused flooding and landslides across mexico causing many rivers to rise and isolating towns in veracruz alone rains flooded 68 rivers which damaged 121 roads and 31 bridges including two destroyed bridges about 14 000 houses were damaged to some degree heavy rainfall forced 23 000 people to evacuate their homes 9 000 of whom went to emergency shelters some forced to leave by mexican army in high risk areas evacuees who did not reside in shelters generally went to houses of friends and family also in veracruz flooding killed about 20 000 livestock along coast of tamaulipas damage occurred from soto la marina to la pesca panuco river in tamaulipas rose above its banks flooding two poor towns along its path and damaging adjacent roads also in state storm damaged local sorghum fields two people in state required rescue after their truck was swept away by a river throughout mexico ingrid killed 32 people mostly due to flooding and mudslides two storms collectively killed at least 192 people and caused mxn 75 us 5 7 billion manuel was responsible for majority of overall effects although ingrid still left an estimated mxn 20 billion us 1 5 billion in estimated economic losses according to aon benfield insured damages totaled mxn 3 billion us 230 million a total of six fatalities occurred in states of hidalgo and puebla three of which were caused after a vehicle was swept off a road while three other people died after their home was buried by a mudslide another death occurred in hidalgo after a house collapsed on a woman in town of de guerrero twelve people died after a landslide smashed a bus in altotonga veracruz and three people died in tamaulipas fringes of storm extended into southern texas where winds gusted to tropical storm force and rainfall was around thunderstorms and high tides affected coastline with tides reaching above normal causing beaches to close due to flooding aftermath and retirement twin impacts of hurricanes ingrid and manuel prompted officials in mexico to declare a state of emergency in 155 municipalities in veracruz tamaulipas chiapas oaxaca guerrero and chihuahua nation s health ministry sent medical crews across country to affected areas in an effort to prevent spread of disease agency also suggested residents boil their water officials opened shelters in tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged housing about 2 000 people in weeks following storm mexican food bank sent about 800 tons of food to hardest hit parts of country in guerrero veracruz and sinaloa in addition mexican red cross delivered 186 tons of food to veracruz alone volunteers delivered about 600 blankets and various cleaning supplies to town of panuco following storms national civil protection coordination received authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding law had passed in 2012 but initially lacked authority to enforce it some residents in tamaulipas complained at slow pace of receiving aid in response gulf cartel brought relief items to with one columnist for el universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents because of severe damage caused by storm in mexico name ingrid was later retired by world meteorological organization and will never again be used for a north atlantic hurricane it was replaced with imelda for 2019 atlantic hurricane season name manuel was also retired from pacific naming list and was replaced with mario see also hurricane manuel affected pacific coast of mexico concurrently with ingrid hurricane bret originated in gulf of mexico and took a northward track but attained greater strength than ingrid and struck southern texas hurricane lorenzo moved erratically in bay of campeche before striking veracruz hurricane roxanne similar storm with an erratic track hurricane diana struck eastern mexico with
