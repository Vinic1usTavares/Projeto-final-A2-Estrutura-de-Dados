primarily developed by atlus main developer for megami tensei series game received additional development help from nextech a company that would later be rebranded as nex entertainment and work on games such as shining soul and children of mana game s cgi cutscenes were developed with help from frameworks entertainment nine was produced by long time megami tensei producer kouji okada directed by kazunori sakai and written by nobutaka shimizu kazuma kaneko a regular designer for series returned to design new demons for title many of them such as character maria proved challenging for him due to his past work mainly involving creating depictions of god and lucifer as opposed to goddess like figures he also found making them move convincingly in new 3d environment problematic kaneko suggested that a new artist be brought on as a collaborator on project so yasuomi umetsu was hired to design game s main characters this was part of an attempt to distinguish nine from previous megami tensei games concept for nine originated during staff discussions about how shin megami tensei would work as an online title shin megami tensei series featurette development started at some point in 2001 and was still in its early stages of development in october of that year during its early stages game was known as shin megami tensei online although team had option of making nine an online exclusive title okada wanted a single player mode to introduce players to workings and world of game a part of planned online component was teaming up with or fighting different players depending on their alignment nine is not ninth game in shin megami tensei series title refers to number of moral alignments that are available in shin megami tensei games decision to create a nine tiered alignment system was because okada wanted to explore original game s moral alignments in more detail this was also reason why game was set between shin megami tensei and its sequel transcript setting was directly based on tokyo s shinjuku shibuya and ikebukuro districts game was first megami tensei title developed for xbox first to switch over to a third person camera perspective from first person perspectives of earlier megami tensei titles first to feature a customizable player avatar and first megami tensei game to feature fully 3d graphics something previously accomplished with maken x a 1999 standalone game for dreamcast okada described development process as challenging with developing new real time battle system being a large part of that challenge two prevalent issues were adjusting balance of battle system and incorporating second tactical system for hacking segments game s sound and music were handled by takahiro ogata masaki kurokawa and kenichi tsuchiya ogata acted as sound director to accurately create sound of modern day tokyo within nine ogata and kurokawa went to districts such as kichijoji and roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds at different times of day while there was a general theme for various city districts music subtly changed depending on player s overall alignment for instance to represent law and chaos alignments in game piano was used for former and guitar for latter battle music also featured randomly generated soundtrack variations with ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes a major improvement enabled by xbox was use of 5 1 surround sound which could enable richer use of both music and in game sound effects according to okada this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level maken x had already given team a chance to use 3d sound but nine was first title to make major use of 5 1 and implementing it alongside all other features proved a challenge for team release nine was originally announced in august 2001 under title shin megami tensei online originally rumored to be for ps2 its announced features included use of voice recognition and online broadband services these features would later be clarified as being planned for online implementation rather than in development after a long period of media silence its official title was announced in february 2002 nine was heavily promoted at multiple japanese gaming events throughout 2002 game released on december 5 2002 it was celebrated with an official launch event attended by okada and kaneko a deluxe edition released simultaneously with standard edition containing a figurine of maria and a keycard related to accessing online content game was later re released as part of microsoft s platinum collection budget collection on october 23 2003 a novelization written by takumi miyajima and with a cover illustration by kaneko was published by fujimi shobo on march 25 2003 a comics anthology was released by enterbrain on march 24 after 2002 electronic entertainment expo e3 it was stated by atlus that while small size of game s online component did not rule out a western release atlus themselves were unable to finance a dedicated server and other companies such as microsoft were unlikely to provide such funding following year at e3 2003 atlus responded with no comment when asked whether nine would see a western release in 2006 atlus stated that there were no plans to bring nine overseas with their focus being on newer megami tensei titles online functions planned for nine were intended to be incorporated from release but in august 2002 atlus announced that they would divide game in two parts one stand alone offline version and one online version reason given for this was that development team did not have enough time to integrate all online functions they wanted to include in game and that atlus did not want to delay game s release atlus planned to release online version in 2002 but put development on hold due to high costs of developing an online game and postponed release until 2003 in august 2003 they announced that they no longer had any plans to publish online version for xbox due to problems relating to network based development and profitability of online games with cancellation of xbox live version development continued on a version of nine for microsoft windows personal computers pcs this version formed base for what would become shin megami tensei imagine a massively multiplayer online role playing game for pcs developed by cave and released in japan and western regions across 2007 and 2009 reception despite heavy promotion it received upon release game only reached 18 in dengeki charts with initial sales of 14 000 units its sales continued to fall and within three weeks game had dropped out of dengeki top 50 by end of year nine had sold just over 30 000 according to atlus game s sales by end of 2002 2003 fiscal year had reached 45 000 units this fell below their planned sales number of 67 000 units in may atlus announced that development costs and poor sales of xbox games including nine had resulted in a financial loss for that year four reviewers for famitsu gave it respective scores of 9 8 7 and 7 on positive side demon fusion and negotiation being cited as addictive and two of reviewers lauded shift into 3d graphics on negative side aspects of battle system was seen as convoluted or confusing while other elements such as a confusing interface and conspicuous lack of online functions brought experience down one reviewer also noted that game was geared towards those who had already played shin megami tensei rpgfan s john mccarrol was positive in his early preview despite not knowing much about promised online functions saying that despite some bland visuals nine promised to be one of best xbox games released in japan and possibly north america kurt kalata and christopher j snelgrove writing for gaming website hardcore gaming 101 had mixed feelings about title finding its visuals dull and gameplay system unimpressive due to ultimate lack of online functionality they also commented that nine felt weirdly incomplete saying that it was not really worth tracking down for series fans notes references external links official website archived
