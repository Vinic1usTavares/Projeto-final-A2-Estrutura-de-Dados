life de fratus is a devout roman catholic who though he was raised in a large catholic family struggled with his faith after an injury early in his career but ultimately determined injury was a gift

you a little more time there is a big reason why that injury happened and i feel that i used it as best as i could have he noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others early in his professional career he struggled to find fellow catholics and noted that most of his teammates were either protestants or not religious moreover in many small towns that house minor league teams there are no catholic churches so de fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a catholic lifestyle however upon realizing that there is more to life than material success he discovered a need for god and has thus developed his faith aside from his faith he enjoys writing and recording music and playing guitar he has two brothers older of whom steve played in minor leagues

and straight and in an economically stable area subsequently de fratus penned a retort to baer via facebook in which he commented i sincerely hope that you will take time to talk to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters i do not apologize for anything i have said i have a platform and i
