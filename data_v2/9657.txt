look mickey also known as look mickey is a 1961 oil on canvas painting by roy lichtenstein widely regarded as bridge between his abstract expressionism and pop art works it is notable for its ironic humor and aesthetic value as well as being first example of artist s employment of ben day dots speech balloons and comic imagery as a source for a painting painting was bequeathed to washington d c national gallery of art upon lichtenstein s death building on his late 1950s drawings of comic strips characters look mickey marks lichtenstein s first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations of pop culture and so satirize and comment upon then developing process of mass production of visual imagery in this lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing to work of artists today lichtenstein borrows from a donald duck illustrated story book showing mickey mouse and donald duck during a fishing mishap however he makes significant alterations to original source including modifying color scheme and perspective while seeming to make statements about himself work dates from lichtenstein s first solo exhibition and is regarded by art critics as revolutionary both as a progression of pop art and as a work of modern art in general it was later reproduced in his 1973 painting artist s studio look mickey which shows painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of lichtenstein s studio background during late 1950s and early 1960s a number of american painters began to adapt imagery and motifs of comic strips into their work lichtenstein was among them and in 1958 began to make drawings of comic strip characters andy warhol produced his earliest paintings in style in 1960 lichtenstein unaware of warhol s work produced look mickey and popeye in 1961 lichtenstein s 1961 works especially look mickey are considered a minor step from his earlier comic strip pop art thumb lichtenstein used this image from donald duck lost and found illustrated by bob grant and bob totten for look mickey according to lichtenstein foundation look mickey was based on little golden book series national gallery of art notes that source is entitled donald duck lost and found written in 1960 by carl and published through disney enterprises image was illustrated by bob grant and bob totten an alternative theory suggests that look mickey and popeye were enlargements of bubble gum wrappers this image marked first of numerous works in which lichtenstein cropped his source to bring viewer closer to scene a number of stories purport to tell of moment of inspiration for look mickey critic alice goldfarb marquis writes that artist recalled one of his sons pointing to a comic book and challenging i bet you can t paint as good as that another says that painting resulted from an effort to prove his abilities to both his son and his son s classmates who mocked lichtenstein s hard to fathom abstracts american painter allan kaprow once stated in reference to a bazooka bubble gum wrapper to lichtenstein you can t teach color from cezanne you can only teach it from something like this lichtenstein then showed him one of his donald duck images during comic book phase of his career lichtenstein often slightly altered colorization of original source according to marco livingstone his early comic subjects comprise a loose and improvised style clearly derived from de kooning art historian jonathan fineberg describes a lichtenstein painting of 1960 as an abstract expressionist picture with mickey mouse in it related stylistically to de kooning women when leo castelli saw both lichtenstein s and warhol s large comic strip based works he elected to show only lichtenstein s causing warhol to create campbell s soup cans series to avoid competing with more refined style of comics lichtenstein was then producing bourdon p 109 he once said i ve got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from lichtenstein and james rosenquist that will be very personal that won t look like i m doing exactly what they re doing watson p 79 lichtenstein s foray into comics led to abandonment of topic by warhol although lichtenstein continued to work with comic sources after 1961 he avoided easily identified sources like popeye and mickey mouse during autumn 1961 allan kaprow a fellow teacher at rutgers university introduced lichenstein to art dealer ivan karp director of leo castelli gallery lichtenstein showed karp several paintings but not look mickey he instead impressed him with girl with ball and karp decided to represent lichtenstein a few weeks later description painting is one of lichtenstein s first non expressionist works and marks his initial employment of ben day dots which he used to give it an industrial half tone effect painting is his first use both of a speech balloon and comics as source material work has visible pencil marks and was produced using a plastic bristle dog brush to apply oil paint onto canvas by time of his death look mickey was regarded as lichtenstein s breakthrough work in reproducing a mass produced illustration in a painterly style lichtenstein simplifies by reducing composition to primary colors which serves to accentuate its mass appeal and largely gives it pop look typically ben day dots enable an artist to produce a variety of colors by using dots of a few colors to give illusion of a broader palette by mixing dots of different colors like an ink jet printer just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using only a limited number of primary hues lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues instead for each color that he wanted to include in a work he used that color paint lichtenstein made several alterations to original work he eliminated various non essential figures and rotated dock so that donald looks off side rather than end at same time he kept donald and mickey in almost same positions as they were in original lichtenstein not only redesigned space but also altered position of donald s body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition walt disney said about donald duck he s got a big mouth a big belligerent eye a neck and a substantial backside that s highly flexible duck comes near being animator s ideal subject lichtenstein s painting reflects many of these physical features compared to original source donald leans further forward towards water and mickey less so mickey s face is more flushed seemingly less from exertion than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards donald composition incorporates some of foibles of comic book printing including joining of contours of waves with yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space interpretation large scale reproduction of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at time critics applauded work s playfulness inherent humor and irreverence according to diane waldman of solomon r guggenheim museum look mickey is broad comedy and falls into category of slapstick in lichtenstein s obituary los angeles times critic christopher knight described work as a slyly hilarious riff on abstract expressionism lichtenstein s slight alterations to its linear clarity and colour critic writes add to its aesthetic value and grandeur reinforced by his choice of scale a common misconception about lichtenstein comes from fact that in his best known works his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons graham bader wrote that lichtenstein s painting in fact appears more product of industrial manufacture than very pulp image on which it is based look mickey is considered self referential in sense that artist is painting something through which viewer may see elements of artist thumb look mickey has reflective elements that call upon caravaggio s narcissus bader observes that look mickey is concerned both with artistic process and lichtenstein s new painting techniques he believes it can be considered a self portrait in sense that it explicitly situates painting s maker himself within self enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center painting shows donald looking into reflective water at lichtenstein s blue rfl signature as a kind of surrogate for image s creator in a manner that is reminiscent of caravaggio s narcissus in which subject gazes at his own reflection on water this is viewed as an allegory of lichtenstein s position as an artist trained to develop his realist instincts despite prominence of abstract expressionism when viewed this way mickey serves as vanguard modernist superego towering over lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts lichtenstein uses red ben day dots to color mickey s face according to some art critics this gives character appearance of blushing other interpretations are that coloration is merely skin pigmentation or that it is hue associated with a healthy glow since mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur another interpretation supported by original source in which mickey says that if donald can land fish he can have it for lunch is that mickey s face is red due to exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority those adhering to blushing interpretation are bolstered by uneven of red dots but others are quick to point out that lichtenstein s ben day dot technique was still in a primitive stage he did not develop use of a stencil i e technique of pressing liquid paint onto surface through a screen of dots to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963 graham bader describing it as engine of painting s narrative notes intrigue created by juxtaposition of donald s heightened sense of visual perception as it relates to his anticipated catch and his deadened sense of tactile perception as it relates to having a fishing hook in back of his own shirt in this sense lichtenstein has chosen to depict a source that has as its subject a divide between raised visual awareness and an absent sense of touch lichtenstein frequently explored vision related themes after he began to work in pop art genre early examples include i can see whole room and there s nobody in it and look mickey in this painting donald s large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while mickey s small eyes indicate his disbelief that donald has caught anything significant like lichenstein s works with subjects looking through a periscope torpedo los a mirror girl in mirror or a peephole i can see whole room and there s nobody in it look mickey with a subject looking at his reflection in water is a prominent example of theme of vision he uses narrative to emphasize this motif while presenting several visual elements legacy right thumb artist s studio look mickey painting was included in lichtenstein s first solo exhibition at leo castelli gallery a show in which all works had pre sold before its opening in february 1962 exhibition which ran from february 10 through march 3 1962 included engagement ring blam and refrigerator he included painting in his artist s studio look mickey 1973 showing it hanging prominently on wall of pictorial space intended to depict his studio as ideal studio and implying that his popularity with critic and public his choice of popular culture subject matter reflecting on look mickey many years later he said painting was bequeathed to washington national gallery of art after lichtenstein s death in 1997 following a 1990 pledge in honor of institution s 50th anniversary it remains in gallery s collection where it is on permanent view harold rosenberg once described reworking of comics source as follows difference between a comic strip of mickey mouse and a lichtenstein painting of same was
