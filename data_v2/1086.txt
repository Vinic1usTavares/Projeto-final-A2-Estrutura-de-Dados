a diving cylinder scuba tank or diving tank is a gas cylinder used to store and transport high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set it may also be used for surface supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba cylinders provide gas to diver through demand valve of a diving regulator or breathing loop of a diving rebreather diving cylinders are usually manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys and are normally fitted with one of two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to regulator other accessories such as manifolds cylinder bands protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided various configurations of harness may be used to carry cylinder or cylinders while diving depending on application cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume known as water capacity of between and a maximum working pressure rating from cylinders are also available in smaller sizes such as 0 5 1 5 and 2 litres however these are often used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys and buoyancy rather than breathing scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder a pair of similar cylinders or a main cylinder and a smaller pony cylinder carried on diver s back or clipped onto harness at sides paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent in some cases more than two cylinders are needed when pressurised a cylinder carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity because gas is compressed up to several hundred times atmospheric pressure selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation is based on amount of gas required to safely complete dive diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air but because main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air many jurisdictions have regulations that govern filling recording of contents and labelling for diving cylinders periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory to ensure safety of operators of filling stations pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply terminology term diving cylinder tends to be used by gas equipment engineers manufacturers support professionals and divers speaking british english scuba tank or diving tank is more often used colloquially by non professionals and native speakers of american english term oxygen tank is commonly used by non divers however this is a misnomer since these cylinders typically contain compressed atmospheric breathing air or an oxygen enriched air mix they rarely contain pure oxygen except when used for rebreather diving shallow decompression stops in technical diving or for in water oxygen recompression therapy breathing pure oxygen at depths greater than can result in oxygen toxicity diving cylinders have also been referred to as bottles or flasks usually preceded with word scuba diving air or bailout cylinders may also be called a trademark derived from aqua lung equipment made by aqua lung la company although that is more properly applied to an open circuit scuba set or open circuit diving regulator diving cylinders may also be specified by their application as in bailout cylinders stage cylinders deco cylinders sidemount cylinders pony cylinders suit inflation cylinders etc parts thumb alt two 12 litre steel cylinders connected by an isolation manifold and two stainless steel tank bands with black plastic tank boots twin 12 litre steel cylinder set functional diving cylinder consists of a pressure vessel and a cylinder valve there are usually one or more optional accessories depending on specific application pressure vessel pressure vessel is a seamless cylinder normally made of cold extruded aluminium or forged steel filament wound composite cylinders are used in fire fighting breathing apparatus and oxygen first aid equipment because of their low weight but are rarely used for diving due to their high positive buoyancy they are occasionally used when portability for accessing dive site is critical such as in cave diving composite cylinders certified to iso 11119 2 or iso 11119 3 may only be used for underwater applications if they are manufactured in accordance with requirements for underwater use and are marked uw aluminium an especially common cylinder provided at tropical dive resorts is aluminium s80 which is an aluminium cylinder design with an internal volume of rated to hold a nominal volume of of atmospheric pressure gas at its rated working pressure of aluminium cylinders are also often used where divers carry many cylinders such as in technical diving in water which is warm enough that dive suit does not provide much buoyancy because greater buoyancy of aluminium cylinders reduces amount of extra buoyancy diver would need to achieve neutral buoyancy they are also sometimes preferred when carried as sidemount or sling cylinders as near neutral buoyancy allows them to hang comfortably along sides of diver s body without disturbing trim and they can be handed off to another diver or stage dropped with a minimal effect on buoyancy most aluminium cylinders are flat bottomed allowing them to stand upright on a level surface but some were manufactured with domed bottoms when in use cylinder valve and regulator add mass to top of cylinder so base tends to be relatively buoyant and aluminium drop cylinders tend to rest on bottom in an inverted position if near neutral buoyancy aluminium alloys used for diving cylinders are 6061 and 6351 6351 alloy is subject to sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer s recommendations 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture but many old cylinders are still in service and are still legal and considered safe if they pass periodic hydrostatic visual and eddy current tests required by regulation and as specified by manufacturer number of cylinders that have failed catastrophically is in order of 50 out of some 50 million manufactured a larger number have failed eddy current test and visual inspection of neck threads or have leaked and been removed from service without harm to anyone aluminium cylinders are usually manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets in a process which first presses walls and base then trims top edge of cylinder walls followed by press forming shoulder and neck final structural process is machining neck outer surface boring and cutting neck threads and o ring groove cylinder is then heat treated tested and stamped with required permanent markings aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear this makes them heavier than they need to be for strength but extra weight at base also helps keep centre of gravity low which gives better balance in water and reduces excess buoyancy steel cylinders thumb animation showing two stages of deep drawing of a steel plate to a cup and a similar cup to a diving cylinder blank with domed bottom in cold water diving where a diver wearing a highly buoyant thermally insulating dive suit has a large excess of buoyancy steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders they also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with same gas capacity due to considerably higher material strength so use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for same gas capacity a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by diver steel cylinders are more susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion particularly in seawater and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage it is not difficult to monitor external corrosion and repair paint when damaged and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life often longer than aluminium cylinders as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits steel cylinders are manufactured with domed convex and dished concave bottoms dished profile allows them to stand upright on a horizontal surface and is standard shape for industrial cylinders cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres j domed bottoms give a larger volume for same cylinder mass and are standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba steel alloys used for dive cylinder manufacture are authorised by manufacturing standard for example us standard dot requires use of open hearth basic oxygen or electric steel of uniform quality approved alloys include ne 9115 9125 carbon boron and intermediate manganese with specified constituents including manganese and carbon and molybdenum chromium boron nickel or zirconium steel cylinders may be manufactured from steel plate discs which are cold drawn to a cylindrical cup form in two or three stages and generally have a domed base if intended for scuba market so they cannot stand up by themselves after forming base and side walls top of cylinder is trimmed to length heated and hot spun to form shoulder and close neck this process thickens material of shoulder cylinder is heat treated by quenching and tempering to provide best strength and toughness cylinders are machined to provide neck thread and o ring seat if applicable then chemically cleaned or shot blasted inside and out to remove mill scale after inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with required permanent markings followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising cylinder neck neck of cylinder is internally threaded to fit a cylinder valve there are several standards for neck threads these include taper thread

neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in cylinder neck and against flange of valve shoulder of cylinder carries stamp markings providing required information about cylinder cylinder valve thumb alt tops of two cylinders showing regulators connected via din and yoke connectors regulators with din valve left and yoke valve right purpose of cylinder valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow to and from pressure vessel and to provide a connection with regulator or filling hose cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating a metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed into bottom of valve extends into cylinder to reduce risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in cylinder getting into gas passages when cylinder is inverted and blocking or jamming regulator some of these dip tubes have a plain opening but some have an integral filter cylinder valves are classified by four basic aspects thread

and metal of diving regulator fluoroelastomer e g viton o rings may be used with cylinders storing oxygen rich gas mixtures to reduce risk of fire there are two basic types of cylinder valve to regulator connection in general use for scuba cylinders containing air a clamp or yoke connectors connection on regulator surrounds valve pillar and presses output o ring of pillar valve against input seat of regulator connection is officially described as connection cga 850 yoke yoke is screwed down snug by hand can make yoke impossible to remove later without tools and seal is created by clamping o ring between surfaces of regulator and valve when valve is opened cylinder pressure expands o ring against outer surface of o ring groove in valve insufficient clamping force may allow pressure to extrude o ring between valve and regulator faces resulting in a leak this type of connection is simple cheap and very widely used worldwide it has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and weakest part of seal o ring is not well protected from din screw thread connectors regulator screws into cylinder valve trapping o ring securely between sealing face of valve and o ring groove in regulator these are more reliable than a clamps because o ring is well protected but many countries do not use din fittings widely on compressors or cylinders which have din fittings so a diver traveling abroad with a din system may need to take an adaptor either for connecting din regulator to a rented cylinder or for connecting an a clamp filler hose to a din cylinder valve there are also cylinder valves for scuba cylinders containing gases other than air new european norm en 144 3 2003 introduced a new type of valve similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar din valves however with a metric fitting on both cylinder and regulator these are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in earth s atmosphere i e 22 100 from august 2008 these were required in european union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean however even with use of new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen clean which is exactly how previous system worked an m male thread cylinder valve was supplied with some drager semi closed circuit recreational rebreathers drager ray for use with nitrox mixtures regulator supplied with rebreather had a compatible

available to allow connection of din regulators to yoke cylinder valves a clamp or yoke adaptor and to connect yoke regulators to din cylinder valves there are two categories of adaptors plug adaptors and block adaptors plug adaptors are rated for 232 240 bar and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them these can be recognised by a dimple recess opposite to outlet opening used to locate screw of an a clamp block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar and can be used with almost any 200 bar din valve a block adaptor screws into a din cylinder valve to allow connection of a

plane connection socket axes are orthogonal to plane of arms and valve spindles are orthogonal to their outlets and axis of each arm with knobs to most commonly used cylinder valve type is single outlet plain valve sometimes known as a k valve which allows connection of a single regulator and has no reserve function it simply opens to allow gas flow or closes to shut it off several configurations are used with options of din or a clamp connection and vertical or transverse spindle arrangements valve is operated by turning a knob usually rubber or plastic which affords a comfortable grip several turns are required to fully open valves some din valves are convertible to a clamp by use of an insert which is screwed into opening y and h cylinder valves have two outlets each with its own valve allowing two regulators to be connected to cylinder if one regulator which is a common failure mode or ices up which can happen in water below about 5 degc its valve can be closed and cylinder breathed from regulator connected to other valve difference between an h valve and a y valve is that y valve body splits into two posts roughly 90deg to each other and 45deg from vertical axis looking like a y while an h valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to manifold socket with valve posts parallel and vertical which looks a bit like an h y valves are also known as slingshot valves due to their appearance reserve valves thumb left a j valve from c 1960 alt a yoke style cylinder valve is

axial spindle cylinder valve with reserve lever alt close up of a draeger reserve valve showing plastic guard and connection of operating lever which is held on by a spring loaded pin and which can be adjusted to several angles depending on which of holes on reserve spindle pin engages until 1970s when submersible pressure gauges on regulators came into common use diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to diver that cylinder was nearly empty gas supply was automatically cut off by a spring loaded valve when gas pressure reached reserve pressure to release reserve diver pulled down on a rod that ran along side of cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve diver would then finish dive before reserve typically was consumed on occasion divers would inadvertently trigger mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and not realizing that reserve had already been accessed could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever these valves became known as j valves from being item j in one of first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs standard non reserve yoke valve at time was item k and is often still referred to as a k valve j valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility where submersible pressure gauge spg can not be read while recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of j valve us department of defense us navy noaa national oceanographic and atmospheric administration and osha national occupational health and safety administration all still allow or recommend use of j valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge they are generally not available through recreational dive shops but are still available from some manufacturers they can be significantly more expensive than k valves from same manufacturer less common in 1950s to 1970s was an r valve which was equipped with a restriction that caused breathing to become difficult as cylinder neared exhaustion but that would allow less restricted breathing if diver began to ascend and ambient water pressure lessened providing a larger pressure differential over orifice it was never particularly popular because if it was necessary for diver to descend during exit from a cave or wreck breathing would become progressively more difficult as diver went deeper eventually becoming impossible until diver could ascend to a low enough ambient pressure handed valves some cylinder valve models have axial spindles in line with cylinder axis and are not handed standard side spindle valves have valve knob on diver s right side when back mounted side spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair one with knob to right and other with knob to left but in all cases valve is opened by turning knob anticlockwise and closed by turning it clockwise this is convention with almost all valves for all purposes left and right hand side spindle valves are used by sidemount divers these may be blanked off manifold valves or specially made for purpose bursting disk some national standards require that cylinder valve includes a bursting disk a pressure relief device that will release gas before cylinder fails in event of if a bursting disk ruptures during a dive entire contents of cylinder will be lost in a very short time risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc in good condition on a correctly filled cylinder is very low burst disk over pressure protection is specified in cga standard s1 1 standard for pressure relief devices accessories additional components for convenience protection or other functions not directly required for function as a pressure

manifold socket on left so it can be used as left cylinder of a manifolded twin in this case manifold socket is plugged so cylinder is usable as a single and when in use valve knob would be reached over left shoulder a cylinder manifold is a tube which connects two cylinders together so that contents of both can be supplied to one or more regulators there are three commonly used configurations of manifold oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is attached to cylinder valve outlet and an outlet connection in middle to which regulator is attached a variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at outlet connector cylinders are isolated from manifold when closed and manifold can be attached or disconnected while cylinders are pressurised more recently manifolds have become available which connect cylinders on cylinder side of valve leaving outlet connection of cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator this means that connection cannot be made or broken while cylinders are pressurised as there is no valve to isolate manifold from interior of cylinder this apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder and isolated from internal pressure independently which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing regulator on other cylinder access to all gas in both cylinders these manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in manifold which allows contents of cylinders to be isolated from each other this allows contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for diver if a leak at cylinder neck thread manifold connection or burst disk on other cylinder causes its contents to be lost a relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into neck threads of both cylinders and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator these manifolds can include a reserve valve either in main valve or at one cylinder this system is mainly of historical interest valve cage also known as a manifold cage or regulator cage this is a structure which can be clamped to neck of cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling valve closed by friction of against an overhead a valve cage is often made of stainless steel and some designs can snag on obstructions cylinder bands cylinder bands are straps usually of stainless steel which are used to clamp two cylinders together as a twin set cylinders may be manifolded or independent it is usual to use a cylinder band near top of cylinder just below shoulders and one lower down conventional distance between for bolting to a backplate is cylinder boot thumb twinned cylinders showing cylinder boots nets and lower band alt lower part of a twin steel set showing a stainless steel tank band just above black plastic cylinder boots boots and tank band have been fitted over close fitting small mesh netting covers intended to protect paintwork and facilitate rinsing and drying of surface under boots a cylinder boot is a hard rubber or plastic cover which fits over base of a diving cylinder to protect paint from abrasion and impact to protect surface cylinder stands on from impact with cylinder and in case of round bottomed cylinders to allow cylinder to stand upright on its base some boots have flats moulded into plastic to reduce tendency of cylinder to roll on a flat surface it is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between boot and cylinder and if this is seawater and paint under boot is in poor condition surface of cylinder may corrode in those areas this can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with overall drag of diver but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on environment cylinder net a cylinder net is a tubular net which is stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom function is to protect paintwork from scratching and on booted cylinders it also helps drain surface between boot and cylinder which reduces corrosion problems under boot mesh size is usually about some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an entrapment hazard in some environments such as caves and interior of wrecks occasionally sleeves made from other materials may be used to protect cylinder cylinder handle thumb plastic scuba cylinder handle alt top of a scuba cylinder showing a moulded black plastic carrying handle fitted by clamping around neck of cylinder just below cylinder valve a cylinder handle may be fitted usually clamped to neck to conveniently carry cylinder this can also increase risk of snagging in an enclosed environment dust caps and plugs these are used to cover cylinder valve orifice when cylinder is not in use to prevent dust water or other materials from contaminating orifice they can also help prevent o ring of a yoke type valve from falling out plug may be vented so that leakage of gas from cylinder does not pressurise plug making it difficult to remove pressure rating thickness of cylinder walls is directly related to working pressure and this affects buoyancy characteristics of cylinder a low pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in same alloy working pressure scuba cylinders are technically all high pressure gas containers but within industry in us there are three nominal working pressure ratings wp in common use low pressure 2400 to 2640 psi 165 to 182 bar standard 3000 psi 207 bar and high pressure 3300 to 3500 psi 227 to 241 bar us made aluminum cylinders usually have a standard working pressure of and compact aluminum range have a working pressure of some steel cylinders manufactured to us standards are permitted to exceed nominal working pressure by 10 and this is indicated by a symbol this extra pressure allowance is dependent on cylinder passing appropriate higher standard periodical hydrostatic test those parts of world using metric system usually refer to cylinder pressure directly in bar but would generally use high pressure to refer to a working pressure cylinder which can not be used with a yoke connector on regulator 232 bar is a very popular working pressure for scuba cylinders in both steel and aluminium test pressure hydrostatic test pressure tp is specified by manufacturing standard this is usually 1 5 x working pressure or in usa 1 67 x working pressure developed pressure cylinder working pressure is specified at a reference temperature usually 15 degc or 20 degc and cylinders also have a specified maximum safe working temperature often 65 degc actual pressure in cylinder will vary with temperature as described by gas laws but this is acceptable in terms of standards provided that developed pressure when corrected to reference temperature does not exceed specified working pressure stamped on cylinder this allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than specified working pressure when filling temperature is greater than reference temperature but not more than 65 degc provided that filling pressure does not exceed developed pressure for that temperature and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at correct working pressure when cooled to reference temperature pressure monitoring left thumb typical submersible pressure gauge alt a pressure gauge with a rubber protective housing and flexible high pressure hose which would be connected to high pressure port of regulator first stage so that internal pressure of a diving cylinder can be monitored throughout a dive low pressure area of face is coloured red to indicate that pressure may be too low to safely continue diving thumb gas pressure in diving cylinders is measured in both united states customary units psi pounds per square inch and metric bar where 1 bar equals 100 kpa 0 1 mpa or about 14 5 psi face of this us made cylinder pressure gauge is calibrated in pounds per square inch in red and in black internal pressure of a diving cylinder is measured at several stages during use it is checked before filling monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed this can all be done with pressure gauge on filling equipment pressure is also generally monitored by diver firstly as a check of contents before use then during use to ensure that there is enough left at all times to allow a safe completion of dive and often after a dive for purposes of record keeping and personal consumption rate calculation pressure is also monitored during hydrostatic testing to ensure that test is done to correct pressure most diving cylinders do not have a dedicated pressure gauge but this is a standard feature on most diving regulators and a requirement on all filling facilities there are two widespread standards for pressure measurement of diving gas in usa and perhaps a few other places pressure is measured in pounds per square inch psi and rest of world uses bar sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units such as kpa or mpa or in atmospheres atm or ata particularly gauges not actually used underwater capacity thumb right 12 litre and 3 litre steel diving cylinders typical primary and pony sizes alt two steel cylinders are shown larger is about twice diameter of smaller and about 20 longer there are two commonly used conventions for describing capacity of a diving cylinder one is based on internal volume of cylinder other is based on nominal volume of gas stored internal volume internal volume is commonly quoted in most countries using metric system this information is required by iso 13769 to be stamped on cylinder shoulder it can be measured easily by filling cylinder with fresh water this has resulted in term water capacity abbreviated as wc which is often stamp marked on cylinder shoulder it s almost always expressed as a volume in litres but sometimes as mass of water in kg fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy standard

nominal volume of gas stored nominal volume of gas stored is commonly quoted as cylinder capacity in usa it is a measure of volume of gas that can be released from full cylinder at atmospheric pressure terms used for capacity include free gas volume or free gas equivalent it depends on internal volume and working pressure of a cylinder if working pressure is higher cylinder will store more gas for same volume nominal working pressure is not necessarily same as actual working pressure used some steel cylinders manufactured to us standards are permitted to exceed nominal working pressure by 10 and this is indicated by a symbol this extra pressure allowance is dependent on cylinder passing appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for us cylinders exported to countries with differing standards nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on 10 higher pressure for example common aluminum 80 al80 cylinder is an aluminum cylinder which has a nominal free gas capacity of when pressurized to it has an internal volume of approximately standard sizes by volume of gas stored aluminum ia a large 13 l l high pressure cylinder heavy at aluminum s80 is probably most common cylinder used by resorts in many parts of world for back gas but also popular as a sling cylinder for decompression gas and as side mount cylinder in fresh water as it has nearly neutral buoyancy these cylinders have an internal volume of approximately and working pressure of they are also sometimes used as manifolded twins for back mount but in this application diver needs more ballast weights than with most steel cylinders of equivalent capacity aluminium is high pressure equivalent with a water capacity of 10 3 l and working pressure aluminum s40 is a popular cylinder for side mount and sling mount bailout and decompression gas for moderate depths as it is small diameter and nearly neutral buoyancy which makes it relatively unobtrusive for this mounting style internal volume is approximately and working pressure aluminum 9 0 l and steel 8 2 l are smaller and lighter than al80 but have a lower capacity and are suitable for smaller divers or shorter dives steel and 10 1 l at are both more compact and lighter than aluminium s80 and are both negatively buoyant which reduces amount of ballast weight required by diver steel 14 8 l 15 3 l and 16 0 l cylinders provide larger amounts of gas for nitrox or technical diving applications and configurations thumb right 200px technical diver with decompression gases in side mounted stage cylinders alt front view of a standing diver ready for water is shown he is carrying a sling mounted aluminium cylinder on each side clipped to a chest d ring and a hip d ring divers may carry one cylinder or multiples depending on requirements of dive where diving takes place in low risk areas where diver may safely make a free ascent or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder where diving risks are higher for example where visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving and particularly when diving under an overhead divers routinely carry more than one gas source diving cylinders may serve different purposes one or two cylinders may be used as a primary breathing source which is intended to be breathed from for most of dive a smaller cylinder carried in addition to a larger cylinder is called a pony bottle a cylinder to be used purely as an independent safety reserve is called a bailout bottle or emergency gas supply egs a pony bottle is commonly used as a bailout bottle but this would depend on time required to surface divers doing technical diving often carry different gases each in a separate cylinder for each phase of dive travel gas is used during descent and ascent it is typically air or nitrox with an oxygen content between 21 and 40 travel gas is needed when bottom gas is hypoxic and therefore is unsafe to breathe in shallow water bottom gas is only breathed at depth it is typically a helium based gas which is low in oxygen below 21 or hypoxic below 17 deco gas is used at decompression stops and is generally one or more nitrox mixes with a high oxygen content or pure oxygen to accelerate decompression a stage is a cylinder holding reserve travel or deco gas they are usually carried side slung clipped on either side of diver to harness of backplate and wing or buoyancy compensator rather than on back and may be left on distance line to be picked up for use on return stage dropped commonly divers use aluminium stage cylinders particularly in fresh water because they are nearly neutrally buoyant in water and can be removed underwater with less effect on diver s overall buoyancy suit inflation gas may be taken from a breathing gas cylinder or may be supplied from a small independent cylinder for safety divers sometimes carry an additional independent scuba cylinder with its own regulator to mitigate out of air emergencies should primary breathing gas supply fail for much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe this extra equipment is not needed or used this extra cylinder is known as a bail out cylinder and may be carried in several ways and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get diver safely back to surface open circuit scuba for open circuit scuba divers there are several options for combined cylinder and regulator system thumb left 15 litre 232 bar a clamp single cylinder open circuit scuba set alt a large scuba cylinder is shown with a handle boot plastic net and single hose regulator with one demand valve a combo submersible pressure gauge console and two low pressure inflator hoses single cylinder consists of a single large cylinder usually back mounted with one first stage regulator and usually two second stage regulators this configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply it has no redundancy in case of failure if cylinder or first stage regulator fails diver is totally out of air and faces a life threatening emergency recreational diver training agencies train divers to rely on a buddy to assist them in this situation skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses this equipment configuration although common with entry level divers and used for most sport diving is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed or where there is an overhead environment wreck diving cave diving or ice diving as it provides no functional redundancy single cylinder with dual regulators consists of a single large back mounted cylinder with two first stage regulators each with a second stage regulator this system is used for diving where cold water makes risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required it is common in continental europe especially germany advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing however it is hard to reach valves so there may be some reliance on dive buddy to help close valve of free flowing regulator quickly main cylinder plus a small independent cylinder this configuration uses a larger back mounted main cylinder along with an independent smaller cylinder often called a pony or bailout cylinder diver has two independent systems but total breathing system is now heavier and more expensive to buy and maintain pony is typically a 2 to 5 litre cylinder its capacity determines depth of dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection ponies may be fixed to diver s buoyancy compensator bc or main cylinder behind diver s back or can be clipped to harness at diver s side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that diver is trained to use them another type of small independent air source is a hand held cylinder filled with about of free air with a diving regulator directly attached such as spare air this source provides only a few breaths of gas at depth and is most suitable as a shallow water bailout thumb 7 litre 232 bar din pillar valve independent twin set left cylinder shows manufacturer markings right cylinder shows test stamps alt rear view of a set of twin independent cylinders strapped to a jacket harness each with a scuba regulator fitted independent twin sets or independent doubles consists of two independent cylinders and two regulators each with a submersible pressure gauge this system is heavier more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set diver must swap demand valves during dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder if this is not done then if a cylinder should fail diver may end up having an inadequate reserve independent twin sets do not work well with air integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on diver s back or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it and where cylinder valves are in easy reach plain manifolded twin sets or manifolded doubles with a single regulator consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold but only one regulator is attached to manifold this makes it relatively simple and cheap but means there is no redundant functionality to breathing system only a double gas supply this arrangement was fairly common in early days of scuba when low pressure cylinders were manifolded to provide a larger air supply than was possible from available single cylinders it is still in use for large capacity bailout sets for deep commercial diving thumb left isolation manifolded twin 12 litre 232 bar scuba set with two a clamp pillar valves and two regulators alt top of a manifolded twin is shown over diver s right shoulder isolation manifolded twin sets or manifolded doubles with two regulators consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold with a valve in manifold that can be closed to isolate two pillar valves in event of a problem with one cylinder diver may close isolator valve to preserve gas in cylinder which has not failed advantages of this configuration include a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder automatic balancing of gas supply between two cylinders thus no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during dive and in most failure situations diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all remaining gas in both tanks disadvantages are that manifold is another potential point of failure and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs this configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving thumb upright 0 7 long 9 2 litre aluminium cylinder rigged for sling mounting alt sling harness is shown on a standing cylinder with bolt snaps for chest and hip connection and connecting webbing and a securing lower end of webbing strap to body of cylinder sling cylinders are a configuration of independent cylinders used for technical diving they are independent cylinders with their own regulators and are carried clipped to harness at side of diver their purpose may be to carry either stage travel decompression or bailout gas while back mounted cylinder s carry bottom gas stage cylinders carry gas to extend bottom time travel gas is used to reach a depth where bottom gas may be safely used if it is hypoxic at surface and decompression gas is gas intended to be used during decompression to accelerate elimination of inert gases bailout gas is an emergency supply intended to be used to surface if main gas supply is lost thumb left sidemount cylinder set with regulators fitted alt a pair of cylinders showing regulators set up for sidemount diving each regulator has a short low pressure inflator hose projecting towards where diver s body would be and dv hoses are stowed under submersible pressure gauges are on short hoses aligned with cylinder axes side mount cylinders are cylinders clipped to harness at diver s sides which carry bottom gas when diver does not carry back mount cylinders they may be used in conjunction with other side mounted stage travel and or decompression cylinders where necessary skilled side mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side this configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves side mounting is primarily used for technical diving but is also sometimes used for recreational diving when a single cylinder may be carried complete with secondary second stage octopus regulator in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving rebreathers thumb two 3 litre 232 bar din valved cylinders inside an inspiration electronically controlled closed circuit diving rebreather alt back view of an inspiration rebreather with cover removed showing scrubber unit in middle with a small cylinder on each side cylinder valves are at bottom end of unit for easier access while in use valve knobs protrude through sides of cover when closed at level of diver s waist oxygen cylinder is on right and has a green knob diluent cylinder has a black knob diving cylinders are used in rebreather diving in two roles as part of rebreather itself rebreather must have at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder many have two and some have more cylinders due to lower gas consumption of rebreathers these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open circuit dives rebreathers may use internal cylinders or may also be supplied from off board cylinders which are not directly plumbed into rebreather but connected to it by a flexible hose and coupling and usually carried side slung oxygen rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder semi closed circuit rebreathers have a cylinder which usually contains nitrox or a helium based gas closed circuit rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder and a diluent cylinder which contains air nitrox or a helium based gas rebreather divers also often carry an external bailout system if internal diluent cylinder is too small for safe use for bailout for planned dive bailout system is one or more independent breathing gas sources for use if rebreather should fail open circuit one or more open circuit scuba sets number of open circuit bailout sets their capacity and breathing gases they contain depend on depth and decompression needs of dive so on a deep technical rebreather dive diver will need a bail out bottom gas and a bailout decompression gas es on such a dive it is usually capacity and duration of bailout sets that limits depth and duration of dive not capacity of rebreather closed circuit a second rebreather containing one or more independent diving cylinders for its gas supply using another rebreather as a bail out is possible but uncommon although long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail out rebreathers are relatively bulky complex vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from than easy to use instantly available robust and reliable open circuit equipment surface supplied diver emergency gas supply thumb left commercial surface supplied diver wearing a single bailout cylinder plumbed into helmet bailout block alt a diver wearing a lightweight helmet with surface supply umbilical and a single back mounted bailout cylinder is shown from above partly in water climbing a boarding ladder on side of a boat surface supplied divers are usually required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient to allow them to return to a place of safety if main gas supply fails usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by diver s safety harness with first stage regulator connected by a low pressure hose to a bailout block which may be mounted on side of helmet or band mask or on harness to supply a lightweight full face mask where capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used for closed bell bounce and saturation dives bailout set must be compact enough to allow diver to pass through bottom hatch of bell this sets a limit on size of cylinders that can be used emergency gas supply on diving bells thumb a closed bell used for saturation diving showing emergency gas supply cylinders alt exterior view of a closed bell showing side door to left with a 50 litre oxygen cylinder and two 50 litre heliox cylinders mounted to frame to side of door diving bells are required to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside they are fully immersed in water during bell operations and may be considered diving cylinders suit inflation cylinders thumb left submersible argon cylinder for dry suit inflation blue colour is a legal requirement in south africa alt a small aluminium cylinder painted blue with a label identifying contents as argon suit inflation gas may be carried in a small independent cylinder sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties this must be clearly labelled and may also need to be colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant other uses of compressed gas cylinders in diving operations divers also use gas cylinders above water for storage of oxygen for first aid treatment of diving disorders and as part of storage banks for diving air compressor stations gas blending surface supplied breathing gas and gas supplies for decompression chambers and saturation systems similar cylinders are also used for many purposes not connected to diving for these applications they are not diving cylinders and may not be subject to same regulatory requirements as cylinders used underwater gas calculations it is necessary to know approximate length of time that a diver can breathe from a given cylinder so that a safe dive profile can be planned there are two parts to this problem capacity of cylinder and consumption by diver cylinder s capacity to store gas two features of cylinder determine its gas carrying capacity internal volume this normally ranges between 3 litres and 18 litres for single cylinders cylinder gas pressure when filled this normally ranges between but actual value should be measured for a real situation as cylinder may not be full at pressures which apply to most diving cylinders ideal gas equation is sufficiently accurate in almost all cases as variables that apply to gas consumption generally overwhelm error in ideal gas assumption to calculate quantity of gas volume of gas at atmospheric pressure cylinder volume x cylinder pressure atmospheric pressure in those parts of world using metric system calculation is relatively simple as atmospheric pressure may be approximated as 1 bar so a 12 litre cylinder at 232 bar would hold almost 12 x 232 1 of air at atmospheric pressure also known as free air in us capacity of a diving cylinder is specified directly in cubic feet of free air at nominal working pressure as calculation from internal volume and working pressure is relatively tedious in imperial units for example in us and in many diving resorts in other countries one might find aluminum cylinders of us manufacture with an internal capacity of filled to a working pressure of taking atmospheric pressure as 14 7 psi this gives 0 39 x 3000 14 7 80 ft3 these cylinders are described as 80 cubic foot cylinders common aluminum 80 up to about 200 bar ideal gas law remains useful and relationship between pressure size of cylinder and gas contained in cylinder is approximately linear at higher pressures this linearity no longer applies and there is proportionally less gas in cylinder a 3 litre cylinder filled to 300 bar will only carry contain of atmospheric pressure air and not expected from ideal gas law equations have been proposed which give more accurate solutions at high pressure including van der waals equation compressibility at higher pressures also varies between gases and mixtures of gases diver gas consumption there are three main factors to consider rate at which diver consumes gas specified as surface air consumption sac or respiratory minute volume rmv of diver in normal conditions this will be between 10 and 25 litres per minute l min for divers who are not working hard at times of extreme high work rate breathing rates can rise to 95 litres per minute for international marine contractors association imca commercial diving gas planning purposes a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies rmv is controlled by blood co2 levels and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures so does not change with depth very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long supply will last and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible scuba divers are expected to monitor remaining gas pressure sufficiently often that they are aware of how much is still available at all times during a dive ambient pressure depth of dive determines this ambient pressure at surface is at sea level for every in seawater diver descends pressure increases by as a diver goes deeper breathing gas is delivered at a pressure equal to ambient water pressure and amount of gas used is proportional to pressure thus it requires twice as much mass of gas to fill diver s lungs at as it does at surface and three times as much at mass consumption of breathing gas by diver is similarly affected time at each depth usually approximated as time at each depth range to calculate quantity of gas consumed gas consumed surface air consumption x time x ambient pressure metric examples a diver with a rmv of 20 l min at 30 msw 4 bar will consume 20 x 4 x 1 80 l min surface equivalent a diver with a rmv of 40 l min at 50 msw 6 bar for 10 minutes will consume 40 x 6 x 10 2400 litres of free air full capacity of a 12 litre 200 bar cylinder imperial examples a diver with a sac of 0 5 cfm cubic feet per minute at 100 fsw 4 ata will consume 0 5 x 4 x 1 2 cfm surface equivalent a diver with a sac of 1 cfm at 231 fsw 8 ata for 10 minutes will consume 1 x 8 x 10 80 ft3 of free air full capacity of an 80 ft3 cylinder keeping this in mind it is not hard to see why technical divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers and commercial divers normally use surface supplied diving equipment and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply breathing gas endurance amount of time that a diver can breathe from a cylinder is also known as air or gas endurance maximum breathing duration t for a given depth can be calculated as t available air rate of consumption which using ideal gas law is t available cylinder pressure x cylinder volume rate of air consumption at surface x ambient pressure this may be written as 1 t pc pa xvc sacxpa with t time pc cylinder pressure vc cylinder internal volume pa ambient pressure sac surface air consumption in any consistent system of units ambient pressure pa is surrounding water pressure at a given depth and is made up of sum of hydrostatic pressure and air pressure at surface it is calculated as 2 pa atmospheric pressure with d depth g standard gravity r water density in a consistent system of units for metric units this formula can be approximated by 3 pa d 10 1 with depth in m and pressure in bar ambient pressure is deducted from cylinder pressure as quantity of air represented by pa can in practice not be used for breathing by diver as it required to balance ambient pressure of water this formula neglects cracking pressure required to open both first and second stages of regulator and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in regulator both of which are variable depending on design and adjustment of regulator and flow rate which depends on breathing pattern of diver and gas in use these factors are not easily estimated so calculated value for breathing duration will be more than real value however in normal diving usage a reserve is always factored in reserve is a proportion of cylinder pressure which a diver will not plan to use other than in case of emergency reserve may be a quarter or a third of cylinder pressure or it may be a fixed pressure common examples are 50 bar and 500 psi formula above is then modified to give usable breathing duration as 4 bt pc pr xvc sacxpa where pr is reserve pressure for example using first formula 1 for absolute maximum breathing time a diver at a depth of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020 kg m3 typical seawater who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation in some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly from a normal breath to next abnormal breath a breath which may not be fully drawn there is never any difficulty exhaling suddenness of this effect depends on design of regulator and internal volume of cylinder in such circumstances there remains air under pressure in cylinder but diver is unable to breathe it some of it can be breathed if diver ascends as ambient pressure is reduced and even without ascent in some systems a bit of air from cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices even after it no longer has pressure enough to open demand valve using same conditions and a reserve of 50 bar formula 4 for usable breathing time is as follows ambient pressure water pressure atmospheric pressure 15 msw 10 bar per msw 1 2 5 bar usable pressure fill pressure reserve pressure 200 bar 50 bar 150 bar usable air usable pressure x cylinder capacity 150 bar x 18 litres per bar 2700 litres rate of consumption surface air consumption x ambient pressure 20 litres per minute per bar x 2 5 bar 50 litres min usable breathing time 2700 litres 50 litres per min 54 minutes this would give a dive time of 54 min at 15 m before reaching reserve of 50 bar reserves it is strongly recommended by diver training organisations and codes of practice that a portion of usable gas of cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies size of reserve depends upon risks involved during dive a deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive in recreational diving for example it is recommended that diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in cylinder of 500 psi 50 bar or 25 of initial capacity depending of teaching of diver training organisation this is because recreational divers practicing within no decompression limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency on technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible due to overhead obstructions or dangerous due to requirement to make decompression stops divers plan larger margins of safety simplest method uses rule of thirds one third of gas supply is planned for outward journey one third is for return journey and one third is a safety reserve some training agencies teach concept of minimum gas rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows a diver to calculate an acceptable reserve to get two divers to surface in an emergency from any point in planned dive profile professional divers may be required by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas to enable them to reach a place of safety such as surface or a diving bell based on planned dive profile this reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply egs also known as a bailout cylinder set or bottle this usually also applies to professional divers using surface supplied diving equipment weight of gas consumed density of air at sea level and 15 degc is approximately 1 225 kg m3 most full sized diving cylinders used for open circuit scuba hold more than of air when full and as air is used buoyancy of cylinder increases by weight removed decrease in external volume of cylinder due to reduction of internal pressure is relatively small and can be ignored for practical purposes as an example a 12 litre cylinder may be filled to 230 bar before a dive and be breathed down to 30 bar before surfacing using 2 400 litres or 2 4 m3 of free air mass of gas used during dive will depend on mixture if air is assumed it will be approximately loss of weight of gas taken from cylinder makes cylinder and diver more buoyant this can be a problem if diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant towards end of dive because most of gas has been breathed from cylinder buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at end of a dive and using buoyancy compensator to neutralise excess weight until gas has been used change in buoyancy of a diving cylinder during dive can be more problematic with side mounted cylinders and actual buoyancy at any point during dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may be separated from diver for any reason cylinders which will be stage dropped or handed off to another diver should not change diver s buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require least compensation when detached table

shop scuba filling station alt interior of a dive shop filling station is shown with a large number of cylinders standing on floor or on wall racks filling panel is to right and cylinders being filled are resting on an angled rack below panel thumb small stationary hp compressor installation alt a small high pressure compressor mounted on a steel frame with a three phase electric motor for power a flexible plastic air intake hose provides fresh air from outside of building diving cylinders are filled by attaching a high pressure gas supply to cylinder valve opening valve and allowing gas to flow into cylinder until desired pressure is reached then closing valves venting connection and disconnecting it this process involves a risk of cylinder or filling equipment failing under pressure both of which are hazardous to operator so procedures to control these risks are generally followed filling from a compressor breathing air supply can come directly from a high pressure breathing air compressor from a high pressure storage system or from a combined storage system with compressor direct charging is energy intensive and charge rate will be limited by available power source and capacity of compressor a large volume bank of high pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders and allows for provision of more economical high pressure air by recharging storage banks from a low power compressor or using lower cost off peak electrical power quality of compressed breathing air for diving is usually specified by national or organisational standards and steps generally taken to assure air quality include use of a compressor rated for breathing air use of compressor lubricants rated for breathing air filtration of intake air to remove particulate contamination positioning of compressor air intake in clean air clear of known sources of contaminants such as internal combustion exhaust fumes sewer vents etc removal of condensate from compressed air by water separators this may be done between stages on compressor as well as after compression filtration after compression to remove remaining water oil and other contaminants using specialized filter media such as desiccants molecular sieve or activated carbon traces of carbon monoxide may be catalyzed to carbon dioxide by periodical air quality tests scheduled filter changes and maintenance of compressor filling from high pressure storage cylinders may also be filled directly from high pressure storage systems by decanting with or without pressure boosting to reach desired charging pressure cascade filling may be used for efficiency when multiple storage cylinders are available high pressure storage is commonly used when blending nitrox heliox and trimix diving gases and for oxygen for rebreathers and decompression gas nitrox and trimix blending may include decanting oxygen and or helium and topping up to working pressure using a compressor after which gas mixture must be analysed and cylinder labeled with gas composition temperature change during filling compression of ambient air causes a temperature rise of gas proportional to pressure increase ambient air is typically compressed in stages and gas temperature rises during each stage and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages charging an empty dive cylinder also causes a temperature rise as gas inside cylinder is compressed by inflow of higher pressure gas though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank at room temperature decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure so at first empty cylinder is charged with cold gas but temperature of gas in cylinder then increases to above ambient as cylinder fills to working pressure excess heat can be removed by immersion of cylinder in a cold water bath while filling however immersion for cooling can also increase risk of water contaminating valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into cylinder during filling cylinders may also be filled without water bath cooling and may be charged to above nominal working pressure to developed pressure appropriate to temperature when filled as gas cools to ambient temperature pressure decreases and will reach rated charging pressure at rated temperature safety and legal issues legal constraints to filling scuba cylinders will vary by jurisdiction in south africa cylinders may be filled for commercial purposes by a person who is competent in use of filling equipment to be used who knows relevant sections of applicable standards and regulations and has written permission from owner of cylinder to fill it cylinder must be in test and suitable for gas to be filled and cylinder may not be filled above developed pressure for temperature reached when it is filled an external inspection of cylinder must be made and specified details of cylinder and fill must be recorded if fill is of a gas other than air analysis of completed fill must be recorded by filler and signed by customer if residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from valve when opened filler may refuse to fill cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty as there is no way for filler to check if it has been contaminated gas purity and testing diving cylinders should only be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques in some jurisdictions suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display test results for public information standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal handling of specialty gases special precautions need to be taken with gases other than air oxygen in high concentrations is a major cause of fire and rust oxygen should be very carefully transferred from one cylinder to another and only ever stored in containers that are cleaned and labeled for oxygen use gas mixtures containing proportions of oxygen other than 21 could be extremely dangerous to divers who are unaware of proportion of oxygen in them all cylinders should be labeled with their composition cylinders containing a high oxygen content must be cleaned for use of oxygen and their valves lubricated only with oxygen service grease to reduce chance of combustion specialty mixed gas charging will almost always involve supply cylinders of high purity gas sourced from an industrial gas supplier gas contamination contaminated breathing gas at depth can be fatal concentrations which are acceptable at surface ambient pressure will be increased by pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits common contaminants are carbon monoxide a by product of combustion carbon dioxide a product of metabolism and oil and lubricants from compressor keeping cylinder slightly pressurized at all times during storage and transportation reduces possibility of inadvertently contaminating inside of cylinder with corrosive agents such as sea water or toxic material such as oils poisonous gases fungi or bacteria a normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in cylinder if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out of gas incident cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless cylinder had been submerged deeper than where last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during dive contamination by water during filling may be due to two causes inadequate filtration and drying of compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant and failing to clear cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater both cause corrosion but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly to extent that it may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period this problem is exacerbated in hot climates where chemical reactions are faster and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked catastrophic failures during filling blast caused by a sudden release of gas pressure inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged greatest risk of explosion exists while filling but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads or cracking due to fatigue sustained high stresses or overheating effects in aluminum tank bursting due to overpressure may be prevented by a pressure relief burst disc fitted to cylinder valve which bursts if cylinder is and vents air at a rapid controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure accidental rupture of burst disc can also occur during filling due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles but is remedied by replacement of disc bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions other failure modes that are a hazard while filling include valve thread failure which can cause valve to blow out of cylinder neck and filling whip failure periodic inspection and testing of diving cylinders thumb condemned diving cylinders set aside for metal recycling alt a pile of rejected and somewhat rusty scuba cylinders lying in a yard most countries require diving cylinders to be checked on a regular basis this usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may be very different from requirements for other compressed gas containers due to more corrosive environment thumb left water jacket hydrostatic test test diagram alt schematic cut away drawing of water jacket hydrostatic testing equipment a hydrostatic test involves cylinder to its test pressure usually 5 3 or 3 2 of working pressure and measuring its volume before and after test a permanent increase in volume above tolerated level means cylinder fails test and must be permanently removed from service an inspection includes external and internal inspection for damage corrosion

years after production date then every 2 years legislation in australia requires that cylinders are hydrostatically tested every twelve months in south africa a hydrostatic test is required every 4 years and visual inspection every year eddy current testing of neck threads must be done according to manufacturer s recommendations procedures for periodic inspections and tests thumb silencer for scuba cylinders if a cylinder passes listed procedures but condition remains doubtful further tests can be applied to ensure that cylinder is fit for use cylinders that fail tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying owner of reason for failure before starting work cylinder must be identified from labelling and permanent stamp markings and ownership and contents verified and valve must be removed after and verifying that valve is open cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of fire hazard before inspection cylinder must be clean and free of loose coatings corrosion products and other materials which may obscure surface cylinder is inspected externally for dents cracks gouges cuts bulges laminations and excessive wear heat damage torch or electric arc burns corrosion damage illegible incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings and unauthorised additions or modifications unless cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination to identify any damage and defects particularly corrosion if inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove a significant amount of wall material when there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets rejection criteria additional tests may be applied such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion while valve is off threads of cylinder and valve are checked to identify thread type and condition threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification clean and full form undamaged and free of cracks and other imperfections ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for pressure test which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test depending on cylinder design specification test pressure is specified in stamp markings of cylinder valves that are to be reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service before fitting valve thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted after tests have been satisfactorily completed a cylinder passing test will be marked accordingly stamp marking will include registered mark of inspection facility and date of testing month and year records of a periodic inspection and test are made by test station and kept available for inspection these include if a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered owner must be notified before making empty cylinder unserviceable cleaning internal cleaning of diving cylinders may be required to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal chemical cleaning using solvents detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on contaminant and cylinder material tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination particularly of heavy corrosion products external cleaning may also be required to remove contaminants corrosion products or old paint or other coatings methods which remove minimum amount of structural material are indicated solvents detergents and bead blasting are generally used removal of coatings by application of heat may render cylinder unserviceable by affecting crystalline microstructure structure of metal this is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders which may not be exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by manufacturer safety before any cylinder is filled verification of inspection and testing dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions and are prudent even if not legally required inspection dates can be checked by looking at visual inspection label and hydrostatic test date is stamped on shoulder of cylinder before use user should verify contents of cylinder and check function of cylinder valve this is usually done with a regulator connected to control flow pressure and gas mixture are critical information for diver and valve should open freely without sticking or leaking from spindle seals failure to recognize that cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre dive check breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell if gas does not smell right it should not be used breathing gas should be almost free of smell though a very slight aroma of compressor lubricant is fairly common no smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible a neatly assembled setup with regulators gauges and delicate computers stowed inside or clipped where they will not be walked on and stowed under boat bench or secured to a rack is practice of a competent diver as scuba set is a life support system no unauthorised person should touch a diver s assembled scuba gear even to move it without their knowledge and approval full cylinders should not be exposed to temperatures above 65 degc and cylinders should not be filled to pressures greater than developed pressure appropriate to certified working pressure of cylinder cylinders should be clearly labelled with their current contents a generic nitrox or trimix label will alert user that contents may not be air and must be analysed before use in some parts of world a label is required specifically indicating that contents are air and in other places a colour code without additional labels indicates by default that contents are air in a fire pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature if internal pressure exceeds mechanical limitations of cylinder and there are no means to safely vent pressurized gas to atmosphere vessel will fail mechanically if vessel contents are or a contaminant is present this event may result in an explosion accidents major diving accident and fatality research studies that have been conducted globally including work by divers alert network diving incident monitoring study and project have each identified cases where mortality was associated with diving cylinder some recorded accidents associated with diving cylinders valve ejected due to mix up with valve threads 3 4 npsm and 3 4 bsp f

retainers in cylinder valves had been replaced by solid screws filling hose failure severely injured operator when hose hit his face wound exposed jaw bone and 14 stitches were needed to close wound cases of lateral have been reported caused by handling of diving cylinders handling cylinders should not be left standing unattended unless secured so that they can not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage cylinder valve mechanism and conceivably fracture valve at neck threads this is more likely with taper thread valves and when it happens most of energy of compressed gas is released within a second and can accelerate cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to surroundings long term storage breathing quality gases do not normally deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within allowed working range for cylinder usually below 65 degc if there is any doubt a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether gas has changed other components are inert any unusual smells would be an indication that cylinder or gas was contaminated at time of filling however some authorities recommend releasing most of contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure aluminium cylinders have a low tolerance for heat and a cylinder containing less than may lose sufficient strength in a fire to explode before internal pressure rises enough to rupture bursting disc so storing aluminium cylinders with a bursting disc has a lower explosion risk in case of fire if stored either full or nearly empty transportation diving cylinders are classified by un

blasted matt finish brushed finish or mill finish no surface treatment material is inherently fairly corrosion resistant if kept clean and dry between uses coatings are generally for cosmetic purposes or for legal colour coding requirements steel cylinders are more sensitive to corrosion when wet and are usually coated to protect against corrosion usual finishes include hot dip zinc spray and heavy duty paint systems paint may be applied over zinc coatings for cosmetic purposes or color coding steel cylinders without anti corrosion coatings rely on paint to protect against rusting and when paint is damaged they will rust on exposed areas this can be prevented or delayed by repair of painted finish worldwide colours permitted for diving cylinders vary considerably by region and to some extent by gas mixture contained in some parts of world there is no legislation controlling colour of diving cylinders in other regions colour of cylinders used for commercial diving or for all underwater diving may be specified by national standards in many recreational diving settings where air and nitrox are widely used gases nitrox cylinders are identified with a green stripe on yellow background aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver steel diving cylinders are usually painted to reduce corrosion often yellow or white to increase visibility in some industrial cylinder identification colour tables yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and or corrosive contents but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible cylinders that are used for partial pressure gas blending with pure oxygen may also be required to
