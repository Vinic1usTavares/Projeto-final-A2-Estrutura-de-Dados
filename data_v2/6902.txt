of a new rule requiring players to give orchestra their exclusive services lso itself later introduced a similar rule for its members from outset lso was organised on co operative lines with all players sharing profits at end of each season this practice continued for orchestra s first four decades lso underwent periods of eclipse in 1930s and 1950s when it was regarded as inferior in quality

music director noseda gets new assignment washington post 24 february 2016 reputation in a 1988 gramophone article james jolly said of lso some would claim that it is most american of our orchestras thinking no doubt of previn legacy bernstein s presidency and tilson thomas s appointment others looking back further to pierre monteux s reign think it our most french orchestra a quality nurtured by previn and latterly claudio abbado but what of their of slavonic repertoire under istvan kertesz or of mahler whose idiom has been finely honed by abbado no lso remains enigmatic unpredictable and supremely individual of all london orchestras lso seems to have more personalities more individuals and has given solo world more than its fair share of star performers as an orchestra lso has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long one thinks of karajan in berlin haitink in amsterdam or mravinsky in leningrad but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance for many years lso had a reputation as an almost exclusively male ensemble women harpists excepted morrison describes lso of 1960s and 1970s as a rambunctious boys club that swaggered round globe morrison p 251 before 1970s one of few women to play in orchestra was oboist evelyn rothwell who joined in 1930s and found herself regarded as an outsider by her male colleagues morrison pp 186 187 she was not admitted to full membership of orchestra first woman to be elected as a member of lso was renata

cent of lso s members were women some musicians including davis judged that this improved orchestra s playing as well as its behaviour morrison p 187 others including previn and veteran principal trumpet maurice murphy felt that although technical standard of playing had improved diminution of orchestra s machismo was a matter for regret comparing lso of 2004 with orchestra of 1960s and 1970s murphy said now strings have improved so much playing is fantastic but it has lost something of its gung ho quality quoted in morrison p 187 orchestra of 1960s had a reputation for tormenting conductors it disliked even such notorious martinets as george szell were given a hard time morrison p 123 by 21st century orchestra had long abandoned such aggression civilities were maintained even with conductors whom orchestra took against they were simply never re engaged morrison p 124 recordings audio thumb right lso at barbican 2011 front left to right roman simovic carmine lauri violins
