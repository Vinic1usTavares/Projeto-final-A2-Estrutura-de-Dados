first fatimid invasion of egypt occurred in 914 915 soon after establishment of fatimid caliphate in ifriqiya in 909 fatimids launched an expedition east against abbasid caliphate under berber general habasa ibn yusuf habasa succeeded in subduing cities on libyan coast between ifriqiya and egypt and captured alexandria fatimid heir apparent al qa im bi amr allah then arrived to take over campaign attempts to conquer egyptian capital fustat were beaten back by abbasid troops in province a risky affair even at outset arrival of abbasid reinforcements from syria and iraq under mu nis al muzaffar doomed invasion to failure and al qa im and remnants of his army abandoned alexandria and returned to ifriqiya in may 915 failure did not prevent fatimids from launching another unsuccessful attempt to capture egypt four years later it was not until 969 that fatimids conquered egypt and made it centre of their empire background fatimids came to power in ifriqiya in 909 when they overthrew reigning aghlabid dynasty with support of kutama berbers in contrast to their predecessors who were content to remain a regional dynasty on western fringes of abbasid caliphate fatimids held ecumenical pretensions as leaders of an isma ili shi a sect and claiming descent from fatima daughter of muhammad and wife of ali they regarded sunni abbasids as usurpers and were determined to overthrow them and take their place thus in early 910 fatimid ruler ubayd allah declared himself imam and caliph as al mahdi billah in line with this imperial vision following establishment of their rule in ifriqiya fatimids next objective was egypt gateway to levant and iraq seat of their abbasid rivals direct route from ifriqiya to egypt led through modern libya apart from few cities on coast tripoli in west and cities of cyrenaica in east this was a country dominated by berber tribes from west to east nafusa hawwara mazata and luwata which during previous centuries had been although incompletely thus nafusa were still kharijites while mazata were muslim in name only only in cyrenaica and to east did there exist true arab bedouin who had migrated there in 9th century fatimids entered area in 911 when kutama chieftains raided up to territories of luwata around tripoli which had submitted after fall of aghlabids hawwara tribesmen quickly came to resent overbearing behaviour of fatimids kutama soldiery as well as their heavy tax demands a first uprising and siege of city in 910 911 was followed by a general revolt in summer 912 which also engulfed city fatimid governor fled and all kutama were slaughtered fatimid heir apparent al qa im bi amr allah led a combined land and naval expedition against hawwara after tripoli capitulated in june 913 al qa im left one of principal kutama generals habasa ibn yusuf there to prepare further eastward expansion of fatimid empire invasion of egypt 15th century isma ili and thus pro fatimid historian idris imad al din provides most detail about expedition against egypt and is complemented by sunni sources such as al tabari and al kindi who write from opposite side conquest of cyrenaica expedition against egypt was launched on 24 january 914 when army under habasa ibn yusuf departed tripoli fatimid army took coastal route abbasid garrisons of sirte and ajdabiya abandoned these towns without battle and on 6 february habasa entered barqa capital of cyrenaica and gateway of egypt conquest of cyrenaica promised to be beneficial to fatimid treasury land tax kharaj brought in 24 000 gold dinars to abbasids annually with another 15 000 dinars provided by jizya paid by christian dhimmi and according to imad al din barqa was evacuated without battle sunni sources claim that fatimid troops committed atrocities against inhabitants and extorted funds from local merchants thus he forced local pigeon merchants to roast and eat their ware suspecting them of using their birds to spy for abbasids he urged members of local arab militia jund to enrol in fatimid army while imposing considerable financial levies on town s population he furthermore executed two chieftains of mazata who nine years before had waylaid and robbed al mahdi during his journey to ifriqiya their sons were also killed while their womenfolk were sold into slavery and their possessions confiscated news of fatimids arrival in barqa provoked abbasid authorities in egypt to send an army against them habasa s men reinforced by fresh troops from ifriqiya won ensuing battle outside city on 14 march capture of alexandria thumb right 300px alt photo of reverse and obverse sides of a gold coin with arabic writing gold dinar of al qa im bi amr allah fatimid caliph in 934 946 as heir apparent to his father he led two early fatimid invasions of egypt encouraged by this success al mahdi sent his son and heir al qa im with another army east to assume command of expedition at head of a force comprising numerous kutama as well as members of arab jund of ifriqiya al qa im set out from al mahdi s residence at raqqada on 11 july he arrived at tripoli on 1 august writing to habasa to await his coming before invading egypt proper disregarding these orders however ambitious habasa led his forces into egypt after defeating an abbasid force at al near modern el alamein on 27 august 914 he entered alexandria kutama raided south along river nile and devastated country reaching as far as giza across river from capital of egypt fustat habasa wrote to local governor takin al khazari offering safe conduct aman in exchange for his surrender but takin refused al qa im arrived in alexandria on 6 november 914 where he imposed fatimid call to prayer a kutama governor and an isma ili qadi judge in meantime arrival of fatimid army in alexandria provoked panic in baghdad abbasid government had paid little attention to affairs of ifriqiya and claims of al mahdi but now urgent enquiries were made as to his origin and intentions takin urgently requested reinforcements and syrian provinces were mobilized in september 914 first syrian troops began arriving in fustat in october abbasid caliph al muqtadir appointed his chamberlain mu nis as commander in chief and ordered him to egypt to support expedition and alleviate financial burden on egyptian populace of expeditionary force two million silver dirham were allocated by treasury march on fustat and first battle at giza in early december as nile floods withdrew and allowed passage of armies along river fatimid army set out for fustat in two columns habasa ahead with al qa im following behind as fustat lay on eastern bank of nile and only way to cross to it was by pontoon bridge to rawda island and giza takin al khazari mobilized garrison and inhabitants of city and set up a fortified camp at giza on 13 december first alarm was raised in fustat with anyone able to bear arms rushing over bridge but no attack ensued this was repeated next day and only on day after did fatimids attack in ensuing battle abbasid forces prevailed as takin s turkish horse archers inflicted heavy casualties on kutama lancers egyptian forces pursued kutama into night but during pursuit inexperienced levies fell into an ambush saving fatimid army from a complete rout egyptians remained tense with another false alarm next day but only minor skirmishes occurred during next few days despite this setback some of egyptians christian copts and muslims alike corresponded with al qa im revealing continued presence of an element of possible sympathizers and according to heinz possibly presence of a fatimid missionary da i in fustat fatimid occupation of fayyum and defeat at giza unable to cross river to fustat al qa im moved with a large part of his army around takin s defences and into fertile fayyum oasis where they could find provisions kutama initially plundered area but al qa im restored order and imposed a regular tax regime on inhabitants at this point al qa im and habasa who had remained behind in command of bulk of fatimid army at giza fell out when al qa im ordered habasa replaced on 8 january 915 in a large scale battle at giza fatimids were decisively defeated fatimid sources unanimously attribute this defeat to habasa who fled battlefield despite al qa im s exhortations to stand firm pro fatimid accounts maintain that al qa im launched three attacks on enemy and caused many casualties but these embellishments cannot hide fact that battle was a disaster with his army collapsing al qa im retreated to alexandria which he entered on 23 january fatimid withdrawal from alexandria and revolt in cyrenaica despite setback in his letters to his father and surviving sermons that he delivered in alexandria al qa im appears not to have lost confidence in his ultimate success for a while he also engaged in negotiations with some egyptian defectors who asked for aman from al qa im and raised prospect of capitulation of fustat it appears that al qa im himself was not entirely convinced of sincerity of such proposals which became impossible when abbasid commander in chief mu nis arrived at fustat in april 915 mu nis dismissed takin and replaced him with dhuka al rumi soon after habasa with thirty of his closest followers deserted al qa im and made for ifriqiya alarmed by this al qa im evacuated alexandria hastily and without battle leaving much of his armament and equipment behind dhuka occupied city and installed a strong garrison under his son al before returning to fustat to mete out punishment to those elements suspected of corresponding with al qa im al qa im arrived at raqqada on 28 may 915 in his rear cyrenaica rose in revolt and overthrew fatimid control in barqa entire kutama garrison was killed rebellion was only suppressed in 917 after an 18 month siege of barqa analysis invasion was costly in blood on both sides 7 000 fatimid troops were killed and another 7 000 were taken prisoner in first round of fighting alone while in second round habasa s troops are said to have lost 10 000 men killed losses among conscripted egyptian population range from 10 000 to 20 000 dead while imad al din put total number of egyptians killed as high as 50 000 both sides suffered from indiscipline and lack of cohesion in their ranks habasa repeatedly acted without consulting al qa im and committed several atrocities against civilians his abandonment of battlefield doomed expedition and on his return to ifriqiya he was executed several fatimid troops defected while al qa im too had to struggle to impose discipline on his men who looted fayyum abbasid side also experienced defections quarrels among their commanders as well as willingness of many egyptians to come to terms with fatimid invader leading to brutal reprisals by abbasid authorities against those who corresponded with al qa im however in strategic terms it was failure of fatimids to capture fustat that determined their failure fustat was main administrative and urban centre of country and as historian lev points out key to conquest of egypt of several invasions of egypt in 10th century only these that captured capital were successful even if large parts of country itself were not yet subdued fatimid expedition was considered risky even at time fatimids rule in ifriqiya was still not secure and was plagued by constant rebellions fatimid navy had been destroyed in 913 during such a revolt by governor of sicily 10th century fatimid propagandist al qadi al nu man even reports that al qa im was reluctant to embark on expedition and argued with his father in favour of delaying it according to michael brett fatimid invasion failed chiefly because expedition found itself deep in interior of country on desert bank of nile across river from egyptian capital confronted by a garrison which had been able to call upon forces of empire at its back precariousness of first fatimid invasion becomes even clearer when contrasted with elaborate military preparations and infiltration of country by fatimid agents undertaken for several years before its final conquest in 969 based on a passage in history of ibn khaldun dutch orientalist michael jan de who first studied qarmatians of bahrayn an offshoot branch of same movement that gave rise to fatimids suggested existence of a covert alliance between two and of a coordinated plan of attack against abbasids with qarmatians attacking from their bases close to abbasid metropolitan region of iraq and fatimids from west indeed qarmatians raided environs of basra in 913 but their forces were weak and any notion of a coordinated offensive is belied by fact that they remained inactive when actual fatimid invasion of egypt took place as they did during second fatimid invasion a few years later furthermore more recent analysis of origins of fatimid qarmatian schism has demonstrated deep seated doctrinal differences and hostility between two isma ili branches and fundamentally anti fatimid disposition of qarmatians aftermath expedition s failure rocked fundaments of fatimid regime belief in divine mission of imam caliph was shaken and discontent arose particularly among kutama sub tribe of from whom habasa now hounded as a criminal originated his eventual capture and imprisonment led to revolt of his brother ghazwiyya who had played a crucial role in securing al mahdi s regime up to that point and who had recently been given charge of entire kutama country to west of ifriqiya revolt was quickly crushed however and ghazwiyya and habasa were executed when their heads were brought before al mahdi he is said to have exclaimed once did these heads enclose east and west and now they are contained within this basket despite their failure fatimids launched a second invasion in 919 which was also defeated apart from a brief intervention in internal conflicts of military factions in egypt in 935 it was not until 969 that another serious invasion was undertaken by then abbasid caliphate weakened by constant power struggles between rival bureaucratic court and military factions and deprived of its outlying provinces to ambitious local dynasts had ceased to exist as a political entity with abbasid caliphs a powerless pawn of buyids while fatimid regime had grown stronger and far more wealthy and now disposed of a large and disciplined army this time fatimids met little resistance and egypt was conquered references sources category 910s conflicts category 914 category 915 category military
