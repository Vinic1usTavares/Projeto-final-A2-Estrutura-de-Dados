p 16 when match began on 14 august chapman won toss and decided that england should bat first when it was his turn to bat he was given a good reception by crowd lemmon pp 17 18 during his innings wisden noted chapman hit out in vigorous fashion but once he was dismissed for 49 remaining batsmen were out quickly leaving england with a disappointing total of 280 australia replied with 302 on a pitch affected by rain england then scored 436 mainly because of a large partnership between opening batsmen jack hobbs and herbert sutcliffe australia needed to score 415 to win which was unlikely given condition of pitch team were bowled out for 125 and at least one of chapman s tactical decisions resulted in australia losing a wicket wisden reported that not a catch was missed nor was a run given away whole england side rising gallantly to occasion naturally a scene of tremendous enthusiasm occurred at end crowd swarming in thousands in front of pavilion and loudly cheering players both english and australian correspondent also commented chapman despite lack of experience in leading a first class team in field turned out a very happy nomination for post of captain young amateur for most part managing his bowling with excellent judgement and in two or three things he did showing distinct imagination throughout match chapman chose to follow his own tactics rather than rely on veteran players in team for advice in series he scored 175 runs at 58 33 aftermath and success following match chapman was lauded as a cricketing hero lemmon p 20 and among those who sent

figures in a season in his history of england cricket captaincy alan gibson notes that controversy over chapman s appointment was soon forgotten following his success he writes english cricket had a new hero who looked part every selector was a champion in its summary of 1927 season wisden named him as kent s best batsman and noted an improvement in his defensive technique against lancashire who retained county championship he scored 260 in three hours batting highest score of his career lemmon pp 65 66 lancashire bowling attack included former australian test bowler ted mcdonald regarded as fastest bowler in world at time and feared by most county batsmen gibson p 147 many critics praised chapman s innings as one of best ever played he was selected to lead gentlemen against players at

games at an average of 66 04 highest aggregate and average of his career kent captaincy became available at end of season but chapman was not appointed according to chapman s biographer david lemmon he was probably approached but was unable to dedicate necessary time to position lemmon p 69 chapman was unavailable for test series in south africa in winter of 1927 28 but was a certainty to lead mcc team to australia in 1928 29 selectors wished him to play more regularly so he played more often in 1928 than any other season he began in good form but was never as effective as in 1927 although his captaincy continued to be highly regarded there were concerns in press over his increasing weight although these were offset by his impressive fielding in that season s tests he captained england to a 3 0 series win over west indies who were playing their first test matches lemmon pp 70 72 and scored one fifty in total he scored 967 first class runs at 37 19 as expected chapman was named as captain for australian tour mcc touring team was regarded as a strong one by commentators only controversy was omission of frank woolley which was not fully explained rumours in later years said that chapman was responsible for leaving woolley out as he was jealous of his county teammate but lemmon regards this as unlikely lemmon p 75 tour of australia 1928 29 thumb upright 1 3 chapman centre

accumulating large totals lemmon pp 77 78 for first test to strengthen team s batting chapman and tour selection committee chose only three specialist bowlers as tests were timeless played to a finish with no time limit he believed batting to be key to victory lemmon p 79 england batted first and scored 521 chapman scored 50 but critics believed he should have batted more cautiously lemmon p 80 when australia began their innings he held a catch from bill woodfull in gully which several observers rated as among best they had seen douglas p 72 lemmon p 81 sydney southerton writing of english fielding said high note was struck by chapman himself at brisbane when with a catch that will be historic he dismissed woodfull it is my opinion that catch had a pronounced effect on course of events in three subsequent tests chapman s fielding exercised a most restraining influence on australian batsmen australia were bowled out for 122 chapman did not ask australia to follow on but batted again to crowd s displeasure lemmon p 84 and his batsmen relentlessly built up england lead when chapman became first captain to declare an innings closed in a timeless test match australia needed 742 to win on a rain affected pitch australia were bowled out for 66 england s win by 675 runs remains in 2016 largest margin of victory by runs in tests lemmon p 82 chapman s team won second test comfortably after scoring 636 in their first innings highest team total in tests at that time lemmon p 85 in third test england began fourth innings requiring 332 to win on a rain damaged pitch a task critics believed impossible lemmon p 87 a large opening partnership from hobbs and sutcliffe gave england a chance and hobbs sent a message to england dressing room suggesting a tactical change in batting order but team could not find chapman who according to percy fender in attendance as a journalist spent most of his time socialising with guests in ladies stand consequently team followed hobbs plan without approval of captain douglas pp 74 75 england s batsmen took total to within 14 of victory when fourth wicket fell chapman came in and batted in an unusual way after attempting some big shots he played ultra defensively possibly in an attempt to allow patsy hendren to reach fifty runs before england won hendren was out soon after then chapman tried to hit a six and was caught batsmen continued to play recklessly and a further wicket fell to a run out douglas describes end of match meanwhile england batsman george geary was quite unruffled by sudden upsets he wound up for next delivery and thumped it through mid on for 4 bellowing dammit we ve done em it was an appropriate way for a side under chapman to win ashes douglas p 77 england s victory in third test ensured ashes were retained and team also won fourth test to take a 4 0 lead in series lemmon pp 90 91 up to this time chapman had enjoyed a harmonious relationship with australian crowds however in match against victoria which followed fourth test crowd barracked mcc team when chapman brought on harold larwood a fast bowler to bowl against bert ironmonger number eleven a tactic regarded as unsporting douglas p 83 as team returned to pavilion chapman was insulted by members of crowd in midst of a minor scuffle possibly influenced by these events he withdrew from final test illness and his poor form may also have been factors according to lemmon it was suggested in later years that chapman did not play owing to his heavy drinking lemmon p 135 in his absence australia won fifth test after fifth day of play and having played both his innings jardine left to catch a boat to india for reasons which are unclear and chapman acted as his substitute in field douglas notes that it looked like england were trying to pull a fast one by picking their strongest batting side which meant dropping chapman without weakening fielding since chapman was jardine s substitute douglas p 84 australians agreed to substitution on condition that chapman did not field near batsmen in tests chapman scored 165 runs at 23 57 and in all first class matches he reached 533 runs and averaged 33 31 southerton summarised his performance chapman himself began well in batting but in later matches was too prone to lash out at off ball and as tour progressed australian bowlers discovered his weakness on his captaincy southerton wrote chapman captained side uncommonly well improving out of all knowledge as tour progressed socially chapman enjoyed tour he attended many functions and events bill ferguson

score of 28 his season was curtailed when he fell awkwardly while fielding in a match against sussex at beginning of august lemmon pp 93 97 gibson p 132 he also missed two mcc tours that winter to new zealand and west indies neither of which involved a full strength team gibson pp 135 36 in 1930 australia toured england once more before test series chapman was not a unanimous choice among press correspondents several critics believed he should not be in team on account of his rapidly increasing weight former england captain pelham warner suggested he needed to lose at least two stone and concern over his poor batting form lemmon pp 99 100 however chapman began season well impressing commentators with his batting fielding and captaincy and was named as england captain for first test match lemmon pp 100 101 in first innings he scored 52 in 65 minutes and england won match by 93 runs on fourth day wisden correspondent wrote chapman with his resources limited managed his bowling well and himself fielded in dazzling fashion this was chapman s sixth successive victory over australia and he had won all nine of tests in which he was captain however it was to be his last test victory gibson p 143 england lost second test by seven wickets and gibson describes match as turning point in chapman s fortunes wisden observed briefly englishmen lost a match which with a little discretion on last day they could probably have saved england scored 425 in their first innings but donald bradman hit 254 runs and australia reached 729 for six declared when chapman came in to bat in second innings england still trailed by 163 runs and had lost four wickets a fifth fell soon after lemmon pp 103 07 he attacked bowling immediately and shared a large partnership with gubby allen when latter was out chapman began to score even faster he took england into lead hitting out at almost every delivery to reach his only test century after 140 minutes batting wisden commented it was about this time that with a little care and thoughtfulness england might have saved game so far from devoting their energies to defence they continued hitting away adding another 113 runs in an hour and a quarter afterwards but losing their last five wickets chapman was finally dismissed for 121 after batting for 155 minutes and striking 12 fours and 4 sixes england were all out for 375 leaving australia needing to score 72 runs to win although chapman held a difficult catch from bradman which was praised by commentators australia won comfortably chapman s century made him first batsman to score centuries at lord s in university match in gentlemen v players game and for england in a test match only martin donnelly later performed a similar feat though his test century was scored for new

headingley delayed match team captains chapman left and woodfull are inspecting field on 14 july 1930 in immediate aftermath of game chapman was praised for his batting team and selectors rather than chapman were blamed for defeat however his captaincy and tactics were later criticised by pelham warner among others in particular his placement of fielders and his refusal to play defensively were questioned gibson notes that historians regard this match as a turning point in test matches afterwards captains became more concerned to avoid defeat rather than follow chapman s policy of playing entertaining attacking cricket whatever result gibson p 144 chapman s unwillingness to play for a draw was in later years held up as last sporting gesture by an england captain marshall p 199 in third test bradman made highest individual score in a test match by scoring 334 out of australia s 566 assisted by rain that shortened available playing time england drew match lemmon pp 107 08 chapman scored 45 in his only innings fourth test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw chapman now faced further criticism of his captaincy his field placings were again queried warner noted that chapman s tactics were poor and that he was slow to react to opposition lemmon pp 108 09 according to cricket writer leo mckinstry selectors lost faith in chapman on account of his inconsistent risky batting and his increased tactical shortcomings however mckinstry also writes that selectors and other influential members of cricketing establishment were privately concerned by chapman s heavy drinking which they felt was affecting his leadership there were also rumours that he was drunk during some sessions of fourth test mckinstry p 333 following an extended meeting of selectors chapman was left out of side and replaced as captain by bob wyatt lemmon p 109 press were united in attacking decision praising chapman s batting and captaincy while denigrating wyatt s lack of experience lemmon pp 110 11 gibson observes in 1930 despite occasional criticisms chapman s position did not seem in any danger he was still popular boyish debonair hero he had been having his most successful series with bat and as a close fieldsman england still did not contain his equal he could not seriously be blamed because english bowlers could not get bradman out though this was perhaps more apparent in retrospect than at time wyatt though nothing was known against him was a figure markedly lacking in glamour in final test bradman scored another century and england lost match and series although wyatt played a substantial innings and wisden conceded chapman could have made little difference except as a fielder two men remained friends during and after controversy gibson p 146 in comparing circumstances of chapman s appointment with those of his replacement by wyatt gibson writes in 1926 england won in 1930 england lost that is why echoes took so long to die down and why selectors remained villains gibson p 145 he concludes that even though wyatt did relatively well it does seem after all these years an odd decision to have taken in series

and illness chapman was popular with crowds but made a poor start to tour with bat until he scored more substantially in lead up to test series lemmon p 117 england lost opening match of series by 28 runs and other four were drawn needing to win final match to level series england were frustrated when start of match was delayed chapman won toss and chose to bowl on a damp pitch which would have favoured his bowlers however umpires discovered bails were wrong size and would not start game until new ones could be made in 20 minutes which were lost pitch dried out and england lost much of advantage of bowling first lemmon p 118 chapman made an official protest before leading his team onto field lemmon p 119 in series he scored 75 runs at 10 71 and 471 runs at 27 70 in all first class games wisden observed that without finding his full powers as a punishing hitter chapman occasionally batted well socially tour was more successful chapman was accompanied by his wife and his parents joined tour for a time he took part in many social events and visited several whiskey firms which were associated with his employers in england chapman played no further test cricket in 26 tests he scored 925 runs at an average of 28 90 and held 32 catches he captained england in 17 matches winning nine and losing two with others drawn under him team achieved seven consecutive victories

along social lines and amateur leadership was aloof from and often dismissive of professional players marshall pp 78 79 members of team felt that he improved atmosphere within side and made game

in batting form would again be given charge of england team christopher douglas believes that difference between jardine and chapman in captaincy style made it harder for press to accept jardine he writes chapman s was just kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection and even though it was barely a year since he had lost leadership his reign was being regarded through rose coloured specs douglas p 105 however it is unlikely that selectors ever considered returning to him lemmon pp 122 23 during season chapman scored 951 runs averaged 29 71 and led kent to third place in county championship for second year in succession decline in 1933 he scored 834 runs but his average fell to 21 94 and he never again averaged over 23 in any season in which he played regularly owing to his increasing weight and lack of physical fitness he found batting much harder as his physique declined he was unable to produce same batting feats he had managed previously in field although

become an embarrassment to other cricketers subsequently chapman faded away without much comment lemmon p 133 technique and critical judgements thumb left chapman batting in australia in 1928 alt a cricketer batting writer neville cardus described chapman as schoolboy s dream of perfect captain of an england cricket eleven he was tall slim always youthful and pink and chubby of face his left handed batting mingled brilliance and grace his cricket was romantic in its vaunting energy but classic in shape while batting chapman always tried to attack bowling although this meant he made mistakes which resulted in his dismissal robertson glasgow p 36 it meant that he could change course of a game in a short time swanton p 138 cricket writer r c robertson glasgow described him as tall strong and lithe he was a left handed hitter with orthodox defence much of which was rendered unnecessary by a vast reach and an ability to drive good length balls over head of mid off bowler and mid on his cover driving too was immensely strong gibson notes that chapman s career batting figures were good but that critics believed that with his talent he should have scored more runs gibson pp 146 47 gibson writes when chapman was going well he looked quite as good as woolley his kent and england team mate at other end and in mid 1920s there was no other english left hander possibly no other england batsman at all except hobbs of whom that could be said his increased weight in 1930s robbed him of confidence and slowed him down to point where his batting declined when batting chapman usually wore cap commentators claimed that chapman was not a subtle captain and lacked tactical astuteness even so his record is better than most others who led england during chapman s career pelham warner believed that chapman started well but that in later stages of 1930 his tactical sense markedly deteriorated lemmon p 131 on other hand several of chapman s contemporaries believed him to be one of best captains arthur gilligan one of chapman s predecessors considered him to be a model for role lemmon p 129 and bert oldfield who played against chapman as australia s wicket keeper thought that chapman possessed an aptitude for leadership chapman s teams were usually harmonious and his sympathetic handling of his players often brought out best in them writing in 1943 robertson glasgow said he knew his men as perhaps no other captain of modern times has known them cricket writer e w swanton believes that chapman s cavalier reputation was misleading in assessing his effectiveness and that underlying boyish facade was both a shrewd cricket brain and good sense to ask advice from those of greater experience robertson glasgow described chapman as among greatest fielders of all time robertson glasgow p 37 and times observed that at his best he had been one of finest fielders ever to play for england in his earlier years he fielded in deep but when he played for kent and england he was positioned closer to batsmen usually at gully or silly point cricketer commented that his capacious hands made him a brilliant close to wicket fielder and some of his catches were miraculous in his youth chapman bowled quite regularly but his negative experience bowling for berkshire lessened his enthusiasm and he did not take it seriously lemmon p 50 personal life thumb upright 1 1 alt a

symonds his wife believed that his choice of a career working in alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in later part of his cricket career further problems arose through his fame as he wanted to keep people happy he drank frequently and attended many social functions lemmon pp 136 38 cricket writer ivo tennant believes that chapman s taste for conviviality was his undoing he always appeared happy but gibson observes that is way some men disguise their unhappiness and lemmon suggests that chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart according to lemmon by end of second world war chapman was largely living in past and that mentally he was still in happy days of university cricket lemmon p 139 later struggle e w swanton observes that from war onwards chapman s life went into a sad eclipse in 1942 chapman was divorced from his wife
