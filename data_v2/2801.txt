google earth is a computer program that renders a 3d representation of earth based primarily on satellite imagery program maps earth by superimposing satellite images aerial photography and gis data onto a 3d globe allowing users to see cities and landscapes from various angles users can explore globe by entering addresses and coordinates or by using a keyboard or mouse program can also be downloaded on a smartphone or tablet using a touch screen or stylus to navigate users may use program to add their own data using keyhole markup language and upload them through various sources such as forums or blogs google earth is able to show various kinds of images overlaid on surface of earth and is also a web map service client recently google has revealed that google earth now covers more than 98 percent of world and has captured 10 million miles of street view imagery a distance that could circle globe more than 400 times in addition to earth navigation google earth provides a series of other tools through desktop application additional globes for moon and mars are available as well as a tool for viewing night sky a flight simulator game is also included other features allow users to view photos from various places uploaded to panoramio information provided by wikipedia on some locations and street view imagery web based version of google earth also includes voyager a feature that periodically adds in program tours often presented by scientists and documentarians google earth has been viewed by some as a threat to privacy and national security leading to program being banned in multiple countries some countries have requested that certain areas be obscured in google s satellite images usually areas containing military facilities history core technology behind google earth was originally developed at intrinsic graphics in late 1990s at time company was developing 3d gaming software libraries as a demo of their 3d software they created a spinning globe that could be zoomed into similar to powers of ten film demo was popular but board of intrinsic wanted to remain focused on gaming so in 1999 they created keyhole inc headed by john hanke keyhole then developed a way to stream large databases of mapping data over internet to client software a key part of technology and acquired of mapping data from governments and other sources product called keyhole was sold on cds for use in fields such as real estate urban planning defense and intelligence users paid a yearly fee for service despite making a number of capital deals with nvidia and sony small company was struggling to make payroll and employees were leaving fortunes for company changed in early 2003 when cnn received a discount for software in exchange for placing keyhole logo on air whenever map was used keyhole did not expect it would amount to more than brief 5 or 10 second prerecorded animation clips but it was used extensively by miles o brien live during 2003 invasion of iraq allowing cnn and millions of viewers to follow progress of war in a way that had never been seen before public interest in software exploded and keyhole servers were not able to keep up with demand keyhole was soon contacted by central intelligence agency s venture capital firm in q tel and national geospatial intelligence agency for use with defense mapping databases which gave keyhole a much needed cash infusion intrinsic graphics was sold in 2003 to vicarious visions after its gaming libraries did not sell well and its core group of engineers and management transitioned to keyhole with hanke remaining at head at time google was finding that over 25 of its searches were of a geospatial character including searches for maps and directions in october 2004 google acquired keyhole as part of a strategy to better serve its users imagery google earth s imagery is displayed on a digital globe which displays planet s surface using a single composited image from a far distance after zooming in far enough imagery transitions into different imagery of same area with finer detail which varies in date and time from one area to next imagery is retrieved from satellites or aircraft before launch of nasa and usgs s landsat 8 satellite google relied partially on imagery from landsat 7 which suffered from a hardware malfunction that left diagonal gaps in images in 2013 google used to remedy issue providing what was described as a successor to blue marble image of earth with a single large image of entire planet this was achieved by combining multiple sets of imagery taken from landsat 7 to eliminate clouds and diagonal gaps creating a single mosaic image google now uses landsat 8 to provide imagery in a higher quality and with greater frequency imagery is hosted on google s servers which are contacted by application when opened requiring an internet connection imagery resolution ranges from 15 meters of resolution to 15 centimeters for much of earth google earth uses digital elevation model data collected by nasa s shuttle radar topography mission this creates impression of three dimensional terrain even where imagery is only two dimensional every image created from google earth using satellite data provided by google earth is a copyrighted map any derivative from google earth is made from copyrighted data which under united states copyright law may not be used except under licenses google provides google allows non commercial personal use of images e g on a personal website or blog as long as copyrights and attributions are preserved by contrast images created with nasa s globe software world wind use blue marble landsat or usgs imagery each of which is in public domain in version 5 0 google introduced historical imagery allowing users to view earlier imagery clicking clock icon in toolbar opens a time slider which marks time of available imagery from past this feature allows for observation of an area s changes over time utilizing timelapse feature allows for ability to view a zoomable video as far back as 32 years timelapse google earth engine google com timelapse 3d imagery thumb 350px countries with 3d coverage in google earth as of november 2019 countries with former 3d coverage thumb right 3d imagery in ios version of google earth seen here at wisconsin dells wisconsin google earth shows 3d building models in some cities including photorealistic 3d imagery first 3d buildings in google earth were created using 3d modeling applications such as sketchup and beginning in 2009 building maker and were uploaded to google earth via 3d warehouse in june 2012 google announced that it would be replacing user generated 3d buildings with an auto generated 3d mesh this would be phased in starting with select larger cities with notable exception of cities such as london and toronto which required more time to process detailed imagery of their vast number of buildings reason given is to have greater uniformity in 3d buildings and to compete with nokia here and apple maps which were already using this technology coverage began that year in 21 cities in four countries by early 2016 3d imagery had been expanded to hundreds of cities in over 40 countries including every u s state and encompassing every continent except antarctica in 2009 in a collaboration between google and museo del prado in madrid museum selected 14 of its paintings to be photographed and displayed at resolution of 14 000 megapixels inside 3d version of prado in google earth and google maps street view on april 15 2008 with version 4

automobiles can be viewed at different scales and from many angles and are navigable by arrow icons imposed on them water and ocean introduced in google earth 5 0 in 2009 google ocean feature allows users to zoom below surface of ocean and view 3d bathymetry supporting over 20 content layers it contains information from leading scientists and oceanographers on april 14 2009 google added bathymetric data for great lakes in june 2011 google increased resolution of some deep ocean floor areas from 1 kilometer grids to 100 meters high resolution features were developed by oceanographers at columbia university s lamont doherty earth observatory from scientific data collected on research cruises sharper focus is available for about 5 percent of oceans this can be seen in hudson off new

reality features google sky allows users to view stars and other celestial bodies it was produced by google through a partnership with space telescope science institute stsci in baltimore science operations center for hubble space telescope dr alberto conti and his co developer dr carol christian of stsci plan to add public images from 2007 as well as color images of all of archived data from hubble s advanced camera for surveys newly released hubble pictures will be added to google sky program as soon as they are issued new features such as multi wavelength data positions of major satellites and their orbits as well as educational resources will be provided to google earth community and also through christian and conti s website for sky also visible on sky mode are constellations stars galaxies and animations depicting planets in their orbits a real time google sky mashup of recent astronomical transients using protocol is being provided by collaboration other programs similar to google sky include microsoft worldwide telescope and google mars google mars is an application within google earth that is a version of program for imagery of planet mars google also operates a browser based version although maps are of a much higher resolution within google earth and include 3d terrain as well as infrared imagery and elevation data there are also some extremely high resolution images from mars reconnaissance orbiter s hirise camera that are of a similar resolution to those of cities on earth finally there are many high resolution panoramic images from various mars landers such as mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity that can be viewed in a similar way to google street view mars also has a small application found near face on mars it is called a robot character user can speak with google moon originally a browser application google moon is a feature that allows exploration of moon google brought feature to google earth for 40th anniversary of apollo 11 mission on july 20 2009 it was announced and demonstrated to a group of invited guests by google along with buzz aldrin at newseum in washington d c google moon includes several tours including one for apollo missions incorporating maps videos and street view style panoramas all provided by nasa other features google earth has numerous features which allow user to learn about specific places these are called layers and include different forms of media including photo and video some layers include tours which guide user between specific places in a set order layers are created using keyhole markup language or kml which users can also use to create customized layers locations can be marked with placemarks and organized in folders for example a user can use placemarks to list interesting landmarks around globe then provide a description with photos and videos which can be viewed by clicking on placemarks while viewing new layer in application in december 2006 google earth added a new integration with wikipedia and panoramio for wikipedia layer entries are scraped for coordinates via there is also a community layer from project wikipedia world more coordinates are used different types are in display and different languages are supported than built in wikipedia layer panoramio layer features pictures uploaded by panoramio users placed in google earth based on user provided location data in addition to flat images google earth also includes a layer for user submitted panoramic photos navigable in a similar way to street view google earth

google earth engine is a cloud computing platform for processing satellite imagery and other geospatial and observation data it provides access to a large database of satellite imagery and computational power needed to analyze those images google earth engine allows observation of dynamic changes in agriculture natural resources and climate using geospatial data from landsat satellite program which passes over same places on earth every sixteen days google earth engine has become a platform that makes landsat and sentinel 2 data easily accessible to researchers in collaboration with google cloud storage google earth engine provides a data catalog along with computers for analysis this allows scientists to collaborate using data algorithms and visualizations platform uses python and javascript application programming interfaces for making requests to servers google earth engine has been used multiple times as a tool for tracking deforestation initial applications of engine have included mapping forests of mexico identifying water in congo basin and detecting deforestation in amazon rainforest using google earth engine to track global forest loss or gain university of maryland reported an overall loss in global forest cover carnegie institute for science s system and s sisteme de alerta de sad are two institutions that partnered with google in development of google earth engine both organizations use program to build maps of forests that measure environmental disturbances additionally google earth engine has been expanded to further applications these range from tiger habitat monitoring malaria risk mapping and global surface water controversy and criticism software has been criticized by a number of special interest groups including national officials as being an invasion of privacy or posing a threat to national security typical argument is that software provides information about military or other critical installations that could be used by terrorists google earth has been blocked by google in iran why is google earth being blocked in iran google earth help forums june 17 2009 and sudan google earth
