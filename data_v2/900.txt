jr makes his first appearance on show in wichita linebacker episode was written by phil klemmer and john enbom and directed by harry winer marking both klemmer and enbom s eleventh writing credit and winer s third directing credit for series klemmer and enbom initially thought that they would be unable to write episode because they didn t know very much about american football so they tried to make episode less about football enbom stated rob just sort of handed episode down i think if you play strict attention you ll find it isn t as as an episode about a football player could possibly be and i think that s why episode did not have budget to hire a full football team so several scenes were devoid of extras including when veronica meets one of football players and when she breaks into locker room episode features first appearance of dean cyrus o dell ed begley jr a recurring character for third season initially michael mckean was slated to take role but within twelve hours of accepting part mckean decided to pass on veronica mars altogether thomas called this most depressing casting news in world one week later begley accepted role both actors had recently appeared in a

reviews eric goldman of ign gave episode a 7 0 out of 10 indicating that it was good despite this he wrote a mixed review opining that as far as mysteries go this was a so so one that hearst campus rapist story just doesn t seem to be getting proper weight it requires and that there s also some strange tonal issues currently however he praised return of weevil rowan kaiser writing for a v club was also relatively critical while focusing praise on weevil s storyline he referred to wichita linebacker as what i would expect were show not so ambitious here veronica isn t going to hearst college she s going to television college where things that are college y happen television without pity gave episode a c i don t think it s being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show s stronger or more exciting episodes writing was oddly flat in first place and attention to detail was subpar as well in addition reviewer criticized show s treatment of its relationships that s one of things that s made this show great in past layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship centered show i only hope they go somewhere with gambling thing because otherwise in my opinion this episode will have been a total waste of time price peterson of tv com wrote that while he liked it overall he disliked focus on logan and weevil writing that he was more than ready for weevil to be written off show and i m getting slightly tired of logan s storylines he seems to be alternating between woe is me hangdog and shifty bro liar logan is not my favorite on his blog what s alan watching alan sepinwall wrote that this was a fairly light hearted hour with two darkest events weevil beating up abusive boyfriend and blonde getting raped taking place off screen and if purpose of doing shorter arcs was to avoid loss of momentum that both bus crash and bridge stabbing suffered in middle of last year i m not sure if it s working yet buzzfeed
