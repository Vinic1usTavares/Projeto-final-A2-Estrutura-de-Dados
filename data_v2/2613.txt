howmet tx turbine experimental was an american sports prototype racing car designed in 1968 to test competitive use of a gas turbine engine in sports car racing planned by racing driver ray heppenstall tx combined a chassis built by mckee engineering turbine engines leased from continental aviation engineering and financial backing and materials from howmet corporation although not first attempt at using a turbine powerplant in auto racing howmet tx was first and is still only turbine to win a race earning two sports car club of america scca race victories and two qualifying sprint victories during its only year of competition tx later set six federation internationale de l automobile fia land speed records for turbines after being retired from racing development interest in use of gas turbines as an alternative to piston engine had been gaining support in automobile industry during 1960s chrysler had begun testing in 1950s and began leasing their turbine car to public in 1963 while british manufacturer rover and racing team brm combined to build a racing car for 24 hours of le mans in and both cars showed reliability but were unable to win over public or to win at le mans respectively by 1967 team owner and car developer andy granatelli had created stp paxton for indianapolis 500 car nearly won race driven by parnelli jones but suffered a mechanical failure after leading over two thirds of event a similar attempt with a lotus 56 in 1968 also led to retirement after showing winning potential thumb left howmet tx was built on mckee mk 9 chassis this is first example of two built in period at same time as granatelli s turbine debut at indy racer ray heppenstall began to conceive a design for his own sports car to make use of a gas turbine improving in some areas where rover brm had failed several years before heppenstall felt that a more simplified design for chassis could make a turbine powered car more competitive heppenstall originally proposed car to allison engine company and later to williams research he eventually turned to fellow racer tom fleming for aid fleming was at time vice president of howmet corporation which provided castings for turbines in aerospace industry heppenstall and fleming were able to convince howmet that their backing of a competitive and unique sports car could promote public awareness of company howmet agreed to fund project lending their name to car chassis heppenstall began project by purchasing a cooper monaco sports car but later decided it was not best choice for a turbine and car was sold off bob mckee owner of mckee engineering was then contracted by heppenstall to build two cars brand new first space frame chassis was actually built from an older mckee car initially built for can am series in 1966 but adapted to house turbine engine second car gtp2 was built from scratch allowing it to be purposely designed around use of a turbine engine including a chassis longer chassis were known as mk 9 to mckee but only ever raced as turbines under howmet tx guise mk 9 was designed around fia s group 6 regulations for sports prototypes allowing for a completely custom mid engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors closed cockpit bodywork with doors was designed by bob mckee to shroud mid engine layout standard double wishbone suspension with coil springs were used with disc brakes on each wheel a fuel tank was placed between cockpit and turbine housing jet a fuel turbine turbines to power two howmet txs were leased from continental aviation engineering ts325 1 gas turbines were prototypes from an aborted bid for a military helicopter contract which continental was not putting to use at time loaned turbines weighed and were able to provide and of torque a maximum of 57 000 rpm was able to be reached thumb right 200px exhaust pipes for original continental turbine smaller pipe at back is for turbine s wastegate a two stage setup used an internal power turbine to drive rear wheels through use of reduction gearing due to wide variable output of turbine and high level of torque a standard gearbox was not necessary leaving howmet tx with only a single gearing speed however gearing ratios were able to be quickly changed in differential allowing car to be adapted to various circuits due to use of a single speed transmission there was no gearing for reverse although heppenstall initially wished to do without reverse fia mandated its use and a small electric motor powered by turbine was installed allowing car to move in reverse turbine itself used two large exhaust pipes however a third pipe was situated off center for use with a wastegate wastegate was designed to eliminate lag between driver pressing accelerator and turbine increasing its revolutions once turbine was at its maximum revolutions wastegate helped regulate flow of hot gas from core to power turbine thus increasing or decreasing power output to gearbox far quicker than core could adjust mass flow by itself although turbines cannot have their displacement measured in same way as a piston engine fia used an equivalence formula to determine continental ts325 1 s displacement of although heppenstall has since admitted that engine was actually above three litre limit this allowed howmet to compete in prototype under 3000 cc category of group 6 formula racing history following completion of two howmet txs cars were brought to 24 hours of daytona opening round of 1968 international championship for makes before even entering competition tx earned attention and was featured prominently on cover of race program although both cars were in attendance only newer gtp2 of two was entered in race other car gtp1 was kept as a spare driving team of heppenstall dick thompson and ed lowther qualified with a lap time seventh fastest overall several competitors made early refueling stops allowing howmet to improve to third place but on lap 34 turbine wastegate failed to reopen giving driver too much power for corner he was in car spun and hit a barrier forcing team to retire by 12 hours of sebring a few months later tx was able to improve its pace this time qualifying third only a second behind a porsche 907 and a ford gt40 turbine ran reliably at first but as race continued debris damaged turbine and caused it to shake loose from its mounts tx was eventually retired after six hours following sebring international championship returned to europe and howmet team followed they entered boac 500 at brands hatch wastegate problems once again caused car to wreck this time after only seven laps staying in britain howmet team entered a national sprint race at oulton park for british driver hugh dibley failure of a starter motor during a pit stop however once again denied tx possibility of finishing hour long event thumb left 200px howmet tx chassis gtp2 running at goodwood festival of speed in 2009 tx returned to united states to contest scca national championship rather than stay in europe for remainder of international championship closer to home problems with experimental tx were able to be overcome as car finished its first race trophy in new cumberland west virginia heppenstall drove car to a second place finish setting a new lap record for circuit following a retirement in michigan tx next arrived at heart of dixie event in huntsville alabama a short sprint race was held on day prior to main race in order to determine starting order of field howmet tx was able to earn victory in sprint allowing it to start on pole position for main event from there tx dominated event and earned another win these two victories marked first ever wins by a turbine powered car in a racing event with first victory earned by howmet tx heppenstall was once again joined by dick thompson for marlboro 300 once again car won short qualifying race to earn pole position and went on to lead every lap of main event winning by an eleven lap margin feeling that tx was now capable of taking on european entries both txs were entered in 6 hours of watkins glen another round of international championship hugh dibley and newcomer bob tullius were entered in first car while heppenstall and thompson shared second cars qualified eighth and ninth fastest following early accidents by factory porsches tx cars were running third and fourth overall dibley and tullius car suffered a transmission problem in closing hour requiring car to crawl around circuit until end of race other entry remained on pace until end finishing on podium overall and was highest finisher in its class podium earned howmet four points towards international championship after watkins glen success two cars were prepared for an attempt at 24 hours of le mans which had been postponed until september french aluminium company sponsored team s bid at 24 hours same drivers were assigned to cars but their qualifying performance at circuit de la sarthe was hampered by long straights twentieth fastest was best performance from two cars for race itself mechanical problems appeared early as thompson s car suffered after only three laps fuel system was not providing enough jet a to turbine to allow it to produce its full power output meaning car had to limp down circuit s long straights while that car continued at a slowed pace other suffered a wheel bearing failure two hours later requiring a lengthy three hour repair by sixth hour of event car was disqualified by race officials having covered an insufficient distance of only 60 laps remaining fuel starved tx did not last much longer as thompson crashed in indianapolis corner with 1968 season over heppenstall planned for following year including development of a new multi gear transmission to replace single speed unit however howmet felt that program was not providing adequate promotion for company and decided to discontinue it land speed records howmet decided in 1969 that although racing program was too expensive to continue two cars it owned could still be put to promotional use heppenstall decided that he would attempt to repair second tx chassis gtp2 to adapt new open cockpit bodywork earning it name howmet tx mk ii new vehicle attempted to break world land speed records for turbine powered cars with tx mk ii weighing approximately car was able to make attempts at two classes of records thanks to addition or subtraction of ballast on a road next to talladega superspeedway in august 1970 heppenstall drove tx mk ii to six records recognized by fia with timing recorded by new international motor sports association imsa fia speed records class type class 2 over 500 kg under 1000 kg standing start 1 4 mi 11 83 standing start 1 2 km 13 48

chassis gtp3 in 1971 howmet ended their promotional use of two tx cars two chassis were sold to ray heppenstall for one dollar however because two continental turbines had been leased to howmet they had to be returned once cars were no longer under howmet s control heppenstall eventually sold two chassis chassis gtp1 was bought by jim brucker and stored in his personal collection in california on display it featured a mock up of continental turbine in engine bay car was bought in 2006 by bruce of avon aero and has been restored with an original continental turbine following restoration gtp1 won sebring trophy at 2007 amelia island d elegance second car chassis gtp2 was converted from its open cockpit bodywork back into its original closed cockpit design in a restoration carried out by mckee engineering at behest of new owner chuck haines restoration of chassis gtp2 was completed in july 1996 original continental turbines could not be obtained so an allison 250c18 turbine was installed chuck haines participated three times at goodwood festival of speed in 2006 it was later sold to xavier who adapted wastegate system to allison turbine gtp2 has since participated in le mans classic event in 2008 2010 and 2012 classic endurance racing series from 2009 to 2012 as well as goodwood festival of speed in 2009 it is now a part of collection during haines ownership of chassis gtp2 bob mckee completed a spare frame known as gtp3 to original specification for haines again due to lack of a continental turbine an allison unit was used instead different powerplant required some redesign as exhaust was now vented out of top of engine cover instead of out rear of car gtp3 does not have wastegate system haines has entered car in historic motorsport events including 2007
