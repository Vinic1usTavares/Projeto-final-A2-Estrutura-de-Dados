noted by roman historians in part for unusual mass reprieve granted by claudius to survivors historical source material source material comes from works of three roman historians who were all born after events of 52 ad suetonius c 69 75 to after 130 probably writing around ad 121 michael grant 1979 introduction to penguin classics edition of twelve caesars and cassius dio around 155 164 to after 229 probably writing 200 22 both wrote about event and quoted phrase tacitus c 56 117 writing from around 98 to 117 mentions event but does not quote phrase first known record of phrase is in writings of suetonius here with apices for legibility quin claudius et ante sed cum have imperator morituri te salutant aut non post quasi venia data vellet diu an omnes tandem e sede sua ac per lacus non sine partim partim ad hoc classis et same incident is described in writings of cassius dio a roman consul and historian who wrote in greek in book 60 of his roman history he states source variations and interpretation person of main verb differs in two sources suetonius quotes it with a third person plural verb salutant meaning they those salute greet and cassius quotes it with a first person plural verb meaning we salute greet apart from this latin and greek expressions have same meaning claudius response is stated in several sources as avete vos fare you well suggesting an act of favor earliest editions of de vita caesarum published in rome in 1470 and venice in 1471 used avete vos but this version was still accepted in nineteenth century as can be seen in baumgarten edition of 1816 karl ludwig roth returned to better quality manuscripts for his 1857 edition chiefly ninth century codex memmianus oldest known extant version of suetonius codex memmianus was first recorded in thirteenth century but disappeared until sixteenth century it received little attention until it was acquired by royal library of paris in 1706 second oldest manuscript 268 was unknown to roth and corrected claudius reported response to aut non john c rolfe notes both responses describing them as one of claudius feeble jokes which combatants pretended to understand as meaning that they need not risk their lives in battle donald kyle describes it as a possible attempt at a witticism joseph pike states in his notes on roth s text reading avete vos is from fifteenth century manuscripts and editions in this case emperor is simply returning salutation literal meaning is however be well be safe or be sound and gladiators understood it as dismissing them basil kennett writing in 1820 describes avete vos response as a cruel jest w hen they would gladly have interpreted it as an act of favour and a grant of their lives he soon gave them to understand that it proceeded from contrary

noted that such an amount of criminals 19 000 according to tacitus and other sources may probably represent sweepings of provinces as well as of rome and italy but even on this supposition number as friedlander remarks ii 324 is suggestive of iniquitous condemnations description of event by tacitus according to tacitus writing around 50 years after event claudius equipped triremes and nineteen thousand combatants lists he surrounded with rafts so as to leave no unauthorized points of escape but reserved space enough in centre to display vigour of rowing arts of impetus of galleys and usual incidents of an engagement on rafts were stationed companies and squadrons of praetorian cohorts covered by a breastwork from which to operate their catapults and ballistae rest of lake was occupied by marines with decked vessels shores hills mountain crests formed a kind of theatre soon filled by an untold multitude attracted from neighbouring towns and in part from capital itself by curiosity or by respect for sovereign he and agrippina presided one in a gorgeous military cloak other not far distant in a greek mantle of cloth of gold battle though one of criminals was contested with spirit and courage of freemen and after much blood had flowed combatants were exempted from destruction occidioni usage in roman times h j leon of university of texas considered this salutation in transactions of american philological association in 1939 he observed that salute had become widely represented and embellished in numerous works dealing with roman antiquities so that it has become one of best known and most often cited of roman customs it was recognized in lay and academic writings as a customary salute of gladiators to emperor and yet there is no other ancient reference to a salute of gladiators and in this case it was uttered not by gladiators at all but by naumachiarii a striking example of this pervasive belief even in academia can be found in historian jerome s 1940 book la vie a rome a l apogee de l empire daily life in ancient rome people and city at height of empire in this book author a member of academie francaise professor at le havre and sorbonne and director of french academy in rome cites phrase and writes in vivid and poetic detail of gladiators melancholy salutation as they parade past emperor prior to entering colosseum reprinted by read books 2008 following a review of source material related to ad 52 naumachia leon observes that fighters were not gladiators but were convicted criminals sentenced to death their intended fate was occidioni massacre or slaughter lake had been surrounded with rafts to prevent a mass breakout and was surrounded by crack soldiers of praetorian guard both infantry and cavalry who were protected by ramparts and equipped with catapults and ballistae and further reinforced by ships bearing marines ready for action he concludes that this was not a formal salute but in all likelihood an isolated incident of a mass plea for sympathy or mercy by desperate convicted men sentenced to death on a specific occasion and that blockquote c three accounts we can reasonably assume that condemned as they were to die these convicts invoked claudius with their morituri te salutant which was not a regular and formal salute but an appeal used only on that occasion in hope of winning emperor s sympathy when he replied aut non they took his words as meaning aut non morituri or not die and indicating pardon suetonius says quasi venia data and refused to fight but finally yielded either to entreaties of emperor or to force and fought bravely until survivors were excused from further slaughter p p my conclusion is accordingly that there is no evidence whatever for much quoted salute of gladiators only two ancient references those in suetonius and in dio refer not to gladiators but to naumachiarii men condemned to die and even these references are to one specific episode circumstances of which indicate that supposed salute was not even a regular salute of naumachiarii blockquote alan baker broadly agrees stating there is no evidence that this was common practice among gladiators as far as we know only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by claudius plass notes that it is hard to see why or how phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula on other hand if it was something that claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible he comments on distancing effect of latin source and first person of greek source and notes that interpretation and response by fighters seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in arena kyle concurs that no other sources record supposed gladiator salute in any other context and it did not come here from true gladiators treated as a commodity they were not elite gladiators but captives and criminals doomed to die who usually fought until all were killed when salute or appeal failed and they were forced to kill one another in earnest a with some initiative and inventing a pseudo gladiatorial salute and then fighting well these men despite their criminal and non professional status and their intended extermination atypically turned themselves into proper gladiators for a day hence some survived he concludes that t he sources remark on incident in part because it was an anomaly in arena practice a mass reprieve usage in modern times right thumb 2000 historical epic gladiator with dvd subtitles
