ellis beckingham named ellis of beckingham in some sources died 1307 was a parish priest for warmington northamptonshire raban s mortmain in medieval england past present 1974 p 11 which at time was under authority of peterborough abbey and with which beckingham had a close relationship throughout his life he both assisted abbey legally and increased his wealth through their grants he was also a royal judge and is possibly best known for being only english judge to keep his position when most of his colleagues were dismissed as a result he has been called with one exception only honest judge of time mee a cambridgeshire country of fens london 1939 23 dates of his birth and death are unknown but he is thought to have died in around 1307 early life elias beckingham came from beckingham in lincolnshire although his date of birth is unknown it is likely however that by time he was first mentioned in administrative documents in 1258 he was already holding a relatively senior position in judiciary elias had at least one sister isolde beckingham and through her a niece and a nephew judicial career beckingham at time he was mentioned in 1258 was working probably as chief clerk for gilbert of preston english crown s senior royal justice this was an itinerant position travelling in a circuit or eyre gilbert s last eyre and therefore also beckingham s as his chief clerk was that of 1268 72 in 1274 beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for middlesex although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by next year at this time he seems to have held rank of king s serjeant he received commission of justice of assize in 1276 from 1273 to 1278 he was a senior clerk to court of common pleas and was then made keeper of writs and rolls of court custos rotulorum et de banco until 1285 in that year beckingham was appointed a justice of common pleas in 1289 grave complaints arose of maladministration of entire justice system during king edward i s absence in gascony wide ranging royal enquiry that followed in 1290 found that thomas weyland chief justice of common pleas had among other offences erased an entry in plea rolls and substituted a false one evidently in collusion with a party to case weyland s offences were severe enough that he had his goods and chattels confiscated and he was exiled from realm weyland three of four other justices of common pleas who did not participate in fraud but were held responsible for not preventing it and master of rolls were heavily fined three judges of court of king s bench were also dismissed beckingham was only justice of common pleas acquitted of charges he thereby gained a historical record for probity more recently it has been suggested that his escape from censure may simply have been due to his absence from westminster hall previous year whilst on dorsetshire eyre where it is known that fines were levied before him and lyme regis burgess pleas to queen eleanor heard he appears to have continued in discharge of his duties until 1307 for he was regularly summoned to parliament as a justice between 1288 and 1305 from fact that he was no longer summoned to parliament after latter date it may be inferred that he died or retired before date when parliament next met his work within courts seems to have leaned towards more routine procedural aspects of court work estates left thumb holy trinity bottisham beckingham appears to have been one of if not richest man in parish although he was still only a free tenant of bottisham rather than a lord of manor in 1275 he bought a moiety of in bottisham cambridgeshire constituting a quarter of fee a half of a knight s fee held from lord of manor of bottisham then maud de lacy countess of hertford and gloucester these holdings were later recognized as manor of likewise purchases of manors such as those in nene valley and stoke by newark enabled him to invest his wealth in land his ecclesiastical status meant that he could also rely on a succession of livings not only those in cambridgeshire but as far afield as rutland devon and cornwall relations with peterborough abbey born in beckingham which itself had a satellite church of peterborough abbey his relations with abbey seem to have been close prior to their appointment of him as a parish priest at warmington in 1281 they had appointed him to northborough parish twelve years earlier but his second parish was by far most lucrative in him it has been said peterborough had found a royal justice bound in loyalty by grant for example in 1288 he granted abbey his manor of raban s mortmain in medieval england past present 1974 p 10 and when eventually abbey came to buy it beckingham lent them some of cash to do so raban s mortmain in medieval england past present 1974 p 24 in this way contemporaries noted beckingham enabled abbey to circumvent king s statute against land passing to church as some point he appears to have also acted as agent and money lender for abbey as well as hearing their cases that came before him personally in court for instance in abbey s purchase of manor and when abbey found itself in dispute with bishop of lincoln and other abbeys he also acted administratively such as witnessing oaths of homage to abbey bottisham and death it seems likely that beckingham was responsible for building nave of holy trinity church in bottisham cambridgeshire in what has been described as a fitting tribute to climax of his career his economic success and his bond with village he was later interred in same church where a monument in place of honour in centre of nave described as a raised purbeck altar tomb was dedicated to his memory this monument had affixed to it a brass showing beckingham dressed in clerical robes rather than official garb of bench plaque has since been stolen but inscription is faintly apparent in stone beneath plate 41 brass indent in an inventory of historical monuments in

shillings per annum on condition that two monks should daily pray for abbey and queen eleanor d 1290 and provide a feast for 200 of poor on anniversary of queen s death having been ordained elias
