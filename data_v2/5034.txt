vision and strategy for tourism development in nunavut a number of issues facing nunavut tourism operators were highlighted one major issue for nunavut tourism industry is territory s remote nature this imposes high travel costs on visitors to nunavut and drives tourism numbers down in addition nunavut s position north of arctic circle reduces opportunity for spring activities and results in a highly seasonally based tourism market this limits opportunities for year round employment in territory many tourism organisations and operators faced difficulty attracting high quality staff members to their ranks and experienced high levels of turnover there are limited links between tourism operators inhibiting opportunities for inter sector growth a number of governmental and human resource issues also exist employees in tourism industry are often poorly trained and tourism operators also face high staff turnover a lack of interest in tourism development also exists in many nunavut governmental organisations as well as in private sector and a policy put in place to prevent market disruption by new businesses has led to many businesses being denied licences to operate due to new competition they would bring to market this policy has not only acted to detriment of competition in tourism sector but has also limited opportunities for industry growth finally a lack of in depth and relevant statistics about trends and growth in tourism in nunavut has prevented businesses from planning for their short and long term futures references external links website of nunavut tourism
