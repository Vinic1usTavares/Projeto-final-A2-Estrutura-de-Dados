square high rise apartment buildings canal street in lower manhattan whose visual imprint inspired character of tito initial conception and development writing process for spook country began for gibson with a desire to write a novel but without any ideas or themes that he wished to explore impetus for story grew out of author s visual impressions of lower manhattan in winter from which character of tito emerged little of material in his original pitch of novel posted online as part of an early promotional campaign by book s publishers survived in final draft original proposal focused on warchalker an obscure iraqi which chronicles story of a disappeared consignment of millions of iraqi reconstruction money readers of blog included a female networks theorist interested in locative technology and a of mixed heritage who freelanced with his family for organized crime plot would have followed those readers attempt to track a shipping container through warchalker on behalf of an unnamed villain characters from proposal did appear in final version albeit in much altered form an early draft featuring musician turned journalist hollis and half cuban spy tito as two protagonists did not satisfy gibson and so he introduced character of milgrim drug addled translator story of tito s family of chinese exiles in cuba turning to crime was not based on historical events though their role as illegal facilitators was inspired by real crime families specializing in smuggling a phenomenon gibson encountered in course of his work with futurist consulting entity global business network although he had intended his 2003 novel pattern recognition to be a standalone work elements of it manifested in script of its eventual successor including character of amoral marketing guru hubertus bigend as gibson developed plot it became apparent that node shadowy magazine startup was way and thus spook country came to inhabit same fictional universe as its predecessor in a january 2007 interview author revealed that later novel was set in spring of 2006 and described shared world of novels as more or less one we live in now gibson was first introduced to locative media websites through links from a friend and initially found phenomenon to be excessively nerdy and very conceptual despite his finding compelling idea of a digital grid mapping surface of earth gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and and instead reworked material into locative art of novel when i started i thought that locative art stuff would work way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction he commented in a subsequent interview then i started liking that it wasn t going to do that conception of artworks in novel was derived from lowbrow art movement and was inspired by movement s talismanic juxtapoz only art magazine gibson was reading regularly at time novel exhibits gibson s characteristic brand awareness a key plot element of pattern recognition which he honed while poring over catalogues of products as part of his writing process author found writing process unnerving as solution to mystery of container novel s macguffin did not come to him until after he had written several hundred pages of manuscript pre release gibson announced novel on october 6 2006 on his blog where fragments of work were posted non sequentially for some time leading to much reader speculation on content and plot of novel following day blog featured an exploration of mooted title by close friend and collaborator jack womack in august 2007 gibson made an appearance in virtual world second life to give a reading of novel later reflecting on experience he remarked that second life construct was a lot more corporate than he had imagined a report in times described event as heavily freighted with meaning in light of gibson s role in shaping conceptions of cyberspace and virtual worlds in an interview to promote release of novel gibson revealed that one of issues that had most affected his writing process since pattern recognition was sense that everything in text was potentially searchable online it s as though there is a sort of invisible hyperlink theoretical text that extends out of narrative of my novel in every direction he commented a recipient of an advanced reading copy initiated node magazine a literary project in guise of novel s fictional magazine with intent of annotating novel author under nom de plume mobilised a cadre of volunteers to track references and collate cloud of data surrounding work those elements of story with footprints on internet resources such as google and wikipedia project had precedent in joe clark s pr otaku an attempt at logging and annotating pattern recognition but whereas that took several years to develop node was complete before novel was even published themes spook country explores themes relating to espionage war profiteering and esoteric martial artistry as well as familiar themes from author s previous novels such as unintended uses for which technology is employed e g locative art and nature of celebrity author s preoccupation with semiotics and apophenia in pattern recognition is carried over in sequel in a review for guardian steven poole observed that this is a novel about and also full of ghost signs or signs that may not be signs and about difficulty of telling difference gibson delights in saturating pages with data that may or may not encode clues for reader eversion of cyberspace through its treatment of locative technology novel revisits notions of virtual reality and cyberspace prominent in gibson s early cyberpunk fiction one character proposes that cyberspace is everting becoming an integral and indistinguishable element of physical world rather than a domain to be visited during book tour for novel gibson elaborated on this theme proposing that ubiquity of connectivity meant that what had been called cyberspace is no longer a discrete sphere of activity separate from and secondary to normal human activity but that those increasingly less common parts of normal life free from connectivity were exception if book has a point to make where we are now with cyberspace he commented it was that cyberspace has colonized our everyday life and continues to colonize everyday life class divide one of elements of novel that author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that vast majority will never experience of which gibson cited brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example author felt that at time of writing such social chasms were widening and drew parallels to victorian era as well as to world of his breakthrough novel neuromancer 1984 in which there is no middle class only super rich and a predominantly criminal underclass in an interview with telegraph promoting novel gibson conjectured that world was moving to a situation wherein social status is determined by connectivity access to communications technology rather than material wealth thumb alt photograph of smoke rising in front of upright steel members of a shattered building a firefighter is visible as a dark silhouette standing still amid smoke a firefighter stands amidst wreckage of world trade center in new york city gibson saw september 11 attacks as a nodal point in history and their sociopolitical impact was a major theme of novel political climate of post 9 11 world sociocultural changes in post september 11 america including a resurgent tribalism and of society first appeared as a prominent motif in gibson s thought with pattern recognition gibson interpreted attacks as a nodal point an experience out of culture which irrevocably changed course of history and marked true beginning of 21st century after crafting 100 pages of that novel he was compelled to re write main character s backstory which attacks had suddenly rendered implausible this he called strangest experience i ve ever had with a piece of fiction result saw gibson noted as one of first novelists to use attacks to inform their writing nathan lee in village voice advanced notion that while pattern recognition focused to an extent on specifying ambient sense of invasiveness in all aspects of life after collapse of towers spook country accepted that anxiety as a premise and was thus more reflective less unnerving of two novels politics is present as an underlying theme in spook country to a greater extent than in any of author s previous novels novel can be read as an exploration of fear uncertainty and pervasive paranoia of an america riven by unending and divisive iraq war although he had avoided overtly political themes in his previous work out of a distaste for didacticism gibson found that in bush era politics had jacked itself up to my level of weirdness of climate in washington d c during that period he disclosed in a 2007 interview that i like sheer sort of neo stalinist denial of reality that s what makes it work it s interesting mike duffy in scotland on sunday characterized novel as a startling effective guidebook to post 9 11 america dave itzkoff of new york times elaborated proposing that it was arguably first example of post post 9 11 novel whose characters are tired of being pushed around by forces larger than they are bureaucracy history and always technology and are at long last ready to start pushing back interpretation and reception spook country appeared on bestseller charts by august 7 2007 five days after release novel entered washington posts hardcover fiction bestseller list for washington d c area in late august at 4 and by september had reached 2 in san francisco and canada it was listed at 6 on publishers weeklys hardcover fiction bestseller list for u s as well as on new york times best seller list for hardcover fiction where it lasted three weeks it earned a nomination for awards for best novel of 2007 and finished second to michael chabon s yiddish policemen s union in standings for locus award for best science fiction novel following year in august 2008 rebecca armstrong of independent named spook country as one of ten best thrillers mike duffy felt that although novel was less overtly science fiction than gibson s earlier novels it retained their wit virtuosity and insights and had same giddy mix of techno fetishism nuanced edge and finesse which enlivened his previous work spook country in essence pronounced telegraphs tim martin is a classic paranoid quest narrative but one that morbid surveillance tropes of cold war for a post iraq era ken barnes of usa today found that l events and points of view shift constantly so that reader never truly feels on solid ground but judged novel to be a vivid suspenseful and ultimately coherent tale in a review for washington post bill sheahan hailed novel s capture of zeitgeist and compared it to acclaimed literary fiction of don delillo thumb left alt profile of a bespectacled middle aged white man he is looking to right and his left index finger rests on his right cheek slightly below eye author william gibson whose command of prose in novel was subject of critical acclaim plot prose and character ed park of los angeles times hailed novel as a puzzle palace of bewitching proportions and stubborn echoes noting fact that antihero hubertus bigend was most prominent link to pattern recognition as deliciously sinister tim martin thought that plot lacked direction at times although he conceded that novel s main henry bigend storyline felt lightweight matt thorne writing in independent conjectured that it was part of gibson s conscious design that that thread plays out against a backdrop of hidden machinations that have a much darker wider resonance thorne declared spook country a more substantial novel than its predecessor on this basis john casimir of sydney morning herald concurred writing that despite similarity in plots of novels narrative foundation of later novel was firmer its structure more sophisticated and its seams less visible ed park singled out author s prose for praise proclaiming that s for sentence few authors equal gibson s gift for terse yet poetic description quotable simile people and products are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating platonic ideal of catalog matt thorne noted that while he found gibson s tendency towards hyper specificity initially irritating there s hypnotic quality to relentless cataloguing author s prose was also extolled by clay evans of daily camera and by benjamin in new york sun who declared that real news in spook country is that much of flair that mr gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly now on all kinds of things in seattle times nisi shawl gushed that e ven without high cool quotient of novel s contents pleasure of gibson s prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book simon cooper of book show agreed with commendations of gibson s prose but felt plot and characterization let book down in a review for providence journal andy smith remarked that author was a master of atmosphere if not character a sentiment echoed by post and couriers dan conover who although praising novel s intelligence and contemporary relevance felt that gibson s underlying political pre occupation and detached narration came at expense of character development neil drumming of entertainment weekly in awarding novel a b rating concurred complaining that protagonists often just feel like higher tech automatons with useful features whose actions are product of manipulation by external forces and cagey operatives rather than conscious decisions in daily telegraph roger perkins was more blunt remarking that relentless pace and breathless dislocation of plot hid character development that s as deep as dental veneer but equally shiny matt thorne summed up issue in opining that problem with a thriller which begins with a technology journalist talking to an experimental artist is that no matter how exciting events later become it s hard to care conclusion reviewers were divided as to merits of novel s ending andy smith lamented that finale of mostly intriguing novel was distinctly anticlimactic tim martin wrote that it seemed somehow less than sum of its parts clay evans dismissed it as not especially meaningful but fun whereas matt thorne found it lacking a traditional thriller s excitement san francisco chronicle reviewer michael berry called it an ingenious reversal which proved that despite its apparent cynicism novel was oddly optimistic for a ghost story overall thorne judged novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of underwhelming ending and because gibson hides full complications of plot so successfully that it feels as if everything important is happening offstage roger perkins judged novel to be a triumph of style over substance which is exactly way you suspect that gibson wants it his colleague martin mused that along with regular gibsonian tropes there was something new a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith in novel which suggested that author might be approaching apex of his writing dan conover concluded that while darkly comic satire was a worthy addition to gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact it would not rank among author s best works references external links spook country at williamgibsonbooks com author s
