lengthy advantage over rest of field to win quaife hobbs started from pole position in sprint race and kept lead until coletti passed him on third lap although his lead diminished because of tyre wear coletti led event s remaining laps to claim victory bird s feature race victory was his and russian time s second of season and coletti s sprint race win meant he became first monegasque driver to win

would contest monaco round as his contract with hilmer motorsports was on a race by race basis practice and qualifying thumb upright sam bird pictured in 2012 set fastest lap in practice and qualified in third position before going on to win feature race one 30 minute practice session was held on thursday before two races bird who called circuit de monaco his favourite track in gp2 series was fastest with a time of 1 minute and 21 512 seconds on super soft tyres 0 057 seconds faster than russian time teammate tom dillmann in second evans carlin s jolyon palmer marcus ericsson of dams arden international s johnny cecotto jr leimer nasr rio haryanto of addax and calado completed top ten ahead of qualifying only minor off track excursions were reported with dams s stephane richelmi spinning at la rascasse corner and stalled in his attempt to continue driving nasr narrowly avoided an impact against a barrier at swimming pool complex and coletti leimer calado and kevin giovesi for lazarus all ran deep onto track s run off areas at various points in half hour session friday afternoon s qualifying session ran for 30 minutes as in 2012 qualifying was divided into two groups of thirteen cars with odd numbered vehicles in group a and even numbered cars in group b starting order was determined by fastest overall driver in either group most cars had soft types equipped at start and most made pit stops for set up alterations with some installing supersoft tyres cecotto clinched his first pole position of season second of his career and at monte carlo with a time of 1 minute and 21 141 seconds he was joined on grid s front row by teammate evans who led group b his best time was 0 016 seconds slower than cecotto on his final timed lap bird was fastest in first sector but lost six tenths of a second in final two sectors and was third leimer drifted sideways at final corner on his fastest lap but avoided contact with a barrier en route to fourth place kevin ceccon trident took fifth sixth placed palmer s first attempt at going faster proved unsuccessful as he came across richelmi in final sector but took it at his next attempt before leimer demoted him down order julian leal racing engineering took seventh after encountering traffic on his final lap and needed to pass one car to record his fastest time dillmann qualified in eighth place nasr set early pace in group b before settling for ninth and frijns rounded out top ten ericcson was fastest driver not to qualify in top ten his best time of 1 minute and 22 349 seconds was 1 208 seconds off cecotto s pace ericsson paced group b early on but was demoted as session progressed he was followed by sergio canamasas caterham racing in 12th and rossi in 13th place coletti was another group b early pace setter but began from 14th position haryanto qualified in 15th but was demoted ten places on grid for causing an avoidable accident at previous round of season in catalunya hence nathanael berthon trident inherited place and was followed by calado richelmi and daniel de jong mp motorsport 20th place qualifier rene binder lazarus incurred a three place grid penalty for impeding canamasas during qualifying giovesi thus started in 20th with daniel abt art grand prix m simon trummer rapax and jake rosenzweig addax in 21st to 23rd positions lancaster started from 24th after a spin his car at sainte devote turn necessitated yellow flags to be waved in area final position in field was taken by adrian quaife hobbs mp motorsport whose fastest time was 2 2 seconds slower than cecotto races first race was held over a distance of either or 60 minutes which ever came first and all drivers were required to make one pit stop first ten finishers scored points with two being awarded to competitor who recorded fastest lap starting order for second race was determined by finishing positions of first race but with first eight drivers in reverse order of where they finished it was run over a distance of either or 45 minutes which ever came first and in contrast to first race drivers were not required to make pit stops top eight finishers scored points towards their respective championships feature race left thumb upright fabio leimer pictured in 2015 was caught up in a first lap accident triggered by johnny cecotto jr feature race was due to start at 11 15 central european summer time utc 02 00 on 24 may but was delayed by 15 minutes due to an incident during qualifying for porsche supercup race in which several cars crashed at massenet corner repairs were required to barriers at turn as they had been dislodged and oil laid on track surface at same turn was cleaned by course workers using cement dust when race eventually began under overcast and cooler weather conditions with air temperature at and track temperature wheelspin from cecotto allowed his teammate evans to lead field heading into sainte devote turn soon after a fifteen car crashed at first corner caused race to be stopped after losing lead cecotto was fending off an attack from leimer through sainte devote it became impossible for cecotto to maintain his line and he understeered straight into a barrier leimer was trapped in manoeuvre and mounted left hand corner of cecotto s car in response palmer took avoiding action by spinning on inside line causing turn to be blocked palmer avoided injury when leal s front wing came close to striking his helmet coletti leal dillmann frijns ericsson rossi berthon binder giovesi haryanto rosenzweig and abt were all trapped in blockade with varying degrees of car damage nasr was near bird and ceccon and avoided collision between leal and palmer drivers ran back to their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take restart a 40 minute delay was necessitated to allow for a track clear up before race could be restarted nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement cecotto leimer palmer leal frijns ericsson rossi berthon and giovesi restart s running order was determined where drivers were through first sector with those that did not enter placed in their starting position this meant evans led behind safety car followed by bird ceccon nasr and calado safety car was withdrawn at end of lap two and racing resumed evans and bird opened up a two second advantage over ceccon nasr calado and richelmi although evans had switched to supersoft tyres during stoppage bird set consecutive fastest laps on soft tyres thumb upright rio haryanto pictured in 2011 was forced into retirement after daniel abt punted him into a barrier as they had been compromised by first lap pileup and were at back of field dillmann and coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when window opened at end of seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres haryanto and abt made their stops on next lap and calado and lancaster did same on lap nine coletti s early pit stop resulted in him lapping faster than any other driver by two seconds other drivers became aware of significance and nasr went into pit lane to keep his position from calado ceccon and richelmi did same on eleventh lap this placed pressure on race leader evans who was at this point three seconds a lap slower than ceccon evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as ceccon made up enough time to move in front of him evans could not keep close to ceccon and was three seconds behind driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt delayed bird who became leader when evans made his pit stop on lap 15 de jong made a problematic pit stop a rear jack failure delayed him and he then crossed yellow line at pit lane exit twice incurring a drive through penalty bird set fast laps while in first place and maintained lead after his pit stop at conclusion of 16th lap ahead of yet to stop binder ceccon and evans bird was pushing when he slid after clipping a kerb on track and glanced a barrier leaving turn on lap 18 abt was attacking haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to outside of haryanto by out braking him resulting manoeuvre meant abt punted haryanto into an inside barrier with his car s front nose being broken as a consequence need for safety car was avoided as haryanto s car was extracted from track quickly abt was adjudged to have been too aggressive towards haryanto by stewards he incurred a drive through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car dillmann attempted to pass rosenzweig but ran deep at novelle chicane he was required to hand position back to rosenzweig binder made his pit stop on 29th lap and emerged in seventh behind coletti bird continued to lead with a 17 second advantage over ceccon who fended off faster evans in third who himself had nasr and calado close behind bird further opened up a 22 second lead over rest of field and maintained it for rest of race to claim victory ceccon finished second with a second covering evans in third and nasr in fourth evans narrowly fended off nasr for final podium place calado secured fifth with coletti and binder sixth and seventh quaife hobbs passed for eighth in race s final stages and thus earned sprint race pole position richelmi and de jong rounded out top ten points scoring positions dillmann lancaster trummer rosenzweig canamasas and abt were last of classified finishers it was bird s third gp2 series win his and russian time s second of season and his first at circuit since his 2012 formula renault 3 5 series monaco round triumph after race stewards deemed cecotto responsible for causing first lap accident that triggered sole stoppage and barred him from competing in following day s sprint race sprint race second race began at 16 10 local time on 25 may weather conditions at start were cooler than previous day s race with light rain falling air temperature was and track temperature was most cars started on soft compound tyres when race started pole sitter quaife hobbs maintained his startline advantage heading into sainte devote corner while coletti moved into second as binder was slow leaving grid and fell to sixth calado initially held third but evans overtook him around outside at mirabeau turn to move into position nasr passed calado at start of following lap at sainte devote corner for fourth position having been close behind quaife hobbs in race s opening stages coletti pressured quaife hobbs by using his local knowledge to apply pressure on latter coletti lined up an overtaking manoeuvre on quaife hobbs on third lap leaving tunnel and heading into novelle chicane he steered right onto inside line and braked later than quaife hobbs to make pass for lead coletti began to pull away from quaife hobbs setting race s fastest lap at that point on fourth lap to be 2 1 seconds ahead of quaife hobbs left thumb upright stefano coletti pictured in 2010 became first driver to win his home event since louis chiron in 1931 quaife hobbs focused himself on holding off closing evans nasr and calado dillmann was forced to go two laps behind leader on seventh lap after he sustained car damage bird in seventh was challenged by ceccon who put his car on line entering novelle chicane forcing bird to overshoot corner to avoid colliding with him bird was aware that his move would entail a drive through penalty and thus yielded seventh to ceccon richelmi immediately attacked bird but it became evident that bird s car had a major problem bird lost further positions before entering pit lane for technical assistance that put him one lap behind race leader he thus set race s fastest lap on supersoft tyres as he was outside of top ten he did not score point entailed by achievement palmer overtook canamasas on lap 13 in a carbon copy move to abt s manoeuvre on haryanto in previous day s race but on this occasion both drivers continued without any significant damage quaife hobbs fended off three car train and appeared stronger as race progressed and tyres degraded as field became tightly packed no driver had advantage of getting edge for moving up field this was case until rosenzweig stuck front of his car down inside of lancaster through lowe s hairpin and tapped hilmer into a half spin rosenzweig s move enabled him to move into tenth while lancaster could not recover sufficiently from incident and lost five places in two corners coletti s control of lead waned because tyre degradation removed some of his earlier fast pace and handling causing his lead over quaife hobbs to be reduced to one second less than four seconds covered first five runners with a 14 second gap over a battle for sixth between binder ceccon and richelmi coletti had help from quaife hobbs who defended from evans by this point track was completely dry with no rain falling evans made another attempt at taking second on final lap almost going into rear of quaife hobbs s car as pair left novelle chicane coletti maintained lead for rest of race to win coletti s victory made him first monegasque driver to win on streets of monaco since louis chiron in 1931 monaco grand prix quaife hobbs finished in second position three tenths of a second ahead of evans in third and nasr took fourth calado binder ceccon and richelmi rounded out top eight points scoring positions de jong rosenzweig canamasas palmer leimer leal frijns haryanto lancaster ericcson rossi giovesi berthon abt trummer bird and dillmann were final classified finishers post race top three drivers in both races appeared on podium to collect their trophies and spoke to media in a later press conference although bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling pace of feature race he believed he was fortunate because of a new rear wing after ceccon hit his car at first start it s an amazing to be able to win my first gp2 race in monaco maybe i should have done it already in past in gp2 but it felt pretty right today ceccon stated he was happy to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of evans it s my first gp2 podium and it s two years in a row that i finish on podium here since i finished third last year in gp3 here as well today i finished in p2 in race 1 it s good when asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at restart and was being pressured by bird on harder soft compound tyres evans spoke of his belief that had he overtaken ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to bird and felt best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept result thumb upright jolyon palmer pictured in 2012 a vocal critic of cecotto s driving in feature race after sprint race coletti spoke of his childhood dream of hearing monegasque national anthem while standing on top step of principality s podium it feels great i mean i ve seen all drivers winning here since i was a kid i m really really happy especially that with this win i ve consolidated my lead in standings he said for season s next race at silverstone his team need to improve his car for qualifying and then aim to win feature race quaife hobbs said it felt amazing to clinch his first career podium today it s a great reward for team and how hard they ve worked we are a new team now every new team have had a podium quaife hobbs believed had he defended from coletti on third lap both drivers would not have entered novelle chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow coletti with view for an attack later in race third place finisher evans revealed he struggled to get optimum rear tyre temperature on formation lap especially since start of race was best time to pass drivers and was aware that a podium finish was probably unrealistic nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on monaco podium after altering his car cecotto s driving which caused multi car pileup in feature race received much attention it was third such incident in season when cecotto courted controversy and criticism from drivers he was disqualified from qualifying for sepang round when he forced bird off track but avoided a penalty in catalunya sprint race when he swerved into canamasas during a battle for fifth leimer claimed that cecotto solely concentrated on him rather than making corner it s really really disappointing as a lot was possible today and i could have scored a lot of points but once more due to another driver i lost out while my competitors in battle for championship are scoring palmer was more vocal in his criticism in cecotto remarking he would rather start from pit lane than within two rows of cecotto peter allen of formula scout argued that while cecotto s manoeuvre was not clearly malicious in intent venezuelan deserved race ban and that it would help him realise that he needed to control his aggressiveness result increased coletti s advantage at top of drivers championship on 120 points nasr remained in second place 24 points behind coletti while bird s feature race victory put him into third position because he did not score any points in two races leimer fell to fourth and calado gained three positions to complete top five rapax assumed lead of teams championship and were a solitary point ahead of previous leaders carlin russian time s form enabled company to move into third place on 80 points and were a further sixteen in front of fourth
