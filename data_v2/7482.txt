offense thumbnail ruf batting for phillies in 2014 ruf is a strong power hitter who according to one talent evaluator quoted in lindy s sports 2014 baseball preview magazine possesses raw country strength at plate he has an uppercut swing and struggles to hit outside pitches because of poor balance at plate but consequently is able to hit fly balls and drive mistake pitches out of park he is a patient hitter but is opposite of many hitters in that as a right handed hitter he hits left handed pitchers better than right handed pitchers defense ruf has played first base as well as both of corner outfield spots during his career and focused on outfield during latter stages of his development because of ryan howard s perceived preeminence at first base in outfield ruf is a liability and he is pretty shaky at first base further underscoring his man without a position persona within phillies organization this has led some to suggest he would be better suited as a designated hitter in
