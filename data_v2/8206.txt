bears are carnivoran mammals of family ursidae they are classified as caniforms or doglike carnivorans although only eight species of bears are extant they are widespread appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout northern hemisphere and partially in southern hemisphere bears are found on continents of north america south america europe and asia common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs long snouts small rounded ears shaggy hair plantigrade paws with five claws and short tails while polar bear is mostly carnivorous and giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets with exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young bears are typically solitary animals they may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell despite their heavy build and awkward gait they are adept runners climbers and swimmers bears use shelters such as caves and logs as their dens most species occupy their dens during winter for a long period of hibernation up to 100 days bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur they have been used for bear baiting and other forms of entertainment such as being made to dance with their powerful physical presence they play a prominent role in arts mythology and other cultural aspects of various human societies in modern times bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts including asian bile bear market iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered and even least concern species such as brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited but still ongoing etymology english word bear comes from old english and belongs to a family of names for bear in germanic languages such as swedish also used as a first name this form is conventionally said to be related to a proto indo european word for brown so that bear would mean brown one however ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible a word meaning brown of this form cannot be found in proto indo european he suggests instead that bear is from proto indo european word ghwer ghwer wild animal this terminology for animal originated as a taboo avoidance term proto germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking animal s true name might cause it to appear according to author ralph keyes this is oldest known euphemism bear taxon names such as and helarctos come from ancient greek word arktos arktos meaning bear as do names arctic and antarctic from constellation ursa major great bear prominent in northern sky bear taxon names such as ursidae and ursus come from latin ursus ursa he bear she bear female first name ursula originally derived from a christian saint s name means little she bear diminutive of latin ursa in switzerland male first name urs is especially popular while name of canton and city of bern is derived from bar german for bear germanic name bernard including bernhardt and similar forms means bear brave bear hardy or bold bear old english name beowulf is a kenning bee wolf for bear in turn meaning a brave warrior sweet henry 1884 anglo saxon reader in prose and verse clarendon press p 202 taxonomy family ursidae is one of nine families in suborder or doglike carnivorans within order carnivora bears closest living relatives are pinnipeds canids and musteloids modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies ailuropodinae monotypic with giant panda tremarctinae monotypic with spectacled bear and ursinae containing six species divided into one to three genera depending on authority nuclear chromosome analysis show that karyotype of six ursine bears is nearly identical with each having 74 chromosomes see hybrid whereas giant panda has 42 chromosomes and spectacled bear 52 these smaller numbers can be explained by fusing of some chromosomes and banding patterns on these match those of ursine species but differ from those of procyonids which supports inclusion of these two species in ursidae rather than in procyonidae where they had been placed by some earlier authorities evolution thumb left plithocyon skull a member of extinct subfamily hemicyoninae from miocene earliest members of ursidae belong to extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae including parictis late eocene to early middle miocene 38 18 mya and slightly younger allocyon early oligocene 34 30 mya both from north america these animals looked very different from today s bears being small and raccoon like in overall appearance with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger parictis does not appear in eurasia and africa until miocene it is unclear whether late eocene were also present in eurasia although faunal exchange across bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as late eocene about 37 mya and continuing into early oligocene european genera morphologically very similar to allocyon and to much younger american about 18 mya are known from oligocene including and amphicynodon there has been various morphological evidence linking with pinnipeds as both groups were semi aquatic otter like mammals in addition to support of clade other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being closet living relatives to pinnipeds thumb right life restoration of arctotherium raccoon sized dog like cephalogale is oldest known member of subfamily hemicyoninae which first appeared during middle oligocene in eurasia about 30 mya subfamily includes younger genera 20 15 mya and plithocyon 15 7 mya a cephalogale like species gave rise to genus ursavus during early oligocene 30 28 mya this genus proliferated into many species in asia and is ancestral to all living bears species of ursavus subsequently entered north america together with amphicynodon and cephalogale during early miocene 21 18 mya members of living lineages of bears diverged from ursavus between 15 and 20 mya likely via species ursavus based on genetic and morphological data ailuropodinae pandas were first to diverge from other living bears about 19 mya although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 mya new world short faced bears tremarctinae differentiated from ursinae following a dispersal event into north america during mid miocene about 13 mya they invaded south america 2 5 or 1 2 ma following formation of isthmus of panama their earliest fossil representative is in north america c 10 2 ma this genus is probably direct ancestor to north american short faced bears genus arctodus south american short faced bears arctotherium and spectacled bears represented by both an extinct north american species t floridanus and lone surviving representative of tremarctinae south american spectacled bear t ornatus thumb fossil of cave bear ursus spelaeus a relative of brown bear and polar bear from pleistocene epoch in europe subfamily ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5 3 4 5 mya coincident with major environmental changes first members of genus ursus appeared around this time sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event 5 3 mya it took on its peculiar morphology related to its diet of termites and ants no later than by early pleistocene by 3 4 mya species ursus minimus appears in fossil record of europe apart from its size it was nearly identical to today s asian black bear it is likely ancestral to all bears within ursinae perhaps aside from sloth bear two lineages evolved from u minimus black bears including sun bear asian black bear and american black bear and brown bears which includes polar bear modern brown bears evolved from u minimus via ursus which itself is ancestral to extinct pleistocene cave bear species of ursinae have migrated repeatedly into north america from eurasia as early as 4 mya during early pliocene ward and kynaston pp 74 77 polar bear is most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400 000 years ago phylogeny bears form a clade within carnivora cladogram is based on molecular phylogeny of six genes in flynn 2005 note that although they are called bears in some languages red pandas and raccoons and their close relatives are not bears but rather musteloids there are two phylogenetic hypotheses on relationships among extant and fossil bear species one is all species of bears are classified in seven subfamilies as adopted here and related articles amphicynodontinae hemicyoninae agriotheriinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae and ursinae below is a cladogram of subfamilies of bears after mclellan and reiner 1992 and qiu et al 2014 second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis was implemented by mckenna et al 1997 is to classify all bear species into superfamily with hemicyoninae and agriotheriinae being classified in family amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified as stem pinnipeds in superfamily in mckenna and bell classification both bears and pinnipeds in a parvorder of carnivoran mammals known as along with extinct bear dogs of family below is cladogram based on mckenna and bell 1997 classification phylogeny of extant bear species is shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial dna sequences from yu et al 2007 giant panda followed by spectacled bear are clearly oldest species relationships of other species are not very well resolved though polar bear and brown bear form a close grouping physical characteristics size bear family includes most massive extant terrestrial members of order carnivora polar bear is considered to be largest extant species ward and kynaston p 61 with adult males weighing and measuring in total length smallest species is sun bear which ranges in weight and in length prehistoric north and south american short faced bears were largest species known to have lived latter estimated to have weighed and stood tall body weight varies throughout year in bears of temperate and arctic climates as they build up fat reserves in summer and autumn and lose weight during winter morphology thumb left upright 1 2 unlike most other carnivora bears have plantigrade feet drawing by richard owen 1866 bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size with males typically being larger larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species relying as they do on strength rather than speed bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk shoulder blades and pelvis are correspondingly massive limbs are much straighter than those of big cats as there is no need for them to flex in same way due to differences in their gait strong forelimbs are used to catch prey to excavate dens to dig out burrowing animals to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey and to club large creatures thumb upright despite being quadrupeds bears can stand and sit as humans do unlike most other land carnivorans bears are plantigrade they distribute their weight toward hind feet which makes them look lumbering when they walk they are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than chase bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves bears non retractable claws are used for digging climbing tearing and catching prey claws on front feet are larger than those on back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees black bears are most arboreal of bears and have shortest claws pandas are unique in having a bony extension on wrist of front feet which acts as a thumb and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as animals feed most mammals have agouti hair with each individual hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to two different types of melanin pigment bears however have a single type of melanin and hairs have a single colour throughout their length apart from tip which is sometimes a different shade coat consists of long guard hairs which form a protective shaggy covering and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to skin shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in spring leaving a shorter summer coat polar bears have hollow translucent guard hairs which gain heat from sun and conduct it to dark coloured skin below they have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation and soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur other than bold black and white pelage of panda bears tend to be uniform in colour although some species may have markings on chest or face bears have small rounded ears so as to minimise heat loss but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits they are unique among carnivorans in not having touch sensitive whiskers on muzzle however they have an excellent sense of smell better than that of dog or possibly any other mammal they use smell for signalling to each other either to warn off rivals or detect mates and for finding food smell is principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before thumb left brown bear skull skulls of bears are massive providing anchorage for powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscles canine teeth are large but mostly used for display and molar teeth flat and crushing unlike most other members of carnivora bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species this may indicate bears are still in process of evolving from a mainly meat eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one polar bears appear to have secondarily re evolved carnassial like cheek teeth as their diets have switched back towards carnivory sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their lips for sucking up termites on which they feed general dental formula for living bears is structure of larynx of bears appears to be most basal of caniforms they possess air pouches connected to pharynx which may amplify their vocalisations bears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans with a single stomach short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum even herbivorous giant panda still has digestive system of a carnivore as well as carnivore specific genes its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to microbes in its gut bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage panda in particular spends 12 15 hours a day feeding distribution and habitat thumb right spectacled bear is only species found in south america extant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in northern hemisphere and are concentrated in asia north america and europe an exception is spectacled bear native to south america it inhabits andean region sun bear s range extends below equator in southeast asia ward and kynaston p 52 atlas bear a subspecies of brown bear was distributed in north africa from morocco to libya but it became extinct around 1870s most widespread species is brown bear which occurs from western europe eastwards through asia to western areas of north america american black bear is restricted to north america and polar bear is restricted to arctic sea all remaining species of bear are asian they occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest both coniferous and broadleaf forests prairies steppes montane grassland alpine scree slopes arctic tundra and in case of polar bear ice floes bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter behaviour and life history thumb right american black bear tracks at superior national forest minnesota united states of america brown and american black bears are generally diurnal meaning that they are active for most part during day though they may forage substantially by night other species may be nocturnal active at night though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators ward and kynaston 99 bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be most asocial of all carnivora only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food such as salmon runs fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense ward and kynaston p 130 with their acute sense of smell bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away they use olfaction to locate other foods encounter mates avoid rivals and recognise their cubs feeding thumb left giant panda feeding on bamboo at smithsonian national zoological park washington d c this species is almost entirely herbivorous most bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter they eat anything from leaves roots and berries to insects carrion fresh meat and fish and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet at extremes are almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and mostly carnivorous polar bear however all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available ward and kynaston p 83 for example asiatic black bears in taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common and switch to ungulates at other times of year when foraging for plants bears choose to eat them at stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible typically avoiding older grasses sedges and leaves hence in more northern temperate areas browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour berries may be foraged in bushes or at tops of trees and bears try to maximize number of berries consumed versus foliage in autumn some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits which affects their behaviour smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast edible reproductive parts such as acorns such masts can be very important to diets of these species and mast failures may result in long range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources brown bears with their powerful digging abilities commonly eat roots panda s diet is over 99 bamboo of 30 different species its strong jaws are adapted for crushing tough stems of these plants though they prefer to eat more nutritious leaves ward and kynaston pp 89 92 bromeliads can make up to 50 of diet of spectacled bear which also has strong jaws to bite them open ward and kynaston p 87 thumb brown bear feeding on infrequent but predictable salmon migrations in alaska sloth bear though not as specialised as polar bears and panda has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears and developed a long tongue to feed on ants termites and other burrowing insects they favour at certain times of year these insects can make up 90 of their diets some species may raid nests of wasps and bees for honey and immature insects in spite of stinging from adults sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey ward and kynaston p 89 fish are an important source of food for some species and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs typically a bear plunges into water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws preferred parts to eat are brain and eggs small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten thumb left polar bear feeding on a seal on an ice floe north of svalbard norway it is most carnivorous species brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates such as deer and bovids mostly young and weak ward and kynaston pp 93 98 these animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on polar bear mainly preys on seals stalking them from ice or breaking into their dens they primarily eat highly digestible blubber ward and kynaston p 92 large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to head or neck or in case of young simply pinned down and mauled predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to young by mother bears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites stealing food caches from rodents and carcasses from other predators for hibernating species weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy a brown bear can eat of food and gain of fat a day prior to entering its den ward and kynaston p 104 communication thumb left captive asian black bears during an aggressive encounter bears produce a number of vocal and non vocal sounds tongue clicking grunting or many be made in cordial situations such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples while moaning huffing sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed barking is produced during times of alarm excitement or to give away animal s position warning sounds include jaw clicking and lip popping while teeth chatters bellows growls roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters cubs may squeal bawl bleat or scream when in distress and make motor like humming when comfortable or nursing ward and kynaston pp 117 121 thumb upright sloth bear rubbing against tree at tiger reserve india bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright which exaggerates individual s size chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display staring is an aggressive act and facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to eyes during agonistic encounters ward and kynaston pp 124 125 individuals may approach each other by stiff legged walking with head lowered dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation showing canine teeth muzzle twisting and neck stretching a subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation by turning away and dropping head and by sitting or lying down bears may mark territory by rubbing against trees and other objects which may serve to spread their scent this is usually accompanied by clawing and biting object bark may be spread around to draw attention to marking post ward and kynaston p 122 pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in vast arctic wilderness reproduction and development thumb left american black bears mating at north american bear center mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of polygyny promiscuity and serial monogamy during breeding season males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males a male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks depending on species to test her reproductive state during this time period males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate courtship may be brief although in some asian species courting pairs may engage in wrestling hugging mock fighting and vocalising ovulation is induced by mating which can last up to 30 minutes depending on species ward and kynaston pp 138 141 thumb polar bear mother nursing her cub gestation typically lasts 6 9 months including delayed implantation and litter size numbers up to four cubs giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and other is left to die in northern living species birth takes place during winter dormancy cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair relying on their mother for warmth milk of female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born by 2 3 months cubs can follow their mother outside den they usually follow her on foot but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother s back ward and kynaston pp 144 148 male bears play no role in raising young infanticide where an adult male kills cubs of another has been recorded in polar bears brown bears and american black bears but not in other species ward and kynaston p 132 males kill young to bring female into oestrus cubs may flee and mother defends them even at cost of her life in some species offspring may become independent around next spring through some may stay until female successfully mates again bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse at around 3 6 years depending on species male alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old lifespan may also vary between species brown bear can live an average of 25 years hibernation bears of northern regions including american black bear and grizzly bear hibernate in winter during hibernation bear s metabolism slows down its body temperature decreases slightly and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute bears normally do not wake during their hibernation and can go entire period without eating drinking urinating or defecating a fecal plug is formed in colon and is expelled when bear wakes in spring if they have stored enough body fat their muscles remain in good condition and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea female bears give birth during hibernation period and are roused when doing so mortality thumb right hunters with shot bear sweden early 20th century this photograph is in nordic museum bears do not have many predators most important are humans and as they started cultivating crops they increasingly came in conflict with bears that raided them since invention of firearms people have been able to kill bears with greater ease felids like tiger may also prey on bears particularly cubs which may also be threatened by canids bears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites including single celled protozoans and gastro intestinal worms and nematodes and flukes in their heart liver lungs and bloodstream externally they have ticks fleas and lice a study of american black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including protozoan parasitic worm diphyllobothrium mansonoides and nematodes capillaria aerophila physaloptera sp sp and others of these d mansonoides and adult c aerophila were causing pathological symptoms by contrast polar bears have few parasites many parasitic species need a secondary usually terrestrial host and polar bear s life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment protozoan toxoplasma gondii has been found in polar bears and nematode trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears bears in north america are sometimes infected by a similar to canine distemper virus they are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis cav 1 with free living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis relationship with humans conservation in modern times bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts including asian bile bear market though hunting is now banned largely replaced by farming iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable even two least concern species brown bear and american black bear are at risk of extirpation in certain areas in general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans and main non natural causes of mortality are hunting trapping road kill and depredation laws have been passed in many areas of world to protect bears from habitat destruction public perception of bears is often positive as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets their ability to stand on two legs and their symbolic importance support for bear protection is widespread at least in more affluent societies giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation sichuan giant panda sanctuaries which are home to around 30 of wild panda population gained a unesco world heritage site designation in 2006 where bears raid crops or attack livestock they may come into conflict with humans in poorer rural regions attitudes may be more shaped by dangers posed by bears and economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers attacks several bear species are dangerous to humans especially in areas where they have become used to people elsewhere they generally avoid humans injuries caused by bears are rare but are widely reported bears may attack humans in response to being startled in defense of young or food or even for predatory reasons entertainment hunting food and folk medicine thumb left dancing bear by william frederick witherington 1822 bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment they have been trained to dance and were kept for baiting in europe at least since 16th century there were five bear baiting gardens in southwark london at that time archaeological remains of three of these have survived across europe nomadic romani bear handlers called lived by busking with their bears from 12th century thumb a nomadic a romani bear busker drawing by theodor aman 1888 bears have been hunted for sport food and folk medicine their meat is dark and stringy like a tough cut of beef in cantonese cuisine bear paws are considered a delicacy bear meat should be cooked thoroughly as it can be infected with parasite trichinella spiralis peoples of eastern asia use bears body parts and secretions notably their and bile as part of traditional chinese medicine more than 12 000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in china vietnam and south korea for production of bile trade in bear products is prohibited under cites but bear bile has been detected in shampoos wine and herbal medicines sold in canada united states and australia literature art and symbolism there is evidence of

a bundle of mugwort ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of sunlight for 100 days tiger gave up after about twenty days and left cave however bear persevered and was transformed into a woman bear and tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought favor of heavenly prince bear woman ungnyeo ungnyeo was grateful and made offerings to hwanung however she lacked a husband and
