limusaurus meaning mud lizard is a genus of theropod dinosaur from jurassic oxfordian stage upper shishugou formation in junggar basin of western china genus contains a single species limusaurus inextricabilis limusaurus was a small slender animal about in length that had a long neck and legs but also highly reduced forelimbs it underwent a drastic morphological transformation as it aged while juveniles were toothed these teeth were completely lost and replaced by a beak with age corresponding to a shift in diet from omnivory to herbivory limusaurus is first definitively known ceratosaur from eastern asia while originally considered to be most basal member i e phylogenetically closest to origin of group ceratosauria along with its closest relative elaphrosaurus a 2016 analysis showed that they are in fact members of noasauridae a group of similarly small and lightly built abelisaurs pattern of digit reduction in limusaurus has been used to support contested hypothesis that three fingered hand of tetanuran theropods is result of loss of first and fifth digits from ancestral five fingered theropod hand which has implications for evolution of birds however it is now considered to be irrelevant to subject of digit homology discovery and naming thumb left holotype and assigned specimen upper right exhibited in tokyo limusaurus was described in a 2009 paper authored by xu xing and colleagues in journal nature description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association holotype ivpp v is an almost complete articulated i e with bones laid out as they were in life skeleton and other ivpp v is a likewise almost complete articulated specimen only missing skull second specimen is 15 larger than holotype these specimens have also respectively been referred to by erroneous specimen numbers ivpp v and ivpp v both genus name limusaurus meaning mud lizard and name of type species l inextricabilis meaning impossible to extricate refer to how known specimens appeared to have died and become preserved after being mired in mud pits seventeen additional specimens were described in 2016 these specimens are known from three different aggregations numbered tbb 2001 tbb 2002 and tbb 2005 with former two being at same level and latter some higher in stratigraphic column they include six juveniles 1 year in age or less ten subadults 2 6 years in age and one adult more than 6 years in age like holotype and second specimen new specimens are also stored at institute of vertebrate paleontology and paleoanthropology all of above specimens were recovered during excavations between 2001 and 2006 at wucaiwan locality in shishugou formation located in junggar basin of xinjiang china description thumb left size of limusaurus juvenile in grey compared to an adult human limusaurus was a small slender animal with a long neck and legs latter being 1 8 times length of torso measuring about in length and in weight skull was short roughly half length of femur and its jaws bore a beak covered tip of jaw a feature that was previously unknown in non coelurosaurian group that includes most bird like dinosaurs theropods juveniles had teeth 9 in each side of upper jaw and 12 in each side of lower which were gradually lost as they grew disappearing by adulthood nasal bone had a shelf on its side was short wide less than one third of skull roof s length and twice as long as it was wide inner edge of premaxilla was convex and lower process of lacrimal bone was strongly inclined forwards jugal bone was slender and its rami or branches were rod like fenestra opening of mandible was quite large being 40 length of entire lower jaw eye socket was also quite large like other abelisaurs where material from forelimbs is available arms and hands of limusaurus were considerably reduced even more so than that of ceratosaurus first finger was smaller than other fingers and lacked digits entirely as for other fingers second finger was very robust and had three digits third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods and preserved portions of fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender terminating in a single digit claws were short stout and expanded at their base thumb life restoration in limusaurus sternum was fused into a single large continuous plate another feature that represents evolutionary convergence upon coelurosaurs it also possesses a furcula or wishbone which previously was unknown among ceratosaurians distinctively scapula bore a prominent ridge at its front end and boot of pubis pointed backwards in a hook like shape and had a ridge on each side legs of limusaurus had proportions that were well adapted to running with lower portions of leg being much longer than femur tibiotarsus fusion of tibia and tarsal bones was 1 2 times length of femur and foot was 1 3 times length of femur first toe on each foot or hallux was extremely reduced being only 17 length of third metatarsal metatarsals of other three toes were arranged in an arc with fourth metatarsal adhering tightly to third for its entire length limusaurus has several features of head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids but it also convergently shares a number of traits including beak and fused sternum with later coelurosaurs overall aspect of animal including long neck and legs is very similar to that of cretaceous ornithomimid theropods as well as triassic non dinosaurian archosaur representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs classification limusaurus is a member of ceratosauria that shares characteristics with both coelophysoids and tetanurans features present in limusaurus are suggestive of a close relationship between clades ceratosauria and tetanurae a number of features allow it to be distinguished as a ceratosaurian these include tall skull and small antorbital fenestra maxilla forming part of nostril nasal enclosing antorbital fenestra on its back margin large mandibular fenestra and relatively short dentary compared to rest of jaw bulging head of humerus as well as long and angled deltopectoral crest lack of ossified wrist bones large and expanded boot of pubis and two grooves on sides of foot claws limusaurus was originally described as a basal ceratosaurian with both it and elaphrosaurus being recovered as most basal ceratosaurians in various phylogenetic analyses however subsequent research has placed it in more derived group specifically as a member of noasauridae an analysis conducted in study of multiple individuals of different ages found limusaurus and elaphrosaurus to group in clade elaphrosaurinae within family noasauridae noasauridae was placed in a position outside neoceratosauria group containing ceratosaurus and abelisauridae phylogenetics within noasauridae from version of analysis with separate specimens of limusaurus are shown below it is notable that all juvenile specimens grouped to exclusion of adult specimens showing that its anatomy changed significantly through growth thumb known remains of related elaphrosaurus a contrasting analysis conducted by rauhut and carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within noasauridae specimen ccg 20011 an as of yet unnamed taxon formerly referred to tetanuran which was not included in other analyses was found to be closer to elaphrosaurus than limusaurus with three taxa representing elaphrosaurinae noasaurus and were only taxa within noasaurinae as laevisuchus and were placed basal to group of noasaurinae and elaphrosaurinae within noasauridae limusaurus is first definite ceratosaur from eastern asia to be discovered new dinosaur gives bird wing clue bbc news june 17 2009 it is also one of earliest members of group ceratosauria living during oxfordian stage of jurassic period approximately 161 157 million years ago its discovery shows that asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during middle late jurassic period than previously thought and suggests a possible land connection between asia and other continents during that period digit homology thumb forelimb of limusaurus most basal theropods have five digits on hand along avian lineage however number of digits in hand decreased by emergence of group tetanurae which includes birds two digits had disappeared from hand leaving three digits traditionally it has been hypothesized that digits lost were two outermost digits i e digits iv v in a process known as lateral digit reduction ldr however hypothesis of ldr is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that from five developmental sites digits that develop are three middle digits ii iii iv this inconsistency has been a matter of debate for almost 200 years and has been used by alan feduccia to support controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost first and fifth digits to explain discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in context of bird origins an alternative scenario to ldr was developed by tony thulborn and tim in 1982 in this scenario digits i and v of theropods were reduced in process of bilateral digit reduction bdr with remaining digits developing to resemble former digits i iii limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for bdr hypothesis due to it and other ceratosaurians having a reduced first digit with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among tetanurans sister group of ceratosaurians several additional hypotheses have been proposed to improve upon and reconcile ldr and bdr hypotheses one predominantly favored hypothesis first developed by gunter p wagner and jacques gauthier in 1999 involves a frameshift of digits first digit fails to grow in first developmental site due to not receiving necessary signals which has effect of shifting digits i iii to positions of ii iv thus while digits i iii from ancestral theropod are retained they do not grow in same location a version of frameshift hypothesis modified to incorporate both elements of bdr and fossil evidence from limusaurus and other theropods thumbs down hypothesis of capek et al suggests that this frameshift took place after reduction of both first and fourth digits in theropod lineage major alternative hypothesis supported by xing and colleagues known as lateral shift hypothesis considers a partial step wise frameshift in which from a four fingered hand with reduced digits i and iv i fully disappears while iv develops into a fully fledged finger with ii iv taking on morphologies of former i iii it is plausible that ceratosaurians underwent bdr independent of tetanurans and therefore has no bearing on issue of avian digit homology in particular as demonstrated by analysis abbreviation and loss of digits in forelimb of limusaurus is likely result of a developmental anomaly that appeared exclusively in and persisted throughout evolutionary lineage of ceratosaurians and is unconnected to pattern of digital reduction and frameshift that occurred in tetanurans this is supported by hands of ceratosaurians ceratosaurus and having plesiomorphic i e more similar to ancestral condition of theropods than to derived abelisaurs metacarpal bones comparable to those of more basal theropod dilophosaurus divergent developmental pathways of ceratosaurians and tetanurans is associated with a difference in forelimb function tetanurans utilized their hands for grasping while hands of ceratosaurians almost certainly played no role in predation paleobiology growth thumb left skull of juvenile specimen ivpp v specimen has teeth which were lost in adults histological analysis of lines of arrested growth within tibiae from various ontogenetic stages of limusaurus indicates that animal was skeletally mature at six years in age in older specimens outermost lines of arrested growth are very close together forming what is known as external fundamental system indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals specimens of limusaurus show 78 different anatomical changes that occurred as animals grew in particular their heads become shallower their middle hand bones lengthened and hook of their pubis grew longer additionally shaft of quadrate bone in skull straightened in adults and tips of their lower jaws became more downturned most obvious change that happened during growth of limusaurus is complete loss of teeth from juveniles to adults juveniles began with one tooth in premaxilla eight in maxilla and eleven in lower jaw 42 teeth total at next stage first sixth and eighth teeth in maxilla as well as sixth in lower jaw have all been lost 34 teeth total although sockets are still present and there is a small replacement tooth in socket of sixth lower tooth during this stage usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced since none of still erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or as specimens grew transformation became more radical in subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age all of teeth are missing ct scanning shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in adult maxilla all of sockets in lower jaw have fused into a single hollow canal and rest of tooth sockets have been obliterated loss of teeth with age in limusaurus is most extreme case of tooth morphology changing with age among dinosaurs in fact limusaurus is one of only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny others are red mullet and striped red mullet several armored catfish and platypus its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both front and back is most similar to that of avialan jeholornis temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from replacement tooth buds regressing as in veiled chameleon combined with retention of developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in limusaurus suggests that development of beaks in other lineages of theropods and indeed beaked animals in general may be related to developmental changes that alter point at which tooth development halts feeding and diet adult specimens of limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared with other groups of herbivorous theropods including ornithomimosauria therizinosauria oviraptorosauria and alvarezsauroidea along with troodontid in particular adult specimens are characterized by presence of stomach stones gastroliths with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults these groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter suggesting that limusaurus did same increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be indicative of gut s ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age an isotope analysis of available specimens of limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs however in same analysis juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures this indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous but switched to strict herbivory as they aged this is comparable to diet shift experienced by aforementioned armored catfish paleoenvironment thumb restoration shishugou formation represents a variety of depositional environments including alluvial fans and alluvial plains streams wetlands and shallow lakes during time when limusaurus lived environment would have been consistently warm and dry judging by abundance of coal and carbon rich deposits climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences with warm wet summers and dry winters climate enabled growth of a richly forested environment forest would have been dominated by araucaria trees with undergrowth being occupied by tree ferns and ferns horsetails and shrubs environment of shishugou formation hosted a diverse assemblage of animals contemporaries of limusaurus in wucaiwan locality include theropods and guanlong latter of which is like limusaurus frequently found in mud deposits sauropod mamenchisaurus ornithischians and tritylodontid mammal crocodyliforms and and turtles and taphonomy known fossil material of limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits these pits range in depth from and were likely created by soil liquefaction from footsteps of sauropods or other large dinosaurs size of these assemblages can be attributed to tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in mud other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of guanlong along with small ornithischians crocodyliforms turtles mammals and tritylodontid cynodonts and may also hint at possible gregarious group living tendencies of limusaurus a small crocodyliform is preserved next to holotype see also timeline of ceratosaur research
