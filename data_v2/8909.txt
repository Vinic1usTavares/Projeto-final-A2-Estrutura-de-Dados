its strengths but also its lack of a strong continuous argument its preference for colourful stories and its tendency to gossip one of warmest receptions came in new york journal of books from novelist norman powers he calls subtle body wide ranging flexible in its outlook and satisfying in its inclusiveness even if ms syman never really defines what exactly yoga is in his view result is really a cultural history of united states powers notes syman s statement that yoga is one of first and most successful products of globalization and observes that in america it helped to weave an isolationist population into fabric of larger world scholar of eastern religions thomas forsthoefel almost entirely agreed with powers in his review of book for nova religio in which he called it a compelling account of complex social and philosophical interface created by yoga s arrival in america also describing it as mainly a social history forsthoefel though sees book s strength as syman s storytelling which he says provides key snapshots both of sweep of yoga s evolution in america and of lives of key figures in that process so that book reads almost like a novel readability has been noted by academics too historian sarah schrank writing in american studies calls subtle body highly readable as it traces various transmutations of yoga in america bob writing in elephant journal states that book reads like a thriller and is so entertaining it clearly has an audience outside yoga world thumb upright pierre bernard a major figure in book pictured in ardha padmasana half lotus in an article titled prizefighter trains by yoga methods life magazine 1939 among most critical was historian jared farmer writing in reviews in american history he calls book relatively vivid but inconstant switching between journalistic historical creative and critical writing styles further in his view it lacks a strong argument and es most colorful stories most extreme of those is syman s longest chapter on pierre bernard with farmer writing that it includes bizarre love triangles menage a trois tantric sex vanderbilt heiresses private detectives spies circus elephants baseball and heavyweight boxing though farmer notes how syman successfully illustrates importance of women in shaping yoga in america particularly indra devi he affirms that today s yoga did not come straight from devi he instead asserts that in 1960s modern yoga split into a mind oriented stream with transcendental meditation and hare krishnas and a body oriented stream with iyengar these are covered variously in other parts of book in another review literary critic michiko kakutani writing in new york times states that syman deftly traces how emerson and thoreau enabled yoga to take root in america providing a lively gallery of larger than life characters in story of american yoga kakutani notes syman s many entertaining anecdotes but states that book fails to cover either yoga s ancient history or to show how various schools of yoga evolved almost entirely disagreeing with claire dederer writing in slate calls book an exhaustive historical survey she notes that syman writes of devi that to her yoga refers only to asanas calling this a turning point from esoteric pursuit to health giving practice available to all in dederer s view syman does a wonderful job of showing how yoga like a virus has kept evolving in order to survive but all same dederer wonders if syman wasn t trying too hard similarly tara writing in hinduism today states that subtle body proceeds systematically and is
