polikarpov i 3 was a soviet fighter designed during late 1920s it entered service in 1929 but was retired in 1935 with advent of fighters with higher performance design and development development of i 3 began in mid 1926 after investigations into loss of polikarpov di 1 were completed although new biplane shared many of characteristics of earlier design including staggered sesquiplane layout of wings it was a new design it was designed by oss landplane department of aviation trust under supervision of nikolai nikolaevich polikarpov head designer of department there was much debate within oss about proper powerplant for new fighter but polikarpov rejected wright tornado radial engine and decided in favor of bmw vi liquid cooled v12 engine a wooden mock up was completed in april 1927 but formal approval of design did not come until 3 june 1927 static tests of a full sized model began in october at same time as negotiations for a license for bmw engine were finished gordon and dexter p 7 i 3 had an oval section semi monocoque fuselage covered with molded birch plywood with a small headrest faired into fuselage although engine was enclosed in a metal cowling two spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a clark y profile internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce wings control surfaces were framed in duralumin but covered in fabric it was provided with differential frise type ailerons duralumin n type struts that separated wings and attached upper wing to fuselage had a teardrop profile they were reinforced with steel bracing wires conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers and tailskid was made from duralumin main gear could be replaced by skis like those fitted to polikarpov r 1 engine s semi retractable radiator extended below fuselage behind rear main gear struts gunston p 292 two fuel tanks were fitted main one in fuselage but a small tank mainly used to start engine was in center section of upper wing along with engine coolant tank a total of of fuel was carried initially i 3 was fitted with two fixed synchronized vickers machine guns but these were later replaced by pv 1 machine guns a central op 1 optical gunsight was provided with a kp 5 ring sight offset to starboard some aircraft had bomb racks to carry two bombs gordon and dexter pp 7 8 first prototype was completed in early 1928 and made its first flight on 21 february its manufacturer s trials were finished by 10 march and state acceptance trials by 14 april pilots of nii vvs air force scientific test institute criticized lack of directional stability at high speeds and a slight problem in control response between maneuvers area of vertical tail was increased and elevators were given horn balances to alleviate first problem while split ailerons addressed second problem since production had begun before aircraft was actually approved for service use first forty aircraft were completed with smaller tailplane a second prototype was completed in august 1928 and tested a different propeller optimized for high speed which increased top speed to although it lengthened take off run first 39 aircraft completed plus two prototypes used imported engines but remainder used license built mikulin m 17 approximately 400 were built with gordon and dexter citing sources that state 389 or 399 they also provide a yearly production table that lists 35 built in 1928 47 in 1929 250 in 1930 and 55 in 1931 which add up to 389 when two prototypes are included gordon and dexter p 9 operational use initial deliveries in 1929 were to units in belorussian military district where they replaced grigorovich i 2 they equipped 4th and 7th squadrons air squadron later 106th and 107th fighter squadrons fighter air squadrons at smolensk 13th and 5th squadrons later 108th and 7th fighter squadrons at bryansk 9th squadron and 17th and 19th squadrons which later became 116th and 117th fighter squadrons units based in ukraine began to receive theirs following year they equipped 3rd squadron later 109th fighter squadron and 73rd air detachment at kiev and 91st squadron later 33rd fighter squadron at bobruisk others were delivered to 1st 2nd and 3rd schools of military pilots gordon and dexter pp 9 10 by 1 october 1930 252 i 3s were in service and 282 a year later 297 were on hand on 1 january 1932 although it fell to 249 a year later and 239 towards end of 1933 it was relegated to secondary roles in 1935 as newer and more powerful polikarpov fighters entered service notably i 5 i 15 and i 16 gordon and dexter p 10 variants di 2 was an enlarged two seat variant it had an extra frame added to fuselage an extended wingspan and an enlarged rudder two 7 62 mm da machine guns were mounted on a ring in observer s cockpit a prototype was completed in early 1929 and made its first flight in may of that year however prototype crashed due to stabilizer failure in a dive later in 1929 killing pilot operators soviet
