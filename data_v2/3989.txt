ilyushin il 6 was a soviet long range bomber developed from ilyushin il 4 during 1942 originally intended as a high speed replacement for il 4 it was recast as a very long range bomber with fuel conserving diesel engines before production of single prototype began in december 1942 flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and engines proved to be hard to start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements further development was canceled in 1944 development outwardly similar to il 4 il 6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer fuselage fitted with a completely new highly tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 8 engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as engine radiators were mounted in wing center section fed by slits in leading edge of wing defensive armament was greatly improved with five cannon fitted on flexible mountings in nose dorsal turret two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of tailplane gordon p 103 il 6 was originally intended as a high speed replacement for il 4 but after initial design was completed in august 1942 vvs requested that bomber have extended range instead of high speed original m 71 radial engines were therefore replaced by charomskiy ach 30 diesel engines with low fuel consumption which promised to give il 6 required range especially when operated at moderate weights revised design was completed in december 1942 and production of prototype was initiated first flight of il 6 was made in irkutsk on 7 august 1943 with lower powered ach 30b engines substituted for unavailable ach 30bf engines gordon pp 103 04 flight tests revealed difficult handling and a lack of power due to non availability of intended ach 30bf engines flight tests continued without waist guns and their gunner until ach 30bf s were fitted between may and july 1944 despite modifications aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance throughout flight tests engines performed satisfactorily in air but were found to be very difficult to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements further development was canceled gordon p 104 variants il 6 intended production version with charomskiy ach 30bf engines also known as m 30 il 6 bomber with m 90 engines projected variant with m 90 engines production drawings were issued but nothing further was heard of it presumably as all effort was focused on diesel powered version specifications il 6 1944 see also references further reading il 006 category 1930s soviet bomber aircraft category world war ii soviet medium bombers category abandoned military aircraft projects of soviet union category aircraft first flown in 1943 category twin piston engined tractor aircraft
