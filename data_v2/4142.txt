paint particular dreamings or tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights a complex concept tjukurrpa refers to spiritual knowledge of landscape and custodianship of it it also refers to laws rules or stories that people must maintain and re produce in their communities daisy jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility and those of her

mission in 1930s as an influence on her work memory and five mile creek 1995 represents country of her childhood it shows hills of region in elevation rather than in plan and represents range of vegetation typical of that country curator marina strocchi notes how daisy jugadai s painting reflects close observation of complex structures of vegetation and environment its features obsessively detailed with artist devotedly including all bush tucker of that area as well as choosing a time of year in which to depict her country vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush while even finer detail such as pollen would be rendered using a matchstick clouds were always final features to be included despite this devotion to detail daisy preferred to paint large canvasses memory and five mile creek was included in national gallery of victoria s 2004 05 exhibition aboriginal art post 1984 and reviewer miriam cosic while noting its naive charm also drew attention to work s title and implication that like other more explicitly political painters of her era she too is talking of violent dispossession artist mandy martin who participated in a 2005 collaboration with several painters from haasts bluff region thought that daisy s rendering of bush tucker was achieved with a stylised but dazzling personal language writer and critic morag fraser described daisy s work as extraordinary observing that in daisy s paintings nature is so wholly internalised and its rendering so uninhibited a distinguished artist in her community her death coincided with a vigorous renewal of artistic expression amongst her successors references category 1955 births category 2008 deaths category australian aboriginal artists category australian women painters category 20th
