bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants known for their role in pollination and in case of best known bee species western honey bee for producing honey and beeswax bees are a monophyletic lineage within superfamily apoidea and are presently considered a clade called anthophila there are over 16 000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families they are found on every continent except antarctica in every habitat on planet that contains insect pollinated flowering plants some species including honey bees bumblebees and stingless bees live socially in colonies bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen former primarily as an energy source and latter primarily for protein and other nutrients most pollen is used as food for larvae bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially decline in wild bees has increased value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than long to megachile pluto largest species of leafcutter bee whose females can attain a length of most common bees in northern hemisphere are halictidae or sweat bees but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee eaters insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies human beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia since at least times of ancient egypt and ancient greece apart from honey and pollination honey bees produce beeswax royal jelly and propolis bees have appeared in mythology and folklore through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to present day though primarily focused in northern hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across britain from 1980 to 2013 found insects have been lost from a quarter of places they inhabited in 1980 evolution thumb melittosphex burmensis a fossil bee preserved in amber from early cretaceous 100 to 145 million years ago of myanmar ancestors of bees were wasps in family crabronidae which were predators of other insects switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to wasp larvae this same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within vespoid wasps where pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors until recently oldest non compression bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber prisca of cretaceous age a corbiculate bee a bee fossil from early cretaceous 100 mya melittosphex burmensis is considered an extinct lineage of pollen collecting apoidea sister to modern bees derived features of its morphology apomorphies place it clearly within bees but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits of legs two mid tibial spurs and a slender hind showing its transitional status by eocene 45 mya there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages highly eusocial corbiculate apidae appeared roughly 87 mya and within apidae around 53 mya colletidae appear as fossils only from late oligocene 25 mya to early miocene melittidae are known from in early eocene megachilidae are known from trace fossils characteristic leaf cuttings from middle eocene andrenidae are known from eocene oligocene boundary around 34 mya of florissant shale halictidae first appear in early eocene with species found in amber are known from fossil brood cells of pleistocene age coevolution thumb upright 0 9 long tongued bees and long tubed flowers coevolved like this amegilla cingulata apidae on acanthus earliest animal pollinated flowers were shallow cup shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles so syndrome of insect pollination was well established before first appearance of bees novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination and are most efficient pollinating insects in a process of coevolution flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes and bees developed longer tongues to extract nectar bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen location and type differ among and between groups of bees most bees have scopal hairs located on their hind legs or on underside of their abdomens some bees in family apidae possess pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops this drove adaptive radiation of angiosperms and in turn bees themselves bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites some bees provide tufts of hairs called that appear to provide lodgings for mites in return it is believed that mites eat fungi that attack pollen so relationship in this case may be phylogeny external this phylogenetic tree is based on et al 2012 which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that bees anthophila arose from deep within crabronidae which is therefore paraphyletic placement of is uncertain small subfamily was not included in their analysis internal this cladogram of bee families is based on et al 2013 which places former families and as subfamilies inside melittidae english names where available are given in parentheses characteristics thumb upright left lapping mouthparts of a honey bee showing labium and maxillae bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume like setae hairs combs on forelimbs for cleaning their antennae small anatomical differences in limb structure and venation of hind wings and in females by having seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half plates bees have following characteristics a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of surface of head between and above these are three small simple eyes ocelli which provide information on light intensity antennae usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are geniculate having an elbow joint part way along they house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch mechanoreceptors smell and taste and small hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to hear sounds mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar thorax has three segments each with a pair of robust legs and a pair of membranous wings on hind two segments front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning antennae and in many species hind legs bear pollen baskets flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure collected pollen wings are synchronised in flight and somewhat smaller hind wings connect to forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in forewing abdomen has nine segments three being modified into sting thumb head on view of a carpenter bee showing antennae three ocelli compound eyes sensory bristles and mouthparts world s largest species of bee is thought to be wallace s giant bee megachile pluto whose females can attain a length of smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in tribe meliponini whose workers are less than in length sociality haplodiploid breeding system thumb left upright 1 3 willing to die for their sisters worker honey bees killed defending their hive against wasps along with a dead wasp such altruistic behaviour may be favoured by haplodiploid sex determination system of bees according to inclusive fitness theory organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output but also that of close relatives in evolutionary terms individuals should help relatives when cost relatedness benefit requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure in haplodiploid species females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs because a male is haploid has only one copy of each gene his daughters which are diploid with two copies of each gene share 100 of his genes and 50 of their mother s therefore they share 75 of their genes with each other this mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what w d hamilton termed more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring workers often do not reproduce but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters as queens than they would by having their own offspring each of which would only have 50 of their genes assuming they would produce similar numbers this unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of multiple independent evolutions of eusociality arising at least nine separate times within hymenoptera however some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid conversely all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males creating half sisters that share only 25 of their genes haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality but monogamy queens mating singly is ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to evolution of eusociality in bees eusociality thumb upright a honey bee swarm bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities eusociality appears to have originated from at least three independent origins in halictid bees most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non reproductive adults plus overlapping generations this division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes in some species groups of cohabiting females may be sisters and if there is a division of labour within group they are considered group is called eusocial if in addition group consists of a mother queen and her daughters workers when castes are purely behavioural alternatives with no morphological differentiation other than size system is considered primitively eusocial as in many paper wasps when castes are morphologically discrete system is considered highly eusocial true honey bees genus apis of which there are seven currently recognized species are highly eusocial and are among best known of all insects their colonies are established by swarms consisting of a queen and several hundred workers there are 29 subspecies of one of these species apis mellifera native to europe middle east and africa africanized bees are a hybrid strain of a mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing european and african subspecies they are extremely defensive stingless bees are also highly eusocial they practise mass provisioning with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming thumb left a bumblebee carrying pollen in its pollen baskets corbiculae many bumblebees are eusocial similar to eusocial vespidae such as hornets in that queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population which occurs in mid to late summer nest architecture is simple limited by size of pre existing nest cavity and colonies rarely last more than a year in 2011 international union for conservation of nature set up bumblebee specialist group to review threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using iucn red list criteria there are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees but they have been studied less often most are in family halictidae or sweat bees colonies are typically small with a dozen or fewer workers on average queens and workers differ only in size if at all most species have a single season colony cycle even in tropics and only mated females hibernate a few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in hundreds such as hesperus some species are eusocial in parts of their range and solitary in others or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nests in same population orchid bees apidae include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology some bees apidae form primitively eusocial colonies with progressive provisioning a larva s food is supplied gradually as it develops as is case in honey bees and some bumblebees solitary and communal bees thumb a bee megachile rotundata cutting circles from acacia leaves most other bees including familiar insects such as carpenter bees leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in sense that every female is fertile and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself there is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax bees collect pollen to feed their young and have necessary adaptations to do this however certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring solitary bees are important pollinators they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste like consistency some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen carrying structures on their bodies a very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences namely carpenter bees sweat bees mason bees plasterer bees squash bees dwarf carpenter bees leafcutter bees alkali bees and digger bees left thumb a solitary bee family megachilidae visiting lantana most solitary bees nest in ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow reeds or twigs holes in wood female typically creates a compartment a cell with an egg and some provisions for resulting larva then seals it off a nest may consist of numerous cells when nest is in wood usually last those closer to entrance contain eggs that will become males adult does not provide care for brood once egg is laid and usually dies after making one or more nests males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when females emerge solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting only in self defense if ever thumb mason bee nests in a hole in dead wood bee hotels are often sold for this purpose while solitary females each make individual nests some species such as european mason bee and dawson s burrowing bee amegilla dawsoni are gregarious preferring to make nests near others of same species and giving appearance of being social large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations to distinguish them from colonies in some species multiple females share a common nest but each makes and provisions her own cells independently this type of group is called communal and is not uncommon primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis biology life cycle life cycle of a bee be it a solitary or social species involves laying of an egg development through several moults of a legless larva a pupation stage during which insect undergoes complete metamorphosis followed by emergence of a winged adult most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate sex of a bee is determined by whether or not egg is fertilised after mating a female stores sperm and determines which sex is required at time each individual egg is laid fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs males tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage egg is generally oblong slightly curved and tapering at one end in case of solitary bees each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it this may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning in social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with larva being fed regularly while it grows nest varies from a hole in ground or in wood in solitary bees to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees larvae are generally whitish grubs roughly oval and bluntly pointed at both ends they have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing they have no legs but are able to move within confines of cell helped by tubercles on their sides they have short horns on head jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of mouth tipped with a bristle there is a gland under mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into silk they use to produce their cocoons pupa can be seen through semi transparent cocoon and over course of a few days insect undergoes metamorphosis into form of adult bee when ready to emerge it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of cell flight thumb honeybee in flight carrying pollen in pollen basket in antoine magnan s 1934 book le vol des insectes he wrote that he and andre sainte lague had applied equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed wing calculations but that one shouldn t be surprised that results of calculations don t square with reality ingram jay 2001 barmaid s brain aurum press pp 91 92 this has led to a common misconception that bees violate aerodynamic theory but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed wing flight and that their flight is explained by other mechanics such as those used by helicopters in 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects wings helped to provide lift high speed cinematography and robotic mock up of a bee wing re work of dr michael h dickinson showed that lift was generated by unconventional combination of short choppy wing strokes a rapid rotation of wing as it flops over and reverses direction and a very fast wing beat frequency wing beat frequency normally increases as size decreases but as bee s wing beat covers such a small arc it flaps approximately 230 times per second faster than a 200 times per second which is 80 times smaller navigation communication and finding food thumb upright karl von frisch 1953 discovered that honey bee workers can navigate indicating range and direction to food to other workers with a waggle dance ethologist karl von frisch studied navigation in honey bee he showed that honey bees communicate by waggle dance in which a worker indicates location of a food source to other workers in hive he demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways by sun by polarization pattern of blue sky and by earth s magnetic field he showed that sun is preferred or main compass other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive bees navigate using spatial memory with a rich map like organization ecology floral relationships most bees are polylectic generalist meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants but some are oligoleges specialists in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen and male orchid bees which gather aromatic compounds from orchids one of few cases where male bees are effective pollinators bees are able to sense presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers floral odors and even electromagnetic fields once landed a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers in rare cases a plant species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened there is however a pronounced tendency for bees to be associated with common widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators there are some forty oligoleges associated with creosote bush in arid parts of united states southwest for example as mimics and models thumb left bee fly bombylius major a batesian mimic of bees taking nectar and pollinating a flower thumb upright bee orchid lures male bees to attempt to mate with flower s lip which resembles a bee perched on a pink flower many bees are aposematically coloured typically orange and black warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting as such they are models for batesian mimicry by non stinging insects such as bee flies robber flies and hoverflies all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees bees are themselves mullerian mimics of other aposematic insects with same colour scheme including wasps and other beetles and many butterflies and moths lepidoptera which are themselves distasteful often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food all mullerian mimics including bees benefit from reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration bees are also mimicked by plants such as bee orchid which imitates both appearance and scent of a female bee male bees attempt to mate pseudocopulation with furry lip of flower thus pollinating it as brood parasites thumb left bombus vestalis a brood parasite of bumblebee bombus terrestris brood parasites occur in several bee families including apid subfamily females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures scopa and do not construct their own nests they typically enter nests of pollen collecting species and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by host bee when cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes host larva s pollen ball and often host egg also arctic bee species bombus hyperboreus in particular are an

four bee families andrenidae colletidae halictidae and apidae contain some species that are crepuscular most are tropical or subtropical but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes these bees have greatly enlarged ocelli which are extremely sensitive to light and dark though incapable of forming images some have refracting superposition compound eyes these combine

bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants and are major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants it is estimated that one third of human food supply depends on pollination by insects birds and bats most of which is accomplished by bees whether wild or domesticated over last half century there has been a general decline in species richness of wild bees and other pollinators probably attributable to stress from increased parasites and disease use of pesticides and a general decrease in number of wild flowers climate change probably exacerbates
