west of london traffic increased in 20th century because of rise in motor vehicle traffic and it remained popular because of lack of nearby bridges pedestrian use dropped after construction of a parallel foot tunnel and extension of docklands light railway to woolwich arsenal station alternatives such as thames gateway bridge and gallions reach crossing have been proposed as replacements but there are no plans to discontinue woolwich ferry as long as there is demand services thumb 300px woolwich ferry route connecting north circular and south circular roads woolwich foot tunnel runs

restrictions for heavy goods vehicles and users of dartford crossing incur toll charges history early services there has been a connection across thames between what is now old woolwich and what would later be north woolwich since norman conquest area was mentioned in domesday book as belonging to hamon steward which belong to pertinent in woolwich pertinent here refers to portion of land north of thames yet also part of county of kent state papers in 1308 show that a service was running between north woolwich and warren lane that year william de sold business to william atte halle for ps10 ferry was subsequently sold in 1320 for 100 silver marks cross river traffic increased following establishment of royal arsenal in 1671 to enable movement of troops and supplies army established its own ferry in 1810 following year an act of parliament established a commercial ferry company but it was dissolved in 1844 in 1846 eastern counties and thames junction railway extended its lines to include a thames wharf branch eventually three steam ferries operated but they proved inadequate to meet growing demand in october 1880 a public meeting was held in woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam ferry service but cost was seen as prohibitive following establishment of metropolitan board of works which had taken over toll bridges in west london and opened them to free public use it was suggested that board should fund a free crossing of thames in east london proposals were made to provide services at woolwich and further upstream at greenwich but latter plan was abandoned in 1884 board agreed to provide two steam powered ferries each costing ps10 650 and asked chief engineer sir joseph bazalgette to lead design and construction in september 1887 messrs mowlem and company were awarded contracts valued at ps54 900 to build approaches bridges and pontoons modern service service was officially opened on 23 march 1889 with paddle steamer gordon two days before first service metropolitan board of works was replaced by london county council lcc and opening ceremony was conducted by lord rosebery instead of expected bazalgette sister vessel duncan was introduced on 20 april by end of 1920s rise in motor traffic had put pressure on ferry s capacity a proposed bridge between shooter s hill and east ham was rejected as too obvious a target for wartime bombings and a third vessel was introduced instead because of lack of a fixed crossing thames became a psychological barrier for those living in east end of london who could only use a limited number of routes to cross river including woolwich ferry lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became dartford crossing further downstream thumb left traffic queueing for woolwich ferry in 1955 conversion to a roll on roll off vehicle service in 1963 reduced waiting times by 1950s it was still quicker for ferry traffic to divert via blackwall

roads lcc continued to operate ferry until it was replaced by greater london council glc on 31 march 1965 in 1964 marples ridgeway and partners started building current reinforced concrete terminals which can operate over a tidal range current terminals were opened in 1966 after abolition of glc in 1986 responsibility for operating service was transferred to secretary of state for transport who contracted then london borough of greenwich to run service asset ownership and operating rights were subsequently transferred to transport for london tfl on establishment of greater london authority

arrangements over years especially to avoid impacting local traffic for foot passengers bus services connect to both terminals there is a small bus station on north side but some cross river foot passengers take foot tunnel instead about 300 foot passengers used ferry daily between 1983 and 1985 further competition arrived in 2009 with extension to woolwich of docklands light railway which crosses under river to east of crossing and tunnel and has led to a reduction in number of foot passengers using ferry future ferry service provides one of few road crossings of thames east of city of london as long as there is a demand for a vehicle ferry it is unlikely to be discontinued and doing so would require changing an 1885 act of parliament planning applications were submitted for a new bridge thames gateway bridge close to woolwich ferry in 2004 although project was cancelled in 2008 in 2012 mayor of london boris johnson announced gallions reach crossing a replacement ferry service running further east from beckton to thamesmead which was expected to open in 2017 this did not occur and has been replaced with proposals for either a new bridge or tunnel in area tfl planning director richard de cani has said that ferry will continue to operate as long as there are no alternatives and there are no current plans to discontinue service tolls cannot be levied on ferry without changing 1885 act of parliament however it is possible that service may eventually be tolled in conjunction with other projects media appearances woolwich ferry has made several appearances on tv and
