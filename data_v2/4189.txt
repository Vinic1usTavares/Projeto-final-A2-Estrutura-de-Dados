like what hell is this holiday i ve never heard of it following year while discussing possible creation of a halloween episode she and executive producer greg daniels agreed to instead create one that was diwali themed as two holidays fall near each other when it came time to write episode however kaling had to perform a google search as she had forgotten many details she explained i was a little embarrassed with how little i knew about it i m hindu but i m not really a practicing hindu so i had to do a lot of research kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture at first being concerned that daniels and people i work with were a little antsy about assigning hindu writer indian episode i didn t want to feel like they pigeonholed me but i felt like i d done enough episodes that it was okay she found that making episode was kind of perfect meeting of being child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show series writers have since joked that they should do a diwali themed episode every year in same vein as christmas specials when creating story kaling knew that a lot of stuff has to happen in midst of festival including michael and carol s relationship becoming very roller as

doctor she remarked kelly s family has like nine daughters and if only they could marry them off it would be wonderful but kelly is oldest and most idiotic of them all though he wanted to avoid
