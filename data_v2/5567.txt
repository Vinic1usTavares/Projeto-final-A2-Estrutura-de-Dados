stephen jay gould september 10 1941 may 20 2002 was an american paleontologist evolutionary biologist and historian of science he was also one of most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation gould spent most of his career teaching at harvard university and working at american museum of natural history in new york in 1996 gould was hired as vincent astor visiting research professor of biology at new york university where he divided his time teaching there and at harvard gould s most significant contribution to evolutionary biology was theory of punctuated equilibrium which he developed with niles eldredge in 1972 eldredge niles and s j gould 1972 punctuated equilibria an alternative to phyletic gradualism in t j m schopf ed models in paleobiology san francisco freeman cooper and company pp 82 115 theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching speciation theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in fossil record most of gould s empirical research was based on land snail genera poecilozonites and cerion he also made important contributions to evolutionary developmental biology receiving broad professional recognition for his book ontogeny and phylogeny in evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism sociobiology as applied to humans and evolutionary psychology he campaigned against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields or non overlapping magisteria whose authorities do not overlap gould s j 1997 nonoverlapping magisteria natural history 106 march 16 22

significantly longer depending on nature of distribution gould needed to determine where his individual characteristics placed him within this range given that his cancer was detected early he was young optimistic and had best treatments available he reasoned that he likely fell within favorable tail of a right skewed distribution after an experimental treatment of radiation chemotherapy and surgery gould made a full recovery and his column became a source of comfort for many cancer patients gould was also an advocate of medical cannabis when undergoing his cancer treatments he smoked marijuana to help alleviate long periods of intense and uncontrollable nausea according to gould drug had a most important effect on his eventual recovery he later complained that he could not

model above consists of morphological stability followed by episodic bursts of evolutionary change via rapid cladogenesis it is contrasted below to phyletic gradualism a more gradual continuous model of evolution early in his career gould and his colleague niles eldredge developed theory of punctuated equilibrium which describes rate of speciation in fossil record as occurring relatively rapidly which then alternates to a longer period of evolutionary stability it was gould who coined term punctuated equilibria though theory was originally presented by eldredge in his doctoral dissertation on devonian trilobites and his article published previous year on allopatric speciation eldredge niles 1971 allopatric model and phylogeny in paleozoic invertebrates evolution vol 25 no 1 mar 1971 pp 156 167 according to gould punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar in central logic of darwinian theory some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was of great interest to biology generally dawkins richard 1999 extended phenotype oxfordshire oxford university press p 101 it merely modified neo darwinism in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before other biologists emphasize theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium and argued that evolutionary stasis had been unexpected by most evolutionary biologists and had a major impact on

made to george gaylord simpson s work in tempo and mode in evolution 1941 however simpson describes paleontological record as being characterized by predominantly gradual change which he termed though he also documented examples of slow and rapid rates of evolution punctuated equilibrium and phyletic gradualism are not mutually exclusive and examples of each have been documented in different lineages debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non scientists and according to richard dawkins has been oversold by media dawkins richard 1986 blind watchmaker new york w w norton

ma belknap press pp 611 615 especially in his work ontogeny and phylogeny in this book he emphasized process of heterochrony which encompasses two distinct processes neoteny and terminal additions neoteny is process where ontogeny is slowed down and organism does not reach end of its development terminal addition is process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in developmental process gould s influence in field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as evolution of feathers selectionism and sociobiology gould was a champion of biological constraints internal limitations upon developmental pathways as well as other non forces in evolution rather than direct adaptations he considered many higher functions of human brain to be unintended side consequence of natural selection to describe such co opted features he coined term exaptation with paleontologist elisabeth vrba gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology against sociobiology in 1975 gould s harvard colleague e o wilson introduced his analysis of animal behavior including human behavior based on a sociobiological framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary basis wilson e o 1975 sociobiology new synthesis cambridge ma harvard university press in response gould richard lewontin and others from boston area wrote subsequently well referenced letter to new york review of books entitled against sociobiology this open letter criticized wilson s notion of a deterministic view of human society and human action allen elizabeth et al 1975 against sociobiology letter new york review of books 22 nov 13 182 184 186 but gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior and later wrote have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve successfully i think vexatious problem of altruism previously greatest stumbling block to a darwinian theory of social behavior here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success and here i wish it well for it represents an extension of basic darwinism to a realm where it should apply gould s j 1980 sociobiology and theory of natural selection in g w

with richard lewontin gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled spandrels of san marco and panglossian paradigm for background see gould s pattern of life s history in john brockman third culture new york simon schuster 1996 pp 52 64 which introduced architectural term spandrel into evolutionary biology in architecture a spandrel is a triangular space which exists over haunches of an arch itc 1908 international library of technology 38 3 22 mark robert 1996 architecture and evolution american scientist july august 383 389 spandrels more often called pendentives in this context are found particularly in classical architecture especially byzantine and renaissance churches when visiting venice in 1978 gould noted that spandrels of san marco cathedral while quite beautiful were not spaces planned by architect rather spaces arise as necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches gould and lewontin thus defined spandrels in evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features which is not directly selected for by natural selection proposed examples include masculinized genitalia in female hyenas use of an as a brooding chamber by snails shoulder hump of giant irish deer and several key features of human mentality in voltaire s candide dr is portrayed as a clueless scholar who despite evidence insists that all is for best in this best of all possible worlds gould and lewontin asserted that it is panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as things that had been naturally selected for and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes such as phyletic and developmental constraints relative frequency of spandrels so defined versus adaptive features in nature remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology maynard smith john 1995 genes memes minds new york review of books 42 nov 30 46 48 by and large i think their spandrels paper had a healthy effect their critique forced us to clean up our act and to provide evidence for our stories but adaptationism remains core of biological thinking a similar appraisal is reflected by ernst mayr in his 1983 paper how to carry out program american naturalist 121 3 324 334 and george c williams natural selection domains levels and challenges new york oxford

professor of civil engineering at princeton offered his expertise in pages of american scientist noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in architectural theory mark concluded gould and lewontin s misapplication of term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy but dennett s critique of architectural basis of analogy goes even further astray because he slights technical rationale of architectural elements in question evolutionary progress gould favored argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long term progress uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress leading towards bigger faster and smarter organisms assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind gould argued that evolution s drive was not towards complexity but towards diversification because life is constrained to begin with a simple starting point like bacteria any diversity resulting from this start by random walk will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in direction of higher complexity but life gould argued can also easily adapt towards simplification as is often case with parasites ref gould s j 1996 full house spread of excellence from plato to darwin new york harmony books ref in a review of full house richard dawkins approved of gould s general argument but suggested that he saw evidence of a tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life by increasing numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes by this definition adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive it is deeply dyed in wool indispensably progressive cladistics gould never embraced cladistics as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of details in historical biology which he considered all important in early 1990s this led him into a debate with derek briggs who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to burgess shale fossils about methods to be used in interpreting these fossils gould s j 1991 disparity of burgess shale arthropod fauna and limits of cladistic analysis paleobiology 17 october 411 423 around this

his later work concentrated on west indian genus cerion according to gould cerion is land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout entire world there are 600 described species of this single genus in fact they re not really species they all interbreed but names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity some are shaped like golf balls some are shaped like pencils now my main subject is evolution of form and problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference so far as we can tell is a very interesting one

out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking ref these are first two paragraphs with notes from an unpublished letter to editor of new york review of books by leda cosmides and john tooby july 7 1997 they wrote in comment on two nyrb articles by gould june 12 and 26 john maynard smith one of world s leading evolutionary biologists recently summarized in nyrb sharply conflicting assessments of stephen jay gould because of excellence of his essays he has come to be seen by non biologists as pre eminent evolutionary theorist in contrast evolutionary biologists with whom i have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against creationists nyrb november 30 1995 p 46 no one can take any pleasure in evident pain gould is experiencing now that his actual standing within community of professional evolutionary biologists is finally becoming more widely known if what was a stake was solely one man s self regard common decency would preclude comment but as maynard smith points out more is at stake gould is giving non biologists a largely false picture of state of evolutionary theory or as ernst mayr says of gould and his small group of allies they quite conspicuously misrepresent views of biology s leading spokesmen indeed although gould characterizes his critics as anonymous and a tiny coterie nearly every major evolutionary biologist of our era has weighed in a vain attempt to correct tangle of confusions that higher profile gould has inundated intellectual world with point is not that gould is object of some criticism so properly are we all it is that his reputation as a credible and balanced authority about evolutionary

had commented on november 1995 review of his work by maynard smith gould darwinian fundamentalism new york review of books 44 june 12 1997 34 37 a false fact can be refuted a false argument exposed but how can one respond to a purely ad hominem attack this harder and altogether more discouraging task may best be achieved by exposing internal inconsistency and unfairness of rhetoric quotation of smith s criticism of gould november 1995 nyrb it seems futile to reply to an attack so empty of content and based only on comments by anonymous critics instead of responding to maynard smith s attack against my integrity and scholarship citing people unknown and with arguments unmentioned let me instead merely remind him of blatant inconsistency between his admirable past and lamentable present some sixteen years ago he wrote a highly critical but wonderfully supportive review of my early book of essays panda s thumb stating i hope it will be obvious that my wish to argue with gould is a compliment not a criticism he then attended my series of tanner lectures at cambridge in 1984 and wrote in a report for nature and under remarkable title paleontology at high table kindest and most supportive critical commentary i have ever received he argued that work of a small group of american had brought entire subject back to theoretical centrality within evolutionary sciences so we face enigma of a man who has written numerous articles amounting to tens of thousands of words about my work always strongly and critical always richly informed and always i might add enormously appreciated by me but now maynard smith needs to canvass unnamed colleagues to find out that my ideas are hardly worth bothering with he really ought to be asking himself why he has been bothering about my work so intensely and for so many years ref public debates between gould s supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed darwin wars by several commentators brown andrew 1999 darwin wars scientific battle for soul of man london simon schuster also john maynard smith eminent british evolutionary biologist was among gould s strongest critics maynard smith thought that gould misjudged vital role of adaptation in biology and was critical of gould s acceptance of species selection as a major component of biological evolution maynard smith john 1981 did

writing essays like these maynard smith john 1981 review of panda s thumb london review of books pp 17 30 reprinted as tinkering in his did darwin get it right new york chapman and hall 1989 pp 94 97 maynard smith was also among those who welcomed gould s reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology one reason for criticism was that gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution and argued for importance of mechanisms other than natural selection mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists as a result many non specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific which gould never tried to imply along with many other researchers in field gould s works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists as proof that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved wright robert 1999 accidental creationist why stephen j gould is bad for evolution new yorker 75 dec 13 56 65 gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works gould s j 1981 evolution as fact and theory discover 2 may 34 37 conflicts between richard dawkins and gould were popularized by philosopher kim sterelny in his 2001 book dawkins vs gould sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues including prominence of gene selection in evolution dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes or replicators while gould advocated multi level selection which includes selection amongst genes nucleic acid sequences cell lineages organisms demes species and clades dawkins accused gould of deliberately underplaying differences between rapid gradualism and macromutation in his published accounts of punctuated equilibrium dawkins richard 1998 unweaving rainbow boston houghton mifflin pp 196 197 it is when we ask what happens during sudden bursts of species formation that confusion arises gould is aware of difference between rapid gradualism and macromutation but he treats matter as though it were a minor detail to be cleared up after we have taken on board overarching question of whether evolution is episodic rather than gradual he also devoted entire chapters to critiquing gould s account of evolution in his books blind watchmaker and unweaving rainbow as did daniel dennett in his 1995 book darwin s dangerous idea cambrian fauna in his book wonderful life 1989 gould famously described cambrian fauna of burgess shale emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs their sudden appearance and role chance played in determining which members survived he used cambrian fauna as an example of role contingency has in shaping broader pattern of evolution his view of contingency was criticized by simon conway morris in his 1998 book crucible of creation conway morris stressed members of cambrian fauna that resemble modern taxa he also argued that convergent evolution has a tendency to produce similarities of organization and that forms of life are restricted and channelled in his book life s solution 2003 conway morris argued that appearance of human like animals is also likely conway morris simon 2003 life s solution inevitable humans in a lonely universe cambridge cambridge university press paleontologist richard fortey noted that prior to release of wonderful life conway morris shared a similar thesis to gould s but after wonderful life conway morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more deterministic position on history of life fortey richard 1998 shock lobsters london review of books 20 oct 1 paleontologists derek briggs and richard fortey have also argued that much of cambrian fauna may be regarded as stem groups of living taxa abstract though this is still a subject of intense research and debate and relationship of many cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in eyes of many palaeontologists kemp thomas 2016 origin of higher taxa chicago university of chicago press p 88 richard dawkins disagrees with view that new phyla suddenly appeared in cambrian arguing that for a new phylum to spring into existence what actually has to happen on ground is that a child is born which suddenly out of blue is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm no zoologist who thinks through implications not even most ardent saltationist has ever supported any such notion dawkins richard 1998 unweaving rainbow p 202 in structure of evolutionary theory gould stresses difference between phyletic splitting and large anatomical transitions noting that two events may be separated by millions of years gould argues that no paleontologist regards cambrian explosion as a genealogical event that is as actual time of initial splitting but rather it marks an anatomical transition in overt phenotypes of bilaterian organisms gould s j 2002 structure of evolutionary theory cambridge belknap press of harvard university press p 1156 opposition to sociobiology and evolutionary psychology gould also had a long running public feud with e o wilson and other evolutionary biologists concerning disciplines of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology both of which gould and lewontin opposed but which richard dawkins daniel dennett and steven pinker advocated gould s j 1997 evolution pleasures of pluralism new york review of books 44 june 26 47 52 these debates reached their climax in 1970s and included strong opposition from groups such as sociobiology study group and science for people wilson e o 2006 naturalist new york island press p 337 pinker accuses gould lewontin and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being radical scientists whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science gould stated that he made no attribution of motive in wilson s or anyone else s case but cautioned that all human beings are influenced especially unconsciously by our personal expectations and biases he wrote gould s primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality or their adaptive nature gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through culture as well and either hypothesis is equally plausible gould s j 1992 biological potentiality vs biological determinism in ever since darwin new york w w norton co pp 251 259 gould did not deny relevance of biology to human nature but reframed debate as biological potentiality vs biological determinism gould stated that human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors its flexibility permits us to be aggressive or peaceful dominant or submissive spiteful or generous violence sexism and general nastiness are biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors but peacefulness equality and kindness are just as biological and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish mismeasure of man gould was author of mismeasure of man 1981 a history and inquiry of psychometrics and intelligence testing generating perhaps greatest controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread 1981 mismeasure of man won national book critics circle award for non fiction it was voted as 17th greatest science book of all time by discover magazine vol 27 december 8 2006 9th best skeptic book by skeptics society frank diller scientists american scientist and ranked 24th place for best non fiction book by modern library and extensive criticism blinkhorn steve 1982 what nature 296 april 8 506 including claims of misrepresentation gould investigated methods of nineteenth century as well as history of psychological testing gould wrote that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in biological determinism view that social and economic differences between human groups primarily races classes and sexes arise from inherited inborn distinctions and that society in this sense is an accurate reflection of biology gould s j 1981 mismeasure of man new york w w norton co p 20 book was reprinted in 1996 with addition of a new foreword and a critical review of bell curve in 2011 a study conducted by six anthropologists criticized gould s claim that samuel morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements arguing that his analysis of morton was influenced by his opposition to racism gould s j 1978 morton s ranking of races by cranial capacity science 200 may 5 503 509 wade nicholas 2011 scientists measure accuracy of a racism claim new york times june 14 d4 group s paper was briefly reviewed in journal nature which recommended a degree of caution noting that while gould s opposition to racism might have biased his interpretation of morton s data paper s authors had biases of their own editorial 2011 mismeasure for mismeasure nature 474 june 23 419 in 2015 group s paper was critically reviewed in journal evolution development by philosopher of science michael who argued that gould s arguments were sound and that morton s initial measurements were indeed tainted by racial bias biologists and philosophers jonathan kaplan massimo and joshua banta also published a critique of groups s paper arguing that many of its claims were misleading and re measurements were irrelevant to an analysis of gould s arguments anthropologist paul wolff mitchell published an analysis of morton s original unpublished data which neither gould nor subsequent commentators had directly addressed and concluded that while gould s specific argument about morton s unconscious bias in measurement is not supported upon closer examination it was true as gould had claimed that morton s racial biases influenced how he reported and interpreted his measurements mitchell p w 2018 fault in his seeds lost notes to case of bias in samuel george morton s cranial race science public library of science biology 16 10 non overlapping magisteria in his book rocks of ages 1999 gould put forward what he described as a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to supposed conflict between science and religion gould s j 2002 rocks of ages science and religion in fullness of life new york ballantine books he defines term magisterium as a domain where one form of teaching holds appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution non overlapping magisteria noma principle therefore divides magisterium of science to cover empirical realm what universe is made of fact and why does it work in this way theory magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value these two magisteria do not overlap nor do they encompass all inquiry he suggests that noma enjoys strong and fully explicit support even from primary cultural stereotypes of hard line traditionalism and that noma is a sound position of general consensus established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria this view has not been without criticism however in his book god delusion richard dawkins argues that division between religion and science is not so simple as gould claims as few religions exist without claiming existence of miracles which by definition violate principles of science dawkins richard 2006 god delusion new york houghton mifflin harcourt p 83 dawkins also opposes idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values and therefore has no authority to claim a magisterium of its own he goes on to say that he believes gould is bending over backwards to be nice to an unworthy but powerful opponent dawkins richard 2006 god delusion new york houghton mifflin harcourt p 81 similarly humanist philosopher paul kurtz argues that gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about questions of ethics in fact kurtz claims that science is a much better method than religion for determining moral principles publications articles
