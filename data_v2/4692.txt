combining aspects of science fiction and horror story concerns a team of scientists who move into their new research facility a renovated victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted team investigate phenomena trying to determine if stones of building are acting as a recording medium for past events stone tape of play s title however their investigations serve only to unleash a darker more malevolent force stone tape was written by nigel kneale best known as writer of quatermass its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in kneale s work in particular his 1952 radio play you must listen about a haunted telephone line is a notable antecedent of stone tape play was also inspired by a visit kneale had paid to bbc s research and development department which was then located in an old victorian house in kingswood surrey critically acclaimed at time of broadcast it remains well regarded to this day as one of nigel kneale s best and most terrifying plays since its broadcast hypothesis of residual haunting that ghosts are recordings of past events made by natural environment has come to be known as stone tape theory plot summary peter brock michael bryant is selfish and petulant head of a research team for ryan electrics his team is developing a new recording medium that will give company an edge over its japanese competitors they move into a new facility at taskerlands an old victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use on arrival they learn from estates manager roy collinson iain cuthbertson that refurbishment of one of rooms in taskerlands remains uncompleted builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted room with its stone walls is a remnant of original building with foundations dating back to saxon era rest of mansion was added on over centuries curious researchers explore room and hear sounds of a woman running followed by a gut wrenching scream jill greeley jane asher an emotionally sensitive computer programmer has a vision of a woman running up steps in room and falling apparently to her death inquiring of old records collinson finds records of a young maid who had died in room in 1890 and that an unsuccessful exorcism had previously been performed on property brock and jill briefly meet with a local vicar who is also an archivist but he fails to turn up records of exorcism brock hypothesises that it is not a ghost but that somehow stone in room has preserved an image of girl s death this stone tape may be new recording medium they have been seeking their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of phenomena team experience and different team members experience different phenomena most are able to hear sounds jill can also see images but another member of team experiences no sensory input jill hypothesises that tape does not produce actual sound or light but instead interfaces with human nervous system during playback to create sensory impression of sound and vision and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others she surmises that recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion like a kind of telepathy excited by possibilities presented by a recording medium which uses a person s own senses as means of recording and playback brock and his team move into room they bombard it with their technology hoping to find secret of stone tape and have it play on demand brock is certain that secret is connected to walls but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering under mounting pressure to succeed brock uses every available instrumentation only to be told by jill that presence she had felt earlier was now gone apparently meaning that tape has been erased brock s failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him requiring him to share taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine embittered brock no longer wants anything to do with stone tape he disregards jill s insistence that there is still more to learn about room and her mounting concerns that it is dangerous to stop their research as brock directs team to resume its past projects vicar reappears claiming to have found records of unsuccessful exorcism not in 1892 but much earlier in 1760 before house even stood realizing that phenomenon occurring in room is far older than house jill theorizes that stone tape can be recorded over again and again like magnetic recording tape maid s death was simply most recent and clearest recording independently continuing her research jill realizes that maid s death was masking a much older recording left many thousands of years ago brock cruelly dismisses her findings and forces jill to take a two month leave to prevent her from continuing her research returning to room one last time jill s senses are besieged by a powerful malevolent presence from much degraded older recording like maid before her she dies while frantically trying to escape it during an inquest brock tries to save face by denouncing jill as having been mentally unstable afterwards he orders that all of jill s research be destroyed without reviewing it haunted room has been declared of historical importance by a preservation society prohibiting development destruction or commercial use he makes a final visit to room and discovers to his horror that stone tape has made a new crystal clear recording that of jill screaming his name as she dies background nigel kneale was a manx television playwright who had first come to prominence in 1950s thanks
