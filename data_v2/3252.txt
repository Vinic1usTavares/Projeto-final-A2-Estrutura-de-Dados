2007 van halen reunited with original lead singer david lee roth who had left band in april 1985 at peak of their global popularity for a north american tour this tour added bassist wolfgang van halen then 16 year old son of guitarist eddie van halen and actress valerie bertinelli forcing out original bassist michael anthony who would go on to form both and circle with van halen s second lead singer sammy hagar reunion tour consisted of 74 shows from september 2007 to june 2008 and became band s highest grossing tour of its thirty year history earning over 93 million eddie van halen was reluctant about possibility of recording new material with roth in 2009 citing poor reaction to three new songs recorded with hagar for 2004 compilation best of both worlds after wolfgang became enthusiastic about recording a new van halen album eddie s opinion changed we re doing this album for us thumb right bassist wolfgang van halen started work on album by searching through band s demo archives eddie wolfgang and alex van halen began jam sessions at former s 5150 studios three months after tour s completion during this time wolfgang discovered rough unreleased demos from band s archives after listening to these and believing they had potential he brought them to alex and eddie to rework and refine first of these tracks she s woman was completed by august 2009 it had originally been demoed by band in mid 1970s roth decided to join project after hearing this song as well as two other reworked tracks let s get rockin later renamed outta space and wolfgang s original intention with album was to create a collection of previously released b sides along with three reworked demos with eddie saying it would have been a record of our more hardcore songs and none of pop stuff that was initial plan but deeper we dug more we found at same time i was writing new songs dave got very excited about that we all did we ended up recording demos for 35 songs after deliberating over whether to self produce album or choose a producer from a list that included rick rubin and pat leonard roth suggested john shanks shanks liked first three songs and agreed to produce album working alongside wolfgang to pick demos that would be developed into album s tracks while all of van halen s albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150 roth persuaded band to work at henson recording studios where he had been recording for more than a decade recording and production by mid january 2011 band had moved into henson studios with shanks staff engineer martin cooke and engineer paul david hager band would record music for 12 hours a day five days a week with roth coming in to track his vocals at night instrumental tracks were completed within three weeks eddie said that he was relieved to relinquish some of production work to his son who was considered by band to be acting in a co production role frequently talking to shanks being consulted by his father on musical direction and developing songs along with creating new bits such as a new breakdown on she s woman as original ended up being used on fair warnings 1981 mean street and an arrangement for stay frosty wolfgang improvised some bass sections such as capo intro to chinatown by end of march 2011 band returned to finish record at 5150 with engineer ross hogarth most of work at 5150 was for guitars and bass as eddie couldn t hear them at henson way i m used to both he and hogarth felt that attempts at mixing there were not progressing due to sound quality issues eddie attributed this to tape machines at henson claiming that everything ended up sounding like it had a sock over it final mix took place over a period of six weeks in summer of 2011 with each song taking a day to mix hogarth indicated that because process was done at a mixing console we couldn t move on to next song until a mix had been approved by everyone and could go off desk hogarth would start with drums adding bass and guitar to finish a backing track which would be complemented with off different sections of a given part to different tracks and parallel compression it was then finished by bringing in roth s vocals backing vocals and further details such as ad libs screams and guitar solos hogarth aimed to bring ed s guitar sound into modern era but maintaining all dna of past he suggested that guitar sound be split naturally between stereo channels instead of separating lead guitar to left channel and panning effects to right by using two guitar amplifiers placed far apart idea was to have a guitar sound that was wide and mono and not digital delay driven and it s what you hear on record with only a few overdubs a more complex structure would be utilized for wolfgang s bass as band wanted a bass sound that covered whole spectrum from high to low and clean to dirty and his instrument was recorded by up to eight separate microphones a multi mic set up was also employed for alex s drums with most of final drumming coming from overhead microphones roth s vocals were all recorded at henson without compression composition and style a different kind of truth was described by roth as a sort of collaboration with van halen s past seven of album s tracks are based on material which roth suggested dated back to between 1975 and 1977 while eddie indicated that others had been composed when i was still in high school and even junior high blood and fire dates back to 1984 an instrumental version of song titled ripley appeared in eddie s score for film wild life original title had been inspired by ripley guitar used by eddie on demo and he sent that guitar back to steve ripley for repair so that it could be used on album version roth rewrote lyrics for most tracks as he wanted to incorporate a point of view from his current personal life he declared that all music is autobiographic particularly when it s not meant to be adding that by retooling songs there is a body of new that meets halfway there that i think makes very colorful sense only lead single tattoo contains a synthesizer which was played by roth two other songs you and your blues and as is have a processed guitar that sounds like a synth roth also performs acoustic guitar on intro for stay frosty a song he had written which was re arranged by wolfgang among effects units used by eddie on album were his signature model mxr phase 90 a whammy pedal and a wah wah pedal latter is prominently featured on kind of hendrix ish trouble with never release and packaging van halen amicably split from long time label warner bros records in 2002 although they would later sign a one record deal with label shortly afterwards for 2004 release best of both worlds band briefly entered into negotiations with columbia records but these stalled after roth indicated he would not sign with label in november 2011 band signed with interscope records after its chairman jimmy iovine became personally involved in negotiations tattoo was released as album s lead single on january 10 2012 one day after its release on itunes it was no 1 selling rock song in united states canada finland and netherlands
