work in 1980s some of lutyens finest memorials and tombs are to be found in mells and edward horner s memorial is one of lutyens best and most moving tributes to waste of life in great war in his public war memorials particularly cenotaph and various memorials based on it lutyens often used abstract and ecumenical designs feeling that a different form of architecture was needed to convey sense of sorrow at enormous loss of life where he was commissioned to commemorate an individual however lutyens was more open to conventional imagery such as a statue of an officer winter p 107 hussey p 474 according to tim skelton author of lutyens and great war 2008 horner statue is widely considered to be one of most moving of personal memorials to first world war lutyens original design for horner s memorial included pillars rising from plinth to enclose statue in a mausoleum but this part of proposal was not implemented pevsner p 555 munnings mould for statue is on display at munnings art museum

church at all thus it was placed in horner chapel on north side of chancel in 2007 it was moved to west end of north aisle as church trustees wished to create space to allow more flexible use of
