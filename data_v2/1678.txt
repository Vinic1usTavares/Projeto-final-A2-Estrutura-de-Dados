wheatley was drafted by new york giants in first round of 1995 nfl draft with seventeenth overall selection he held out for 17 days before signing a five year contract with team terms included a 2 3 million signing bonus and escalating base salaries totaling over 2 9 million negotiations were prolonged in part because of extensive family involvement wheatley set no goals for himself and lived by his grandmother s motto on preparing oneself you can set your sails but you can t set wind giants viewed wheatley as their running back of future since rodney hampton was in final year of his contract despite original visions wheatley was used sparingly and started only eight games over course of four seasons with giants off field wheatley moved his half brother with him to new jersey to keep him out of tumultuous environment and to provide him a strong learning environment in 1995 and 1996 under dan reeves giants had losing seasons and relied heavily on rodney hampton who received bulk of carries on rushing plays in 1995 running back herschel walker received more passing downs and in 1996 fullback charles way was a main weapon wheatley returned kickoffs for 1995 and 1996 with 10 returns for 18 6 yards per return in 1995 and 23 returns for 21 9 yards per return in 1996 while hampton led team in rushing with 827 yards to wheatley s 400 yards in 1996 wheatley s 503 return yards and 51 yards receiving gave him team all purpose yards leadership however wheatley had 6 fumbles on only 147 touches 112 rushes 12 receptions and 23 kickoff returns drafting of wheatley had been hotly contested some giant draft war room personnel had wanted to select korey stringer and others had an interest in rashaan salaam when giants selection came after wheatley was selected with seventeenth pick running backs napoleon kaufman james stewart and rashaan salaam were chosen with eighteenth nineteenth and twenty first selections respectively reeves made it no secret that he would have selected salaam over wheatley in draft wheatley s introduction to giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to training camp on time then in rookie season training camp he had misfortune of pulling a hamstring while running sprints on first day speculation had been that injury had occurred in a stumble in a june track meet reeves held prompt injury against running back he never wanted wheatley later fell asleep in a meeting which drew a fine from reeves although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting he also had mental concentration issues in practice he was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that giants had wheatley evaluated on top of this wheatley was fined several times for tardiness to team meetings jim fassel era 1997 1998 in 1997 by end of training camp rodney hampton s knees had given out and although wheatley had a great camp tiki barber was named starting tailback that season jim fassel s first giants went to playoffs with a 10 5 1 record wheatley led team in carries that season despite missing two games and shared responsibilities with way and barber on october 12 wheatley had his first 100 yard game with 102 yards on 22 carries against arizona cardinals in a 27 13 victory on road while wheatley and way divided rushing load barber and way divided most of responsibility for running backs role in passing attack while wheatley had less than half as many receptions and reception yards as either of them an ankle injury caused wheatley to miss final two regular season games and wild card playoff game by 1998 wheatley was only four year veteran in giants backfield and although he developed another good relationship with an offensive coordinator he was becoming accustomed to being described as an enigma giants fell to 8 8 while relying on barber way and gary brown during season wheatley often performed scout team duties and was inactive for some games fassel was not sympathetic to wheatley s desire for playing time and thought that wheatley was overweight over course of season there was controversy about a season long weight limit of that had been placed on wheatley wheatley s playing weight limit had been set at in training camp and had been raised to 235 on wheatley s request he had played at in final game of his college career by week 11 wheatley had only dressed in five games and played in four and was relegated to a role as an alternate when he played wheatley thought he was treated unfairly in new york although two different coaching staffs had issues with him he points out double standards that gave him bad feelings in retrospect in situations where he was not only giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as showing up at practice drunk or being cited for d u i were not vilified wheatley had responsibility of driving his brother leslie mongo to his school that opened at 8 15 and thought he was victim of new jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9 00 a m team meetings charles way by contrast wheatley s closest friend on team and roommate on road was nicknamed teacher s pet according to new york times there was a misperception of wheatley as a cancer in locker room by most accounts although he had some issues his teammates remembered him for his personality and mannerly nature general opinion of wheatley was that he was blessed with enormous talent but as a package he was an enigma according to michael strahan wheatley could outrun wide receivers outlift linemen and anyone thus his off season workout pattern of sloughing weights for discussion of politics and current affairs was troubling but not challenged because he could outlift most however in addition to enigmatic issues wheatley had physical problems in new york he was injured and unable to perform for parts of all four of training camps after 1998 season wheatley was traded to jimmy johnson s miami dolphins in february trade giants were satisfied receiving a seventh round draft pick in return oakland raiders dolphins hoped that wheatley would compete for starting tailback position with abdul karim al jabbar who had rushed for a league leading 15 touchdowns in 1997 but whose production had fallen off to only 6 in 1998 however wheatley was cut from miami dolphins training camp roster he had only gone through one week of dolphins training camp before being released making him available to raiders raiders signed wheatley on august 4 1999 to help make up for loss of zack crockett who suffered a broken foot ironically wheatley seventeenth overall selection in 1995 nfl draft earned his 1999 roster spot in a battle with rashaan salaam twenty first overall selection in 1995 nfl draft who had been dan reeves preferred draft choice in 1995 wheatley was paired in raiders backfield with napoleon kaufman eighteenth overall selection in 1995 nfl draft while in oakland wheatley would achieve much greater success than he had in new york wheatley rushed for 1 000 yards in a season led raiders in rushing three times appeared in three consecutive playoffs including one super bowl and finished in top 10 in nfl for rushing touchdowns twice through 2007 nfl season wheatley was seventh leading rusher in oakland raider history with 3 682 yards as a raider in his role as a raider wheatley was able to contribute to some of greatest memories in history of franchise seven of his eight career 100 yard rushing games came as a raider five of these games were at oakland coliseum and two were on road against seattle seahawks none of these games came in playoffs where his highest rushing total was 56 yards jon gruden era 1999 2001 thumb right jon gruden s west coast offense brought out best in veterans like wheatley how well wheatley complemented napoleon kaufman in oakland was quickly evident to new york media and his newfound success was noticed when giants had an impotent running game in his absence in his early years with raiders wheatley quickly made good on promise of his potential with a combination of power to run inside and speed to run outside wheatley was quite popular in oakland players liked him and his coach jon gruden even joked with him during his interviews on field wheatley became an important part of a surprisingly efficient west coast offense run by jon gruden in 1999 wheatley was raiders leading rusher and their only running back to have more than one touchdown reception for first time wheatley had multiple 100 yard games in same season 100 yards on 20 rushes on october 3 against seattle seahawks and 111 yards on 19 rushes on december 19 against tampa bay buccaneers players gelled as a unit and not only did wheatley have his best seasons in oakland but also long time nfl veterans on raiders amassed their best season upon his arrival for example rich gannon an nfl veteran quarterback since 1987 made his first four pro bowl appearances with wheatley as a weapon team only compiled an 8 8 record however wheatley had best season of his career in 2000 as raiders went 12 4 and reached american football conference championship game of 2000 01 nfl playoffs wheatley amassed 1 046 yards rushing and 9 touchdowns on 232 carries and added 20 receptions for 156 yards wheatley combined effectively with kaufman to form an inside and outside attacking combination in these first two years wheatley s 4 5 yards per carry ranked ninth in nfl not only did wheatley amass a career high three 100 yard rushing games that season but he also had his three highest career single game performances 156 yards on only 15 carries on october 22 at home against seattle seahawks 146 yards on december 16 at seattle and 112 yards on november 5 against kansas city chiefs 100 yard performances against seattle were his second and third in his first four games against them as a raider in playoffs wheatley only posted a total of 63 yards rushing on 31 carries and one reception for four yards in two home playoff games on january 6 2001 wheatley posted what would turn out to be his career seven career games playoff high 56 yards rushing and his only playoff touchdown in january 14 conference championship against baltimore ravens he only rushed for 7 yards on 12 carries in 2001 with arrival of jerry rice and charlie garner offense focused on passing game running five more pass attempts per game than year before team produced two 1 000 yard receivers with rice amassing 1 139 yards and tim brown totaling 1 165 yards garner led team in rushing and accumulated 72 receptions meanwhile wheatley only started three games and accumulated only 12 receptions over course of season for first time as a raider wheatley went an entire season without a 100 yard rushing game team went 10 6 and returned to 2001 02 nfl playoffs but wheatley only had 88 carries during regular season despite tying zack crockett for running back leadership with 6 touchdowns in first round wild card game wheatley posted his second highest playoff total of 37 yards in wheatley s first and only career road playoff game he only posted five yards rushing on four carries bill callahan era 2002 2003 under new coach bill callahan 2002 raiders became more reliant on garner as primary running back again rice and brown were primary targets for gannon who while having his best season with 4 689 yards did not use wheatley as a receiver as much as other players wheatley had more carries than in 2001 but did not start a single game and did not see end zone often again wheatley went an entire season without a 100 yard rushing game however as a role player he was able to play in three 2002 03 playoff games including 2003 super bowl against former coach gruden as in his previous seasons wheatley posted his best playoff numbers in his first game this time 30 yards on only four carries a week later on january 19 2003 wheatley had his final post season carry a 5 yard run on his only carry of game in super bowl xxxvii on january 26 wheatley s only touch came on a seven yard reception although raiders did not win super bowl tyrone wheatley was re signed in 2003 wheatley reclaimed his role as raiders leading rusher although garner second leading rusher continued to be target of more passes and crockett made it to end zone as a rusher as often as wheatley and garner combined wheatley became sixth person to lead raiders franchise in rushing yards three times clem daniels marv hubbard mark van marcus allen napoleon kaufman 2003 raiders fell to 4 12 and had no 1 000 yard receivers or runners wheatley s only 100 yard rushing game came on november

who took his picture norv turner era 2004 although wheatley s 2003 performance had been modest compared with other seasons that he led raiders in rushing 1999 2000 it was sufficient to convince raiders that they did not need to re sign pass catching running back charlie garner for 2004 season with new coach norv turner 2004 raiders used a platoon of five runners wheatley crockett justin
