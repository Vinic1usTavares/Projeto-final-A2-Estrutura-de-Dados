via clifton down station to ashley hill junction east of montpelier from which great western and midland lines diverged great western heading south joining bristol and south wales union railway towards bristol temple meads midland heading east towards line was built at standard gauge and was initially managed by clifton extension railway joint committee station was built by messrs baker son of canon s marsh bristol there were two platforms with southern platform used by trains towards clifton down and northern one by trains in other direction platforms were long and spacious but open to elements with little in way of cover an iron footbridge linked two platforms as well as carrying a pedestrian right of way between cromwell road to north and station road to south original station buildings were built from pennant stone a common material in bristol area and partly obtained from digging of a cutting near clifton down station master had lodgings above waiting rooms on southern platform which had separate ticket windows for midland and great western services buildings on northern platform were principally waiting rooms a goods yard was provided on south side of station road mainly used for coal traffic and accessible from west via a bridge over road a signal box with 16 levers was located at west end of southern platform controlling yard and crossover points on main line there was some debate about whether station should be called montpelier or montpellier but joint railway committee overseeing line ruled in favour of former in 1888 in 1895 a petition was submitted to joint railway committee asking for better cover for platforms improved waiting rooms and a new booking office on northern platform committee agreed to extend canopy on northern platform and to improve waiting rooms but refused to build a new booking office work was completed in 1896 further building work took place during first world war when southern platform was extended thumb looking east along

clifton and fishponds or mangotsfield midland services were suspended from 1 january 1917 to 15 may 1919 due to war section of bristol port railway and pier closed in 1922 so to compensate an additional six trains were provided to avonmouth with four back in 1923 grouping resulted in midland railway being absorbed into london midland and scottish railway lms and line continued in a joint

bristol but services were at regular intervals passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as result of a fare increase and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted which lost more

western passenger franchise of which services at montpelier are a part beyond 2013 citing a desire for a longer term contract due to impending upgrade to great western main line franchise was put out

2013 and subsequently extended until march 2019 with upgrade to great western main line main line from london to bristol was due to be electrified by 2016 however electrification was never intended to extend beyond main lines and electrification into bristol temple meads was indefinitely delayed in 2016 so montpelier will continue to be served by diesel trains with sprinter units replaced by and turbo units stephen williams mp for bristol west questioned whether electrification could continue to montpelier and rest of severn beach line then secretary of state for transport philip hammond replied that it would have to be looked at in future group friends of suburban bristol railways supports electrification of entire severn beach line improved services at montpelier are called for as part of greater bristol metro scheme a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in bristol area there is an aspiration for half hourly services with trains towards bristol terminating alternately at and however due to large sections of severn beach line which are single track and to congested main line from temple meads such frequency is not currently feasible scheme was given go ahead in july 2012 as part of city deal whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by government there are also calls for reopening of henbury loop line which could allow a direct service from montpelier to via avonmouth plans for a loop were rejected by west of england joint transport board however bristol city councillors voted to send decision back to board
