thumb upright 1 14 traditional general aviation fixed wing light aircraft most numerous class of aircraft in sector general aviation in united kingdom has been defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation although international civil aviation organization icao excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition some commercial operations are often included within scope of general aviation ga in uk sector operates business jets rotorcraft piston and jet engined fixed wing aircraft gliders of all descriptions and lighter than air craft public transport operations include business or corporate aviation and air taxi services and account for nearly half of economic contribution made by sector other commercial ga activities are aerial work such as surveying and air ambulances and flight training which plays an important role in supply of pilots to commercial air transport cat industry private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation it includes a strong vintage aircraft movement and encompasses a range of air sports such as racing aerobatics and parachuting at which british teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition of 21 000 civil aircraft registered in uk 96 per cent are engaged in ga operations and annually ga fleet accounts for between 1 25 and 1 35 million hours flown single most common class of aircraft is fixed wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga but main area of growth over last 20 years has been in use of more affordable aircraft such as microlights amateur built aeroplanes and smaller helicopters there are 28 000 private pilot licence holders and 10 000 certified glider pilots some of 19 000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in ga activities although ga operates from more than 1 800 aerodromes and landing sites ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips over 80 per cent of ga activity is conducted at 134 of larger aerodromes ga industry which is around 7 per cent size of its cat cousin employs 12 000 people and contributes ps1 4 billion to uk economy ga is regulated by civil aviation authority caa although regulatory powers are being increasingly transferred to european aviation safety agency easa main focus is on standards of airworthiness and pilot licensing and objective is to promote high standards of safety at lighter end of ga spectrum some regulatory authority is devolved to representative bodies and gliding is in transition from a self regulatory model to more formal governance by easa airspace regulation necessary to protect an increasing number of cat operations has reduced area in which ga flights can be freely conducted growth in cat is also making access to larger airports more difficult for ga sector and smaller aerodromes are vulnerable to closure and re development for more profitable uses uk planning system has no remit to consider national significance of ga public transport operations and generally does not favour development of smaller aerodromes catering to ga market planning process has become a mechanism for addressing local aerodrome related environmental issues which particularly regarding noise are main subjects of public criticism levelled at ga definitions thumb left business aviation is a commercial activity that is considered part of ga sector international civil aviation organization icao defines general aviation ga as an aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport operation or an aerial work operation it defines commercial air transport cat as an aircraft operation involving transport of passengers cargo or mail for remuneration or hire and aerial work as an aircraft operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture construction photography surveying observation and patrol search and rescue aerial advertisement etc organisations in united kingdom uk describe ga in less restrictive terms that include elements of commercial aviation british business and general aviation association interprets it to be all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by major airlines and armed services general aviation awareness council applies description all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire for purposes of a strategic review of ga in uk civil aviation authority caa defined scope of ga as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule and considered it necessary to depart from icao definition and include aerial work and minor cat operations this article uses caa description to define scope of general aviation in uk on basis that this organisation is regulatory body for aviation in uk and publisher of a key source history thumb amy johnson and her de havilland dh 60 moth jason first aerodrome in uk was established by aero club at muswell manor on isle of sheppey and in may 1909 it was venue of first flight conducted in country by a british pilot john moore brabazon 16 october 1908 flight at farnborough by american samuel f cody is officially recognised as first powered aeroplane flight in britain in 1910 aero club was granted royal prefix took responsibility for controlling all private flying in uk and started issuing first british pilot licences introduction of de havilland dh 60 moth in 1925 revolutionised light aviation and royal aero club recognising vital necessity of promoting civil flying formed light aeroplane club scheme between 1925 and 1939 around 60 flying clubs were started and more than 5 000 pilots were trained during world war ii civil aerodromes were taken over for military use existing military airfields were expanded and new ones were built this resulted in a significant inventory of facilities becoming available after war pre war civil aerodromes for example sywell were returned to civilian use surplus military airfields were closed and in some cases for example beccles subsequently re opened as civil aerodromes ministry of civil aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in uk and this task remained responsibility of government departments until establishment of independent caa in 1972 with an expanded infrastructure in place ga became established after war when manufacturers such as cessna and piper introduced light aircraft designed for private market cessna 172 developed from late 1940s cessna 170 was introduced in 1956 and became world s best selling single engine aeroplane single piston engine aircraft are still most common class of aircraft in uk ga fleet development of rogallo wing in 1950s fostered development of hang gliding during 1960s and 1970s 1960s also saw experiments with motorised hang gliders but it was not until 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature resulting in birth of microlight movement another milestone in development of ga was 1964 introduction of learjet 23 although it was not first business jet it popularised corporate aviation and established personal jet as a whole new class of aircraft activities thumb right fixed wing microlight thumb right air creation weight shift microlight thumb right development of robinson r22 has made recreational helicopter flying more affordable thumb right miss demeanour privately owned hawker hunter ga sector operates a range of aircraft including balloons and airships gliders hang gliders microlights helicopters amateur built and mass produced light aircraft ex military aircraft and business jets flights can be broadly categorised as public transport aerial work and private flying first two of which are commercial activities commercial operations commercial operations are remunerated activities which fall within icao definition of cat some are however closely aligned to and considered part of ga sector public transport operations are non scheduled on demand services flying between points specified by customer providing a more flexible service than airline travel air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties and business or corporate aviation uses company owned aircraft to transport employees and clients aircraft used in these operations include business jets helicopters and twin piston engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people an example of this type of operation is transport by helicopter of spectators to british formula one grand prix at silverstone this involves so many flights that according to cranfield aviation services on race day heliport is temporarily world s busiest airport aerial work is a small but important component of commercial ga sector characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non transport activities such as surveying crop spraying and emergency services work air ambulance and police flying schools flying schools are commercial businesses engaged in training of pilots both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally they make widespread use of fixed wing light aircraft associated with traditional ga not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights school owned aircraft account for a significant amount of ga activity both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements pilot training element is regarded by ga community as a key benefit that is critical to supply of pilots for airline industry it is claimed by general aviation awareness council that 60 70 per cent of professional pilots have self financed their flight training at ga schools and one uk airline operator has stated that industry must rely on 70 80 per cent of new pilots coming from ga sector publication is undated but is reported in july 2001 edition of european business air news caa estimates that between 1996 and 2006 number of new professional pilots following unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of uk and that airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy ga sector in uk for its supply of pilots caa concludes that a severe reduction in ga would give some merit to argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened but that data on flying hours does not support such a gloomy outlook of course reliance on other countries for pilot training means that uk economic benefit of training activity private flying private flying can be for both recreational purposes and personal transport using aircraft that are owned individually collectively as part of a syndicate or rented from a flying club a survey of pilots conducted between 2001 and 2002 indicated that most common purposes of recreational flights were local flights near base aerodrome visits to other aerodromes and day trips away half of all flights landed at same aerodrome they departed from and only 9 per cent involved an overnight stay away from home private flying is most associated with traditional form of factory produced two and four seater single piston engine training and touring aircraft examples of these are cessna 152 cessna 172 and piper pa28 cherokee all with their origins in 1950s and more modern designs of cirrus average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be compared to an estimated ps77 per hour for gliders and a reported ps35 per hour for microlights recent trends have seen an increase in use of microlights and also in recreational helicopter flying following introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as robinson r22 and r44 another growth area in private flying in recent years has been in use of amateur built aircraft such as van s aircraft rv 4 and europa there is a strong vintage aircraft movement in uk with two thirds of 500 registered historic aircraft active these cover whole spectrum of civil and military aviation examples being de havilland dragon rapide airliner of 1930s and world war ii wwii spitfire fighter there are many post wwii aircraft which could also be considered historic under a looser definition including for example 60 ex military jets such as hawker hunter historic aircraft are regular exhibits at air displays which are claimed to be second most popular spectator activity after football in uk sports thumb right gliders at 2004 standard class nationals race competitive gliding in uk takes place between may and september regionals are local competitions organised and run by one of bigger gliding clubs in region and represent entry level to glider racing races are handicapped according to glider performance and normally take place over nine days success in regionals allows pilots to progress to nationals where there are five classes of competition these are based on glider performance lowest being club class and then progressing through standard maximum wingspan and flaps not permitted as standard but flaps are permitted maximum wingspan and finally open class no restrictions success at national level can lead to a place in national team and competition at international level in 2007 british gliding team was ranked number one and british pilots took two women

with all aircraft diving for finish line together there are up to 16 races per year conducted at airfields in uk france and channel islands for prizes that include schneider trophy and king s cup and season culminates with british air racing and european air racing championships thumb left extra 300 unlimited class aerobatic aircraft aerobatic competitions take place for both powered aircraft and gliders with up to 30 events each year in uk and ireland starting at beginner level pilots can move up to standard powered aircraft or sports glider levels and then on to intermediate advanced and finally unlimited classes each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from aircraft national championships are awarded annually at standard sports intermediate advanced powered aircraft only and unlimited levels and pilots who have reached advanced and unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent uk in international competition parachute competitions are held at club regional national and international levels and include disciplines of accuracy landings freefall gymnastics formation skydiving canopy formation freestyle and

collective term for any location from which flying operations take place although more specific terminology can be used to characterise its purpose caa strategic review of ga applies term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations and airfield to locations which predominantly support ga operations general aviation small aerodrome research study gasar analysed 687 aerodromes in england which come under scope of ga classifying 374 into six types these range in size from regional airports to smallest farm strip although 84 per cent of ga flights operate from 134 of larger aerodromes in first four categories of 687 aerodromes 113 were used for glider microlight balloon and operations which were nowhere described in detail and could not therefore be included in classification analysis and 200 sites were identified as helipads a distinct category without further need for classification analysis according to requirements of study leaving 374 which were included in classification analysis gasar aerodrome classification factors used in determining how an individual aerodrome is categorised by gasar study are based broadly on size and facilities six types of aerodrome are described in size order as regional airports e g east midlands major ga airports e g oxford developed ga airfields e g andrewsfield basic ga airfields e g developed airstrips e g and basic airstrips e g in hampshire actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex using 28 different parameters backed up with a peer review by experienced ga pilots thumb left andrewsfield classified by gasar as a developed ga airfield airports generally have long fully lit hard surfaced runways full air traffic control and navigation and landing aids they are usually located on urban fringes support commercial and business operations and often exclude certain types of light aircraft at more rurally located airfields lighter end of aviation such as microlight and gliding activities becomes increasingly prevalent and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools at this level runways are generally shorter and grass surfaces are increasingly common navigation aids are increasingly scarce being more basic where they are available and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control smallest airfields are too small to feature on general purpose ordnance survey os maps and lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities although presence of a hangar is not uncommon at larger examples they do not feature on os maps and are owned by private clubs or more commonly individuals aerodrome licensing most aerodromes used for public transport operations are required to be licensed by caa to be granted a licence an aerodrome operator must satisfy caa that physical conditions at aerodrome and its environs are acceptable scale of equipment and facilities provided are adequate for flying activities which are expected to take place an effective safety management system is in place and that staff are competent and where necessary suitably qualified aerodromes classified as developed ga airfields or larger by gasar study are with few exceptions licensed only two basic ga airfields silverstone and duxford are licensed and all airstrips are unlicensed light aviation airports study group a joint caa industry initiative was established in 2005 to review regulation of light aviation aerodromes a particular focus of this group was a review of restrictions placed on unlicensed aerodromes group concluded that requirement for public transport operations to be conducted only from licensed aerodromes should be further reviewed in context of corresponding international and european requirements it also recommended that restrictions on flight training at unlicensed aerodromes should be lifted and this was permitted from april 2010 scale of sector thumb right there are 7 000 hang gliders registered in uk there are an estimated 27 000 civil aircraft registered in uk 96 per cent of which are engaged in ga activities in 2005 ga fleet comprised 9 000 fixed wing aircraft 4 100 microlights 1 300 helicopters 1 800 airships balloons 2 500 gliders and some 7 000 hang gliders estimates put number of foreign registered ga aircraft based in uk at 900 number of pilots licensed by caa to fly powered aircraft in 2005 was 47 000 of whom 28 000 held a private pilot licence remainder held professional pilot licences either a commercial pilot licence or an airline transport pilot licence although not all of these would be engaged in ga activities in addition there are 10 000 active glider pilots and estimates put membership of aviation related sport and recreational associations at 36 000 number of aerodromes that support ga in uk is difficult to establish with certainty 2008 united kingdom flight guide lists 355 and flight equipment uk vfr flight guide 2008 lists nearly 500 farm strips and private airfields flight guide lists more than 300 landing sites gasar study estimates 1 100 formal flying sites in england alone a figure which includes 400 sites known to planning authorities but not included in flight guides it estimates another 759 informal sites known only to land owners customs and members of enthusiast group air britain sector was estimated to employ nearly 12 000 people and directly contribute ps1 4 billion to uk economy in 2005 making it roughly seven per cent of size of cat industry nearly half of economic contribution was generated by business aviation trends thumb left number of registered twin piston engined aircraft is on decline most sectors of ga for which data are available have experienced growth in aircraft numbers and hours flown over last two decades lighter end of ga spectrum microlights amateur built and airships and balloons have in particular shown strong growth although last of these activities was severely curtailed during foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 when access to farmland was denied after strong growth in late 1980s traditional flying has shown a slight decline recently reflecting a move amongst recreational flyers towards microlight aircraft and increased numbers of foreign registered aircraft recreational helicopter usage has grown primarily due to introduction of smaller and cheaper aircraft glider activity has remained relatively static although there has been a gradual increase in number of self launching motor gliders business aviation has shown strong growth although numbers of aircraft on uk register have declined this reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign registered business jets based in uk which are estimated to be growing in numbers however twin piston engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly reflecting pressures on light air taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services and a more sophisticated corporate charter business amount of flight training conducted by uk schools has declined largely at hands of competition from foreign schools which benefit from lower costs and better weather since 1990 total number of hours flown annually by ga sector has remained in range 1 25 1 35 million dominant sector being traditional ga flying which accounts for 0 6 million per year an overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002 decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that economic health of ga industry is weakening though lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm regulation thumb right van s aircraft rv 4 amateur built aircraft thumb right a british warbird grace spitfire thumb right de havilland dragon rapide vintage aircraft thumb right mass balloon ascent at bristol international balloon fiesta objective of regulation is to promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation and this is main area of interaction between caa and ga sector efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness pilot qualification rules for movement of aircraft and equipment to be carried caa was established as primary regulatory body for all aviation in uk in 1972 in 1991 it started working within joint aviation authorities jaa framework to implement agreed common standards known as joint aviation requirements jar throughout european union eu in 2003 this was taken a step further when european aviation safety agency easa was established as central eu regulator taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from national authorities caa acts as an agency of easa on these issues retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to easa proposed developments seek to establish easa as single authority throughout eu taking over from individual member states power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from scope of easa devolved and self regulation within this framework certain sectors of ga are governed on a devolved basis in all cases caa easa retains responsibility for safety regulation but representative bodies particularly of sectors that are not included in scope of easa are granted greater oversight of their activities majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by british microlight aircraft association bmaa although a significant number are regulated by light aircraft association laa formerly known as popular flying association laa is primary regulator for amateur built aircraft as well as vintage and classic aircraft parachuting is governed by british parachute association although aircraft used in this activity are generally caa regulated balloon and airship flying is overseen by british balloon and airship club uk specific national private pilot licence nppl is administered by national pilots licensing group ltd supported by laa aircraft owners and pilots association uk british gliding association and british microlight aircraft association separate from these devolved groups gliding in uk is self regulated british gliding association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness now formally regulated as a result of easa legislation and still retains control of pilot certification hang gliding and paragliding activities i e foot launched gliders are governed by british hang gliding and paragliding association airworthiness under caa and easa rules all aircraft are required to meet certain standards of airworthiness to fly safely and legally aircraft that meet these standards are issued with a certificate of airworthiness however british registered aircraft which are excluded from scope of easa and which cannot satisfy requirements for issue of a certificate of airworthiness may be issued with a permit to fly this allows them to fly in uk airspace subject to certain limitations for example being restricted to day time flights under visual flight rules only a number of organisations e g british microlight aircraft association and light aircraft association have obtained a standing over flight permission for permit to fly aircraft within their area of interest with some european countries notably france permits are typically issued to vintage and historic aircraft amateur built aircraft and microlights pilot licensing pilot qualification most relevant to ga is private pilot licence ppl which permits holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration in addition to european wide joint aviation regulations flight crew licensing jar fcl standard caa also issues uk specific national licences in absence of european standards for gyroplane balloon and airship pilots caa licenses these according to original uk ppl standard as a response to perception that jar pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for purposes of recreational pilots national private pilot licence nppl was introduced in 2002 nppl is easier to obtain than jar fcl licence has less stringent medical requirements is more restrictive in privileges it grants and is valid only for flights in british registered aircraft flying in uk and french airspace although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within regulatory framework of easa gliding sector is currently self regulating in this respect british gliding association is responsible for defining standards of initial training and certifying via a badge system pilots who meet those standards pilots working in sectors of ga that are commercial operations such as aerial work and business aviation are required to hold a professional pilot licence which at a minimum is commercial pilot licence safety thumb upright between 1995 and 2004 there were 2 630 accidents involving ga aircraft of which 139 were fatal resulting in loss of 317 lives majority of accidents involved small fixed wing aircraft engaged in private flights and analysis attributes most common causes of these to flight handling skills poor judgement or lack of training or experience and omission of or inappropriate action accident statistics 1995 2004 type total accidents fatal accidents total fatalities aeroplane 1 622 107 196 helicopter 246 31 71 balloon 49 1 1 airship n a not available source provides number of fatalities for gliders and microlights but not number of fatal accidents 1 0 0 glider 430 38 gyroplane 31 8 microlight 251 23 totals 2 630 139 317 there were 27 fatal accidents involving ga aircraft in 2007 resulting in loss of 48 lives these compare with 16 accidents claiming a total of 19 lives previous year and although 2007 statistics are higher than average they are not exceptional issues growth in commercial air transport cat has eroded operational freedom of ga both in air and on ground at larger airports difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a decline in number of aerodromes generally and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re development for more profitable uses uk planning system is designed to focus on local issues and consideration of national impact of ga operations is not within its remit this makes aerodrome development difficult often subjecting those that successfully negotiate process to restrictions in use airspace access thumb right in controlled airspace above birmingham airport airspace is shared by cat military and ga users it is divided into controlled airspace in which aircraft must always be under control of an air traffic controller and uncontrolled airspace in which aircraft can operate autonomously although ga flights can under certain conditions enter controlled airspace they operate mainly outside of it controlled airspace is essential for provision of a known air traffic environment necessary for safe operation of cat a caa review found that mixing commercial operations with other users is considered undesirable even untenable by commercial operators however this position has resulted in extensive class a controlled airspace with complex boundaries including some running down to ground prohibiting vfr access to airspace resulting in high numbers of ga flights operating close to borders of controlled airspace who could not get formal receipt of an air traffic service coupled with pilot navigation errors hundreds of airspace infringements have been recorded every year increases in number of cat operations and in number of airports they operate from has resulted in a corresponding increase in class a controlled airspace between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above england and wales leading to a perception within ga community of being squeezed out there are particular problems for ga around large airports where class a controlled airspace extends down to 2 concentration of commercial operations and high demand for ga in south east of england have also resulted in extensive areas of class a controlled airspace there which serve to channel uncontrolled ga operations through high collision risk hot spots aerodrome access thumb right light aircraft parked at london gatwick airport in 1961 before it became a cat giant regional airports such as edinburgh airport have experienced strong growth in cat operations in recent years these operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with ga and although there is no evidence of deliberate discrimination effect has been to discourage or exclude it ga aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges including imposition of handling fees in some cases some airports restrict or deny ga parking and others limit or refuse certain ga activity as a result light ga aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large busy international airports such as heathrow stansted gatwick and manchester in addition to this de facto loss of facilities number of aerodromes in uk has been in decline over last 50 years as a result of increasing urbanisation and closure of airfields built during wwii alternative and more profitable uses for land can also lead to existing aerodromes being threatened with closure for example north weald or actually being closed as happened to ipswich airport north weald is waiting on a decision concerning closure and re development for residential purposes ipswich airport was closed in 1996 and land turned over to residential re development and bristol filton airport referring to importance of a functioning national network of ga airfields especially where ga performs an air transport role caa states that there could be cause for concern if a significant further loss of airfields were to continue especially if crucial nodes on transport network were to be lost crucial nodes are aerodromes for which there are no nearby alternatives and loss of which may have a greater effect nationally or in terms of regional economic development than would be considered if only assessing local effect planning system planning system is critical to viability and operation of ga aerodromes with many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them and with ga access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive a viable network of aerodromes supporting ga air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue however there is no unified national planning policy specific to ga aerodromes and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider national impact because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through planning process and this issue is principal factor on which majority of planning decisions relating to ga land use are made ga is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to local planning authorities and most planning decisions relating to ga either refuse permission or grant it with restrictive conditions little gransden is just one example of a ga airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on number of movements permitted thereby inhibiting further development such restrictions if poorly conceived can make ga operations unviable or even unsafe criticism thumb right upright parachute dropping is just one of ga activities that generate noise complaints public opinion towards aviation generally is worsening based on increasing environmental concerns relating to emissions and noise and private flying has been criticised by respondents to a government consultation on aircraft noise as a frivolous or selfish activity in terms of environmental complaints and enquiries made to caa that relate specifically to ga noise is by far most common subject half of 2 000 noise complaints made annually to caa concern ga operations most of which relate to aerobatics helicopters using private sites air balloon incidents parachute dropping and alleged low flying planning guidance on aircraft noise advises that in some circumstances public perceive general aircraft noise levels as more disturbing than similar levels around major airports this is a result of tonal characteristics of light aircraft engines and activities they are engaged in including repetitive circuit flying at low altitude near an aerodrome during which aircraft are audible for long periods slow climbing aircraft engaged in parachute drop or glider tug activities concentrated around drop zone or aerodrome also audible for long periods erratic and repetitive engine noise from aircraft engaged in aerobatics and piston engines on full power in areas of low background noise leading to perception that such noise is more intrusive in an attempt to alleviate these problems majority of aerodromes implement noise abatement procedures designed to route aircraft away from noise sensitive areas and more than 50 are required by government to provide consultative facilities in which local concerns can be raised with aerodrome operators see also general aviation in europe references category aviation in united kingdom united kingdom
