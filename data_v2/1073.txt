typhoon ma on known in philippines as typhoon ineng was a large and powerful typhoon that affected southern japan in july 2011 it was sixth named storm and second typhoon of 2011 pacific typhoon season originating from an area of low pressure near wake island on july 9 precursor to ma on gradually developed as it moved westward by july 11 it had become sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression although cyclone s circulation remained broad over following days ma on gradually intensified and attained typhoon status on july 14 favorable environmental conditions allowed for additional strengthening and storm ultimately attained peak ten minute sustained winds of 175 km h 110 mph on july 16 after turning northward in response to a weakening subtropical ridge typhoon underwent a series of eyewall replacement cycles that caused it to weaken on july 19 ma on struck shikoku before turning southeastward and moving back over water slow weakening continued as ma on succumbed to effects of high wind shear system ultimately became extratropical on july 24 and was last noted by japan meteorological agency a week later near kamchatka peninsula initially ma on posed a slight threat to mariana islands and prompted issuance of tropical storm warnings however system remained far away from area and only produced scattered rainfall in japan hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide prone areas torrential rains produced by storm estimated at more than 1 200 mm 48 in led to widespread and damaging floods five people perished as a result of ma on and damage reached y 3 9 billion 2011 jpy 50 million 2011 usd meteorological history origins of ma on were from an area of convection that meandered near wake island on july 9 disturbance slowly consolidated and developed a low level circulation based on presence of low wind shear and generally favorable environmental conditions tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated that system would develop into a tropical cyclone early on july 11 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and a few hours later japan meteorological agency jma reported formation of a tropical depression about halfway between wake island and northern marianas islands jtwc followed suit and initiated advisories on tropical depression 08w depression tracked westward due to a ridge to its north its circulation was initially broad and ill defined with patches of disorganized convection due to dry air depression was able to intensify due to generally favorable conditions and jma upgraded depression to tropical storm ma on at 0600 utc on july 12 gradually thunderstorms became concentrated around center despite restricted outflow to north and west ma on intensified at a slower than climatological rate although an eye feature became evident by early on july 13 at 0000 utc that day jma upgraded ma on to a severe tropical storm and 24 hours later storm intensified into a typhoon to northeast of northern marianas by that time it was also located about 970 km 575 mi southeast of iwo jima a ragged eye became apparent on satellite imagery and after developing an anticyclone aloft its outflow became much better defined by july 15 typhoon ma on had a well defined eye with strongest convection in its southern periphery it continued intensifying and jtwc estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 220 km h 135 mph late on july 15 ma on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear which caused its eyewall to break apart in northwest quadrant it re intensified next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced at 0600 utc on july 16 jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 175 km h 110 mph while typhoon was located about 1185 km 735 mi southeast of okinawa around that time ma on began a motion to northwest due to a weakening of subtropical ridge and it briefly entered area warned by philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa agency gave it local name ineng late on july 17 ma on underwent another eyewall replacement cycle and weakened despite developing improved outflow and convection in northern quadrant typhoon s large size prevented re intensification gale force winds extended 370 km 200 mi east of center in addition intrusion of dry air diminished thunderstorms in western periphery by july 18 ma on reached western extent of ridge and began a motion to north toward japan next day it turned to northeast as it paralleled japan coastline just offshore at around 1400 utc on july 19 ma on made landfall on shikoku as a minimal typhoon turning to east typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm before moving over southern tip of kii peninsula early on july 20 after emerging from country ma on turned to southeast increased wind shear displaced convection to east although slight re intensification was expected however jtwc downgraded ma on to a tropical depression on july 21 after storm lost much of its convection circulation became ill defined and jtwc discontinued advisories on july 22 noting system was in process of dissipation however jma maintained ma on as a severe tropical storm until july 23 by which time storm had turned to northeast storm became extratropical on july 24 near kuril islands lasting another seven days before dissipating east of kamchatka peninsula preparations and impact thumb typhoon ma on approaching japan on july 18 after ma on attained tropical storm status tiyan guam national weather service office issued a tropical storm watch for agrihan pagan and it was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning after ma on became a typhoon which was canceled after storm passed islands to north typhoon produced high waves in guam as well as gusty winds and precipitation in an outer feeder band high waves in advance of typhoon capsized a boat in east china sea although six passengers were rescued moisture from storm extended west to taiwan where over of rainfall was reported heavy rainfall caused flooding and mudslides that blocked roadways and forced evacuations in japan typhoon was forecast to strike areas affected by fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster officials prepared by installing a cover to prevent rain contamination ultimately there still was rain contamination and ma on s passage produced 2 000 tons of radioactive water before storm struck japan officials in miyazaki advised evacuation of about 900 people in areas prone to mudslides at least 300 airline flights were canceled due to storm typhoon also caused delays in nation s rail system nippon oil stopped shipping oil during storm as ma on moved across japan it produced winds of 108 km h 68 mph along with heavy rainfall of up to 1200 mm 48 in rainfall in a 24 hour period reached 860 mm 38 5 in in kochi which set a 24 hour rainfall record and exceeded average july precipitation by 265 5 mm 10 6 in rains flooded houses and roads in region high rains closed several expressways and in shizuoka prefecture a blocked road stranded 96 mountain climbers strong winds left about 11 000 people without power on shikoku island combination of winds and rain damaged 385 year old nijo castle in kyoto typhoon injured 60 people and killed five people one of deaths was from a man who drowned while checking on his boat during storm damage was estimated at y 3 9 billion 2011 jpy 50 million 2011 usd following ma on s passage temperatures decreased across japan which led to a marked decrease in heat stroke deaths throughout month heat stroke deaths were 70 less than in july
