he auditioned for part as kirkwood and bhatti worked on coronation street at same time bhatti was only actor who auditioned for part of yusef in fact wadia recommended bhatti to kirkwood to play yusef as she thought that he definitely had quality that yusef would need which is a very ambiguous but charming quality bhatti explained to digital spy that eastenders cast are very welcoming he explained they re so welcoming there s a lot of joking about i m having a great time at eastenders it s a real privilege to be here i ve known nitin and nina wadia who plays zainab for a very long time and we ve always got on very well nitin and i play tense scenes together so it s nice that we can have a laugh afterwards yusef is introduced as part of a storyline involving masood family tamwar dates afia and when yusef is introduced to tamwar s parents masood and zainab masood explodes with anger at sight of him recognising him as a man from their past ganatra explained that although yusef allegedly tried to save zainab from fire all masood saw was zainab locked in a burning kitchen we are only playing it from each person s point of view yusef is playing it from his point of view that he did try and save her masood is saying all i know is that i went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire patel said storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist in march 2011 bhatti said he was staying with eastenders until around june 2011 and would see from there he made his first appearance on 23 november 2010 ganatra spoke at british soap awards 2011 to digital spy and praised impact of yusef saying he s very much an arch villain he s a great character who s there to put jeopardy into masoods relationship zainab and masood have been married for 28 years and they re mad about each other for someone to come and destroy that slightly it s exciting it s exciting for us to play bhatti s departure was not announced when a fire was reported to be happening around christmas 2011 rumours emerged from an alleged eastenders insider that yusef has long been tipped as a possible fatality insider added this is biggest fire eastenders has ever seen and there will be casualties it is such a huge disaster that it will affect most of families on show in one way or another there is a great tradition at eastenders of captivating christmas day storylines and this year is no different yusef s death aired on 26 december 2011 concluding his storyline personality on eastenders website yusef is described as calm collected strong willed mysterious loyal to afia and regretful of his past daniel maier from guardian said that yusef is clearly a wrong un but it s hard to tell exactly what his game is you suspect he s not sure himself a baddie without portfolio most of his time seems taken up with malicious glances and general susan hill from daily star called yusef twisted while tony stewart from daily mirror called him smug deceitful and dangerous wadia opined that yusef is not evil but much more complex than that and his personality would be explored during his storyline bhatti told inside soap that yusef has more bad qualities than good but is insecure because when zainab left him it brought shame on his family storyline development in an interview with digital spy bhatti described his relationship with his daughter afia explaining that they have a strong bond and that yusef would die for his daughter he said that it definitely hurts when he finds out that tamwar and afia are already married as he is so close to afia and she has betrayed him in an interview with inside soap bhatti admits that he is sympathetic for his character yusef he said that yusef is very insecure and that he can understand his behaviour in some ways meanwhile discussing fan reaction to his character bhatti admitted that women have told him that he s a bad man bhatti also hinted that yusef will become more firmly established as a walford villain over next few weeks stating that yusef does have more bad qualities than good and that fans call him dr evil yusef is wrongly accused of having an affair with zainab due to his sister in law overhearing them speaking a source said that whole day turns into a disaster when sees yusef and zainab together she automatically thinks they re having an affair and everyone struggles to come to terms with what they have heard bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a heartthrob interviewed by will payne of sunday mirror he said that it s a great compliment however it was a complete surprise bhatti hinted that perhaps women love character but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits kidnap in april 2011 it was reported that masood would kidnap yusef pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire yusef will then go to masood s house and tell zainab what masood has done an eastenders insider told news of world masood has never got over that tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from masood that leaves yusef seriously injured but yusef will get his own back it is a twisted love triangle that will also show sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages it s not clear if their marriage will survive yusef s meddling yusef obviously wants zainab back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between masood and zainab ganatra said that yusef will turn very manipulative and very nasty and masood finds him as a big threat saying he throws a real spanner in works for masood he is doing everything he can to wreck masood s life really and way you do that is to get to his family it s a very clever way of doing things it s not about destroying his family it s about winning his family and turning them against him so that masood is left isolated and on his own ganatra spoke of storyline saying i think there s rumours of revenge yusef is a really nice catalyst he s a very exciting character to throw into mix if it goes that way it s more drama for us to play scenes were broadcast on 2 june 2011 with phil mitchell also taking revenge alongside masood domestic violence in late 2011 yusef manages to win his former wife back they later make plans to get married nina wadia explains why zainab is willing to forgive yusef wadia said to inside soap he tells zainab that he was forced to start fire by his family yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong minute he lit match and that he ran into house to save her and by end of this conversation she finds herself saying to him let s get married regardless obviously it was something i struggled to get my head around but being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common and that experience connects them so deeply she recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that whole thing was probably her fault because she walked out on their marriage wadia continued it doesn t look like zainab s going to listen but as denise leaves it s clear she s torn about what to do a short time before their wedding day arrives yusef starts to abuse zainab both physically and mentally he forbids zainab to leave house and later starts using her son kamil to control her wadia explains that she wants storyline to have a positive impact against real life violence she told bbc news i think idea behind showing a strong woman like zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even strongest of women they can change and they can be manipulated especially if they re isolated from their friends and family manipulator can take advantage so it s to prove that it can even happen to people like her to be honest if even one woman rings that action line at end of show and there s some difference made to her life i ll feel like we ve done our job she continued it is a serious issue and i m glad it s being highlighted i hope that it wakes anyone up not just women i know that there are abused men out there as well so if it gives anyone strength to leave a relationship like that we ll have done our job scenes where yusef refused to let zainab see kamil pulled in 8 viewers at 7 30pm bbc three s repeat of episode later secured viewers at 10pm wadia admitted to feeling emotionally drained after her scenes with ace bhatti she explained to people it s very draining i m putting myself into this very dark place which i know sadly is a reality for so many women zainab s confidence has been steadily eroded she s feeling isolated and has fallen under yusef s control he wants revenge she is totally in his power i had to show this can happen to any woman no matter how strong she seems zainab was strong and not naive but a woman is vulnerable if man hits right psychological weak spots but both ace and i have found it hard to do i ve known ace for a long time and we re good friends he has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all way through wadia has been given advice on storyline from roshni refuge in birmingham which specializes in abuse within asian families wadia warns that yusef will ultimately get worse as time progresses she said to inside soap i was filming out on location recently with ace and a bunch of women came over to him and said god you re such a horrible man it s funny because ace is such a sweet man and you haven t even seen worst of yusef yet wadia continued let s just say that what happens is complete opposite of what you want to see zainab and yusef share a dark and twisted love and she definitely has feelings for him it s not true and pure like what she used to have with masood and if yusef manages to get her back to pakistan it will be end for her i wouldn t be surprised if zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that s going to happen nitin ganatra who plays masood ahmed explains to digital spy masood s reactions when he discovers that yusef has taken kamil away masood goes crazy over this nitin replies i ve got kids myself and i know i d react same way if i found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody s house who child doesn t even know masood is still only person who can see yusef for what he really is so he goes into a blind panic over situation masood calls in police and they make sure that kamil is safe but we re left to wonder if he will stay that way police say that they can t get involved in domestic disputes so masood says well what about father s rights if a mother reported this you d see it as kidnap i thought that was a great line and really interesting i think in that moment masood s representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don t have access to their children in same way asked what masood s reactions are over zainab s abuse nitin says masood tells denise it s just another one of zainab s dramas but then there comes a point where he sees bruises on zainab then masood becomes very concerned for zainab in a very genuine way it also might reignite something between two of them as well as they have to work together to solve these problems scenes showing masood and denise race to cafe where kamil was raised 8 26 million viewers bbc three s repeat screening later secured viewers at 10pm reception bhatti revealed that since appearing in eastenders people have come up to him in street and called him a bad man and that fans call him dr evil in may 2011 bhatti was nominated in best newcomer category at tv quick awards and storyline where he tries to destroy masoods marriage was for best storyline bhatti was surprised to hear that yusef is liked mainly by women but in an interview with daily mirror he admits that he is nothing like yusef in real life bbc news branded yusef as zainab s sinister first husband elsewhere metro co uk described yusef as a deceptive doctor jane simon of daily mirror said that zainab sending yusef into blazing building was a stroke of genius simon also said that it s unknown what yusef is hoping to achieve with his one man reign of terror being married to a woman he can t stand with a son he doesn t want she added it doesn t sound like much of a game plan see also list of eastenders
