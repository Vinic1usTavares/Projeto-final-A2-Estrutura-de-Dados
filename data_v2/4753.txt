u s route 50 us 50 in utah crosses center of state highway serves no major population centers in utah with largest city along its path being delta most of route passes through desolate remote areas through eastern half of state route is concurrent with interstate 70 i 70 us 50 both enters and exits utah concurrent with us 6 however two routes are separate through center of state three completely different routings of us 50 have existed between green river and ely nevada route between these cities has become progressively shorter as new roads have been paved through this largely uninhabited region of both states earlier routings were a result of a dispute between utah and nevada over which auto trails would be paved and converted to u s highways route description thumb left us 50 and us 6 between nevada border and delta highway enters utah from nevada in a desolate portion of great basin desert similar to many portions of route in nevada there are no services from this point to delta a span of roadway that is about while passing through great basin highway crosses two mountain ranges confusion range via king s canyon and house range via skull rock pass before arriving at shore of sevier lake an intermittent lake fed by snow melt from many mountain ranges in eastern half of great basin from us 50 water is only usually visible in spring months old us 6 50 used to cut across through marjum pass to tule valley now goes around to south highway follows sevier lake to delta scenery dramatically changes as us 50 approaches delta where u s route 6 and 50 separate as road approaches delta a straight passage across desert changes to zigzags through farming areas highway continues to zigzag through farms until arriving at more mountainous terrain at holden at holden highway merges with interstate 15 to cross range at scipio summit us 50 then separates from this freeway to meet interstate 70 in salina two highways run concurrent from this point east to colorado yet again there is a stretch of highway long without services from salina to green river thumb right i 70 and us 50 routed through spotted wolf canyon while co routed with i 70 us 50 crosses wasatch plateau and passes through san rafael swell construction of i 70 through swell is noted as one of engineering marvels of interstate highway system one specific feat excavation through a portion called spotted wolf canyon required excavating of rock to have a bed for just of roadway construction workers noted that prior to construction of freeway a man could stand in this canyon and touch both sides of canyon wall us 6 rejoins us 50 near green river three routes run concurrent and follow southern edge of book cliffs to grand junction colorado once again services are not present from thompson springs to fruita colorado a span of about this portion of us 50 is part of dinosaur diamond prehistoric highway a national scenic byway name of byway comes from large number of areas along route with visible dinosaur remains entire route through state as well as concurrencies with i 15 and i 70 is included in national highway system history thumb left us 50 descending from skull rock pass in western utah modern route of u s route 50 between ely nevada and green river utah is third iteration first iteration in 1926 when u s highway system was first announced there was a gap in us 50 between ely and thistle at time states of utah and nevada were feuding about which of old auto trails would be paved and used for new u s highway system nevada favored lincoln highway which modern us 50 closely follows in that state utah refused to consider lincoln highway west of salt lake city officials perceived that route would carry all california bound traffic directly to nevada while passing through very few communities in utah utah instead favored victory highway modern interstate 80 west of salt lake and arrowhead trail modern interstate 15 by favoring these routes utah could force travelers destined for southern california to use a different route than those destined for northern california with both of these traversing through more cities in utah than lincoln highway arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to utah as it passed through many communities in state but only las vegas in nevada utah prevailed and us 50 did not continue to follow lincoln highway to salt lake city as nevada had wanted first continuous route of us 50 across eastern nevada and western utah was an arch shaped route us 50 proceeded north from ely along what is now numbered u s route 93 and alternate us 93 where highway would merge with victory highway u s route 40 along wendover cut off since replaced by i 80 to salt lake from there highway returned to green river via what is now numbered state route 201 u s route 89 and u s route 6 second iteration second iteration has its origins with formation of us 6 in 1937 us 6 was extended west from its former terminus at greeley colorado to long beach california in eastern utah route used existing alignment of us 50 however in western utah route used an unpaved road through delta reconnecting with us 50 in ely by 1954 this route was fully paved and us 50 was moved to this shorter alignment older us 50 alignment was designated as u s route 50 alternate with this change us 6 50 ran concurrent from ely to grand junction colorado paved version did not exactly follow unpaved roads dirt route passed through numerous mountain ranges of great basin with most difficult being marjum canyon route was relocated to follow north shore of sevier lake which reduced number of mountain ranges crossed although us 50 was moved to yet another alignment this route remains us 6 today third iteration modern route of us 50 was created in 1976 this iteration of us 50 has its origins in a dispute over route of interstate 70 in utah while i 70 was in planning stage colorado lobbied for an extension of original proposal to run across colorado and into utah utah supported an extension using then us 6 50 to connect denver colorado with salt lake city however federal planners did not see value in this route and instead supported a route that could be used to connect denver with los angeles california i 70 was built using federally selected route in 1976 us 50 was changed again to a routing mostly concurrent with i 70 portion of modern us 50 between delta and scipio had been previously numbered state route 26 and portion between scipio and salina had been numbered state route 63 with sr 63 portion being transferred to sr 26 in 1971 east of green river i 70 closely follows original route of us 50 with some minor straightening by crescent junction cisco and westwater major intersections mileposts reset at i 70 junction to reflect i 70 mileage references external links utah 50 category transportation in millard county utah category transportation in sevier county utah category transportation in emery
