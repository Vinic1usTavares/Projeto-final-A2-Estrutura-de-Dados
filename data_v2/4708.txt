deputy ka immakam pasa who would summarize a situation for sultan and request sultan s will on matter such documents were called telhis summary until 19th century and takrir suggestion later on sultan s handwritten response his command or decision were called hatt i humayun on telhis or hatt i humayun on takrir other types of documents submitted to sultan were petitions arzuhal sworn transcriptions of oral petitions mahzar reports from a higher to a lower office religious reports by qadis to higher offices and record books these would be called hatt i humayun on arz hatt i humayun on mahzar etc depending on type of document sultan responded not only to documents submitted to him by his viziers but also to petitions arzuhal submitted to him by his subjects following friday prayer thus hatt i humayuns on documents were analogous to papal rescripts and rescripts used in other imperial regimes when sultan contacted public for friday prayer or other occasions people would hand in petitions addressed to him these were later discussed and decided upon by council of viziers they would prepare a summary of all petitions and action decided upon for each one sultan would write on same sheet i have been informed manzurum olmustur multiple times followed by item number to which he is referring when palace bureaucracy was reorganized after tanzimat reforms sultan s decision came to be written directly by chief scribe at bottom of summary document and this one writing applied to all decisions practices when a petition or memo requiring sultan s decision was to be submitted to him grand vizier usually prepared an executive summary telhis as an attachment in some cases rather than prepare a separate summary document grand vizier or his deputy would write his summary and views diagonally on top or bottom margins of documents coming from lower functionaries see an example in first figure above such annotations on a written document were called sometimes grand vizier would append a separate cover page on top of a proposal coming from a lower level functionary like treasurer defterdar or minister of defence introducing it as for example this is proposal of defterdar in such cases sultan would write his hatt i humayun on cover page in other cases grand vizier would summarize matter directly in margin of document submitted by lower functionary and sultan would write on same page as well sometimes sultan would write his decision on a fresh piece of paper attached to submitted document in most cases hatt i humayuns were written by sultan himself although there exist some that were penned by chief scribe or another functionary important hatt i humayuns on white were sometimes drafted by head of diplomatic correspondence reis ul kuttab or secretary of navy kapudan pasa in some cases there were notations as to who prepared draft of document that was then re written by sultan hatt i humayuns usually were not dated although some concerning withdrawal of money from treasury did carry dates most late period hatt i humayuns and had dates abdulhamid i was especially inclined to date his hatt i humayuns his grand vizier koca yusuf pasha later suggested this practice of dating hatt i humayuns to abdulhamid s successor selim iii so that he could follow up whether his orders were carried out however this suggestion was not adopted abdulhamid ii used signatures toward latter parts of his reign language thumb right 200px upon note that minbar to be sent to medina requires 134 of copper suleyman i responds on top in his own handwriting be it given language of hatt i humayuns on documents generally was a form of turkish understandable orally even today and has changed little over centuries many documents or annotations were short comments such as i gave verdim be it given will not happen be it written is clear is clear to me malum oldu malumum olmustur provide it it has come to my sight manzurum oldu manzurum olmustur be it answered record

mucebince amel oluna or to be done as required not to be contravened mucebince amel ve oluna hatt i humayuns on white were more elaborate and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by sultan they often started by addressing recipient sultan would refer to his grand vizier as my vizier or if his grand vizier was away at war would refer to his deputy as ka immakam pasa those written to other officials would often start with an expression like you who are my vizier of rumeli mehmed pasha sen ki mehmed pasa sin head of religious affairs or sultan s personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully in cases where hatt i humayun was to be delivered ceremoniously with an imperial sword and a cloak as in an appointment to a high rank there would be a flowery salutation such as after i have honored you with my glorious greeting you should know that i ola ki correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title a note without an address was meant for grand vizier or his deputy history thumb right 200px response ca 1788 of selim iii on a memorandum regarding printing instead of on new coins my deputy grand vizier my imperial decree has been that if not contrary to current law word of is not to be printed earliest known hatt i humayun is one sent by sultan murad i to evrenos bey in 1386 commending commander for his conquests and giving him advice on how to administer people until reign of murad iii viziers used to present matters orally to sultans who would then give their consent or denial also orally while hatt i humayuns were very rare prior to this they proliferated afterward especially during reigns of sultans such as abdulhamid i selim iii and mahmud ii who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything content of hatt i humayuns tends to reflect power struggle that existed between sultan and his council of viziers divan process of using hatt i humayun to authorize actions of grand vizier came into existence in reign of murad iii this led to a loss of authority and independence in grand vizier while other palace people such as master of harem harem or concubines who had greater access to sultan gained in influence by giving detailed instructions or advice sultans reduced role of grand viziers to be just a supervisor to execution of his commands this situation appears to have created some backlash as during most of 17th century there were attempts to return to grand viziers prestige and power of supreme proxy i and over time hatt i humayuns returned to their former simplicity however in eighteenth century selim iii became concerned by over centralization of bureaucracy and its general inefficacy he created consulting bodies i to share some of authority with him and grand vizier he would give detailed answers on hatt i humayuns to questions asked of him and would make inquiries as to whether his decisions were followed hatt i humayun became selim iii s tool to ensure rapid and precise execution of his decisions during reign of mahmud ii in early 1830s practice of writing on memoranda of grand vizier was replaced by chief scribe of imperial office i humayun recording sultan s decision after tanzimat government bureaucracy was streamlined for most routine communications imperial scribe i began to record spoken will irade of sultan and thus irade also called irade i seniyye i e supreme will or irade i i e glorious will replaced hatt i humayun use of hatt i humayuns on white between sultan and grand vizier continued on for matters of great importance such as high level appointments or promotions infrequently grand vizier and sultan wrote to each other directly as well large number of documents that required sultan s decision through either a hatt i humayun or an irade i is considered to be an indication of how centralized ottoman government was abdulhamid i has written himself in one of his hatt i humayuns i have no time that my pen leaves my hand with god s resolve it does not early hatt i humayuns were written in calligraphic styles of talik talik a variant of talik and riq a after mahmud ii they were only written in riq a ahmed iii and mahmud ii were skilled and their hatt i humayuns are notable for their long and elaborate annotations on official documents in contrast sultans who accessed throne at an early age such as murad v and mehmed iv display poor spelling and calligraphy archival hatt i humayuns sent to grand vizier were handled and recorded at amedi kalemi secretariat of grand vizier amedi kalemi organized and recorded all correspondence between grand vizier and sultan as well as any correspondence with foreign rulers and with ottoman ambassadors other hatt i humayuns not addressed to grand vizier were stored in other document stores called fon in terminology of current turkish archivists cut out hatt i humayuns during creation of state archives in nineteenth century documents were organized according to their importance hatt i humayuns on white were considered most important along with those on international relations border transactions and internal regulations documents of secondary importance were routinely placed in trunks and stored in cellars in need of repair presumably as a sign of respect toward sultan hatt i humayuns on documents petitions reports etc were cut out and stored together with hatt i humayuns on white while rest of documents were stored elsewhere these cut out hatt i humayuns were not cross referenced with documents to which they referred and were only annotated by palace office using general terms and an approximate date because sultans were not in habit of dating their hatt i humayuns until late period of empire in most cases documents associated with them are not known conversely decisions on many a memorandum petition or request submitted to sultan are unknown separation of hatt i humayuns from their documents is considered a great loss of information for researchers ottoman archives in istanbul has a special section of cut out hatt i humayuns catalogs today all known hatt i humayuns have been recorded in a computerized database in ottoman archives of turkish prime minister basbakanlik or boa in short in istanbul and they number 95 134 most hatt i humayuns are stored at boa and in topkapi museum archive boa contains 58 000 hatt i humayuns because hatt i humayuns were originally not organized systematically historians in nineteenth and early twentieth century created several catalogs of hatt i humayuns based on different organizing principles these historic catalogs are still in use by historians at boa hatt i humayun tasnifi is catalog of hatt i humayuns belonging to amedi kalemi it consists of 31 volumes listing 62 312 documents with their short summaries this catalog lists documents from 1730 to 1839 but covers primarily those from reigns of selim iii and mahmud

tasnifi catalogs 216 572 documents in 34 volumes organized by topics that include local governments provincial administration vakif and internal security hatt i humayun of 1856 although there exist thousands of hatt i humayuns imperial reform edict or fermani of 1856 is well enough known that most history texts refer to it simply as hatt i humayun this decree from sultan abdulmecid i promised equality in education government appointments and administration of justice to all regardless of creed in ottoman code of laws text of this ferman is introduced as a copy of supreme ferman written to grand vizier perfected by decoration above with a hatt i humayun see footnote 4 in so technically this edict was a hatt i humayun to rank reform decree of 1856 is sometimes referred to by another name rescript of reform here word rescript is used to sense of edict decree not reply to a query or other document hatt i humayun of 1856 was an extension of another important edict of reform hatt i sharif of gulhane of 1839 and part of tanzimat reforms that document is also generally referred to as hatt i sharif although there are many other hatt i a term that is synonymous with hatt i humayun sultan s
