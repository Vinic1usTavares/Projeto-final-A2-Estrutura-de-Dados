on keokuk rail bridge which was second bridge built and operated by andrew carnegie s keokuk hamilton bridge company in that location while it was designed for wagons and early automobiles crossing rail bridge became difficult in larger modern vehicles specifically semi trucks as a result a new automobile only bridge was built directly to south of older span keokuk hamilton bridge opened in 1985

journey northward us 136 turns to southeast towards mississippi river at intersection with us 218 there are no directional signs for us 136 instead because of southeast to northwest orientation of city westbound us 136 is listed as pointed towards missouri and eastbound as pointed towards illinois after running through southern part of downtown it crosses mississippi on keokuk hamilton bridge which is adjacent to older keokuk rail bridge from both bridges lock and dam no 19 and its hydroelectric power plant dominate northern view of river history in late 1860s andrew carnegie s keystone bridge company built original keokuk and hamilton bridge in same location as keokuk rail bridge it was a steel truss bridge that had one set of tracks and two lanes for wagon traffic pedestrian traffic was cantilevered out on either side of trusses a swing span on keokuk side allowed river traffic to cross when bridge opened in 1871 first locomotive to cross bridge crushed pivot point of swing span it was replaced a few days later bowers pp 14 19 ten years later war eagle a river steamer sank after it collided with a fixed span of bridge both ship and bridge span were destroyed until span was replaced a wooden covered bridge was built in its place thumb left prior to 1985 us 136 crossed mississippi river on keokuk rail bridge second bridge now known as keokuk rail bridge was built in 1910s when modern trains were pushing bridge s load capacity keokuk businessmen coerced carnegie s keokuk hamilton bridge company owners of original bridge who thought their bridge was adequate to rebuild their bridge by threatening to build a new span on new dam being built near bridge however a new bridge over new dam would require congressional approval in form of house resolution 26672 after hearings before house committee on interstate and foreign commerce committee chairman urged keokuk hamilton bridge co would reconstruct its bridge or he would recommend passage of house resolution 26672 bridge company relented and planning began almost immediately bowers pp 19 20 bridge company contracted with ralph modjeski to design new bridge modjeski determined that original bridge was indeed overstressed for rail traffic he proposed two options a single track rail bridge with a roadway above tracks or a bridge similar to original but built to modern standards latter option was chosen piers of bridge were cut down and recapped bridge was built between 1914 and 1915 and opened for traffic in 1916 original roadway was made of wood but was replaced by steel mesh in 1956 bowers pp 21 24 us 136 was designated nationally in 1951 in keokuk area it was overlaid upon us 61 from west of alexandria missouri over des moines river into iowa and into downtown keokuk south of downtown it replaced iowa 161 which crossed mississippi river on keokuk rail bridge since its designation route has largely remained same however eastern end changed slightly with opening of keokuk hamilton bridge in 1985 in 1970s politicians on both sides of river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across river rail bridge while still adequate for rail traffic it proved to be a challenge for drivers western terminus of bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles but was dangerous for semi trucks bowers p 24 governor terry branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view underside of road deck new four lane keokuk hamilton bridge opened on november 23 1985 nearly eight months ahead of schedule and
