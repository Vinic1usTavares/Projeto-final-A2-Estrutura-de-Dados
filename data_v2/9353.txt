battle of lanzerath ridge was fought on december 16 1944 first day of battle of bulge during world war ii near village of lanzerath belgium along key route for german advance on northern shoulder of operation it was fought between two squads totalling 18 men belonging to an american reconnaissance platoon four u s forward artillery observers and a battalion of about 500 german paratroopers during a day long confrontation american reconnaissance troops inflicted dozens of casualties on germans and delayed by almost 20 hours advance of entire 1st ss panzer division spearhead of german 6th panzer army germans finally flanked american forces at dusk capturing them only one american a forward artillery observer was killed while 14 were wounded german casualties totaled 92 germans paused believing woods were filled with more americans and tanks only when ss standartenfuhrer joachim peiper and his panzer tanks arrived at midnight twelve hours behind schedule did germans learn nearby woods were empty due to lost communications with battalion and then regimental headquarters and unit s subsequent capture its disposition and success at delaying advance of 6th panzer army that day was unknown to u s commanders lt lyle bouck considered wounding of most of his men and capture of his entire unit a failure when war ended five months later platoon s men who were split between two prisoner of war camps just wanted to get home it was only after war that bouck learned that his platoon had prevented lead german infantry elements from advancing and had delayed by about 20 hours their armored units advance on october 26 1981 after considerable lobbying a congressional hearing and letter writing by bouck every member of unit was finally recognized for their valor that day making platoon most decorated american unit of its size of world war ii background prior to battle of bulge u s army was engaged in a campaign to attack roer river dams before invading rest of germany green 99th infantry division was supporting battle weary 2nd infantry division in their attack on german west wall at wahlerscheid during two days of hard fighting u s army had finally managed to slip through heavily fortified lines and penetrate german defenses americans were expecting a counterattack in area but their intelligence completely failed to detect germans movement of hundreds of armored vehicles and tens of thousands of infantry into region much of region was relatively quiet lending area title of ghost front during early december 1944 american s defensive line in ardennes had a gap south of losheimergraben general leonard t gerow in command of v corps recognized this area as a possible avenue of attack by germans this area which lay between v corps and troy h middleton s viii corps was undefended just patrolled by jeep patrols in northern part of area were conducted by 99th infantry division s 394th intelligence and reconnaissance platoon whereas those in south were conducted by 18th cavalry squadron 14th cavalry group which was attached to 106th infantry division in border area between germany and belgium there was only one road network that could support a military advance it was through area known as losheim gap a long narrow valley at western foot of schnee eifel this was key route through which german sixth and fifth panzer armies planned to advance on december 11 general walter m robertson commander of battle hardened 2nd infantry division was ordered to attack and seize roer river dams in case he had to pull back he chose elsenborn ridge as his defensive line general walter e lauer commanding 99th infantry division was charged with building up defenses around elsenborn ridge lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned he gave instructions to his division s soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes prelude inexperienced american units thumb first lt lyle bouck jr at 20 years old troops of 99th infantry division who lacked battle experience were deployed to ardennes in november 1944 with 394th regiment relieving 60th regiment of 9th infantry division among units was 394th i r platoon consisting of well trained soldiers who had been selected because they were expert marksmen and in peak physical condition some of men were college educated and were former members of u s army s abruptly terminated astp program this platoon was led by 20 year old lt lyle bouck one of youngest officers in army and second youngest man in unit for next few weeks his platoon established and maintained regimental listening and observation posts conducted patrols behind enemy lines and gathered information they lived in a brick building in hunningen taking advantage of a basement full of potatoes and a home made stove to supplement military c rations platoon consisted of two nine man reconnaissance squads and a seven man headquarters section which was attached to 394th regimental s2 section as platoon was not intended nor trained for combat they were told to avoid direct engagement with germans nonetheless they took part in several missions behind enemy lines even as far as losheim behind front line to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence bouck and several of his men were among first group in their regiment to be recognized with combat infantry badge most often their patrols consisted of creeping through snow clogged defiles obscured by fog in an attempt to fix enemy positions on december 10 reconnaissance platoon was ordered by major robert kriz commanding officer of 394th infantry regiment to a new position about south east of hunningen near lanzerath belgium a village of 23 homes and a church village lay at a critical road junction in northern part of losheim gap 25 men were charged by kriz with plugging a gap in front line between 106th division to south and 99th division to north only reserve was 394th infantry regiment s 3rd battalion which was at bucholz station behind them lay roads that would give enemy rapid access to army s rear and allow them to easily flank thinly placed 99th division american defensive preparations i r platoon took over positions on a ridge top immediately northwest of lanzerath that were formerly occupied by part of 2nd infantry division they were ordered to improve their foxhole positions and maintain contact with task force x made up of 55 troops manning four towed three inch guns from 2nd platoon company a 820th tank destroyer battalion 820th was attached to 14th cavalry group 106th infantry division of viii corps i r platoon and 820th td were reinforced by 22 men of 820th s 2nd recon platoon commanded by lieutenant john who were mounted on an armored half track and two jeeps members of second platoon took up positions within two homes inside village of lanzerath about to southeast together two units comprised foremost units in their sector of american forces facing siegfried line americans were attacking through siegfried line at about to north and a localized counter attack was expected lt bouck followed procedure and ordered his men to build fortifications with interlocking fields of fire taking advantage of foxholes left by previous unit they dug them deeper so that two or three men could stand in them and fire from concealed edges they covered each hole with pine logs to thick their hilltop location was just inside edge of a forest and overlooked a pasture bisected by a high barbed wire fence parallel to their location their position covered about along a shallow ridge line about in enfilade position above road and northwest of village their foxholes were situated in a shallow curve along ridge line in a northeast direction almost to a fork in road at their left flank snow fell covering their dug in fortifications inside woods leaving them virtually invisible from road below thumb left a camouflaged forest pillbox like those built by i r took advantage of a small log hut behind their position which they used as a warming hut bouck had augmented unit s weaponry with four extra carbines two browning automatic rifles and one light 30 caliber machine gun avoiding official channels he had also traded his unit s collection of german memorabilia with an ordnance supply officer for an armored jeep with a mounted 50 caliber machine gun his men dug an emplacement for armored jeep and its 50 caliber gun placing it in enfilade down road along german s possible axis of advance once an hour in an attempt to fill gap in their sector they ran a jeep patrol up and down line to stay in contact with units on their right and left flank and to detect any enemy movement they hoped they would be relieved soon we weren t trained to occupy a defensive position in front lines we were trained to patrol and get information about enemy bouck said in an interview 60 years later on night of december 16 they heard clanking of armor and sound of vehicles in distance bouck ordered his men to remain awake temperature ranged from to low during day german plans many of german units were recent conscripts with very little experience sergeant vinz kuhlbach s platoon was typical most of his soldiers had little combat experience and even less training german units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50 men previously rejected as physically unfit for service wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals and men transferred from jobless personnel of shrinking kriegsmarine and luftwaffe german 3rd fallschirmjager division which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation had been virtually destroyed during normandy invasion in falaise pocket it had been resurrected by using replacements from 22nd 51st and 53rd luftwaffe field regiments german units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans although they carried new stg 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades few had ever fired them in combat german recruits were told american soldiers they faced would not have nerve to stand and fight their officers said americans were a gum chewing undisciplined half breed with no stomach for real war to preserve available armor infantry of 9th fallschirmjager regiment 3rd fallschirmjager division had been ordered to lead attack through lanzerath and clear village before advancing towards and then bullingen german commanders estimated they would face a full division of u s troops at bullingen kampfgruppe peiper s initial position was in forest around blankenheim germany east of german belgium border and siegfried line once infantry captured lanzerath sepp dietrich s sixth panzer army led by kampfgruppe peiper would proceed without delay infantry would then secure right flank of attack route near losheimergraben peiper s goal was to cross meuse river at huy belgium despite losses that had brought allies to border of their homeland german morale was surprisingly strong men knew allies were demanding an unconditional surrender they were now fighting for fatherland defending soil of their country not just fighting for hitler dietrich knew plan had flaws germans had captured same terrain during summer of 1940 in three days now they were being asked to do it in winter in five days plan counted on bad weather to keep allied planes grounded dietrich only had one quarter fuel they needed their plan counted on capturing allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable dietrich s assigned route or included narrow roads in many places single tracks which would force units of kampfgruppe to tail each other creating a column of infantry and armor up to long roads would prevent attackers from concentrating their forces in blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in past main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow moving towed artillery and bridging trains dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical choke points by even a token u s force could seriously impede his schedule when hitler s operations officer generaloberst alfred jodl gave him his orders dietrich yelled i m a general not a bloody undertaker battle german barrage thumb upright 1 5 northern shoulder of battle of bulge in which bouck s unit held up german advance through a key intersection near lanzerath for nearly a full day on december 16 1944 at 05 30 germans launched a 90 minute artillery barrage using 1 600 artillery pieces across an 80 mile 130 km front although american platoon was only aware of what was happening in their sector their first impression was that this was anticipated counterattack resulting from allies recent attack in wahlerscheid crossroads to north where 2nd division had knocked a sizable dent into siegfried line bouck later said many shells exploded in trees sending shards of steel and wood into ground but men were protected by their reinforced foxholes german guns cut deep holes size of trucks in pasture german advance thumb soldiers man a 30 caliber heavy machine gun in a foxhole during battle of bulge german infantry began to advance near losheim before artillery barrage lifted preparing to cross front line as soon as it ended they marched under glow of massive searchlights bouncing light off clouds armor was located farther back near blankenheim germany at 8 00 as sun rose american platoon heard explosions and guns around buchholz station and losheimergraben to east and north where 3rd and 1st battalions of 394th infantry division were located 55 soldiers of u s 2nd platoon company a 820th tank destroyer battalion 14th cavalry group was initially ordered south to help protect but shortly afterwards were redirected to join active battle near buchholz station they withdrew from village and left without contacting i r platoon this left platoon as only unit in sector and without armor support bouck sent james slape and creger to set up an observation post in a house on eastern side of village that had been abandoned by task force x accompanying them he spotted in dawn light a long column of what appeared to be about 500 german troops headed toward them from east their distinctive helmet style told bouck they were fallschirmjager among best soldiers germany could field none of his training or experience prepared him for this situation outnumbered as he was by perhaps 20 to 1 bouck and james scrambled back to ridge top and rest of their unit platoon s telephone land line to 1st battalion headquarters in losheimergraben was knocked out but their scr 300 radio still worked bouck reached regimental headquarters at hunningen on radio and requested permission to withdraw and engage in a delaying action he was told to remain in position and reinforcements from 3rd battalion will come to support you in town creger watched as a forward element of german infantry advanced with weapons slung into lanzerath they obviously did not expect to encounter any americans creger radioed bouck and told him of germans advancing through lanzerath on road between creger and bouck s position bouck sent robinson mcgeehee and silvola to assist creger who crept down to bucholz station road and thence up a ditch towards lanzerath before three men reached creger he left village using a more direct route as he returned to american lines he engaged and killed or wounded most of a german platoon on eastern side of road robinson mcgeehee and silvola attempted to rejoin their platoon but found way blocked by german soldiers who threatened to flank them they decided to head for losheimergraben and seek reinforcements they crossed a deep railroad cut and once on far side encountered soldiers from fusilier regiment 27 of 12th volksgrenadier division trying to outflank 1st battalion 394th infantry regiment in losheimergraben they spotted three men after a brief firefight robinson and mcgeehee were wounded and all three were captured germans entered home that creger and slape were using as an observation post slape climbed into attic while creger only had time to hide behind a door he pulled pin on a grenade as door knob jammed into his ribs bullets from i r platoon struck building and germans suddenly left creger and slape exited by back door and ducked into a nearby cowshed they crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield picking their way forward they circled through woods until they encountered a handful of germans opening fire they killed them creger and slape spotted bouck and milosevich across road and sprinted towards them drawing german fire they made it back to their ridge top position and bouck called regimental headquarters he requested artillery support but when he reported german column advancing on his position voice on other end of radio told him he must be seeing things bouck told them he had 20 20 vision and demanded artillery fire on road in front of his unit u s artillery unavailable platoon s position at southern end of 99th division s sector was not only outside their own regimental boundary it was outside their division s boundary and v corps boundary division prioritized artillery fire for targets within its boundary bouck waited in vain for sound of incoming artillery he called regimental headquarters again asking for directions he was told to hold at all costs which essentially meant until dead or captured bouck knew that if his platoon gave way 99th division s right flank already thin and undermanned could be in grave danger four members of a forward observation team from battery c 371st field artillery had been in village when tank destroyer unit withdrew lieutenant warren springer and other three men sergeant peter gacki t 4 willard wibben and t 5 billy queen joined bouck s unit on ridge where they could continue to observe enemy movement bouck distributed them among foxholes to help reload magazines and reinforce their position radio operator james fort attempted to contact headquarters on scr 284 radio mounted on a jeep by command post and found that german martial music jammed channel he then used a side channel and morse code hoping germans weren t listening to send a status report to regimental headquarters excerpt platoon s defensive action as german forces moved through lanzerath and in front of their positions bouck and his men allowed lead members of unit to pass hoping to surprise germans they were preparing to fire on three men who they believed were regiment s officers when a girl from village emerged from one of homes talking to officers she pointed in their general direction an officer yelled a command and paratroopers jumped for ditches on either side of road americans thought she had given their position away and fired on germans wounding several in october 2006 more than 50 years later a writer found now adult woman still living in village she told him she did not know americans were still in area and was pointing out direction tank destroyer unit had departed towards bucholz station german infantry deployed and about two platoons of 2nd company 1st battalion 9th fallschirmjager regiment 3rd fallschirmjager division then attacked americans head on bunched together in open and charging straight up hill directly at platoon s hidden and fortified positions americans were surprised at inexperienced tactics for americans it was like shooting clay ducks in california at an amusement park several attackers were killed trying to climb over high barbed wire fence that bisected field often shot at close range with a single shot to heart or head lt springer used his jeep mounted scr 610 radio to call in coordinates for artillery fire a few shells landed near road outside lanzerath but they did not hinder german attack his jeep was then struck by machine gun or mortar fire and his radio was destroyed slape and milosevich fired continually as fast as they could reload slape thought germans were mad to attack in such a suicidal manner straight across open field he later recalled that it was one of most beautiful fields of fire he had ever seen after only about 30 seconds firing stopped nearly all of attacking germans had been killed or wounded mcconnell shot in shoulder was only american casualty during a second attack made around 11 00 am milosevich fired 50 caliber jeep mounted machine gun until enemy fire drove him back into his foxhole in both first and second attack that morning no german soldier got past fence in middle of field bodies were piled around it german medics waved a white flag late in morning and indicated they wanted to remove wounded which american defenders allowed however during ceasefire american soldiers noticed that german medics were entering coordinates of american position nullifying ceasefire americans again suffered only one wounded on second attack when pvt kalil was struck in face by a rifle grenade that failed to explode germans mounted a third attack late in afternoon around 3 00 several times german soldiers attempted to penetrate american lines americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on attackers to push them back down hill at one point pfc milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already dead as mortar fire on his position got more accurate milsovech noticed a pistol on supposed medic s belt and decided he must be calling in fire on their position he shot and killed him bouck contacted regimental headquarters once more seeking reinforcements at 3 50 fort sent unit s last update to regimental headquarters in hunningen he reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75 who were attempting to advance from lanzerath towards railroad to northwest as dusk approached and their ammunition ran dangerously low bouck feared they could be flanked at any time he planned to pull his men back just before dusk when they would have enough light to escape through woods bouck ordered his men to remove distributor caps from their jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to rear he dispatched corporal sam jenkins and pfc preston through woods to locate major kriz at regimental hq and seek instructions or reinforcements excerpt bouck tried to contact regimental headquarters on scr 300 radio for instructions a sniper shot radio as bouck held it to his ear sniper also hit scr 284 radio mounted in jeep behind bouck eliminating any possibility of calling for reinforcements or instructions german troops were reluctant to attack head on once again and sergeant vinz pleaded with officers of 9th fallschirmjager regiment to allow his men to flank americans in dusk fifty men from fusilier regiment 27 of 12th volksgrenadier division were dispatched to attack american s southern flank through woods just as bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal german soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by americans in their foxholes each of positions spread out over ridge top were overrun in turn surprisingly germans did not simply kill defenders in their foxholes bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun and he thought he would be shot when german put his weapon in his back and pulled trigger it was empty both bouck and german officer were then struck by bullets german fell seriously wounded while bouck was struck in calf sergeant kuhlbach asked bouck who was in command and bouck replied that he was kuhlbach asked him why americans were still shooting and bouck said it was not his men doing it bouck surrendered and helped carry his wounded men down to village conclusion thumb upright 1 24 map showing progress of german offensive during december 16 25 1944 during their dawn to dusk fight 15 remaining men of i r platoon plus four men of 371st artillery forward observation team repeatedly engaged elements of 1st battalion 9th fallschirmjager regiment 3rd fallschirmjager division of about 500 men germans reported 16 killed 63 wounded and 13 missing in action other reports suggest americans inflicted between 60 and five hundred casualties on germans only one american forward artillery observer billy queen was killed in bouck s platoon 14 out of 18 men were wounded small american force had seriously disrupted scheduled advance of entire 6th panzer army s drive for antwerp along critical northern edge of offensive after virtually no sleep during preceding night and a full day of almost non stop combat with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining flanked by a superior enemy force platoon and artillery observers were captured aftermath german military took over several homes in lanzerath and turned them into aid stations for wounded of both sides rest of homes were commandeered as temporary quarters german armor advance thumb left waffen ss kampfgruppe knittel pass through crossroads on road between saint vith and malmedy to support peiper in stavelot kampfgruppe peiper lead element of sixth panzer army s spearhead 1st ss panzer division consisted of 4 800 men and 600 vehicles on december 16 it started as much as to east in germany and was unable to advance at its scheduled rate because of road congestion road from to losheim was one solid traffic jam in part due to two blown railroad overpasses blocking advance of 3rd parachute regiment and 12th division to losheimergraben but also due to stiff american resistance peiper s lead units did not reach losheim until 7 30 pm when he was ordered to swing west and join up with 3rd fallschirmjaeger division which had finally cleared route through lanzerath peiper was furious about delay en route to lanzerath peiper s unit lost five tanks and five other armored vehicles to american mines and anti tank weapons kampfgruppe peiper finally reached lanzerath near midnight lt bouck held in cafe turned 21 years old at midnight on december 17 at midnight he watched as a senior german officer who he later identified as peiper attempt to obtain accurate information about u s army s strength in area peiper was told by obersturmbannfuhrer i g von hoffman a former luftwaffe general staff officer from berlin and commanding officer of 9th fallschirmjager regiment 3rd fallschirmjager division that his men had run into stiff resistance he reported that woods and road ahead were packed with american troops and tanks he had bedded his troops down for night and planned to probe forest for americans at first light their expectations of further resistance was all based on stiff defense offered by bouck s force of just 18 men right upright thumb ss standartenfuhrer joachim peiper commander of 1st ss panzer division peiper asked battalion commander and a hauptmann captain in same unit about american resistance both said they had not personally seen americans but that woods were heavily fortified peiper learned that no patrols had been conducted into woods and no one had personally reconnoitered area disgusted peiper demanded that von hoffman give him a battalion of paratroops to accompany his tanks at 4 30 a m on december 17 more than 18 hours behind schedule 1st ss panzer division rolled out of and headed northwest for bucholz station entire timetable of their advance on river meuse and antwerp had been seriously slowed allowing americans precious hours to move in reinforcements german advance never recovered from its initial delay and kampfgruppe peiper only got as far as stoumont where remaining vehicles ran out of fuel and came under heavy attack from american aircraft artillery and tanks having advanced less than half way to river meuse they were forced to abandon more than a hundred vehicles in town including six tiger ii tanks soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot elements of peiper s battle group that entered stoumont retreated with 800 men task of defeating 99th division was objective of 12th ss panzer division reinforced by additional panzergrenadier and divisions on december 17 german engineers repaired one of road bridges over railroad along losheim losheimergraben road and 12th division s armor began advancing towards key road junction at losheimergraben and twin villages of and however in more than ten days of intense battle 12th ss panzer division was unable to dislodge americans from elsenborn ridge where elements of v corps of first u s army prevented german forces from reaching key road network to their west due to determined resistance of 99th division which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops along with experienced 2nd and 30th divisions northern shoulder of battle of bulge was a sticking point for entire offensive operation had americans given way german advance would have overrun vast supply depots around liege and spa and possibly have changed outcome of battle of bulge prisoners of war i r platoon members who were able to walk were sent to germany james was so seriously wounded he couldn t speak he and kalil who was also seriously wounded were loaded onto trucks and eventually put aboard trains bouck was jammed into a single railroad cattle car with 71 others pows and traveled for days without food or water by christmas day seven men in bouck s car had died and rest were barely hanging on prisoners were transported to hospitals in frankfurt and hanover mcconnell also wounded ended up like james in stalag xi b near bad most primitive pow camp in germany bouck and his men were finally imprisoned in stalag xiii d in nuremberg and later in

his men proper recognition bouck contacted his former division commander maj gen walter e lauer who nominated bouck for a silver star in june 1966 a silver star arrived in bouck s mailbox but no other platoon member was recognized bouck was shortly afterward interviewed by john s d eisenhower for his book bitter woods which described actions of unit in detail columnist jack anderson unsuccessfully campaigned for william james tsakanikas to be awarded medal of honor congressional hearings on men s action resulted in a recommendation to secretary of defense that bill james be awarded medal of
