neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being this allows children especially male children to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be case in more traditionally structured households b a dy c 2007 october 8 just don t call me mr mom newsweek 150 15 52 55
