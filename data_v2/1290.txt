record plant in los angeles if i were a boy was placed on i am disc of i am sasha fierce as it is a ballad that shows beyonce s insecurities about love and person she is underneath all makeup underneath lights and underneath all exciting star drama in an interview with essence magazine beyonce explained that if i were a boy is broad and different from her previous releases because it is not a traditional r b song she added i had to try it because i remember aretha franklin said a great singer can sing anything and make it her own beyonce was also motivated by her audience s strong expectations from her as a singer while preparing her third solo album beyonce wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like if i were a boy because music and emotion in story is told so much better it s a better connection because you can hear it and it s not all these other distractions i really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what i had to say jean s response after jean s version of if i were a boy was rejected by her record company she was upset that beyonce recorded and released ballad roger friedman of fox news wrote that jean was first informed that beyonce recorded song by a stranger daily telegraph reported that beyonce s father and then manager mathew knowles pursued publishing rights of if i were a boy after realizing that it had potential to become a big hit jean used her myspace account to express her frustration i have been reading some of these comments and to set record straight from horse s mouth if i were a boy is my song yes i wrote this song it is my story a painful one and song is very dear to me you can hear original version on my myspace site friedman later reported that beyonce and jean had come to terms deal included a promise that beyonce would record a duet with jean for her debut album in an interview with eric r danton of hartford courant jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that beyonce was recording if i were a boy she was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as do ing whole artist thing as well jean added it s an amazing compliment but i was like that s great but it s going to be on my album and it can be on my album too i just didn t realize how it worked at first when i got this people didn t know that i was an artist so it was like oh this songwriter bc if i were a boy was first song she ever recorded and she initially did not intend to hand it to another singer jean said that fact that beyonce recorded ballad provided many opportunities and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics she refused their offers desiring to use her songs for her own album however jean still intends to write for other artists composition and lyrical interpretation if i were a boy is a midtempo pop and r b ballad with folk rock and soft rock influences song was composed using common time in key of g major and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute it was written in common verse chorus form verses are supported by four chords and follow a vi iv i v chord progression in form em7 b g d f ed masle of arizona republic noted that progression is reminiscent of nirvana s 1991 song smells like teen spirit instrumentation is provided by a piano acoustic guitars live drums and strings as well as hand claps which are used throughout song beyonce s vocals span range from a low of f 3 to high of e5 her singing gets higher and louder as she employs melodic crescendos critics noted that beyonce delivers a tormented performance with unwavering sentiments lyrics of if i were a boy are about a gender swapping thought experiment through which beyonce analyses ideologies of a tense relationship as she sings about things she would do if she were a boy beyonce highlights vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women s sense of empathy during first part of ballad beyonce alternates between role of her flawed partner and that of better man she would be in first verse she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men chasing after girls and treating her lover cruelly before adding that she would never be confronted for it beyonce then sings chorus in which she gives her vision of life as a better man i think i could understand how it feels to love a girl i swear i d be a better man because she knows how it hurts when you lose one you wanted cause he s taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed in second verse beyonce resigns herself and continues to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women still imagining herself impersonating man who has wronged her she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex lovers after having found another girl beyonce continues i d put myself first and make rules as i go cause i know that she d be faithful waitin for me to come home she then repeats chorus intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying during bridge beyonce stops singing about male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly as beyonce emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did in rest of song she finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize in last verse beyonce concludes but you re just a boy fraser mcalpine of bbc music notes that she pushes her voice into a thin pleading whine at this point with a squeak in her voice she repeats chorus for final time as she fights to remain strong not allowing her agony to bring her down

is to manipulate someone s voice if i can do it with a clip i pulled off of tv imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances entire industry has been so manipulated because there s such an emphasis on perfection so when something like this happens it causes such a stir i knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast it s wild how much story s been twisted it s just always been fun for me to manipulate artists and make it sound crazy it was just for a good laugh it was a goof just for fun i do a lot of parodies on my youtube channel and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand it was just what i ve learned in school and it s fun i could fool so many people and get away with it a lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it so why should i apologize if you can t poke fun at yourself i don t know what kind of person you are formats and track listings download single if i were a boy 4 09 dance mixes ep vol 1 if i were a boy maurice
