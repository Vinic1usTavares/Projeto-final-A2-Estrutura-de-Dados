voiced by greg baldwin and zuko is voiced by dante basco grey delisle and mark hamill voice two antagonists azula and fire lord ozai respectively co creators also lend their voices to two minor characters in third part into inferno animated effects in finale were directed by jae myung yoo a particularly tricky part to animate was climactic scene where protagonist aang tries to overpower antagonist ozai konietzko originally pitched scene to dimartino and ehasz but three of them encountered difficulties communicating how scene would look they ended up drawing a fully colored storyboard to send to animation studios additionally finale featured a significant amount of fire compared to previous episodes and were all hand drawn by yoo s team dos santos observed that fire effects alone cost more than most shows spend on an entire season although avatar is not considered anime because of its american origin tasha robinson of scifi channel observed that avatar blurs line between anime and us domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant an ign reviewer commented that sozin s comet had that classic anime look that i ve always loved to see when watching old anime movies story through animation was perfectly done finale s music was written and composed by track team led by jeremy zuckerman unlike past episodes a music track produced by a live orchestra was used rather than one in midi format according to konietzko one of most challenging scenes to pair musically was agni kai duel between zuko and azula scene s pairing of moody and melancholic music with intense action was inspired by ghost in shell and a decision was made to quiet sound effects to let music set tone was inspired by blade runner avatar last airbender borrows extensively from east asian art to create its fictional universe four bending arts exist in universe they are based on different styles and variations of chinese martial arts baguazhang for airbending hung gar and southern praying mantis for earthbending northern shaolin for firebending and t ai chi for waterbending fight scenes were choreographed by sifu kisu who performed and filed every fight sequence with konietzko to serve as reference for animators additionally finale borrowed heavily from taoist concept of balance and order avatar an incarnation of a divine being is supposed to maintain world s order nickelodeon

understanding voice of a new character lion turtle lion turtle was designed by bryan konietzko and character designer jae woo kim konietzko disliked how lion turtle turned out he felt that art was not
