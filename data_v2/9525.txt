resolution for series greutert commented that saw vi would have some finality to it something he always wanted to see in series during early planning stage for script it was suggested that mandylor s character detective hoffman should take on mafia but idea was quickly dismissed as not feeling saw enough greutert said in a demon fm interview that lionsgate told him a week before filming that saw vi would be post converted into 3d greutert was upset by this since film he envisioned was a 2d film aesthetically plans were later abandoned due to time restraints casting on july 26 2007 before saw iv was released craveonline s horror website com announced that costas mandylor would sign on to appear as mark hoffman in saw v and saw vi mandylor commented on his character hoffman is sort of torn of becoming a mad man or becoming a guy that s more composed coming from a pure place like jigsaw that s my character s dilemma does he go fucking crazy or follow rules of boss greutert said in an interview with bloody disgusting that saw vi would have most characters of any saw film to date but reassured writers would stay true to previous storylines to prevent any violations of logic and chronology a tv reality show called scream queens aired in 2008 on vh1 in which 10 unknown actresses competed for a breakout role in saw vi unknown actress tanedra howard won role lionsgate made a

is good or evil pretty much you ll know greutert wanted to bring cary elwes s character dr gordon back but elwes was not available he was later cast in saw 3d though storyline is very different than one greutert had for him in saw vi filming and trap designs thumb left concept art of carousel room trap since actors were constantly spinning they were given anti nausea medication to prevent motion sickness with a budget of 11 million saw vi began principal photography on march 30 2009 and wrapped on may 13 2009 film was shot at toronto s cinespace film studios greutert said that victims in traps would be more one on one with trap and would be more personal to them this was compared to saw iv and saw v which most of traps were set in big rooms and involved several people at one time armstrong told bloody disgusting reviewer mike pereira that he thinks visually saw vi might be his favorite saying we re kind of pulling back a little bit in color palette it s going to be more suggestive and not so vibrant in your face like iii and iv it s more neutral and shows natural flesh tones on saw v i pulled back a little bit and on this one i pulled back even more he commented that steam room trap was best looking of them all he went on to say it s big and expensive it s got furnaces fires and steam it s multi leveled most complex saw we had techno cranes flying through it was pretty amazing commenting on carousel room trap armstrong said it s very carnival playground like it s just nasty there are spinning red lights in there it s really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning greutert said in an issue of horror magazine fangoria that carousel room was to date longest trap scene ever he admitted that originally they had ten actors riding carousel but it was ultimately scaled down to six to tie in to film s title post production services were provided by deluxe soundtrack saw vi original motion picture soundtrack includes music by bands every time i die suicide silence nitzer ebb mushroomhead and lacuna coil among others soundtrack includes 18 tracks separated by three parts each with six songs and includes three bonus tracks it was released on october 20 2009 through trustkill records james christopher monger of allmusic praised use of hard rock and heavy metal music something that had been missing since saw iv he said in his review that it s a fitting marriage as hard rock and heavy metal are sonic suitors to horror and torture porn films and video games he particularly liked songs by hatebreed in ashes they shall

best critical reception out of series after saw 2004 review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that 39 of 72 critics have given film a positive review with an average rating of 4 3 out of 10 website s critical consensus reads it won t earn franchise many new fans but saw vi is a surprising step up for what has become an intricately grisly annual tradition metacritic gives film a weighted average rating of 30 out of 100 based on 12 reviews indicating generally unfavorable reviews cinemascore polls reported that average grade moviegoers gave film was a c on an a to f scale thumb although tobin bell s character was killed in saw iii his jigsaw persona sustains a crucial part in every sequel owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly said that saw vi is thinnest and most tediously preachy of saw films it s first one that s more or less consumed by backstory which is to say it s one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks he said if your goal is to do a quick study for a round of saw trivial pursuit then this may be movie for you if you re looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter skip this sequel and hope that producers get their sick act together next time rob nelson of variety wrote squeezing another pint of blood from its torture porn corpus lionsgate slays again with saw vi a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called saw it already at least requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition but added presumably owing to director kevin greutert s work as editor of all five previous saw pics film s juggling of chronology is franchise s best christopher monfette of ign movies rated saw vi three out of five and wrote that while saw vi certainly offers a redemption for series and promise of a coming power struggle for jigsaw s legacy saw vii will no doubt mark time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get ax frank scheck of hollywood reporter said if this is torture porn it s as if it was designed to be enjoyed by michael moore he closed his review saying as usual what gives film whatever interest it has beyond satisfying rapacious appetites of gore aficionados is moral element attached to various rube goldberg style set pieces here it s exemplified by a well staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs roger moore of orlando sentinel gave film two out of five stars he said script has a more lyrical bent and a more satiric bite than any of other saw sequels and called acting perfunctory on most fronts robert abele of los angeles times gave film a negative review writing but really do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate elsewhere usual critiques apply terrible acting zero suspense laughable logic and promise of another one next year how can we get this policy canceled chris hewitt of st paul pioneer press gave film a negative review he was displeased that film offered nothing new saying first three saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them but three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh kim newman of empire gave film three out of five stating saw vi gets back to saw basics in gripping gruesome manner wesley morris of boston globe gave film a two and half out of four stars saying who knew that franchise s creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense who knew they d realize that tobin bell s righteous killer had current events value given our cable news climate it s not beyond imagining that john kramer could have his own populist tv show jigsaw s death panel blake french of amc filmcritic gave film three and a half out of five writing director kevin greutert hasn t helmed a lot of films in past but he did edit all of previous saws as it turns out his mastered craft lends well to directing he spins a taut tight concise web of terror and surprise best entry in series since saw ii brad miska of bloody disgusting gave film seven out of ten and wrote saw vi is faithful to franchise and twist finale are 100 satisfying saw fans will walk out of theater with their fists in air with feeling that they ve reclaimed their beloved franchise marc savlov of austin chronicle gave film one and half out of five stars saying whole gooey mess in already blood spattered surgical garb of ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on screenwriters part but once you get past that pseudo ironic touch this saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in series see also references top 8 band saw november
