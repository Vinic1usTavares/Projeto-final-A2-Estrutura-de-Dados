m22 locust officially light tank airborne m22 was an american designed airborne light tank which was produced during world war ii locust began development in 1941 after british war office requested that american government design a purpose built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support british airborne forces war office had originally selected light tank mark vii tetrarch light tank for use by airborne forces but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so war office believed that a purpose built tank would be required to replace it united states ordnance department was asked to produce this replacement which in turn selected marmon herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in may 1941 prototype was designated light tank t9 airborne and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a douglas c 54 skymaster transport aircraft although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a general aircraft hamilcar glider after a series of modifications were made to initial prototype production of t9 began in april 1943 it was significantly delayed however when several faults were found with tank s design marmon herrington only began to produce significant numbers of t9 in late 1943 and early 1944 and by then design was considered to be obsolete only 830 were built by time production ended in february 1945 as a result ordnance department gave tank specification number m22 but no combat units were equipped with it however war office believed that tank would perform adequately despite its faults so tank was given title of locust and 260 were shipped to great britain under lend lease act seventeen locusts were received by 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment in late 1943 but mechanical problems led to tanks being withdrawn in favour of tetrarchs previously used by regiment in october 1944 however remaining tetrarchs of regiment were replaced by locusts and eight were used during operation varsity in march 1945 tanks did not perform well in action several were damaged during landing process and one was knocked out by a german self propelled gun only two locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company tanks were forced to withdraw from position after several hours however because they attracted artillery fire that caused infantry to suffer heavy casualties locust never saw active service with british army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946 a number of locusts were used by foreign militaries in post war period however belgian army used locusts as command tanks for their m4 sherman tank regiments and egyptian army used several company sized units of locusts during 1948 arab israeli war development history background light tank airborne m22 also known as locust began development in late 1941 in response to a request by british military earlier in year for an airmobile light tank which could be transported onto a battlefield by glider flint p 22 at time request was made war office considered using equipment in britain s fledgling airborne forces which had been formed in june 1940 by order of prime minister winston churchill otway p 21 when officials at war office examined equipment that would be required for a british airborne division they decided that gliders would be an integral component of such a force these gliders would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank flint p 15 plans to transport an airborne tank went through a number of revisions but by may 1941 it was considered feasible for a tank weighing to be carried for in a glider although latter would have to be specifically designed for task in a conference held on january 16 1941 it was decided that general aircraft hamilcar under development at time would be used to transport a single tank or two universal carriers flint pp 15 16 a decision had recently been made by war office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in british army on whole they had performed poorly during battle of france and were considered to be a liability as a result vickers armstrong light tank mk vii tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete this made it available for use by airborne forces and it was chosen by war office as tank to be transported by glider flint p 16 however it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile and it also possessed several faults flint p 11 its size limited possible crew to three a driver in hull and a gunner and commander in turret which was found to be too few crew members to operate tetrarch effectively gunner or commander in addition to his own duties had to act as loader for 2 pounder which caused delays in combat a report on tank written in january 1941 stated that since commander had both to fight and control tank controlling a troop of tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible war office was also aware that tank had a faulty cooling system that made tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates such as middle east and north africa flint p 13 a purpose built airborne light tank was therefore required to replace tetrarch but decision was taken by war office not to produce tank in britain due to a lack of production capacity instead american government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for tetrarch flint p 23 this request was made by british air commission in washington d c with a proposal calling for a tank of between and to be developed this being maximum weight war office had decided could be carried by current glider technology proposed tank was to have a primary armament of a main gun and secondary armament of a 30 06 browning m1919a4 and a crew of three specification also called for a maximum speed of and an operational radius of turret and front of hull were to have an armour thickness of between and and sides of tank a thickness of united states ordnance department was given task of developing proposed tank and in turn requested designs from three american companies general motors j walter christie and marmon herrington design offered by christie in mid 1941 was rejected as it failed to meet specified size requirements as was a modified design company produced in november zaloga m551 sheridan p 5 at a conference in may 1941 ordnance department chose marmon herrington design and requested that company produce a prototype tank which was completed in late 1941 it was designated light tank t9 airborne by company and ordnance department flint p 24 development t9 had a crew of three and weighed it was armed with a main gun and a coaxial 30 06 browning m1919a4 machine gun as well as two further machine guns on right hand side of bow main gun and coaxial machine gun were mounted in a powered turret which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow gun to be fired when tank was moving t9 was powered by a 162 horse power six cylinder air cooled lycoming engine and thickness of armor varied front rear and sides of hull had a thickness of while sloped portions of hull had a thickness of tank s engine was able to give it a maximum speed of t9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider a significant change from original request but instead was to be carried under belly of a douglas c 54 skymaster transport aircraft using four lifting brackets welded onto each side of hull of tank turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside c 54 and reattached once on battlefield loading took six men about twenty five minutes unloading ten minutes on top of this aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land fletcher p 72 however t9 was of correct shape weight and size to be carried inside a hamilcar glider suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that tank could be transported inside a glider if required flint pp 24 25 thumb left a hamilcar mark i glider in flight were used to transport locust into battle alt a large bulky glider with long wings in flight coming in to land on a runway it is casting a shadow to its right on runway fields can be seen behind it and there are trees and bushes in background a number of changes were made to prototype during testing main change was addition of supporting steel beams to improve and strengthen suspension of tank which increased weight to maximum weight that could be carried by a hamilcar glider flint p 25 two new prototypes were ordered by ordnance department in january 1942 and were delivered by marmon herrington in november 1942 they were both designated t9e1 new tanks incorporated a number of requested changes turret was altered in shape it was lightened by removal of power traverse mechanism and gyro stabilizer for main armament front of hull was altered from a stepped appearance to a more sloped profile which would provide for a better ballistic shape two 30 06 machine guns were removed from bow of tank and suspension was altered to try and reduce weight of design however contrary to normal practice ordnance department had placed an order for original t9 design in april 1942 before t9e1 models were delivered in november 1942 500 were ordered in april and this order rapidly increased to a total of 1900 with deliveries to begin in november however production difficulties and design changes caused this date to be delayed several times and it was not until april 1943 that production on t9 actually began production of t9 peaked at 100 tanks produced per month between august 1943 and january 1944 however this number rapidly declined when results of british and american testing programmes were reported to ordnance department and only 830 were ever produced flint p 26 faults discovered with design led to ordnance department giving it specification number m22 but classing it as limited standard no american combat units were equipped with tank although some of those produced were used for training purposes and two experimental units were formed and equipped with locusts 151st airborne tank company was formed on 15 august 1943 despite concerns that there would be insufficient transport aircraft to deliver unit into battle and 28th airborne tank battalion was also formed in december of same year however neither unit saw combat due to us army s lack of interest in using them in an airborne capacity 151st airborne tank company remained in united states shuttling from base to base throughout war and 28th airborne tank battalion was refitted with conventional tanks in october 1944 zaloga m551 sheridan pp 7 8 some 25 locusts were ordered in april 1944 for use in european theater of operations and delivered by september although a small number were sent to united states sixth army group in alsace france for testing they were never used in combat zaloga m551 sheridan pp 8 10 however british still required m22 as a replacement for tetrarch and first prototype locust was shipped to britain in may 1942 for testing followed by second prototype t9e1 in july 1943 flint p 27 although they were of opinion that m22 possessed a number of faults war office believed it would perform adequately as an airborne tank thus tank received official title of locust and 260 were shipped to britain under lend lease act majority of locusts ended up placed in tank parks until they were scrapped at end of conflict and only eight ever saw action with british airborne forces flint pp 27 28 faults extensive testing of m22 occurred in 1943 and 1944 and was conducted by both ordnance department and british armoured fighting vehicle afv gunnery school at lulworth ranges these tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with locust afv school noted that process of loading m22 into a c 54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved use of complex equipment overall process took six untrained men 24 minutes although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training unloading was also a long process taking approximately ten minutes it was noted that time it took to unload m22 from a c 54 on battlefield meant that both tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire fletcher p 72 operational use of tank would therefore be restricted to availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden c 54 which might not be in right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation a heavy transport aircraft fairchild c 82 packet was developed to specifically carry m22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam shell doors but it did not enter service until after war had ended zaloga m551 sheridan p 8 us army armored board released a critical report on locust in september 1943 stating that it was inadequate in areas of reliability and durability and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations zaloga m551 sheridan p 6 by 1944 it was also realized that design of tank was actually obsolete armor of m22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting armor piercing ammunition of a 50 caliber machine gun complaints were also made about 37mm main armament which was not powerful enough to penetrate armor of most tanks used by axis powers similarly a report made on march 13 1944 by elements of 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment complained that when a high explosive shell was fired from gun resulting shell burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted flint p 162 there were also mechanical problems with design which caused it to be unreliable engine was also found to be underpowered possibly due to problems with torque characteristics of engine or an inefficient transmission system operational history world war ii initial service by late 1941 several new british units had been raised specifically trained to conduct airborne operations largest such unit was newly formed 1st airborne division and on 19 january 1942 war office took decision that a light tank detachment would be amongst support units attached to division designated light tank squadron this unit was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to fore of division using their speed to capture objectives and hold them until relieved by other units flint pp 75 76 unit chosen for conversion into light tank squadron was c special services squadron which had seen service as an independent tank unit during operation ironclad invasion of madagascar in mid 1942 squadron was also equipped with tetrarchs which had recently been re designated as an airborne tank by war office c squadron was officially transferred to 1st airborne division on 24 june 1942 bringing with it seven tetrarchs amongst other vehicles it was equipped with flint p 77 unit immediately began training but did not stay attached to 1st airborne division for very long during mid 1943 division was transported to middle east where it would eventually participate in operation husky allied invasion of island of sicily c squadron remained in britain however as not enough hamilcar gliders had yet been built to transport and deploy all of their tetrarchs flint p 80 thumb light tank mk vii tetrarch with littlejohn adaptor fitzsimons p 1753 tetrarch was originally used by british airborne forces but was eventually replaced by locust alt a small squat tank sits in a field its left hand tracks facing camera its gun barrel has been lengthened with a metal extension a man in uniform with a black beret stands next to it in background fields can be seen to left and several houses to right squadron was transferred to division with which it would spend rest of war 6th airborne division raised in april 1943 squadron continued to train as an air portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with duties it would perform including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter attacks against enemy infantry and armor flint pp 83 84 in mid july an american pilot was sent to britain to illustrate that tank could fit inside a hamilcar and be landed zaloga m551 sheridan p 10 and then on october 25 light tank squadron received a shipment of seventeen locusts during november new tanks were issued to squadron replacing a majority of tetrarchs however a small number of tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch 76 2 mm infantry support howitzer which were designated as tetrarch 1 cs close support were retained flint p 83 several of locusts also were fitted with littlejohn adaptors to increase range and penetration power of their main armament although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached squadron squadron was expanded into 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment in december 1943 and as late as march 1944 plans were made for regiment to be equipped with seventeen locusts and three tetrarchs when it took part in operation tonga british airborne landings in normandy however records indicate that by april hamilcar gliders of regiment were being refitted to only carry tetrarchs and by late march locusts appear to have been completely replaced this seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with locusts as well as specific problems with design of locust s gearbox regiment took part in operation tonga as part of 6th airlanding brigade in june 1944 equipped with twenty tetrarchs flint p 106 however due to their thin armor and underpowered armament they proved to be completely outclassed by tanks and self propelled guns deployed by german forces such as panzer iv and sturmgeschutz iii flint pp 122 123 by august in preparation for 6th airborne division s participation in planned breakout from normandy bridgehead majority of tetrarchs in a squadron were replaced with cromwell fast cruiser tanks only three tetrarchs were retained remaining with headquarters troop of a squadron flint p 125 in september division returned to britain and in first week of october 1944 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment underwent an extensive reorganization regiment was completely restructured and retired all remaining tetrarch tanks it was equipped with replacing them with locusts flint p 138 operation varsity in march 1945 6th airborne division was informed that it would be participating in operation varsity an airborne operation in support of 21st army group crossing river rhine during operation plunder on march 24 division in conjunction with american united states 17th airborne division would be dropped by parachute and glider near city of wesel where it would capture strategically important village of hamminkeln several important bridges over river ijssel and southern portion of a major forest diersfordter wald otway pp 302 303 eight locusts from regiment divided into two troops of four would land with 6th airlanding brigade in landing zone p east of diersfordter wald and west of hamminkeln acting as a divisional reserve rest of regiment would arrive by road after crossing rhine with 21st army group flint p 152 thumb locust in action during operation varsity march 1945 alt a locust tank facing right on a road that cuts through a field several uniformed men move

24 march were towed from airfield by handley page halifax heavy bombers to join rest of gliders and transport aircraft carrying two airborne divisions weather conditions for operation were excellent with clear visibility and all eight gliders arrived in vicinity of landing zone without incident flint p 153 during their attempts to land however small force was severely depleted one glider broke away from halifax towing it and disintegrated apparently as a result of structural failure with locust inside it falling to ground flint p 154 three more gliders came under heavy german anti aircraft fire and crashed as they landed one tank survived with a damaged machine gun another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action and third broke loose of glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret rendering it useless flint pp 155 156 six locusts landed intact on landing zone including several with significant damage but two of these tanks did not reach rendezvous point chosen for regiment one undamaged tank came to aid of a group of american paratroopers who were under fire from a german self propelled gun but was rapidly knocked out by german vehicle wounding two crewmembers a second tank broke down as it attempted to tow a jeep out of a crashed glider although crew remained with tank and supported british airborne troops in area flint p 156 of four locusts that reached rendezvous point only two were undamaged and fully fit for action these two were immediately deployed to high ground east of diersfordter wald while being covered by two damaged tanks upon arrival they were engaged by german troops and had to be supported by an infantry company and soon their presence began attracting a great deal of artillery and anti tank fire flint p 157 although neither of tanks were hit a number of infantrymen were killed or wounded and after several hours tanks were forced to withdraw four tanks and remaining infantry formed a small force that repelled several german attacks on their position and were eventually relieved at 10 30 by a tank squadron from 44th royal tank regiment and elements of rest of 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment flint p 158 post war thumb damaged m22 locust in negba israel alt a beige coloured locust tank faces camera with its gun barrel pointing upwards slightly its right hand track

varsity was only time locust was used in action with 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment or british army as a whole a report issued at end of a conference held by director air of war office in january 1946 confirmed that locust design was considered obsolete any light tanks to be used in post war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs flint p 192 british army disposed of a small number of locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries several had their main armaments removed and were used by belgian army as command tanks for their m4 sherman regiments and a few locusts even found their way back to u s where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors flint p 193 a larger number of locusts served with egyptian army replacing a number of older tank models such as vickers armstrong mark v light tank that egyptian military had acquired during interwar period zaloga armour of middle east wars pp 4 5 several company sized units
