abd al malik ibn marwan ibn al hakam june july 646 9 october 705 was fifth umayyad caliph ruling from april 685 until his death a member of first generation of born muslims his early life in medina was occupied with pious pursuits he held administrative and military posts under caliph mu awiya i founder of umayyad caliphate and his own father caliph marwan i by time of abd al malik s accession umayyad authority had collapsed across caliphate as a result of second muslim civil war and had been reconstituted in syria and egypt during his father s reign following a failed invasion of iraq in 686 abd al malik focused on securing syria before making further attempts to conquer greater part of caliphate from his principal rival mecca based caliph abd allah ibn al zubayr to that end he concluded an unfavorable truce with reinvigorated byzantine empire in 689 quashed a coup attempt in damascus by his kinsman al ashdaq following year and reincorporated into army rebellious qaysi tribes of jazira upper mesopotamia in 691 he then conquered zubayrid iraq and dispatched his general al hajjaj ibn yusuf to mecca where he killed ibn al zubayr in late 692 thereby reuniting caliphate under abd al malik s rule war with byzantium resumed resulting in umayyad advances into anatolia and armenia destruction of carthage and recapture of kairouan launchpad for later conquests of western north africa and iberian peninsula in 698 in east abd al malik s viceroy al hajjaj firmly established caliph s authority in iraq and khurasan stamping out opposition by kharijites and arab tribal nobility by 702 abd al malik s final years were marked by a domestically peaceful and prosperous consolidation of power in a significant departure from his predecessors rule over caliphate s provinces was centralized under abd al malik following elimination of his rivals gradually loyalist arab troops from syria were tasked with maintaining order in provinces as dependence on less reliable local arab garrisons receded tax surpluses from provinces were forwarded to damascus and traditional military stipends to veterans of early muslim conquests and their descendants were abolished salaries being restricted to those in active service most consequential of abd al malik s reforms were introduction of a single islamic currency in place of byzantine and sasanian coinage and establishment of arabic as language of bureaucracy in place of greek and persian in syria and iraq respectively his muslim upbringing conflicts with external and local christian forces and rival claimants to islamic leadership all influenced abd al malik s efforts to proscribe a distinctly islamic character to umayyad state another manifestation of this initiative was his founding of dome of rock in jerusalem earliest archaeologically attested religious monument built by a muslim ruler and possessor of earliest epigraphic proclamations of islam and prophet muhammad foundations established by abd al malik enabled his son and successor al walid i who largely maintained his father s policies to oversee umayyad caliphate s territorial and economic zenith abd al malik s centralized government became prototype of later medieval muslim states early life abd al malik was born in june july 646 in house of his father marwan ibn al hakam in medina his mother was a isha a daughter of mu awiya ibn al mughira his parents belonged to banu umayya one of strongest and wealthiest clans of quraysh tribe islamic prophet muhammad was a member of quraysh but was ardently opposed by tribe before they embraced islam in 630 not long after quraysh came to dominate muslim politics abd al malik belonged to first generation of born muslims and his upbringing in medina islam s political center at time was generally described as pious and rigorous by traditional muslim sources he took a deep interest in islam and possibly memorized qur an abd al malik s father was a senior aide of their umayyad kinsman caliph uthman in 656 abd al malik witnessed uthman s assassination in medina an event that had a lasting effect on him according to historian a a dixon six years later he distinguished himself in a campaign against byzantines as commander of a naval unit he was appointed to role by his distant cousin caliph mu awiya i founder of umayyad caliphate afterward he returned to medina where he operated as an assistant of his father who had become governor of city as with rest of umayyads in hejaz western arabia abd al malik lacked close ties with mu awiya who ruled from his power base in damascus in syria mu awiya belonged to sufyanid line of umayyad clan while abd al malik belonged to larger abu al as line when a revolt broke out in medina in 683 against mu awiya s son and successor caliph yazid i umayyads including abd al malik were expelled from city revolt was part of wider anti umayyad rebellion that became known as second muslim civil war on way to umayyad capital in syria abd al malik encountered army of muslim ibn uqba who had been sent by yazid to subdue rebels in medina he provided ibn uqba intelligence about medina s defenses rebels were defeated at battle of al harra in august 683 but army withdrew to syria after yazid s death later that year deaths of yazid and his son and successor mu awiya ii in relatively quick succession in 683 684 precipitated a leadership vacuum in damascus and consequent collapse of umayyad authority across caliphate most provinces declared their allegiance to rival mecca based caliph abd allah ibn al zubayr in parts of syria older established arab tribes who had secured a privileged position in umayyad court and military in particular banu kalb scrambled to preserve umayyad rule marwan and his family including abd al malik had since relocated to syria where marwan met pro umayyad stalwart ubayd allah ibn ziyad who had just been expelled from his governorship in iraq ibn ziyad persuaded marwan to forward his candidacy for caliphate during a summit of pro umayyad tribes in jabiya hosted by kalbi chieftain ibn bahdal tribal nobility elected marwan as caliph and latter became dependent on kalb and its allies who collectively became known as yaman in reference to their ostensibly shared south arabian yamani roots their power came at expense of qaysi tribes relative newcomers who had come to dominate northern syria and jazira under mu awiya i and had defected to ibn al zubayr qays were routed by marwan and his yamani backers at battle of marj rahit in 684 leading to a long standing blood feud and rivalry between two tribal coalitions abd al malik did not participate in battle on religious grounds according to contemporary poems compiled in anthology of abu tammam d 845 reign accession abd al malik was a close adviser of his father he was headquartered in damascus and became its deputy governor during marwan s expedition to conquer zubayrid egypt in late 684 upon caliph s return in 685 he held a council in sinnabra where he appointed abd al malik governor of palestine and designated him as his chosen successor to be followed by abd al malik s brother abd al aziz this designation abrogated succession arrangements reached in jabiya which stipulated yazid s son khalid would succeed marwan followed by another umayyad former governor of medina amr ibn sa id al ashdaq nonetheless marwan secured oaths of allegiance to abd al malik from yamani nobility while historian gerald hawting notes that abd al malik was nominated despite his relative lack of political experience dixon maintains he was chosen because of his political ability and his knowledge of statecraft and provincial administration as indicated by his gradual advance in holding important posts from an early age marwan died in april 685 and abd al malik s accession as caliph was peacefully managed by yamani nobles he was proclaimed caliph in jerusalem according to a report by 9th century historian khalifa ibn khayyat which modern historian elad considers to be seemingly reliable at time of his accession critical posts were held by members of abd al malik s family his brother muhammad was charged with suppressing qaysi tribes while abd al aziz maintained peace and stability as governor of egypt until his death in 705 during this period abd al malik heavily relied on yamani nobles of syria including ibn bahdal al kalbi and ibn al who played key roles in his administration latter served as equivalent to chief minister or wazir of later abbasid caliphs furthermore a yamani always headed abd al malik s shurta elite security retinue first to hold post was yazid ibn abi al and he was followed by another yamani ka b ibn hamid al ansi caliph s haras personal guard was typically led by a mawla

and blue represent territories of his respective rivals al mukhtar and ibn al zubayr areas shaded in yellow represent territory controlled by kharijites though umayyad rule had been restored in syria and egypt abd al malik faced several challenges to his authority most provinces of caliphate continued to recognize ibn al zubayr while qaysi tribes regrouped under zufar ibn al harith al kilabi and resisted umayyad rule in jazira from al qarqisiya a euphrates river fortress strategically located at crossroads of syria and iraq failure in iraq re establishing umayyad rule across caliphate was major priority of abd al malik his initial focus was reconquest of iraq caliphate s wealthiest province iraq was also home to a large population of arab tribesmen group from which caliphate derived bulk of its troops in contrast egypt which provided significant income to treasury possessed a small arab community and was thus a meager source of troops demand for soldiers was pressing for umayyads as backbone of their military syrian army remained fractured along yamani and qaysi lines though roughly 6 000 yamani soldiers of abd al malik s predecessor were able to consolidate umayyad position in syria they were too few to reassert authority throughout caliphate ibn ziyad a key figure in establishment of marwanid power set about enlarging army by recruiting widely among arab tribes including those which nominally belonged to qays faction ibn ziyad had been tasked by abd al malik s father with reconquest of iraq at time iraq and its dependencies were split between pro alid forces of al mukhtar al thaqafi in kufa and forces of ibn al zubayr s brother mus ab in basra in august 686 ibn ziyad s 60 000 strong army was routed at battle of khazir and he was slain alongside most of his deputy commanders at hands of al mukhtar s much smaller pro alid force led by ibrahim ibn al ashtar decisive defeat and loss of ibn ziyad represented a major setback to abd al malik s ambitions in iraq he refrained from further major campaigns in province for next five years during which mus ab defeated and killed al mukhtar and his supporters and became iraq s sole ruler abd al malik shifted his focus to consolidating control of syria his efforts in iraq had been undermined by qaysi yamani schism when a qaysi general in ibn ziyad s army umayr ibn al al sulami defected with his men mid battle to join zufar s rebellion umayr s subsequent campaign against large christian banu taghlib tribe in jazira sparked a series of tit for tat raids and further deepened arab tribal divisions previously neutral taghlib throwing in its lot with yaman and umayyads taghlib killed umayr in 689 and delivered his head to abd al malik byzantine attacks and treaty of 689 along syria s northern frontier byzantines had been on offensive since failure of first arab siege of constantinople in 678 in 679 a thirty year peace treaty was concluded obliging umayyads to pay an annual tribute of 3 000 gold coins 50 horses and 50 slaves and withdraw their troops from forward bases they had occupied on byzantine coast outbreak of muslim civil war allowed byzantine emperor constantine iv to extort territorial concessions and enormous tribute from umayyads in 685 emperor led his army to mopsuestia in cilicia and prepared to cross border into syria where mardaites an indigenous christian group were already causing considerable trouble with his own position insecure abd al malik concluded a treaty whereby he would pay a tribute of 1 000 gold coins a horse and a slave for every day of year

locations map of arab byzantine frontier zone during 7th 10th centuries with major fortresses indicated under justinian ii byzantines became more aggressive though it is unclear whether they intervened directly as reported by 9th century muslim historian al baladhuri or used mardaites to mount pressure on muslims their depredations extended throughout syria as far south as mount lebanon and galilee uplands these raids culminated with short lived byzantine recapture of antioch in 688 setbacks in iraq had weakened umayyads and when a new treaty was concluded in 689 it greatly favoured byzantines according to 9th century byzantine chronicler theophanes confessor treaty repeated tribute obligations of 685 but now byzantium and umayyads established a condominium over cyprus armenia and caucasian iberia modern georgia revenue from which was to be shared between two states in exchange byzantium undertook to resettle mardaites in its own territory 12th century syriac chronicler michael syrian however mentions that armenia and adharbayjan were to come under full byzantine control in reality as latter regions were not held by umayyads at this point agreement probably indicates a carte blanche by abd al malik to byzantines to proceed against zubayrid forces there this arrangement suited both sides abd al malik weakened his opponent s forces and secured his northern frontier and byzantines gained territory and reduced power of side that was apparently winning muslim civil war about 12 000 mardaites were indeed resettled in byzantium but many remained behind only submitting to umayyads in reign of al walid i their presence disrupted umayyad supply lines and obliged them to permanently keep troops on standby to guard against their raids byzantine counteroffensive represented first challenge against a muslim power by a people defeated in early muslim conquests moreover mardaite raids demonstrated to abd al malik and his successors that state could no longer depend on quiescence of syria s christian majority which until then had largely refrained from rebellion modern historian khalid yahya blankinship described treaty of 689 as an onerous and completely humiliating pact and surmised that abd al malik s ability to pay annual tribute in addition to financing his own wartime army relied on treasury funds accrued during campaigns of his sufyanid predecessors and revenues from egypt revolt of al ashdaq and end of qaysi rebellion in 689 90 abd al malik used respite from truce to initiate a campaign against zubayrids of iraq but was forced to return to damascus when al ashdaq and his loyalists abandoned army s camp and seized control of city al ashdaq viewed abd al malik s accession as a violation of caliphal succession agreement reached in jabiya abd al malik besieged his kinsman for sixteen days and promised him safety and significant political concessions if he relinquished city though al ashdaq agreed to terms and surrendered abd al malik remained distrustful of former s ambitions and executed him personally zufar s control of al qarqisiya despite earlier attempts to dislodge him by ibn ziyad in 685 86 and caliph s governor in homs aban ibn al walid ibn uqba in 689 90 remained an obstacle to caliph s ambitions in iraq moreover in revenge for umayr s slaying zufar had intensified his raids and inflicted heavy casualties on caliph s tribal allies in jazira abd al malik resolved to command siege of al qarqisiya in person in summer of 691 and ultimately secured defection of zufar and pro zubayrid qays in return for privileged positions in umayyad court and army integration of qaysi rebels strongly reinforced syrian army and umayyad authority was restored in jazira from then onward abd al malik and his immediate successors attempted to balance interests of qays and yaman in umayyad court and army this represented a break from preceding seven years during which yaman and particularly kalb were dominant force of army defeat of zubayrids thumb upright 1 3 alt an old photograph showing a black cubic structure enclosed by rectangular arcade surrounded by buildings and hills ka aba in mecca

malik was free to focus on reconquest of iraq while mus ab had been bogged down fighting kharijite rebels and contending with disaffected arab tribesmen in basra and kufa abd al malik was secretly contacting and winning over these same arab nobles thus by time abd al malik led syrian army into iraq in 691 struggle to recapture province was virtually complete command of army was held by members of his family his brother muhammad leading vanguard and yazid i s sons khalid and abd allah leading right and left wings respectively many syrian nobles held reservations about campaign and counseled abd al malik not to participate in person nonetheless caliph was at head of army when it camped opposite mus ab s forces at maskin along dujayl canal in ensuing battle of maskin most of mus ab s forces many of whom were resentful at heavy toll he had exacted on al mukhtar s kufan partisans refused to fight and his leading commander ibn al ashtar fell at beginning of hostilities abd al malik invited mus ab to surrender in return for governorship of iraq or any other province of his choice but latter refused and was killed in action following his victory abd al malik received allegiance of kufa s nobility and appointed governors to caliphate s eastern provinces afterward he dispatched a 2 000 strong syrian contingent to subdue ibn al zubayr in hejaz commander of expedition al hajjaj ibn yusuf had risen through ranks and would become a highly competent and efficient supporter of caliph al hajjaj remained encamped for several months in ta if east of mecca and fought numerous skirmishes with zubayrid loyalists in plain of arafat abd al malik sent him reinforcements led by his mawla tariq ibn amr who had earlier captured medina from its zubayrid governor in march 692 al hajjaj besieged ibn al zubayr in mecca and bombarded ka aba holiest sanctuary in islam with catapults though 10 000 of ibn al zubayr s supporters including his sons eventually surrendered and received pardons ibn al zubayr and a core of his loyalists held out in ka aba and were killed by al hajjaj s troops in september or october ibn al zubayr s death marked end of civil war and reunification of caliphate under abd al malik in a panegyric that literary historian suzanne stetkevych asserts was intended to declare and legitimize abd al malik s victory caliph s christian court poet al akhtal eulogized him on eve or aftermath of ibn al zubayr s fall as follows to a man whose gifts do not elude us whom god has made victorious so let him in his victory long delight he who wades into deep of battle auspicious his caliph of god through whom men pray for rain when his soul whispers its intention to him it sends him resolutely forth his courage and his caution like two keen blades in him common weal resides and after his assurance no peril can seduce him from his pledge al akhtal 640 708 al tribe has departed after his victory abd al malik aimed to reconcile with hejazi elite including zubayrids and alids umayyads rivals within quraysh he relied on banu makhzum another qurayshi clan as his intermediaries in view of umayyad family s absence in region due to their exile in 683 nevertheless he remained wary of hejazi elite s ambitions and kept a vigilant eye on them through his various governors in medina first of these was al hajjaj who was also appointed governor of yemen and yamama central arabia and led hajj pilgrim caravans of 693 and 694 though he maintained peace in hejaz harshness of his rule led to numerous complaints from its residents and may have played a role in his transfer from post by abd al malik a member of makhzum and abd al malik s father in law hisham ibn isma il was ultimately appointed during his tenure in 701 706 he was also known for brutalizing medina s townspeople consolidation in iraq and east despite his victory control and governance of iraq a politically turbulent province from time of muslim conquest in 630s continued to pose a major challenge for abd al malik he had withdrawn syrian army and entrusted to iraqis defense of basra from kharijite threat most iraqis had become weary of conflict with kharijites which had brought them little but hardship and loss according to gibb those from kufa in particular had grown accustomed to wealth and comfort of their lives at home and their reluctance to undertake lengthy campaigns far from their families was an issue that previous rulers of iraq had consistently encountered initially caliph appointed his brother bishr governor of kufa and another kinsman khalid ibn abdallah to basra before latter too was put under bishr s jurisdiction neither governor was up to task but iraqis eventually defeated kharijites in yamama in 692 93 azariqa kharijites in persia were more difficult to rein in and following bishr s death in 694 iraqi troops deserted field against them at abd al malik s attempt at family rule in iraq had proven unsuccessful and he installed al hajjaj in post instead in 694 kufa and basra were combined into a single province under al hajjaj who from start of his rule displayed a strong commitment to governing iraq effectively against azariqa al hajjaj backed al muhallab ibn abi sufra al azdi a zubayrid holdover with long experience combating kharijite rebels al muhallab finally defeated azariqa in 697 concurrently a kharijite revolt led by shabib ibn yazid al shaybani flared up in heart of iraq resulting in rebel takeover of al mada in and siege of kufa al hajjaj responded to unwillingness or inability of war weary iraqis to face kharijites by obtaining from abd al malik syrian reinforcements led by sufyan ibn al abrad al kalbi a more disciplined force syrians repelled rebel attack on kufa and killed shabib in early 697 by 698 kharijite revolts had been stamped out abd al malik attached to iraq sistan and khurasan thus making al hajjaj responsible for a super province encompassing eastern half of caliphate al hajjaj made al muhallab deputy governor of khurasan a post he held until his death in 702 after which it was bequeathed to his son yazid during his term al muhallab recommenced muslim conquests in central asia though campaign reaped few territorial gains during abd al malik s reign upon becoming governor al hajjaj immediately threatened with death any iraqi who refused to participate in war efforts against kharijites in an effort to reduce expenditure he had lowered iraqis pay to less than that of their syrian counterparts in province by his measures al hajjaj appeared almost to have goaded iraqis into rebellion as if looking for an excuse to break them according to historian hugh kennedy indeed conflict with muqatila arab tribal forces who formed iraq s garrisons came to a head beginning in 699 when al hajjaj ordered governor of kirman abd al rahman ibn muhammad ibn al ash ath to lead an expedition against zabulistan ibn al ash ath and his commanders were wealthy and leading noblemen and bristled at al hajjaj s frequent rebukes and demands and difficulties of campaign in response ibn al ash ath and his army revolted in sistan marched back and defeated al hajjaj s loyalists in tustar in 701 and entered kufa soon after al hajjaj held out in basra with his banu thaqif kinsmen and syrian loyalists who were numerically insufficient to counter unified iraqi front led by ibn al ash ath alarmed at events abd al malik offered iraqis a pay raise equal to syrians and replacement of al hajjaj with ibn al ash ath due to his supporters rejection of terms ibn al ash ath refused offer and al hajjaj took initiative routing ibn al ash ath s forces at battle of dayr al jamajim in april many of iraqis had defected after promises of amnesty if they disarmed while ibn al ash ath and his core supporters fled to zabulistan where they were dispersed in 702 suppression of revolt marked end of iraqi muqatila as a military force and beginning of syrian military domination of iraq iraqi internal divisions and utilization of disciplined syrian forces by abd al malik and al hajjaj voided iraqis attempt to reassert power in province determined to prevent further rebellions al hajjaj founded a permanent syrian garrison in wasit situated between long established iraqi garrisons of kufa and basra and instituted a more rigorous administration in province power thereafter derived from syrian troops who became iraq s ruling class while iraq s arab nobility religious scholars and mawali were their virtual subjects furthermore surplus taxes from agriculturally rich sawad lands were redirected from muqatila to abd al malik s treasury in damascus to pay syrian troops in province this reflected a wider campaign by caliph to institute greater control over caliphate renewal of byzantine wars in anatolia armenia and north africa despite ten year truce of 689 war with byzantium resumed following abd al malik s victory against ibn al zubayr in 692 decision to resume hostilities was taken by emperor justinian ii ostensibly because of his refusal to accept payment of tribute in muslim currency introduced that year rather than byzantine see below this is reported solely by theophanes and issues of chronology make this suspect not all modern scholars accept its veracity real casus belli according to both theophanes and later syriac sources was justinian s attempt to enforce his exclusive jurisdiction over cyprus and to move its population to cyzicus in northwestern anatolia contrary to treaty given enormous advantages secured by treaty for byzantium justinian s decision has been criticized by byzantine and modern historians alike however historian ralph johannes lilie points out that with abd al malik emerging victorious from civil war justinian may have felt it was only a matter of time until caliph broke treaty and resolved to strike first before abd al malik could consolidate his position further umayyads decisively defeated byzantines at battle of sebastopolis in 692 and parried a byzantine counter attack in 693 94 in direction of antioch over following years umayyads launched constant raids against byzantine territories in anatolia and armenia led by caliph s brother muhammad and his sons al walid abd allah and maslama laying foundation for further conquests in these areas under abd al malik s successors which would culminate in second arab siege of constantinople in 717 718 military defeats inflicted on justinian ii contributed to downfall of emperor and his heraclian dynasty in 695 ushering in a 22 year period of instability in which byzantine throne changed hands seven times in violent revolutions further aiding arab advance in 698 99 emperor tiberios iii secured a treaty with caliph for return of cypriots both those moved by justinian ii as well as those subsequently deported by arabs to syria to their island beginning in 700 abd al malik s brother muhammad subdued armenia in a series of campaigns armenians rebelled in 703 and received byzantine aid but muhammad defeated them and sealed failure of revolt by executing rebel princes in 705 as a result armenia was annexed into caliphate along with principalities of caucasian albania and iberia as province of arminiya meanwhile in north africa a byzantine berber alliance had reconquered ifriqiya and slain its governor uqba ibn nafi in battle of vescera in 682 abd al malik charged uqba s deputy zuhayr ibn qays to reassert arab position in 688 but after initial gains including slaying of berber ruler kasila at battle of zuhayr was driven back to barqa cyrenaica by kasila s partisans and slain by byzantine naval raiders in 695 abd al malik dispatched hassan ibn al nu man with a 40 000 strong army to retake ifriqiya hassan captured byzantine held kairouan carthage and bizerte with aid of naval reinforcements sent by emperor leontios byzantines recaptured carthage by 696 97 after byzantines were repelled carthage was captured and destroyed by hassan in 698 signaling final irretrievable end of roman power in africa according to kennedy kairouan was firmly secured as a launchpad for later conquests while port town of tunis was founded and equipped with an arsenal on orders of abd al malik who was intent on establishing a strong arab fleet hassan continued his campaign against berbers defeating them and killing their leader warrior queen al kahina sometime between 698 and 703 afterward hassan was dismissed by abd al aziz and replaced by musa ibn who went on to lead umayyad conquests of western north africa and iberian peninsula during reign of al walid final years last years of abd al malik s reign were generally characterized by sources as a domestically peaceful and prosperous consolidation of power blood feuds between qays and yaman which persisted despite former s reconciliation with umayyads in 691 had dissipated toward end of his rule dixon credits this to abd al malik s success at harnessing tribal feeling to interests of government while at same time suppressing its violent manifestations remaining principal issue faced by caliph was ensuring succession of his eldest son al walid in place of designated successor abd al aziz latter consistently refused abd al malik s entreaties to step down from line of succession but potential conflict was avoided when abd al aziz died in may 705 he was promptly replaced as governor of egypt by caliph s son abd allah abd al malik died five months later on 9 october and was buried outside of bab al jabiya gate of damascus legacy thumb upright 1 75 alt a map of

successes in words of kennedy 9th century historian al yaqubi described abd al malik as courageous shrewd and sagacious but also miserly his successor al walid continued his father s policies and his rule likely marked peak of umayyad power and prosperity abd al malik s key administrative reforms reunification of caliphate and suppression of all active domestic opposition enabled major territorial expansion of caliphate during al walid s reign three other sons of abd al malik sulayman yazid ii and hisham would rule in succession until 743 interrupted only by rule of abd al aziz s son umar ii moreover with exceptions of latter and marwan ii all umayyad caliphs who came after abd al malik were directly descended from him hence references to him as father of kings in traditional muslim sources umayyad emirs and caliphs who ruled in iberian peninsula between 756 and 1031 were also his direct descendants in assessment of his biographer chase f robinson mu awiya may have introduced

was unprecedented at one point his brothers or sons held nearly all governorships of provinces and syria s districts likewise his court in damascus was filled with far more umayyads than under his sufyanid predecessors a result of clan s exile to city from medina in 683 he maintained close ties with sufyanids through marital relations and official appointments such as according yazid i s son khalid a prominent role in court and army and wedding to him his daughter a isha abd al malik also married khalid s sister atika who became his favorite and most influential wife after his victory in civil war abd al malik embarked on a far reaching campaign to consolidate umayyad rule over caliphate collapse of umayyad authority precipitated by mu awiya i s death made it apparent to abd al malik that decentralized sufyanid system was unsustainable moreover despite defeat of his muslim rivals his dynasty remained domestically and externally insecure prompting a need to legitimize its existence according to blankinship abd al malik s solution to fractious tribalism which defined his predecessors caliphate was to centralize power at same time his response to byzantine christian resurgence and criticism of muslim religious circles which dated from beginning of umayyad rule and culminated with outbreak of civil war was to implement islamization measures centralized administration established by abd al malik became prototype of later medieval muslim states according to wellhausen government evidently became more technical and hierarchical under abd al malik though not nearly to extent of later abbasid caliphs as opposed to freewheeling governing style of sufyanids abd al malik ruled strictly over his officials and kept interactions with them largely formal he put an end to provinces retention of lion s share of surplus tax revenues as had been case under sufyanids and had them redirected to caliphal treasury in damascus abd al malik may have inaugurated several high ranking offices and muslim tradition generally credits him with organization of barid postal service whose principal purpose was to efficiently inform caliph of developments outside of damascus he built and repaired roads that connected damascus with palestine and linked jerusalem to its eastern and western hinterlands as evidenced by seven milestones found throughout region oldest of which dates to may 692 and latest to september 704 road project formed part of abd al malik s centralization drive special attention being paid to palestine due to its critical position as a transit zone between syria and egypt and jerusalem s religious centrality to caliph according to kennedy abd al malik s centralized bureaucratic empire was in many ways an impressive achievement but political economic and social divisions that developed within islamic community during his reign was to prove something of a difficult inheritance for later umayyads institution of islamic currency and arabization of bureaucracy thumb upright 1 2 alt obverse and reverse of a gold colored coin inscribed in arabic a gold dinar of abd al malik minted in damascus in 697 98 abd al malik introduced an independent islamic currency in 693 which initially bore depictions of caliph before being abandoned for coins solely containing inscriptions a major component of abd al malik s centralization and islamization measures was institution of an islamic currency byzantine gold solidus was discontinued in syria and egypt likely impetus being byzantines addition of an image of christ on their coins in 691 92 which violated muslim prohibitions on images of prophets to replace byzantine coins he introduced an islamic gold currency dinar in 693 initially new coinage contained depictions of caliph as spiritual leader of muslim community and its supreme military commander this image proved no less acceptable to muslim officialdom and was replaced in 696 or 697 with image less coinage inscribed with qur anic quotes and other muslim religious formulas in 698 99 similar changes were made to silver dirhams issued by muslims in former sasanian persian lands in eastern caliphate depictions of sasanian king were consequently removed from coinage though abd al malik s new dirham retained its characteristically sasanian silver fabric and wide flan thumb left upright 8 alt obverse of a bluish green colored glass piece inscribed in arabic a glass coin weight bearing name of servant of god abd al malik commander of faithful minted in damascus shortly after overhaul of caliphate s currency in circa 700 abd al malik is generally credited with replacement of greek with arabic as language of diwan bureaucracy in syria transition was carried out by his scribe sulayman ibn sa d al hajjaj had initiated arabization of persian diwan in iraq three years before though official language was changed greek and persian speaking bureaucrats who were versed in arabic kept their posts arabization of bureaucracy and currency was most consequential administrative reform undertaken by caliph arabic ultimately became sole official language of umayyad state but transition in faraway provinces such as khurasan did not occur until 740s according to gibb decree was first step towards reorganization and unification of diverse tax systems in provinces and also a step towards a more definitely muslim administration indeed it formed an important part of islamization measures that lent umayyad caliphate a more ideological and programmatic coloring it had previously lacked according to blankinship in tandem abd al malik began export of papyri containing muslim statement of belief in greek to spread islamic teachings in byzantine realm this was a further testament to ideological expansion of byzantine muslim struggle increasingly muslim character of state under abd al malik was partly a reflection of islam s influence in lives of caliph and chief enforcer of his policies al hajjaj both of whom belonged to first generation of rulers born and raised as muslims having spent most of their lives in hejaz theological and legal center of islam where arabic was spoken exclusively and administrative offices were held solely by arab muslims abd al malik and his viceroy only understood arabic and were unfamiliar with syrian and greek christian and persian zoroastrian officials of diwan they stood in stark contrast to sufyanid caliphs and their governors in iraq who had entered these regions as youths and whose children were as acquainted with native majority as with arab muslim newcomers according to wellhausen abd al malik was careful not to offend his pious subjects in careless fashion of caliph yazid but from time of his accession he subordinated everything to policy and even exposed ka ba to danger of destruction despite piety of his upbringing and early career dixon challenges this view attributing abbasid era muslim sources portrayal of abd al malik s transformation in character after his accession and consequent abandonment of his piety to their general hostility to abd al malik whom they variously accused of being a mean treacherous and blood thirsty person dixon nonetheless concedes that caliph disregarded his early muslim ideals when he felt political circumstances necessitated it reorganization of army abd al malik shifted away from his predecessors use of arab tribal masses in favor of an organized army likewise arab noblemen who had derived their power solely through their tribal standing and personal relations with a caliph were gradually replaced with military men who had risen through ranks these developments have been partially obscured by medieval sources due to their continued usage of arab tribal terminology when referencing army such as names of tribal confederations mudar rabi a qays and yaman according to hawting these do not represent tribes in arms utilized by earlier caliphs rather they denote army factions whose membership was often but not exclusively determined by tribal origin abd al malik also established a berber dominated private militia called al after their original commander caliph s mawla al which helped enforce authority of umayyad caliphs through reign of marwan ii under abd al malik loyalist syrian troops began to be deployed throughout caliphate to keep order which came largely at expense of tribal nobility of iraq latter s revolt under ibn al ash ath demonstrated to abd al malik unreliability of iraqi muqatila in securing central government s interests in province and its eastern dependencies it was following revolt s suppression that military became primarily composed of syrian army consecrating this transformation was a fundamental change to system of military pay whereby salaries were restricted to those in active service this marked an end to system established by caliph umar which paid stipends to veterans of earlier muslim conquests and their descendants while iraqi tribal nobility viewed stipends as their traditional right al hajjaj viewed them as a handicap restricting his and abd al malik s executive authority and financial ability to reward loyalists in army stipends were similarly stopped to inhabitants of hejaz including quraysh thus a professional army was established during abd al malik s reign whose salaries derived from tax proceeds dependence on syrian army of his successors especially hisham scattered army among caliphate s multiple and isolated war fronts most of them distant from syria growing strain and heavy losses inflicted on syrians by caliphate s external enemies and increasing factional divisions within army contributed to weakening and downfall of umayyad rule in 750 foundation of dome of rock thumb upright 1 2 alt an octagonal multi colored building upper trim of which is inscribed in arabic topped by a golden plated dome dome of rock pictured in 2015 in jerusalem was founded by abd al malik in 691 92 in 685 86 or 688 abd al malik began planning construction of dome of rock in jerusalem its dedication inscription mentions year 691 92 which most scholars agree is completion date of building it is earliest archaeologically attested religious structure to be built by a muslim ruler and building s inscriptions contain earliest epigraphic proclamations of islam and of prophet muhammad inscriptions proved to be a milestone as afterward they became a common feature in islamic structures and almost always mention muhammad dome of rock remains a unique monument of islamic culture in almost all respects including as a work of art and as a cultural and pious document according to historian oleg grabar thumb left upright 9 alt a gray metal domed octagonal structure decorated with tiles of different colors and geometric designs supported by dark stone columns with beige colored capitals abd al malik also erected dome of chain pictured in 2013 which is adjacent to dome of rock narratives by medieval sources about abd al malik s motivations in building dome of rock vary at time of its construction caliph was engaged in war with christian byzantium and its syrian christian allies on one hand and with rival caliph ibn al zubayr who controlled mecca annual destination of muslim pilgrimage on other hand thus one series of explanations was that abd al malik intended for dome of rock to be a religious monument of victory over christians that would distinguish islam s uniqueness within common abrahamic religious setting of jerusalem home of two older abrahamic faiths judaism and christianity other main explanation holds that abd al malik in heat of war with ibn al zubayr sought to build structure to divert focus of muslims in his realm from ka aba in mecca where ibn al zubayr would publicly condemn umayyads during annual pilgrimage to sanctuary though most modern historians dismiss latter account as a product of anti umayyad propaganda in traditional muslim sources and doubt that abd al malik would attempt to alter sacred muslim requirement of fulfilling pilgrimage to ka aba other historians concede this cannot be conclusively dismissed while his sons commissioned numerous architectural works abd al malik s known building activities were limited to jerusalem as well as dome of rock he is credited with constructing adjacent dome of chain expanding boundaries of temple mount haram al sharif to include foundation stone around which dome of rock was built and building two gates of temple mount possibly mercy gate and prophet s gate theophanes possibly conserving an original syro palestinian melkite source reports that abd al malik sought to remove some columns from a christian shrine at gethsemane to rebuild ka aba but he was dissuaded by his christian treasurer ibn mansur father of john of damascus and another leading christian called patrikios from palestine who successfully petitioned emperor justinian ii to supply other columns

damascus and seasonal residences in its general vicinity he spent winter mostly in damascus and sinnabra near lake tiberias then to jabiya in golan heights and dayr a monastery village on slopes of mount overlooking ghouta orchards of damascus he would typically return to city in march and leave again in heat of summer to baalbek in beqaa valley before heading back to damascus in early autumn
