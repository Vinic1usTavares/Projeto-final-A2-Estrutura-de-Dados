visitante real name eduardo jose cabra martinez began creating music together in 2004 step brothers hosted their music on a website and began searching for a record label in order to release their music commercially after sending demo tapes to white lion records duo was offered a record deal duo gained recognition for their controversial song querido fbi which responded to killing of filiberto ojeda rios a key figure for puerto rican independence movement soon after querido fbi gained notoriety for calle 13 band s 2005 eponymously titled debut album was released and became commercially and critically successful in latin america group was subsequently labeled as reggaeton a genre that duo wished to distance itself from visitante commented on situation truth is that first record had only four those were cuts used for promotional purposes and so that s brand that was put on us but from beginning to me reggaeton never offered anything musically my brother liked it yes but we always tried to execute it in an organic way with real instruments and mixing it with other genres recording thumb left residente o visitante features a guest appearance by spanish rapper la mala rodriguez while writing residente o visitante duo took a trip to south america to explore areas populated by latin america s indigenous and african descended minorities residente reflected on journey stating we saw horrible things but also things that were incredibly beautiful some of contrasts are really intense duo was strongly influenced by experience visitante discovered and purchased several new musical instruments on trip including a a and a bombo all of which were used on song a mi residente and visitante felt that writing on road was conducive to group s creative output group s journeys were documented in a film entitled sin mapa which debuted on july 29 2009 at new york international latino film festival and later was released on dvd residente o visitante was recorded in various countries as band was on tour during making of album residente explained that group did not feel any pressure to compete with success of calle 13 and felt that recording of residente o visitante was a smoother process than first main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities more tools and more money we were also on tour at same time unlike first i spent my time writing during travels while my brother would write music residente was invited by la mala rodriguez to come to spain to collaborate on a song he agreed as he greatly admired la mala s work and two met for drinks where they discussed kind of song they wanted to create before going to studio to record what would later become mala con el 13 composition music on record band wished to experiment more with live instruments and diverse styles of music margarita diaz of ny daily news referred to residente o visitante as an exhilarating travelogue through sounds and rhythms of south america visitante who composed music on album credits musical diversity to his past he began playing classical piano at age six and at age 17 he joined a varied array of bands and played saxophone and keyboards residente o visitante features more guest artists than band s debut including collaborations with musicians such as tego calderon la mala rodriguez and orishas introduction to album as described by elijah wald of los angeles times sounds like a lovely baroque chorale unless one speaks spanish in which case it becomes immediately evident that it s an ornate canon of filthiest words in puerto rican street slang tango del pecado mixes tango and reggaeton and has been referred to as tango ton song features argentinian music producer gustavo santaolalla and his tango club puerto rican rapper tego calderon is featured on sin exagerar which contains guitar influenced by surf rock additionally song cumbia de los aburridos is strongly influenced by colombian cumbia music featuring an accordion and a horn section un beso de desayuno mixes electronica rap and bossa nova lyrics residente described album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor with lyrics on record residente aimed for authenticity attempting to tackle subjects not typically discussed in conventional reggaeton he explained that listening to residente o visitante is similar to watching a movie in sense that album depicts real life events and uses profanity to evoke emotion in listener leila cobo of billboard wrote that lyrical content of residente o visitante ranges from sophomoric humor to outright perversion song mala suerte con el 13 group s collaboration with la mala rodriguez is a satire of latin macho attitude he wished to defy and poke fun at traditional gender roles citing feminist philosopher judith butler as an influence i wanted to record a duet between a guy who s weak and inadequate and a woman who s a sexual psychopath and has all power in world a complete mockery of macho stereotypes in same vein sin exagerar parodies misogyny that residente felt had saturated reggaeton scene album s lead single tango del pecado is addressed to parents of residente s then girlfriend former miss universe denise quinones who did not approve of couple s relationship he explains that song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions and author ed morales observes that it s a calling out of morality of latin america it s just an invitation to turn everything upside down by embracing ugly and profane in life and you know asking people to go on that journey tango del pecado also created controversy due to repeated chanting of el volumen a la musica turn up satanic music residente asserts that he did not add line to create a reaction saying i never do something expecting something i do things because i like them el avion se cae depicts thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger in pal norte residente discusses plight of immigrants in united states commenting on track s lyrical themes he explained i had wanted to do that theme because i think it is an important topic and not just for immigrants in united states but all over it is a song that immigrants can identify with dominicans as well as puerto ricans all people leave one country for another for same reasons although much of album addresses immigration and moving to different countries la crema is a celebration of living in puerto rico title and artwork thumb album s title was inspired by visitante s left experiences of visiting his step brother residente right as a child album s name was inspired by an experience from residente and visitante s childhood when they were children visitante would visit his brother at calle 13 13th street of el conquistador subsection of trujillo alto puerto rico every week since subsection is a gated community visitors were routinely asked residente o visitante resident or visitor by a security guard when approaching community s main gate therefore visitante would identify himself as a visitor while residente would have to insist that he was a resident to clear gate pair named themselves calle 13 after street their family s house was on title is also meant to refer to status of immigrants in united states a recurring theme on record album cover depicts a winged virgin with a canteen on her chest resembling sacred heart of jesus residente noted that image represents hispanic immigrants coming to united states in an attempt to both sanctify immigrants and humanize holy images common in latin america an image inside cd booklet features residente with stigmata in his hands he noted that photo is intended to portray jesus as a regular guy who deals with struggles similar to those of people crossing borders he further commented obviously art of cd is not made for people who are used to seeing guy with chick in a bikini in a car with all her jewelry we don t come here to people more release and reception chart

out of 5 stars noting disc s diverse musical styles and unique lyricism residente is a gifted rapper who matches eminem in terms of wit and playfulness while visitante is a similarly gifted producer

calling his performance a revelation and referring to song un beso de desayuno as band s most noble achievement a fully formed reggaeton love song however casillas felt that album was overly long and stated that sounds like donald duck on a treadmill olivia munoz of philadelphia inquirer referred to record as weird seductive thought provoking and hilarious all at once and despite noting unconventional lyrical themes she deemed many of songs to be surprisingly danceable phil freeman of village voice called album more thoughtful and musically broad minded than its predecessor and noted that album gave residente a platform for a more explicit political consciousness than some might have predicted referring to songs pal norte and la cumbia de los aburridos agustin gurza of los angeles times opined that album is more mature though no less outrageous than band s debut and referred to tango del pecado and pal norte as two of most memorable songs of year nuria net of vibe felt that cutting edge appeal of debut album was reduced to vulgar lyrics on residente o visitante writing though this second album shows impressive breadth swaying from reggaeton to cumbia to tango calle 13 s
