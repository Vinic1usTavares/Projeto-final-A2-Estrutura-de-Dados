conquest of belgrade is an oil painting by romanticist katarina ivanovic one of serbia s first significant female painters painted in 1844 45 it depicts capture of belgrade by serbian revolutionaries in late 1806 during first serbian uprising ivanovic was inspired to create painting upon reading a book titled history of serb people while studying at munich academy painting was poorly received by belgrade s art critics art historian lilien filipovitch robinson suggests this was due to its poor compositional and spatial conception by 1870s ivanovic s works had largely been forgotten in serbia conquest of belgrade was one of four paintings offered by ivanovic to gallery of historical portraits in 1874 gallery went on to form nucleus of what was to become national museum of serbia painting is currently in possession of national museum background according to david a norris a scholar specializing in serbian cultural history conditions in 19th century serbia were unsuitable for development of visual art materials were difficult to come by studio and exhibition spaces were virtually non existent and there were no art patrons willing to financially support painters and purchase their finished works in first half of 19th century serbian visual artists dedicated themselves almost exclusively to decorating walls of churches and producing icons and other religious objects there were some painters of serb heritage living outside serbia such as uros knezevic and jovan popovic who resided in austrian empire another one of these artists was romanticist katarina ivanovic who was born in szekesfehervar in either 1811 or 1817 and was first significant serbian female painter she left szekesfehervar around 1835 and went to budapest to study painting under master jozsef pesky she remained in budapest for much of 1835 later that year she found a patron a baroness by name of czacki in late 1835 baroness funded ivanovic s move to vienna precisely what her training entailed is unknown but since women were not admitted into academy of fine arts at time it is likely that ivanovic was classified as a special student and tutored privately some scholars have suggested that she studied under ferdinand georg though this cannot be established with any degree of certainty since most documents pertaining to her time in vienna were destroyed in subsequent wars description and history an oil on canvas conquest of belgrade measures it depicts city s capture by serbian revolutionaries in late 1806 during first serbian uprising this proved to be one of defining battles of insurrection ivanovic had left vienna in 1840 and gone to study at munich academy possibly owing to czacki s further generosity subsequent statements suggest that ivanovic was inspired to paint conquest of belgrade around this time writing in 1873 she recalled how painting came about while studying at munich academy i started to read history of serb people i wanted to paint brave battle of mirko on my canvas with seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering city at night while muslims were celebrating bajram eid al fitr and didn t even think about any danger mirko and his comrades killed guards at town gate their rifle shots were signal for others ivanovic soon travelled to belgrade visited conversed with some of participants in belgrade s capture and examined period clothing and weaponry used in battle she created composition in 1844 45 it was painted in belgrade legacy thumb right 300px art historian lilien filipovitch robinson draws parallels between painting and theodore gericault s raft of medusa 1818 19 conquest of belgrade is only known historical composition from time period that art historian d popovich describes as second phase of ivanovic s career which lasted from 1842 to 1847 painting was not well received by belgrade critics it was compositionally and spatially poorly conceived writes popovich but quite exciting in cinnabar and ocher tones art historian zarko states that painting is typical of this phase in ivanovic s career which saw a substantial decline in quality of her scene paintings dissatisfaction with way her works were received in serbian capital prompted ivanovic to leave serbia lilien filipovitch robinson another historian compares work s romantic presentation to theodore gericault s depiction of contemporary shipwreck survivors in raft of medusa 1818 19 inasmuch as neither is a reliable documentary piece this she asserts is typical of contemporary serbian painters who did not have a long romantic tradition and therefore borrowed elements from other artists especially those from france filipovitch robinson further describes painting as highly theatrical emotional and stridently romantic in its complexity deliberate confusion slashing diagonals tenebrism and intense colouration she writes it most resembles paintings of her french romantic predecessors gericault and antoine jean gros as well as more contemporary eugene delacroix ivanovic painted very little in her final years and is said to have been largely forgotten in serbia by 1870s in june 1876 she became an honorary member of
