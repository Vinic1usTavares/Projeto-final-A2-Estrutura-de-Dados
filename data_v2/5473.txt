according to rowland another biographer mark valentine wrote that hornung seems to have regarded this period as one of most satisfying of his life return to england 1886 98 thumb a bride from bush hornung s first novel a graceful comedy of manners hornung returned to england in february 1886 before death of his father in november from a position of relative prosperity john s coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he was in financially straitened circumstances by time of his death hornung found work in london as a journalist and story writer often publishing his work under a pseudonym although in 1887 he published his first story under his own name stroke of five which appeared in belgravia magazine his work as a journalist was during period of jack ripper and series of five murders which were undertaken against a background of rising urban crime in london it was around this time that hornung developed an interest in criminal behaviour hornung had worked on novel manuscript he brought back from australia and between july and november 1890 story a bride from bush was published in five parts in cornhill magazine it was also released that year as a book his first story described by rowland as an assured graceful comedy of manners used hornung s knowledge of australia as a backdrop and device of an australian bride to examine british social behaviour novel was well received by critics in 1891 hornung became a member of two cricket clubs idlers whose members included arthur conan doyle robert barr and jerome k jerome and strand club hornung knew doyle s sister constance connie aimee monica doyle 1868 1924 whom he had met when he visited portugal connie was described by doyle s biographer andrew lycett as being attractive with pre raphaelite looks most sought after of doyle daughters by december 1892 when hornung doyle and jerome visited black museum at scotland yard hornung and connie were engaged and in 1893 hornung dedicated his second novel tiny luttrell to c a m d they were married on 27 september 1893 although doyle was not at wedding and relations between two writers were sometimes strained hornungs had a son arthur oscar in 1895 while his first name was from doyle who was also arthur s godfather boy s middle name was probably after doyle and hornung s mutual friend oscar wilde and it was by his second name that he was known in 1894 doyle and hornung began work on a play for henry irving on subject of boxing during regency doyle was initially eager and paid hornung ps50 as a down payment before he withdrew after first act had been written work was never completed like hornung s first novel tiny luttrell had australia as a backdrop and also used plot device of an australian woman in a culturally alien environment australian theme was present in his next four novels boss of 1894 guest 1894 irralie s bushranger 1896 and rogue s march 1896 in last of these hornung wrote of australian convict transport system and showed evidence of a growing fascination with motivation behind criminal behaviour and a deliberate sympathy for criminal hero as a victim of events while irralie s bushranger introduced character stingaree an oxford educated australian gentleman thief in a novel that casts doubt on conventional responses to a positive criminal character according to hornung s biographer stephen knight introducing raffles 1898 1914 thumb first raffles story was in june 1898 issue of cassell s magazine in 1898 hornung s mother died aged 72 and he dedicated his next book a series of short stories titled some persons unknown to her memory later that year hornung and his wife visited italy for six months staying in posillipo his account of location appeared in an article of may 1899 edition of cornhill magazine hornungs returned to london in early 1899 to a house in pitt street west kensington where they lived for next six years fictional character stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in cassell s magazine a j raffles character was modelled on george cecil ives a cambridge educated criminologist and talented cricketer who like raffles was a resident of albany a gentlemen s only residence in mayfair first tale of series in chains of crime was published in june that year titled ides of march stories were collected into one volume with two additional tales under name amateur cracksman which was published following year hornung used a narrative form similar to doyle s sherlock holmes stories with raffles and his partner in crime and former school fag bunny manders being criminal counterparts to holmes and dr watson although rowland writes that raffles and manders were also fictionalized versions of wilde and wilde s lover lord alfred douglas and he dedicated stories to his brother in law to a c d this form of flattery doyle had warned against writing stories and reflected in his memoirs that there are few finer examples of short story writing in our language than these though i confess i think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion i told him so before he put pen to paper and result has i fear borne me out you must not make criminal hero book was a popular and financial success although some critics also echoed doyle s fears reviewer in spectator wrote that stern moralists would consider book s premise as a new ingenious artistic but most reprehensible application of crude principles involved in old fashioned hero worship of jack sheppard and dick turpin book ends with manders imprisoned and raffles apparently dead something that left spectator reviewer expressing their satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form it is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue thumb upright left a j raffles introduced in 1898 after publishing two novels dead men tell no tales in 1899 and peccavi in 1900 hornung published a second collection of raffles stories black mask in 1901 nearly broke manders is told to apply for post of a nurse to an elderly invalid who then reveals himself to be raffles who as manders describes had aged twenty years he looked fifty at very least his hair was white there was no trick about that and his face was another white lines about corners of eyes and mouth were both many and deep in final story of collection knees of gods raffles and manders enlist in army to fight in second boer war story closes with manders wounded and raffles killed critics again complained about criminal aspect spectator declared this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral while reviewer for illustrated london news thought that hornung s invention has obviously flagged it is laughable in a sense which author never intended to hear these burglars rant about honour of old england it is a pity that man who wrote peccavi should stoop to this in 1903 hornung collaborated with eugene to write a four act play raffles amateur cracksman which was based on two previously published short stories gentlemen and players and return match play was first performed at princess theatre new york on 27 october 1903 with kyrle bellew as raffles and ran for 168 performances in 1905 after publishing four other books in interim hornung brought back character stingaree previously seen in irralie s bushranger later that year he responded to public demand and produced a third series of short raffles stories in a thief in night in which manders relates some of his and raffles s earlier adventures reviewer for boston herald thought that sentimental side of story has never before been shown so dramatically and romantically and described book as thrilling and exciting hornung s next book was published in 1909 and was final raffles story full length novel mr justice raffles book was poorly received with reviewer for observer asking if hornung is perhaps a little tired of raffles and stating that it has not magic or go of first raffles and there is no good in pretending that it has during course of year he collaborated with charles sansom to write a play a visit from raffles which was performed in november that year at brixton empress theatre london hornung turned away from raffles thereafter and in february 1911 published camera fiend a thriller whose narrator is an asthmatic cricket enthusiast with an ironmaster father much as hornung was himself story concerned attempts of a scientist to photograph soul as it left body hornung followed this up with fathers of men 1912 and thousandth woman 1913 before witching hill 1913 a collection of eight short stories in which he introduced characters and narrator gillon whom rowland considers to be reincarnations of raffles and bunny hornung s next work crime doctor 1914 marked end of his fictional output first world war and aftermath thumb upright one of hornung s two non fiction works notes of a camp follower 1919 oscar hornung left eton college in 1914 intending to enter king s college cambridge later that year when britain entered war against germany he volunteered and was commissioned into essex regiment he was killed at second battle of ypres on 6 july 1915 aged 20 although heartbroken by loss hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of oscar s letters home under title trusty and well beloved released in 1916 around this time he joined an anti aircraft unit in either 1916 or 1917 he joined ymca and did volunteer work in england for soldiers on leave in march 1917 he visited france writing a poem about his experience afterwards something he had been doing more frequently since oscar s death and a collection of his war poetry ballad of ensign joy was published later that year in july 1917 hornung s poem wooden crosses was published in times and in september bond and free appeared towards end of year he was accepted as a volunteer in a ymca canteen and library a short distance behind front line during his service in arras in february 1918 he borrowed a staff car from a friend and visited his son s grave near ypres before returning to library in arras hornung was concerned about support for pacifism among troops and wrote to his wife about it when she spoke to doyle about matter rather than discussing it with hornung he informed military authorities hornung was angered by doyle s action and told him there was no need for him to butt in except for his own satisfaction relations between two men were strained as a result hornung continued to work at library until german spring offensive in march overran british positions and he was forced to retreat firstly to amiens and then in april back to england he stayed in england until november 1918 when he again took up his ymca duties establishing a rest hut and library in cologne in 1919 hornung s account of his time spent in france notes of a camp follower on western front was published doyle later wrote of book that there are parts of it which are brilliant in their vivid portrayal while hornung s biographer alison cox described book as one of best records of war as experienced on front lines that year hornung also published his third and final volume of poetry young guard death and legacy hornung finished his work with ymca and returned to england probably in early 1919 according to rowland he worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health his wife s health was of even greater concern so in february 1921 they took a holiday in south of france to recuperate he fell ill on train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 march 1921 aged 54 he was buried in saint jean de luz in south of france in a grave adjacent to that of george gissing doyle returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of australia received news in paris and travelled south in time for funeral when hornung had still been courting doyle s sister doyle wrote that i like young willie hornung very much he is one of sweetest natured and most delicate minded men i ever knew honouring him after his death doyle wrote that he was a dr samuel johnson without learning but with a finer wit no one could say a neater thing and his writings good as they are never adequately represented powers of man nor quickness of his brain his obituarist in times described him as a man of large and generous nature a delightful companion and conversationalist thumb upright poster for 1917 film raffles amateur cracksman with john barrymore much of hornung s work fell out of favour as time passed rowland observed that all of hornung s other works have been forgotten with possible exception of stingaree but cricketing cracksman continues to enthral idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of hornung s legacies and twentieth century literary criticism states that critics have also interpreted raffles as a prototype of antihero in modern crime fiction academic frank chandler describing raffles s death writes that all his creator s attempts to portray him as a hero rather than an anti hero deservedly fail valentine highlights one aspect of stories was mix of devilry and daring demonstrated by raffles in this respect he was a literary forerunner of saint james bond and other insouciant types writer colin watson agrees and called hornung a precursor of ian fleming character continued in book form writer philip under pseudonym barry perowne obtained permission from hornung estate to continue raffles stories and seven more novels followed between 1933 and 1940 with raffles transformed from a gentleman thief to a tough adventurer perowne continued series in 1950 and 14 of his stories were published in 1974 volume raffles revisited hornung s original stories have undergone a number of reprints and when all short stories were published in a single volume graham greene considered it a splendid idea in 1975 greene had written a play based on raffles stories return of a j raffles which premiered at royal shakespeare company with denholm elliott as raffles there were several raffles films made during hornung s lifetime further films followed in years after his death including raffles amateur cracksman 1925 with house peters sr raffles 1930 featuring ronald colman return of raffles 1933 with george barraud and raffles 1939 starring david niven last of these was a samuel goldwyn productions remake of their own 1930 film which academic victor e neuburg called most memorable portrayal of character bbc has dramatised some of hornung s raffles stories for radio first in 1940s and again in 1990s when nigel havers played raffles in 1977 anthony valentine played thief and christopher his partner in a yorkshire television series a 2001 tv version gentleman thief adapted stories for a contemporary audience with havers playing lead writing style and technique thumb caricature of hornung by stuart boyd 1904 hornung s prose is widely admired for its lucid simple style oliver edwards writing in times considered that not least attractive part of raffles books is simple plain unaffected language in which each one of them is written obituarist in same newspaper agrees and thinks hornung had a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise colin watson also considers point and observes that in hornung s writing superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to point while doyle admired his sudden use of right adjective and right phrase something writer and journalist jeremy lewis sees as a flamboyant taste for vivid critics have observed that hornung s stories and novels are well structured george orwell wrote that hornung was a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must admire his work watson states that hornung s writing has pace stories however ridiculous carry readers along briskly according to cox hornung s work showed steady maturation during his career a point that doyle also agreed with although edwards disagrees and thinks crime doctor to be one of hornung s weaker books hornung s approach to characters differed from other contemporary authors cox notes that hornung frequently chose to write from perspective of criminal and while many of hornung s novels contained criminal activity as a major element of plot critic for contemporary authors states that works do not belong to crime fiction genre hornung s works included elements from more general fiction such as false identities disguises and disowned heiresses major themes academic nick rance identifies three categories of raffles stories rise of new woman in which raffles either escapes from romantic entanglements or uses infatuations of a woman in order to achieve his aims rise of plutocracy in which raffles steals from nouveau riche as much as upper classes and those stories that seek to reaffirm or re establish a sense of middle class identity last category is based on raffles not being a member of society only being accepted because of his cricketing ability and associated fame from this point raffles s stealing from rich is a rearguard action on behalf of puritan values which was perceived as making up middle class values although rance also states that those values are obscured because of changing boundaries between classes makes same point and considers that raffles s daring exploits and fantastic adventures symbolized growing rebellion against victorian sensibility at turn of century upright left thumb raffles in patriotic mood sent a stolen gold cup to queen victoria in celebration of her diamond jubilee hornung kept abreast of scientific and medical developments and was keen to incorporate them into his stories which critic for contemporary authors states shows hornung had a streak of modernity and decided interest in new ideas camera fiend uses modern technology of camera as an instrument central to plot while protagonist of crime doctor uses psychology to identify criminals throughout raffles stories patriotism runs as an intermittent theme to such an extent that writer william vivian butler describes him as a super patriot in course of short story a jubilee present raffles celebrating queen victoria s diamond jubilee steals a gold cup from british museum and sends it to queen telling manders that we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely finest monarch in world in knees of gods raffles volunteers for service in second boer war changing his name and hair colour he jokes to manders that he is prepared to dye for his country and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy some of hornung s novels including shadow of rope no hero and thousandth woman are notable for portraying women in a rather modern favorable light according to critic for contemporary authors showing concern for their unequal position in society cox identifies a theme of guilt running through a number of works among these is peccavi in which a clergyman lives his life trying to atone for an earlier crime shadow of rope in which a woman is accused of her husband s murder and thousandth woman in which a woman stands by her lover after he is accused of murder although hornung s australian experience was brief it influenced most of his literary work from a bride from bush published in 1899 to old offenders and a few old scores which was published after his death according to chandler nearly two thirds of hornung s books refer in varying degrees to australian incidents and experiences with even raffles starting his criminal career in australia some of horning s works such as a bride from bush were praised for their accuracy of detail in depicting australian environment although detail could overwhelm storyline as in rogue s march cricket was one of hornung s lifelong passions and he was delighted to become a member of marylebone cricket club in 1907 sport also permeated his stories with raffles playing for gentlemen of england rance observes that raffles compares law breaking and cricket crime is reckoned as another and better sport raffles does on occasion disparage his game commenting to manders in gentlemen and players where s satisfaction of taking a man s wicket when you want his spoons valentine also considers point and sees raffles s cricket as a front for his criminal activities citing raffles s praise for cricket for glorious protection it affords a person of my proclivities watson examines raffles s actions within broader context of sportsmanship with raffles acting within his own moral code of what is done and not done orwell in his essay raffles and miss blandish observes that when raffles feels remorse it is almost purely social he has disgraced old school he has lost his right to enter decent society he has forfeited his amateur status and become a cad notes and references notes references sources external links category 1866 births category 1921 deaths category
