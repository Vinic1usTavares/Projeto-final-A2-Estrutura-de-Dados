jackson remini is best known for his work on america s seventh president andrew jackson after his book on van buren he initially planned on writing a full biography of him until deciding to write about jackson instead in 1960s remini wrote a series of short books about jackson which were election of andrew jackson 1963 andrew jackson 1966 and andrew jackson and bank war 1967 remini s initial books on andrew jackson convinced him to write a fuller account of man s life this led to writing of his book andrew jackson published in three volumes 1977 1981 1984 which is considered his magnum opus it was originally conceived as a single volume but remini tried to convince his editor hugh van dusen to allow for two he at first refused saying i can t sell two volumes remini recalled we were sitting there in middle of marriage of figaro and he turned to me and he said you can have two volumes and that was beginning of it then when presidential years grew to be more than another volume i needed a third volume i took him to see tristan und isolde and it worked finished series totaled approximately 1 600 pages there was an electrifying dynamism about jackson that i found irresistible remini said he went on to call him embodiment of new american he added this new man was no longer british he no longer wore queue and silk pants he wore trousers and he had stopped speaking with a british accent remini s books on jackson have generally received praise jon meacham read remini s trilogy in high school and later wrote his own biography of jackson which remini read in manuscript form meacham said he was practicing a kind of narrative historical biographical craft at exactly moment when most of academy was moving toward intellectual and group driven history he described remini as someone who never believed that his interpretation was last word meacham continued you cannot write about jackson without standing on remini s shoulders daniel walker howe a historian who took a rather critical view of jackson speaks favorably of remini writing a forthright admirer of his subject remini is laudatory in his assessments of jackson s achievements at same time he is also a meticulous scholar who does not allow his prejudices to get in way of evidence he finds of remini s trilogy joel h says that one comes away with feeling that here is how jackson saw himself might have set forth his won case and wished to be remembered in his own biography of jackson historian h w brands calls remini s three volume series a monumental work of research and exposition by dean of jackson studies final volume andrew jackson course of american democracy 1833 1845 won 1984 us national book award for nonfiction while remini has been credited for his unique focus on jackson individual he has also received criticism for seeing things too much from jackson s point of view and for identifying too closely with his subject no historian knows more about andrew jackson than robert v remini john william ward also a jackson biographer wrote in a 1981 review of second volume of jackson trilogy andrew jackson and course of american freedom 1822 1833 he added that remini has mastered in all their complex detail many issues and events of jackson s private and public life but in doing so he has come to see world too much from jackson s point of view seeing world through old hickory s eyes we appreciate him as a complex human being history professor andrew r l cayton wrote in a new york times book review of remini s andrew jackson and his indian wars 2001 problem is that we see world only through jackson s eyes a 1984 review by james m banner of new york times of final volume of remini s jackson trilogy says that he cannot be said to be respectful of interpretations more skeptical than his own nor of being detached banner argues that remini s work is a biography of old school governed by an old strategy and unabashed in its sympathies he concludes by declaring that remini s three volumes are not right vehicle for what we need remini took a moderate view of jackson s behavior during bank war he believed that bank had too much power which it was obviously using in politics it had too much money which it was using to corrupt individuals and so jackson felt he had to get rid of it it is a pity because we do need a national bank but it requires control he refuted idea that collapse of bank was responsible for panic of 1837 which he describes as a world wide economic collapse but conceded that it may have exacerbated crisis remini partially defended jackson s indian removal policies remini 1984 p 574 he held that had jackson not orchestrated removal of five civilized tribes from their ancestral homelands they would have been totally wiped out just like other tribes namely yamasee mahican and narragansett which did not move in his review of andrew jackson and his indian wars andrew denson criticizes remini s silly conclusion that jackson s support for indian removal saved indians from extinction pointing to continued existence of other indian communities east of mississippi river as evidence to contrary remini wrote a one volume abridgment to original three volume series called life of andrew jackson which was published in 1988 he delivered a lecture on jackson at white house in 1991 other work remini also wrote biographies of other prominent americans of early 19th century namely martin van buren henry clay daniel webster john quincy adams and joseph smith his 1991 biography of clay entitled henry clay statesman for union was well received brian boylan of los angeles times credits remini for ability to write a fair biography of clay even after his extensive work on jackson who was clay s bitter enemy remini treats clay with such affection and care that after half a century of being a vague name in pre civil war american history henry clay springs to life in all his fascinating brilliance historian otis a singletary writes that biography of clay was thoroughly researched and written in a lively and engaging style remini enjoyed recounting how once when he was delivering a speech on steps of clay s home ashland a large thunderclap struck which he regarded as a sign of jackson s disapproval biography of webster published in 1997 as daniel webster man and his time won d b hardeman prize in 2008 remini published a short history of united states which was just under 400 pages long according to a book review his last work was at edge of precipice henry clay and compromise that saved union 2010 in a review of book russell mcclintock praises remini for his engaging writing style and depiction of clay which he calls both heroic and credible but accuses him of overemphasizing importance of compromise and overlooking times when it did not work mcclintock summarized his thoughts by calling book a concise and lively account of a critical but understudied episode that while it breaks no new scholarly ground does raise valuable points about importance of compromise in republican government works following is a list of all of books written by remini martin van buren and making of
