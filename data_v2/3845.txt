apart amidst this backdrop a war between georgia and separatists left parts of former south ossetian autonomous oblast under de facto control of russian backed but internationally unrecognised separatists following war a joint peacekeeping force of georgian russian and ossetian troops was stationed in territory a similar stalemate developed in region of abkhazia where abkhaz separatists had waged war in 1992 1993 following election of vladimir putin in russia in 2000 and a pro western change of power in georgia in 2003 relations between russia and georgia began to deteriorate reaching a full diplomatic crisis by april 2008 by 1 august 2008 south ossetian separatists had begun shelling georgian villages with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in area artillery attacks by pro russian separatists broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement to put an end to these attacks and restore order georgian army was sent to south ossetian conflict zone on 7 august georgians took control of most of tskhinvali a separatist stronghold in hours russian troops had illicitly crossed russo georgian state border and advanced into south ossetian conflict zone by 7 august before georgian military response russia accused georgia of aggression against south ossetia and launched a large scale land air and sea invasion of georgia on 8 august with stated goal of a peace enforcement operation russian and south ossetian forces fought georgian forces in and around south ossetia for several days until georgian forces retreated russian and abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking kodori gorge held by georgia russian naval forces blockaded part of georgian coast russian air force attacked targets beyond conflict zone in undisputed parts of georgia this was first war in history

ossetia corresponds to ossetia in north caucasus left thumb creation of south ossetian ao in place of georgian regions in 1922 in 10th century ad georgia for first time emerged as an ethnic concept in territories where georgian language was used to perform christian rituals after mongol invasions of region kingdom of georgia eventually was split into several states in 19th century russian empire gradually took over georgian lands in aftermath of russian revolution georgia declared independence on 26 may 1918 ossetian people are autochthonous to north ossetia located in north caucasus controversy surrounds date of ossetian arrival in transcaucasia according to one theory they first migrated there during 13th and 14th centuries ad and resided alongside georgians peacefully for hundreds of years in 1918 conflict began between landless ossetian peasants living in kartli who were affected by bolshevism and demanded ownership of lands they worked and government backed ethnic georgian nobility who were legal owners although ossetians were initially discontented with economic stance of tbilisi authorities tension shortly transformed into ethnic conflict during uprisings in 1919 and 1920 ossetians were covertly supported by soviet russia but even so were defeated independent democratic republic of georgia was invaded by red army in 1921 and a soviet government was installed government of soviet georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for transcaucasian ossetians in april 1922 called south ossetian autonomous oblast historians such as stephen f jones emil and arsene believe that bolsheviks awarded this autonomy to ossetians in exchange for their help against democratic republic of georgia since this area had never been a separate entity prior to russian invasion nationalism in soviet georgia gained momentum in 1989 with weakening of soviet union kremlin endorsed south ossetian nationalism as a counter against georgian independence movement on 11 december 1990 supreme soviet of georgia responding to south ossetia s attempt at secession annulled region s autonomy a military conflict broke out between georgia and south ossetian separatists in january 1991 georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 april 1991 thus becoming first non baltic state of soviet union to do so south ossetian separatists were aided by former soviet military units now controlled by russia by june 1992 possibility of a full scale war between russia and georgia increased as bombing of georgian capital tbilisi in support of south ossetian separatists was promised by russian authorities georgia endorsed a ceasefire agreement on 24 june 1992 to prevent escalation of conflict with russia georgian south ossetian russian and north ossetian peacekeepers were posted in south ossetian conflict zone under joint control commission s jcc mandate some mostly ethnically georgian parts of former south ossetian autonomous oblast remained under georgian control tskhinvali based separatist authorities of self proclaimed republic of south ossetia were in control of one third of territory of former south ossetian autonomous oblast before 2008 war this situation was mirrored in abkhazia an autonomous republic in georgian soviet socialist republic where abkhaz separated from georgia during war in early 1990s population of abkhazia was reduced to 216 000 after an ethnic cleansing of georgians single largest ethnic group in region a decrease from 525 000 before war upper kodori gorge in northeast abkhazia remained beyond unrecognised abkhaz separatist government s sway russian interests and involvement transcaucasia lies between russian region of north caucasus and middle east constituting a buffer zone between russia and middle east it borders turkey and iran strategic importance of region has made it a security concern for russia significant economic reasons such as presence or transportation of oil also affect interest in

civil war and war in abkhazia in october december 1993 russia saw black sea coast and being adjacent to turkey as invaluable strategic attributes of georgia russia had more vested interests in abkhazia than in south ossetia since russian military deployment on black sea coast was seen as vital to russian influence in black sea before early 2000s south ossetia was originally intended as a tool to retain a grip on georgia vladimir putin became president of russian federation in 2000 which had a profound impact on russo georgian relations conflict between russia and georgia began to escalate in december 2000 when georgia became first and sole member of commonwealth of independent states cis on which russian visa regime was enforced eduard kokoity an alleged member of mob became de facto president of south ossetia in december 2001 he was endorsed by russia since he would subvert peaceful reunification of south ossetia with georgia russian government began massive allocation of russian passports to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia in 2002 without georgia s permission this policy laid foundation for russia s future claim to these territories in 2003 president putin began to consider possibility of a military solution to conflict with georgia after georgia deported four suspected russian spies in 2006 russia began a full scale diplomatic and economic war against georgia followed by persecution of ethnic georgians living in russia by 2008 most residents of south ossetia had obtained russian passports according to reuters russia supplied two thirds of south

stalemate until 2004 when mikheil saakashvili came to power after georgia s rose revolution which ousted president eduard shevardnadze restoring south ossetia and abkhazia to georgian control was a first concern of saakashvili georgian government launched an initiative to curb smuggling from south ossetia in 2004 after its success in restoring control in adjara tensions were further escalated by south ossetian authorities intense fighting took place between georgian forces and south ossetians between 8 and 19 august at parliamentary assembly of council of europe in strasbourg in january 2005

although georgia has no notable gas or oil reserves its territory hosts part of baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline supplying europe russia iran and persian gulf countries opposed construction of pipeline pipeline both russia and iran because it has decreased western dependence on middle east s oil pipeline has been a major factor in united states backing for georgia left thumb russian president vladimir putin at 2008 bucharest summit during nato summit in bucharest in april 2008 american president george w bush campaigned for offering a membership action plan map to georgia and ukraine however germany and france said that offering map to ukraine and georgia would be an unnecessary offence for russia nato stated that ukraine and georgia would be admitted in alliance and pledged to review requests for map in december 2008 russian president vladimir putin was in bucharest during summit at conclusion of summit on 4 april putin said that nato s enlargement towards russia would be taken in russia as a direct threat to security of our country following bucharest summit russian hostility increased and russia started to actively prepare for invasion of georgia chief of general

republics general baluyevsky admitted in 2012 that after president putin had decided to attack georgia prior to may 2008 inauguration of dmitry medvedev as president of russia a military action was planned and explicit orders were issued in advance before august 2008 russia aimed to stop georgia s accession to nato and also to bring about a regime change but in september 2019 russian foreign minister sergey lavrov was quoted as saying that if nato accepts georgian membership with article on collective defense covering only tbilisi administered territory i e excluding two georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are currently unrecognized breakaway republics supported by russia we will not start a war but such conduct will undermine our relations with

russian warplane on 20 april however russia denied responsibility for incident and abkhazia claimed that an l 39 aircraft of abkhaz air force shot down uav an allegation of an attack by a nato mig 29 was made by russia ambassador to nato dmitry rogozin nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer commented that he d eat his tie if it turned out that a nato mig 29 had magically appeared in abkhazia

chief of general staff said soviet made tor and buk anti aircraft missile systems bought by georgia from ukraine were responsible for shooting down russian aircraft during war a russian assessment reported by roger mcdermott said that russian losses would have been significantly higher if georgians had not left behind a portion of their buk m1 systems near senaki in western georgia and several osa missile launchers in south ossetia according to some reports georgia also possessed a battery of israeli made sr short range self propelled anti aircraft system georgian air defence early warning and command control tactical system was linked via turkey to a nato air situation data exchange which provided georgia with intelligence during conflict georgia has said that its key deficiencies were ineffective communication during action and its lacking air strength konstantin makienko of cast saw substandard instruction of pilots as primary reason for paltry conduct of georgian air sorties according to georgian first deputy defence minister batu georgia was required to have a complex multi layered air defence system to protect its airspace western officers involved with georgia s military indicated that georgian military deficiencies were too great to be eliminated by new weapons according to a 2 september 2008 new york times article georgia s army fled ahead of russian army s advance turning its back and leaving georgian civilians in an enemy s path its planes did not fly after first few hours of contact its navy was sunk in harbor and its patrol boats were hauled away by russian trucks on trailers a sweeping russian offensive caught georgia by surprise who had never got ready for confronting such invasion many managerial and procedural problems surfaced during war according to a western officer georgian logistical readiness was mediocre there was interference between subdivisions during action training to simulate combat against a probable enemy 58th army had never been organised by georgian army during war communications broke down in mountains and troops had to resort to mobile phones there was insufficient planning according to giorgi nobody thought about sealing roki tunnel there was a dismal organisation of delivery of 10 000 georgian reservists in gori on 9 august they had no specific targets and went back to tbilisi following day conflict was named by georgian journalists as war that was hidden from history because there was very little video recording of fighting according to their american trainers georgian soldiers were unprepared for fighting despite having warrior spirit there was a small number of disciplined and knowledgeable officers in high ranking positions and saakashvili s government had no military background russia russian command control communications and intelligence c3i performed poorly during conflict russian communication systems were outdated with a 58th army commander allegedly making contact with his combat troops via a journalist owned satellite phone without modern glonass precision guided munitions could not be used and us controlled gps was unavailable since war zone was blacked out due to negligence of russian defence minister use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not sanctioned an ria novosti editorial said that russian forces were without reliable aerial reconnaissance systems once using a tupolev tu 22m3 bomber instead however russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during war deputy chief of general staff of russia general anatoly nogovitsyn said that in conflict new weapons were not tried out ria novosti editorial also said that russian su 25 ground attack jets did not have radar vision and ground target coordinate computing they also did not have long range surface to air missiles that could be fired beyond air defence zones of an adversary opposition affiliated russian analyst konstantin makienko observed substandard conduct of russian air force it is totally unbelievable that russian air force was unable to establish air superiority almost to end of five day war despite fact that enemy had no fighter aviation according to russian expert anton lavrov on 8 august russian and south ossetian troops deployed in south ossetia were unaware that russian aviation was involved in war russian troops and south ossetians often assessed russian aircraft as enemy and shot at them before precise identification took place on 8 august air force performed 63 flights in support of russian ground troops a total of six russian warplanes were lost during war one su 25sm two su two su and one tu 22m3 friendly fire was cause of loss of three aircraft lavrov denies that shot down tu 22m was being used for reconnaissance communication between north caucasus military district commander and air force was poor and their roles were unclear colonel general aleksandr commander in chief of air force did not set foot in command post instead running air force operations on a mobile phone from his workroom without any help from his air defence aides air force was blamed of rendering no assistance to land campaign swedish analysts carolina and fredrik westerlund said that although russian black sea fleet did not meet significant resistance it proved effective at implementing elaborate operations mechanised infantry opened a new front in abkhazia which contributed to quickness of russian military success heritage foundation researchers said in their assessment of preparation of russian general staff that manoeuvres were planned and implemented effectively with a crucial confusion being engineered by russians a reuters analyst described russia s army as strong but flawed war demonstrated that russia s armed forces have emerged from years of neglect as a formidable fighting force but revealed important deficiencies he stated that russia fell short of its role of a first rate military power due to these faults unlike second chechen war russia s force in georgia was composed primarily of professional soldiers instead of conscripts reuters journalists in georgia stated that they found russian forces to be well outfitted and orderly forces cast director ruslan said that victory over georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations roger mcdermott wrote that slight dissimilarity in criticism by civilian and official references after conflict was an orchestrated effort by government to sell reform to military and garner support among populace evolution of russian army into a professional force was not deemed as fruitful in september 2008 general vladimir acknowledged that many of professional soldiers did not have better training than conscripts most of land combat warfare was conducted by russian airborne troops and special troops due to failure of russian air force to penetrate georgian air defence airborne troops could not be airlifted behind georgian lines a surprise attack on a land forces commander in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy made it demonstrated information gathering negligence many russian land units reportedly were short of ammo equipment losses and cost georgia thumb georgian dana howitzer after ceasefire agreement stratfor states that russia has largely destroyed georgia s war
