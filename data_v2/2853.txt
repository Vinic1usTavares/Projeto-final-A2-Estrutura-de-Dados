workers of sp regional party based in uttar pradesh who were proceeding to attend a rally organised by united national progressive alliance unpa defending his party s stand mns chief raj thackeray explained that attack was a reaction to provocative and unnecessary show of strength and uncontrolled political and cultural dadagiri bullying of uttar pradesh and bihar migrants and their leaders in events leading to these clashes raj thackeray made critical remarks themed around language politics and regionalism about migrants from north indian states of uttar pradesh and bihar accusing them of spoiling maharashtrian culture and not mingling with them at political rallies held across state he questioned loyalty of bollywood actor amitabh bachchan towards maharashtra where he attained fame and popularity accusing him of showing more interest in his native uttar pradesh he called celebration of chhath puja by north indian migrants a drama and a show of arrogance on 13 february 2008 state government which was accused of reluctance to take immediate action ultimately arrested raj thackeray and abu asim azmi a local sp leader on charges of instigation of violence and causing communal disturbance although released that same day a gag order was imposed on both leaders to prevent them from making further inflammatory remarks meanwhile tensions in maharashtra rose as news of raj s

activists beat up north indian candidates appearing for all india railway recruitment board entrance exam in mumbai incident led to raj s arrest and fresh violence later on 28 october 2008 a labourer from uttar pradesh was lynched in a mumbai commuter train attacks evoked critical reactions from various parts of country particularly uttar pradesh and bihar political leadership even bal thackeray raj s estranged uncle and chief of shiv sena who formed his party in 1966 to raise voice of marathi manoos marathi people discounted his nephew s criticism of bachchan as stupidity in an editorial a month later in saamna shiv sena s political mouthpiece however bal thackeray wrote that biharis antagonised local populations wherever they went and were an unwelcome lot throughout country media slated bal s remarks as an attempt to recapture his party s sons of soil plank being hijacked by raj background raj thackeray s resignation from shiv sena and formation of mns thumb flag of maharashtra navnirman sena on 9 march 2006 raj thackeray nephew of bal thackeray quit shiv sena and formed maharashtra navnirman sena mns after being sidelined by chief s son uddhav shiv shiv sena members who supported raj s leadership in contrast to his cousin uddhav joined mns party was founded on ideology of being benefactor of local marathi manoos marathi people an ideology that party members felt shiv sena had abandoned keeping in line with this raj has repeatedly demanded special job reservations for locals a critic of influx of migrants into state especially uttar literally meaning north indians predominantly from uttar pradesh and bihar he has blamed large scale immigration of people from these economically backward states for causing a shortage of jobs for maharashtrians shiv sena s move to appease migrants times of india summarised cause of mns s attacks there s a method in mns s madness in attacking north indians in mumbai though howsoever flawed it might be raj believes his cousin and shiv sena leader uddhav thackeray has been wooing people from bihar and up through a campaign he began back in 2005 with inclusive call of mee as his party s vote bank uddhav s growing popularity with north indians had been rankling raj who is losing ground and political relevance as evident in mns s performance in last municipal elections raj s criticism of amitabh bachchan in january 2008 targeting mumbai resident amitabh bachchan at political rallies raj asserted that actor was more interested in his native state uttar pradesh than maharashtra he expressed his disapproval of amitabh s inaugurating a girls school named after his daughter in law actress aishwarya rai bachchan at barabanki in uttar pradesh rather than in maharashtra bachchan was also criticised for choosing to run elections from his native state on 2 february at a party function at dharavi in mumbai raj said though he amitabh has become a star in mumbai his interest is in uttar pradesh that is why he was trying to be an ambassador of up rather than maharashtra that is why though he achieved everything in mumbai when it came to elections amitabh chose uttar pradesh thumb amitabh bachchan responding to raj s accusations actor s wife and an sp mp jaya bachchan said that they were willing to start a school in mumbai provided mns leader donated land to build it she told media i heard that raj thackeray owns huge properties in maharashtra in mumbai at kohinoor mills if he is willing to donate land we can start a school in name of aishwarya here amitabh however abstained from commenting on issue bal thackeray refuted allegations saying amitabh bachchan is an open minded person he has great love for maharashtra and this is evident on many occasions actor has often said that maharashtra and specially mumbai has given him great fame and affection he has also said that what he is today is because of love people have given him people of mumbai have always acknowledged him as an artiste it was utter foolishness to make these parochial allegations against him amitabh is a global superstar people all over world respect him this cannot be forgotten by anyone amitabh should ignore these silly accusations and concentrate on his acting according to some reports raj s censure of amitabh whom he supposedly admires stemmed from his disappointment of not being invited to wedding of amitabh s son abhishek despite invitations to his estranged uncle bal and cousin uddhav on 23 march amitabh finally spoke out in an interview with a local tabloid saying random charges are random they do not deserve kind of attention you wish me to give later on 28 march at a press conference for international indian film academy when asked what his take was on anti migrant issue amitabh said that it is one s fundamental right to live anywhere in country and constitution entitles so he also stated that he was not affected by raj s comments raj s remarks on chhath puja and migrants in his party speeches raj had also reproached north indian migrants on celebration of chhath puja a festival popular in bihar calling it a drama and a show of arrogance he demanded that they must only celebrate maharashtrian festivals a petition was filed in patna civil court on 8 february against him for his remarks over chhath puja his statements drew flak from leaders of bihar especially indian railways minister and former chief minister of bihar lalu prasad yadav who challenged that he would come to mumbai and perform chhath puja in front of raj s house also ridiculed raj saying he raj is a child in politics navnirman sena leader accused migrants of swamping maharashtra india s most industrialised state in search of jobs mns chief had also accused

be addressed by former uttar pradesh chief minister singh yadav and other prominent members of unpa and sp police arrested 73 mns and 19 sp workers after these clashes on charges of rioting raj justified his party s stand as a response to provocative and unnecessary show of strength and uncontrolled political and cultural dadagiri of uttar pradesh and bihar migrants and their leaders and questioned do political movements need to obey law on 10 february at a press conference he issued a statement saying what happened in mumbai in past one week was only a reaction and if leaders of uttar pradesh and bihar try to demonstrate their strength here such reactions would recur after clashes sp approached election commission demanding de registration of mns sp general secretary whose

recruitment board examination attack translated in english original text in marathi political analysis political observers commented that attacks on north indians by mns were a shrewd ploy of their chief raj to embarrass shiv sena and usurp its core marathi constituency they also felt raj was trying to gain a political foothold by imitating his uncle and political mentor bal thackeray who had headed anti south indian campaign lungi throw out those who wear celebrate by blowing bugles during formative years of shiv sena in 1960s kumar ketkar editor of marathi daily loksatta said though raj might have achieved what he wanted but he may have not anticipated attention it would get he said he thought media would gobble it up and just create a small storm that will shift agenda but great amar singh and abu azmi fuelled issue by taking him more seriously than what he deserves confrontational position aided mns volunteers to get into limelight ketkar also said shiv sena would lose in scenario commenting sena tried to woo north indians after it realised their value as a vote bank in 2004 defeat they realised that demography of city had changed within a decade that is when they decided it was time to please north indians uddhav started organising uttar bharatiya functions this is year that he bore fruits of his efforts that is why raj decided to strike at same sentiment that sena played in past marathi manoos author of sena story vaibhav purandare said raj resorted to this measure to stem his party s eroding credibility he said when raj launched his party he first started out with an inclusive approach when he found that it is not working he had to do something drastic to get back into limelight on other hand sena was actually becoming inclusive it even began attracting muslims into its fold it also began taking up common man s issues like farmer suicides and power supply this is raj s attempt to take sena s mass base away to completely embarrass sena and he has succeeded both ketkar and purandare however agreed that raj was trying to position himself as bal thackeray s potential successor alleged congress support for mns shubhangi of daily news and analysis noted in her article titled forget political will raj has state support stated ever since its birth on 9 march 2006 mns has been nurtured by ruling congress and nationalist congress party ncp with an ulterior motive of splitting shiv sena ironically sena itself was given a protected childhood in late 1960s by then congress as a tool to war with communist party of india which had a strong presence in mumbai not surprisingly covertly administration has provided raj adequate platform to consolidate political forum through an emotive marathi plank purpose is to split 26 marathi voters in mumbai which is rather loyal to shiv sena electoral merit of mns remains untested but its ability to bond with sons of soil cannot be cursorily dismissed in mumbai thane nashik and pune she further noted under chief minister vilasrao deshmukh congress sees a double advantage in strategy a proactive mns will divide sena voters on one hand and drive mumbai s north indian community which was being targeted as outsiders by mns to congress s lap north indians who dominate 48 essential services in mumbai constitute a sizeable and hence decisive vote bank forget political will it is well calculated political design which has withheld democratic front government from taking stern action against raj or else how does one explain home minister rr patil engaging in a telephone conversation urging him to slow down instead of arresting his men indulging in violence on streets she also said vilasrao deshmukh is no better he has often said my administration will not tolerate divisive forces nobody is above law she expressed her views in reference to bombay high court on lashing out at maharashtra government over threat given by maharashtra navnirman sena about displaying marathi signboard on shops and establishments in metropolis if you don t have political will then give that message to people that we can not do anything division bench of justice j n patel and k k said dissatisfied about government s inaction against hooliganism of maharashtra navnirman sena activists why no action has been taken against respondent number six raj thackeray are some people untouchable for you justice patel asked as government failed to file a proper reply regarding action taken congress leader hussain dalwai said it s a sad commentary on administration which has come to a stage where it requires high court intervention he put onus of his party s coalition partner saying whether it is mns violence in signboard or dalit killing at it shows an insensitive administration ncp president sharad pawar should seriously reflect on working of state home department even ncp leaders including ajit pawar and chhagan bhujbal have told rr patil and deshmukh in cabinet meet to either act or shut up suggesting that maharashtra government was not keen on taking strong action against mns chief raj thackeray nda on thursday described as stage managed show arrest and bail for him in cases of violence against north indians in state bjp mp hussain said congress is raj thackeray s event management company and it is trying to project raj s arrest as an event instead of making any serious effort to check violent campaign of mns against north indians there is match fixing between raj and maharashtra government state government deliberately books him under small sections and he gets bail talking on attacks on north indian candidates at all india railway recruitment examinations in mumbai rajya sabha mp and jd u national general secretary tiwari also attacked congress for promoting mns chief and comparing him with slain punjab separatist leader congress party has a mastery in creating self destructing demons earlier they created in punjab which killed a congress prime minister even this raj thackeray is ultimately going to damage congress tiwari claimed he also alleged that maharashtra government arrested raj to carry out a formality and as mild charges were pressed he got bail soon resumption of verbal attacks raj thackeray thumb mns supporters attending rally held on 3 may 2008 at shivaji park mumbai while still under gag order in an interview with marathi weekly magazine lok prabha of indian express group raj was quoted as saying we will go with folded hands and ask them north indians to leave if they refuse then we will raise our hands lok prabha editor pravin said mns chief has technically not made any inflammatory statement even when he says he and his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse he treads ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se on 3 march at a party function organised by mns at shivaji park after expiry of gag order raj announced i have not given up my mission thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on migrant issue then on 3 may despite legal warnings by police before his rally raj issued a diktat to his supporters to take action whenever they encountered injustice at a rally at shivaji park he said that north indians are living in mumbai is because of our mercy let it be known he told mns leaders to shed their complacence and advised his supporters to take action whenever they felt necessary he warned that north indians who did not speak marathi and did not respect marathi culture would be driven away raj dared police in his speech by saying arrest me for this if you can after analysing speech amidst demand for action against mns chief a senior police official quoted it was difficult to find an explicit threat or provocation in text of his speech to initiate strong legal action against him and it seems he raj consulted legal experts before making speech bal thackeray on 6 march bal thackeray issued an editorial titled ek bihari sau one bihari hundred illnesses in saamna shiv sena s political mouthpiece saying biharis were an unwanted lot in country in what was termed as an apparent bid to recapture his party s marathi sons of soil plank which was being hijacked by mns leader raj thackeray wrote about biharis they biharis are not wanted in southern india assam and also punjab and chandigarh biharis have antagonised local population wherever they had settled up bihari mps have shown their ingratitude towards mumbai and maharashtra with an anti marathi tirade in parliament he also denounced bihari mps saying they were spitting in same plate from which they ate by criticising mumbaikars and maharashtrians he also wrote they are trying to add fuel to fire that has been extinguished by saying that mumbaikars have rotten brains outburst was apparently in response to mps from bihar who had disrupted proceedings of lok sabha in protest against attacks on north indians bihar chief minister nitish kumar upset with remarks demanded that prime minister and centre intervene in matter immediately saamna editorial prompted at least 16 lok sabha mps from bihar and uttar pradesh belonging to rjd jd u sp and congress to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against bal thackeray after matter was raised in lok sabha speaker somnath chatterjee said if anybody has made any comment on our members functioning in conduct of business in house not only do we treat that with contempt that it deserves but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms nobody will be spared on 27 march in protest against bal thackeray s editorial leaders of shiv sena in delhi resigned citing its outrageous conduct towards non marathis in maharashtra and announced that they will form a separate party addressing a press conference shiv sena s north india chief jai bhagwan goyal said decision to leave party was taken because of partial attitude of party high command towards maharashtrians shiv sena is no different from khalistan and jammu and kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines main aim of these forces is to split our country like maharashtra navnirman sena shiv sena too has demeaned north indians and treated them he said evaluating developments political observers in mumbai remarked that shiv sena had been caught in a bind by raj s campaign as it had in recent years sought to portray an inclusive image to try to woo significant migrant vote in mumbai and thane region in run up to assembly elections in 2009 to balance this strategy party had started speaking up for maharashtrians to remind them that it was shiv sena was original voice of
