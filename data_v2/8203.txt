carola class was a group of six steam corvettes built by german kaiserliche marine in late 1870s and 1880s class comprised lead ship and they were ordered to replace older sailing vessels that were no longer sufficient to protect german interests around world intended for service in german colonial empire ships were designed with a combination of steam and sail power for extended cruising range and they were equipped with a battery of ten guns relying primarily on sail power for their long range deployments ships were obsolescent before construction began six ships were all sent on lengthy overseas deployments throughout their careers with assignments to germany s colonial holdings in africa togo german south west africa and german east africa and in pacific german new guinea and later kiautschou bay concession they were frequently used to suppress local uprisings against german rule punish those who attacked german citizens or businesses and show flag on several occasions ships of class were badly damaged in accidents marie running aground off new mecklenburg and sophie being rammed by a merchant vessel both in 1884 and olga being forced ashore by a cyclone in 1889 but none of members of class were lost several of corvettes were used for training purposes taking part in fleet exercises extended training cruises with naval cadets and in case of carola and olga later in their careers as dedicated gunnery training ships no longer useful as cruising warships by 1890s all of ships of carola class were withdrawn from active service by end of decade some were used for training purposes but alexandrine was too worn out from her years abroad to permit further use marie was too expensive to convert into a training ship and sophie was instead used as a barracks ship between 1904 and 1908 all of carola class corvettes were broken up for scrap with exception of sophie which lingered on as a floating barracks until she too went to breakers in 1920 design as german commercial interests began to expand to overseas markets in asia and pacific in 1870s need for long range cruising warships became increasingly severe particularly as other european powers started to exclude german businesses from activity abroad by mid 1870s fleet of corvettes available to german kaiserliche marine imperial navy was rapidly ageing with several vessels already twenty years old at time world s navies were grappling with development of steam power which had already replaced sails in large ironclad warships cruising vessels required a much longer radius of action than ironclads and steam engines were not yet reliable or efficient enough to rely on them alone necessitating retention of traditional sailing rigs in 1875 design for a new class of steam corvettes was prepared and six ships were ordered last two to a modified design design for carola class was based on preceding s though they were reduced in size despite fact that they were intended to modernize german cruising fleet their design was obsolescent before construction even began capable of engaging only similar vessels nevertheless carola class corvettes and other cruisers available succeeded in expanding germany s colonial empire particularly in central pacific in 1880s and 1890s general characteristics thumb left olga in 1880s first four ships of carola class were long at waterline and long overall with a beam of and a draft of forward last two ships and were slightly larger at at waterline and overall with a beam of and a draft of forward first four ships displaced as designed and at full load and larger vessels displaced as designed and fully laden ships hulls were constructed with iron frames that provided structure for wood hull planks over which a layer of zinc was applied to protect wood from biofouling alexandrine and arcona received copper sheathing instead of zinc stem and sternpost were also iron except for last two vessels which had bronze sternposts first four vessels had nine watertight compartments while last two had eleven all six ships had a double bottom under engine room steering was controlled with a single rudder and all six ships maneuvered well under steam and better under sail they rolled and pitched badly and lost significant speed in a head sea though they handled well in bad weather and had a crew that consisted of 25 officers and 244 enlisted men though as school ships their crews were reduced to 13 officers and 135 enlisted which left room for 150 cadets aboard each vessel had a complement of 10 officers and 244 enlisted while had 10 officers and 265 enlisted alexandrine and arcona each had a crew of 25 officers and 257 enlisted each corvette carried several smaller boats carola and olga had two picket boats two cutters two yawls and one dinghy while other four vessels each had one picket boat one launch two cutters two yawls and two dinghies machinery thumb left marie under sail carola and olga were powered by a single horizontal 3 cylinder double expansion steam engine that drove one 2 bladed screw propeller that was wide in diameter steam was provided by eight coal fired fire tube boilers which were ducted into two funnels marie and sophie had a 2 cylinder steam engine with a propeller that was wide and they had two fewer boilers and only one funnel alexandrine and arcona had two engines and eight boilers and both vessels had two funnels electricity was provided by one generator that produced at 55 volts each vessel had a capacity for of coal storage for boilers first four ships had a designed speed of under steam from though they all exceeded those figures carola slowest ship of class reached a top speed of while marie and sophie both made alexandrine and arcona with their additional engine were rated for 14 knots from former achieved her designed speed and latter exceeded it slightly reaching on speed trials first four ships had a cruising radius of at a speed of ships were equipped with a three masted barque rig with a surface area of to supplement their steam engines on their long deployments abroad where coal might be scarce after they were converted into gunnery training ships carola and olga had their sailing rig removed and they received heavy military masts with fighting tops for light weapons armament ships of carola class were armed with a battery of ten 22 caliber cal breech loading guns which were supplied with a total of 1 000 rounds of ammunition guns had a range of they also carried two 24 cal guns with 200 rounds of ammunition and six hotchkiss revolver cannon alexandrine and arcona had newer 30 cal versions of 15 cm guns which had a range of and were supplied with 730 shells they also carried four 35 cal guns with 400 rounds these guns had a range of like their sisters they also had six revolver cannon for carola which was converted into a gunnery training ship in early 1890s 15 cm guns were later reduced to six and then four guns and 8 7 cm guns were replaced with a pair of 10 5 cm sk l 35 guns eight sk l 30 guns and two sk l 40 guns as converted as a gunnery training ship for automatic weapons olga later carried just two 8 8 cm guns and ten 3 7

first came immediately after entering service in 1881 and lasted into 1883 she went to central pacific ocean to protect german interests in samoa and melanesia and later went to southern africa and was first german warship to reach what would become german southwest africa while in pacific she conducted a punitive operation against locals in hermit islands who had murdered a pair of german citizens and nine locals who had worked for them while at island of buka in 1883 her crew named a previously unused harbor queen carola harbor after their vessel s namesake after returning to germany in 1883 she was laid up until 1886 during which time she received a torpedo tube her second deployment came in 1886 and saw carola alternate between german east africa and pacific as part of a cruising squadron commanded by eduard von knorr karl eduard heusner and later karl august deinhard squadron s time in pacific was uneventful and consisted of visiting ports in east asia and patrolling germany s holdings in central pacific in german new guinea during operations off east africa from 1888 to 1890 she participated in anti slave trade operations which included capture of a dhow carrying 78 slaves that were freed she also helped suppress abushiri revolt sending marines ashore to fight rebels and providing gunfire support to german forces led by major hermann wissmann after returning to germany in 1891 carola was converted into a gunnery training ship as she was by then obsolete as a warship she served in this capacity in company with training ship and olga through 1890s and early 1900s with this duty being interrupted in 1897 when she was used as a target ship carola was decommissioned in 1905 sold following year and broken up for scrap in hamburg olga thumb olga aground in apia harbor following 1889 apia cyclone in course of her career olga was sent abroad on three major deployments first uneventful voyage came in 1882 and took vessel to south american waters to show flag for a year and a half during cruise prince heinrich of prussia served aboard ship second cruise came shortly thereafter when unrest in german colony of kamerun necessitated formation of a west african squadron to suppress it olga and three other corvettes send marines ashore to battle local forces resisting german rule after defeating rebellion olga returned to germany in 1885 and she thereafter served as a training ship though this activity lasted only a few months before she was again ordered abroad her third cruise began in september 1885 and initially saw ship sent to german east africa to join cruising squadron she was tasked with patrolling coast of german protectorate of wituland she also forced extradition of two locals who had murdered a german explorer in 1887 squadron was sent to pacific and olga arrived in samoa in august that year she sent men ashore to fight samoan rebels opposed to german backed government in first battle of while in harbor at apia in 1889 olga was badly damaged by a powerful cyclone and was forced to leave station for repairs two other german vessels were destroyed by storm but olgas crew were able to salvage ship from 1890 olga saw limited service in a variety of subsidiary roles she was used as a training ship from 1893 to 1897 when she was transferred to fishery school she conducted an extensive survey in spitzbergen in 1898 before being decommissioned late in year to be converted into a gunnery training ship she served in that capacity until 1905 when she was stricken from naval register olga was sold for scrap following year and was broken up in hamburg in 1908 marie thumb sms marie probably in wilhelmshaven in mid 1880s marie was sent abroad immediately after entering service initially to south america where she picked up german participants of first international polar year at south georgia island after observing aftermath of war of pacific between bolivia chile and peru in late 1883 and early 1884 she was transferred to german new guinea where she was tasked with supporting germany s growing overseas empire in region her deployment to central pacific was cut short when she accidentally ran aground off new mecklenburg and was badly damaged necessitating a return to germany for extensive repairs she was thereafter laid up for remainder of decade ship was reactivated for a second overseas tour in 1892 she was first sent to chile protect german nationals in aftermath of chilean civil war of 1891 before joining alexandrine and arcona off brazil in 1893 in response to revolta da armada revolt of fleet there after they ensured that german interests in brazil were safe three ships were then sent to east asia in april 1894 where they formed nucleus of east asia division and were tasked with protecting german nationals in china during first sino japanese war marie was recalled to germany in mid 1895 as she had been replaced by a newer and more capable protected cruiser marie and stopped in morocco on way back to enforce a settlement over murder of two german citizens after reaching germany in september 1895 she was decommissioned later assigned to reserve training unit she was never activated for role since navy had determined it would be too expensive to return marie to service instead she was eventually stricken from naval register in 1904 and sold for scrap three years later sophie thumb left an old postcard of sophie featuring a painting of ship by christopher rave sophie was sent abroad in 1883 first to escort crown prince friedrich wilhelm on a visit to spain she then went to western africa to protect german nationals in togo before germany had declared a protectorate in country ship s commander exceeded his orders which instructed him to avoid direct conflict with local rulers though he successfully negotiated agreements that protected german citizens in area and arrested hostile chiefs sophie then returned home and was tasked with training duties serving as flagship of training squadron during exercises in september 1884 she was rammed and badly damaged by a steam ship she returned to service after lengthy repairs and in 1885 and 1886 went on extended training cruises first to west indies and second to spain while on second cruise she was ordered to join cruiser squadron germany maintained to respond to crises around world she patrolled german colonial holdings in german east africa and german new guinea from 1886 to 1892 during this period she helped to secure east africa sending landing parties ashore in dar es salaam windi and river delta and blockading coast while in pacific station she conducted punitive expeditions against locals who had attacked germans and cruised chinese coast with corvette in 1891 sophie and leipzig sailed to chile join alexandrine in defending germans during civil war in country which included landing marines in valparaiso in april 1892 three ships continued on to east africa but stay there was short lived as she was recalled to germany in june and was decommissioned shortly after her arrival sophie was converted into a dedicated training ship between 1895 and 1898 entering service in that role in january 1898 this duty lasted for only a year before she was withdrawn in march 1899 having been replaced by larger corvette she ended her career as a barracks ship including at german base in helgoland during first two years of world war i ultimately being sold in 1920 and broken up following year alexandrine thumb left alexandrine sometime c 1886 1895 alexandrine was laid up for several years after completion at time german navy had a plan whereby germany s colonies would be protected by gunboats while larger warships would generally be kept in reserve with a handful assigned to a flying squadron that could respond to crises quickly alexandrine was first activated in 1889 for a deployment to central pacific to reinforce gunboats on station there competing claims to islands of samoa created tension between germany britain and united states necessitating a larger warship to enforce germany s claims to islands ship patrolled german new guinea until 1891 protecting german interests in region and punishing locals who attacked germans in islands in 1891 she joined cruiser squadron which also included marie ships were sent to chile to protect german nationals during chilean civil war that year while on way squadron flagship leipzig ran out of coal and alexandrine had to take her under tow squadron thereafter cruised off east asia in 1892 and by end of year went to german east africa in 1893 she was sent to brazil where revolta da armada in that country threatened german interests while in brazil an outbreak of yellow fever spread to ship forcing her to go into quarantine after brazilian government suppressed rebellion alexandrine and other ships were then sent back to east asia to monitor first sino japanese war in march 1895 alexandrine was recalled to germany and while she was en route she stopped in morocco to pressure local authorities into paying reparations for murder of two german citizens on her arrival in germany she went into dry dock to be inspected and it was found that her hull had badly deteriorated after several years abroad as a result she was decommissioned in june 1895 she did not see further active service being used only as a floating battery in danzig from 1904 to 1907 that year she was stricken from naval register sold and used temporarily as a floating workshop and then broken up later in 1907 arcona thumb arcona in nagasaki 1897 like alexandrine arcona was kept in reserve after completion until 1892 when she was activated for an extended deployment abroad she protected german interests in venezuela in 1892 during unrest in country and her presence forced venezuelan government to issue an apology for attacks against german citizens in macuto she joined overseas cruiser squadron in german east africa following year while in african waters she went to german south west africa to carry field guns to strengthen local schutztruppe protection force later in 1893 she was sent to brazil when a naval revolt threatened german nationals in country there she joined marie and alexandrine outbreak of first sino japanese war in 1894 prompted transfer of arcona and two of her
