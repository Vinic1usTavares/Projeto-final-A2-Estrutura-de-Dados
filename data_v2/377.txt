know i can be on pole and i can win ricciardo stated that while he was aware he had an unrealistic chance of winning championship he would take a race by race approach and hoped to win either of

what happens in weeks before race sport s governing body federation internationale de l automobile s fia race director charlie whiting announced plans to introduce a ban on certain pit to car communications with a particular emphasis on banning driver coaching such as describing a driver s sector times relative to another competitor under article 20 1 of sporting regulations which state that a driver must drive car alone and unaided additionally in week of grand prix fia banned teams from sending drivers coded messages either through radio or pit board and decided that at next race of season in japan they would be prohibited from sending information concerning tyres and brake wear after team principals raised concerns about extent of ban three days before race fia revised what teams could tell their drivers over radio including car performance and safety concerns after persistent media speculation about his future at caterham team confirmed that kamui kobayashi would take

after setting his fastest lap his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure ending his session early raikkonen s session also ended prematurely with brake fire vettel stopped at pit lane exit with a sudden loss in oil pressure but avoided a ten place grid penalty because he was running an older engine hamilton despite complaining of brake vibrations set day s fastest lap at 1 minute and 47

seconds slower than teammate hamilton hamilton led by five seconds by start of lap ten despite car balance problems over a single lap massa ran close behind raikkonen until his first pit stop at end of lap as part of williams team plan to pass ferrari through strategy raikkonen made his stop on following lap and emerged behind massa bottas entered pit lane on lap eleven with vettel alonso and ricciardo stopping on next lap after kvyat made his stop he rejoined behind rosberg but overtook him shortly after hamilton made his pit stop from lead on lap 14 and retained it narrowly in front of button rosberg was informed over radio that he could not go beyond 6 500 revolutions per minute in first gear because of a faulty pit lane limiter he slowly entered pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed mechanics switched his car off and rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel in an attempt to change gear after stopping for almost two minutes rosberg s car was pushed into his garage to retire massa overtook perez for sixth place on 15th lap vergne incurred a five second stop and go penalty on next lap after being judged

behind alonso s faster ferrari massa overtook hulkenberg on main straight for eighth on that lap hamilton made his stop for super soft compound tyres on following lap giving lead to ricciardo his team used a large time gap to remove rubber debris on his front wing ricciardo took his pit stop on lap 27 returning lead to hamilton grosjean was close behind perez but he could not pass him perez attempted an overtake sutil on straight on 30th lap and sutil squeezed perez into a wall clipping left front nose cone section it slid under perez s wheel littering debris on track and prompting safety car s deployment to enable marshals to remove debris from track some drivers elected to make pit stops to switch onto soft compound tyres ferrari brought their drivers in to enable them to reach end of race without need for another pit stop hamilton s race engineer peter bonnington cautioned him about debris but hamilton did not receive warning in time and drove over shards of wing he enquired about tyre pressures and was told no issues had been discovered sutil incurred a five second stop and go penalty for collision with perez safety car was withdrawn at end of 37th lap and racing resumed with hamilton in lead hamilton set race s fastest lap at 1 minute and 50 417 seconds on lap 39 to pull out a 5 8 second advantage over vettel sutil s car developed a water leak and

behind vettel and narrowly ahead of ricciardo hamilton quickly caught vettel used drs leaving turn five and turned right to reclaim lead two corners later on lap 54 button stopped at side of track to retire with a power box failure on same lap his retirement promoted raikkonen to seventh and bottas worn tyres slowed him enabling hulkenberg vergne and perez to run close behind him maldonado s aspiration for his first point of 2014 was not realised when magnussen passed him for tenth place on lap 56 three laps later hulkenberg was passed by vergne for eighth position vergne moved to seventh after overtaking raikkonen on left entering first corner and bottas soon after perez had better traction than teammate hulkenberg and passed him between turns 17 and 18 perez got past raikkonen driving into tenth turn and took seventh when bottas lost all tyre grip and fell from top ten quickly because of safety car period race ended under a two hour time limit unhindered in final eight laps hamilton opened up a healthy advantage over vettel and crossed start finish line after 60 laps for his seventh victory of season his second in singapore and 29th of his career vettel finished second in his best result of season 13 534 seconds behind and successfully held off teammate ricciardo and alonso in final laps massa finished fifth vergne s five second time penalty did not affect his sixth

three drivers reached front of field hamilton led three times for a total of 58 laps more than any other driver post race left thumb lewis hamilton celebrating his seventh victory of season and 29th of his career at podium interviews conducted by former team owner eddie jordan hamilton said he did not feel any pressure at his final pit stop because he felt comfortable with his large lead vettel revealed his team altered their strategy before safety car and stated final laps with worn tyres were very very much borderline and emphasised challenge of track in hot and humid weather conditions ricciardo spoke of event feeling like a home race and said he would watch alonso s first lap to see whether he should have ceded another position to ricciardo in later press conference hamilton felt race would have been hardcore had rosberg not retired and knew mercedes would not be 100 percent happy because they aspired to secure victories collectively and be series most dominant team vettel revealed how uncomfortable he felt that he could not reach end of race on worn tyres but stated second was best possible result for red bull ricciardo was satisfied to pressure his teammate vettel but felt it was a processional event for top three rosberg called his race toughest of year and deemed it worse than british grand prix when he retired with a gearbox failure he stated that his car s reliability needed most attention and wanted to understand problem it s tough not even leaving grid i was hoping team could fix it after race had started because it was going on and off sometimes working sometimes not there s no point in shouting it s a reliability issue and it s happened again mercedes team principal toto wolff apologised to rosberg immediately following driver s retirement saying it was a bitter moment to lose ground in drivers championship he later stated he did not want to see championship decided on reliability and that mercedes needed to refocus and discover origin of their problems team s technical director paddy lowe added reliability concerns worried him throughout season and spoke of his hopes it would not be repeated in future thumb kevin magnussen suffered from back burns and dehydration after his drinks bottle became hot because of a broken radiator seal after race magnussen was treated for dehydration and minor burns on his lower back with an iced towel by his trainer antti and mclaren sought a doctor who tended to magnussen in its hospitality building his condition was caused by a broken radiator seal that possibly loosened after going over turn seven kerbs early in grand prix causing hot air to be directed into his cockpit warming his seat and drinks bottle he found water in his drink bottle very hot to consume and complained over radio that it burned his mouth magnussen raised his arms out of his cockpit to direct cool air down his sleeves and onto his back to alleviate pain he called his tenth place finish hardest earnt point i ve ever had and mclaren team principal eric boullier said his performance under circumstances was a scant consolidation and praised magnussen for being indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit magnussen later posted on twitter that reports of his condition were exaggerated and that he felt just hot and sweaty kvyat also suffered from dehydration when his water supply malfunctioned after two thirds race distance alonso believed timing of safety car and not a strategy error prevented him from achieving a podium finish saying if ferrari had mercedes s pace they would remain on track moment of safety car was probably not good but sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn t help today it didn t help ferrari team principal marco defended his team s strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented them from finishing on podium definitely safety car didn t do any better for us but race is made of 60 laps we squeezed car as much as we could strategy from pits was excellent there were other variables we know we cannot control we did our best boullier suggested red bull used coded messages to assist ricciardo when they told ricciardo to remain off kerbs but stressed it was fia s task to investigate red bull team principal christian horner spoke to whiting for clarification because ricciardo had battery damage from going over kerbs governing body confirmed they were satisfied with red bull s radio messages and stated team abided by regulations result regained hamilton drivers championship lead with 241 points rosberg s retirement dropped him to second three points behind hamilton ricciardo consolidated third place with 181 points and alonso and vettel moved ahead of bottas for fourth and fifth mercedes further extended their lead in constructors championship to 182 points over of red bull in second place williams and ferrari remained in third and fourth places and force india moved in front of mclaren to move into fifth position with five
