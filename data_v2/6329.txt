wasp 17b is an exoplanet in constellation scorpius that is orbiting star wasp 17 its discovery was announced on 11 august 2009 it is first planet discovered to have a retrograde orbit meaning it orbits in a direction counter to rotation of its host star this discovery challenged traditional planetary formation theory a planet going wrong way phys org june 7 2011 accessed june 10 2011 in terms of diameter wasp 17b is one of largest exoplanets discovered and at half jupiter s mass this made it most puffy planet known in 2010 on 3 december 2013 scientists working with hubble space telescope reported detecting water in atmosphere of exoplanet discovery a team of researchers led by david anderson of keele university in staffordshire england discovered gas giant which is about 1 000 light years 300 parsecs from earth by observing it in transit its host star wasp 17 such photometric observations also reveal planet s size discovery was made with a telescope array at south african astronomical observatory due to involvement of wide angle search for planets superwasp consortium of universities exoplanet as 17th found to date by this group was given its present name astronomers at observatory of geneva were then able to use characteristic red shifts and blue shifts in host star s spectrum as its radial velocity varied over course of planet s orbit to measure planet s mass and obtain an indication of its orbital eccentricity careful examination of doppler shifts during transits also allowed them to determine direction of planet s orbital motion relative to its parent star s rotation via rossiter mclaughlin effect special properties wasp 17b has a radius between 1 5 and 2 times that of jupiter and about half mass thus its mean density is between 0 08 and 0 19 g cm3 compared with jupiter s 1 326 g cm3 and earth s 5 515 g cm3 density of water is 1 g cm3 unusually low density is thought to be a consequence of a combination of planet s orbital eccentricity and its proximity to its parent star less than one seventh of distance between mercury and sun leading to tidal flexing and heating of its interior same mechanism is behind intense volcanic activity of jupiter s moon io wasp 39b has a similarly low estimated density wasp 17b is thought to have a retrograde orbit with a sky projected inclination of orbit normal against stellar spin axis of about amaury h m j et al spin orbit angle measurements for six southern transiting planets accepted for publication in a a 2010 arxiv preprint not to be confused with line of sight inclination of orbit given in table which is near 90deg for all transiting planets which would make it first planet discovered to have such an orbital motion it was found by measuring rossiter mclaughlin effect of planet on star s doppler signal as it transited in which whichever of star s hemispheres is turning toward or away from earth will show a slight blueshift or redshift which is dampened by transiting planet scientists are not yet sure why planet orbits opposite to star s rotation theories include a gravitational slingshot resulting from a near collision with another planet or intervention of a smaller planet like body working to gradually change wasp 17b s orbit by tilting it via kozai mechanism sodium in atmosphere of wasp 17 has been detected thumb center 400px comparison of hot jupiter exoplanets artist concept from top left to lower right wasp 12b wasp 6b wasp 31b wasp 39b hd 189733b hat p 12b wasp 17b wasp 19b hat p 1b and hd 209458b see also hat p 7b another exoplanet announced to have a retrograde orbit day after wasp 17b announcement tres 4 another large exoplanet with a low density list of exoplanet extremes notes references external links alexander amir scientists detect wrong way planet planetary society august 12 2009 accessed august 14 2009 category exoplanets discovered in 2009 category exoplanets discovered by wasp category giant planets category hot jupiters category transiting exoplanets category scorpius constellation
