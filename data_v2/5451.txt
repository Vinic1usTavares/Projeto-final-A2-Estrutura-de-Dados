nebka meaning lord of ka is throne name of an ancient egyptian pharaoh of third dynasty during old kingdom period in 27th century bce he is thought to be identical with hellenized name necherochis or necherophes recorded by egyptian priest manetho of much later ptolemaic period nebka s name is otherwise recorded from near tomb of a priest of his cult as well as in a possible cartouche from beit khallaf later new kingdom king lists and in a story of papyrus westcar if beit khallaf seal impression is indeed a cartouche of nebka then he is earliest king to have thus recorded his throne name otherwise this innovation can be ascribed to huni nebka is thought by most egyptologists to be throne name of sanakht third or fourth ruler of third dynasty who is sparsely attested by archaeological evidence and must have had only a short reign older hypotheses followed two new kingdom sources which credit nebka with founding third dynasty a view that is now believed to contradict archaeological evidence tomb of nebka has not been located with any certainty and three locations have been proposed a mastaba in beit khallaf attributed to sanakht by john garstang a mudbrick structure in abu rawash seen as tomb of nebka by swelim and dodson and unfinished northern pyramid of zawyet el aryan name sources earliest source for nebka s name is mastaba tomb of late third dynasty high official akhetaa who among other positions held that of priest of nebka exact location of akhetaa s mastaba is now lost hindering further research it may be near abusir where some relief bearing blocks from tomb were found re used as construction material next oldest source is found in a story recorded on westcar papyrus which dates to seventeenth dynasty but which was likely first written during late middle kingdom period possibly at end of twelfth dynasty there a king nebka is cited in story known as nebka and crocodile which pertains to adultery and typical sort of punishment for that during old kingdom story throws a positive light on personality of king nebka who is depicted as a strict but lawful judge he punishes mischief and unethical behavior in this case punishing betrayal of an unfaithful wife with death penalty passage involving nebka starts after a magician ubaoner throws a commoner who had an affair with ubaoner s wife to a crocodile who swallows him for seven days subsequent historical sources date to nineteenth dynasty royal table of saqqara mentions a nebkara close to end of third dynasty as direct successor of sekhemket and predecessor of huni this nebkara is likely a variant of name nebka near contemporaneous abydos king list and turin canon record a king nebka this time as founder of third dynasty finally a king necherochis is listed as founder of third dynasty in aegyptiaca a history of egypt written in 3rd century bce during reign of ptolemy ii 283 246 bce by an egyptian priest manetho no copies of aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by sextus julius africanus and eusebius themselves quoted by byzantine scholar george syncellus according to these sources aegyptiaca gave necherochis as predecessor of sesorthos or both names being widely held to refer to djoser as aegyptiaca credits sesorthos with invention of stone architecture necherochis eusebius or necherophes africanus both likely hellenized forms of nebka is said to have faced a rebellion of libyans during his reign but when moon waxed beyond reckoning they surrendered in terror africanus further credits necherophes with 28 years of reign identity thumb upright seal impression from beit khallaf showing sanakht s serekh together with what could be a cartouche of nebka nebka s identity with respect to other third dynasty rulers is now partially settled most scholars including thomas schneider baker peter clayton michel baud jaromir malek toby wilkinson kenneth anderson kitchen stephan michael rice donald and rainer stadelmann are convinced that nebka was identical with hor sanakht this opinion is based on a single fragmentary clay seal discovered by in 1902 in beit khallaf a locality north of abydos kurt sethe proposed that damaged sealing shows serekh of sanakht next to a fragmentary cartouche housing an archaic form of sign for ka cartouche is believed to be just large enough to have enclosed further sign neb in addition a further two dozen sealings of sanakht were uncovered in beit khallaf s nearby tomb k2 which john garstang believed to be this king s tomb if identification of nebka with sanakht is correct then nebka is earliest king to write his throne name in a cartouche and otherwise this innovation would pass to huni egyptologists john d nabil swelim and wolfgang resisted equation of nebka with sanakht in earlier research they underline heavily damaged nature of beit khallaf seal fragment and hence that alleged cartouche can be hardly identified with certainty instead they propose that cartouche could actually be oval shaped crest of a royal fortress with one or several boats in it a city that may have already been mentioned under name elder s boats in sources dating to second dynasty king peribsen chronology thumb upright relief fragment of sanakht from sinai nebka s relative chronological position has been subject of debate in earlier egyptology as he is listed as first pharaoh of third dynasty in both turin third column seventh line and abydos 15th entry king lists some egyptologists including malek tried to reconcile this position in list with evidence from beit khallaf by proposing that nebka sanakht reigned for a short time between last second dynasty ruler khasekhemwy and djoser whom malek sees as a younger brother to sanakht this is now understood to flatly contradict quoting wilkinson much archeological evidences which rather point to djoser as first ruler of dynasty and sekhemket as his immediate successor for example numerous seal fragments of djoser uncovered in tomb of khasekhemwy strongly suggest that he buried this king who might have been his father khasekhemwy s wife and likely djoser s mother queen nimaethap was herself buried in tomb k1 of beit khallaf which yielded much sealings of djoser but none of sanakht nimaethap was furthermore given title of mother of a king that is with a singular implying that she had only one son who ascended throne precluding reign of sanakht between those of khasekhemwy and djoser kitchen also observes that turin canon gives exactly same reign length of 19 years to both nebka and djoser hinting at an error in placement of nebka s name on canon and attribution of djoser s regnal years to nebka in addition saqqara king list places nebka after sekhemket rather than before djoser further indirect evidence for nebka s placement in late third dynasty comes from papyrus westcar which records story of nebka and crocodile between two tales set in reigns of djoser and huni and sneferu respectively evidence from tomb of akhetaa regarding chronological position of nebka is inconclusive on one hand akhetaa s title could indicate that he was priest of cult of reigning king and thus that nebka was alive at end of third dynasty on other hand it could equally be that akhetaa was priest of a funerary cult in which case nebka s placement could be somewhat earlier given likely identification of nebka with sanakht and placement of later in late third dynasty perhaps as penultimate king of this line it is possible that nebka sanakht reigned for six years this is duration credited by turin canon to immediate predecessor of huni whose name is lost and in any case a short reign better fits scant archeological evidences for both nebka and sanakht tomb thumb upright skull uncovered in beit khallaf tomb k2 attributed to sanakht by garstang tomb of nebka has not been located with any certainty nor has that of sanakht garstang who excavated mastaba k2 at beit khallaf believed that it belonged to sanakht as seals bearing this pharaoh s name were uncovered there beside a burial dieter arnold and other egyptologists now think mastaba k2 was tomb of a private individual rather than a royal one swelim and aidan dodson have instead proposed that a mudbrick structure located in abu rawash could be tomb of nebka dodson states that it is a mudbrick enclosure with a central square massif of same material located north of modern village of abu known as el dair it has been badly damaged by drainage work since first being discovered in 1902 and now may be beyond saving however plan seems to closely resemble royal funerary monuments of late second early third dynasties while pottery from site has been dated to latter period thumb upright stone sarcophagus from unfinished northern pyramid of zawyet el aryan at opposite some egyptologists have noticed that nebka s name seems to be inscribed in unfinished northern pyramid of zawyet el aryan under form nebkara so that this structure could have been started by this king more precisely they point to several graffiti made of black and red ink which were found in chamber and in descending stairway of pyramid alessandro barsanti recorded at least 67 inscriptions with names of different workmen crews as well as name of planned pyramid complex seba ka meaning star of ka workmen crew whose name appears most often thus being leading crew during building works was wer ef seba ka meaning great like star of king ka inscription no 35 gives name nefer meaning his beautiful ka is flawless but otherwise lacks any reference to known people from third of fourth dynasty to which this pyramid is usually ascribed graffiti no 15 and no 52 mention royal name nebkara meaning lord of ka of ra and a further inscription no 55 mentions a possible horus of gold name neb meaning lord of golden crown some egyptologists propose that this is either horus name of king huni or horus of gold name of nebka
