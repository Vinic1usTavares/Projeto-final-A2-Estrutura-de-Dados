off to make sure lana is all right three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in lana s direction clark arrives just as lana in truck is sucked into tornado s vortex clark speeds into tornado to rescue her production when thinking of how to end first season two things were clear to alfred gough and miles millar final episode would have school prom and there would be tornadoes although jeph loeb s superman for all seasons which inspired gough and millar when they created show contains an event where a tornado hits smallville pair insist that tornado idea came from a story they overheard on radio about a tornado that hit a high school during their prom night simpson p 102 episode would mark departure of eric johnson as series star whitney fordman though he would return as a special guest in seasons two and four filming director greg beeman filmed episode with a tone that was thematically similar to a rising storm according to beeman episode would start very calm and then begin to build upon itself as he explains hard part of filming was controlling buildup beeman wanted to build drama visuals and wind from storm up together mike walls brought in jet powered wind machines which had been used for movie twister to simulate high velocity winds for storm that was going to blow through smallville wind is first introduced when chloe arrives to pick clark up for prom what begins as a gentle introduction is built upon little by little with each progressing scene by time lana drops whitney off at bus station wind has become very strong another dilemma beeman faced was keeping performances realistic and not over top beeman believes that tempest proves exactly what he thought about smallville that show is seen and experienced from point of view of a teenager beeman explains if you re in love you re head over heels in love if you re scared you re terrified if you re sad you re in grief emotions are strong but it doesn t mean that performances are over top thumb right from left to right tom welling clark kent allison mack chloe sullivan and sam jones iii pete ross with remy zero for tempest this boils down to departure of whitney which causes distress in lana experimental relationship between clark and chloe who are trying to figure out whether or not they ll be in love evilness of roger nixon and how jonathan fights to protect his family and battle between father and son lionel and lex beeman saw these events as if they were part of an opera and that performances needed to match that tone without going over top simpson p 104 rob maier construction coordinator and production designer for tempest was very busy for this episode as scenes were filmed at andalinis farm and zero avenue which is name of road that runs along canada us border for scene where three tornadoes touch down beside lana he also had to work on shattering windows at luthor mansion for lex and lionel s final confrontation simpson p 106 band remy zero whose single save me is opening theme for show was asked to perform for episode band quickly learned that filming a live performance for a television show is not as straight forward as its sounds in order to be able to film everything beeman could not have band playing full volume throughout scene there were times when everyone had to be quiet and pretend to play or dance while actors exchanged their dialogue there were other times when they had to be as loud as they could effects mike walsh was worried about filming moment when a beam breaks inside luthor mansion from wind generated by storm and lands on top of lionel his crew already knew which beam was going to fall but they did not know where to cut beam because they were not sure how beeman intended to shoot scene when day of shooting came around everything worked out well they used a stunt double for initial impact of beam and then john glover stepped back into scene and fell down with beam on top of him wind effects also created potential danger for cast and crew as eric johnson recalls even smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage annette o toole had a similar experience for her scenes in storm cellar when jonathan races into storm after nixon special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate winds that were coming from outside dry leaves were smacking o toole in face smothering her simpson pp 110 111 character development this episode featured a lot of character development that many of actors had been waiting for lana s jealousy over clark and chloe going to prom begins to come out although kristin kreuk believes that lana does not want to be jealous and wants to be able to support clark with his newfound feelings for chloe according to eric johnson whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that johnson wishes audience would have been able to see sooner as whitney gives lana a private dance before prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town simpson p 107 to add further depth to his character not previously seen millar and gough decided to send whitney off to war instead of killing character outright idea of sending whitney off to war was something that came to millar and gough midway through season they knew they did not want to kill him because they wanted ability to bring him back at some point in future so they came up with this noble heroic send off for character simpson p 108 for lex this episode featured moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it as rosenbaum sees it moment that lex hesitates to free his father from support beam that collapses on him is moment that audience gets to see a hint of evil man they know lex will one day become this is a brief moment where lex forgets who he is and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his turn to dark side simpson p 109 reception tempest
