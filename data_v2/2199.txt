bath she became romantically involved with co star michael sheen after meeting during play rehearsals she later said i was all revved up to feel very intimidated it was my first ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions and then he walked in it was almost like god well i m finished now that s it then he s most outrageously talented person i ve ever met irving

royal court theatre and clocks and whistles at bush theatre beckinsale next starred in an itv adaptation of jane austen s emma playing emma to mark strong s mr knightley and samantha morton s harriet smith you shouldn t necessarily like emma beckinsale has said of her character you do love her but in way family of a young girl could be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her programme was aired in autumn 1996 just months after gwyneth paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of same story caryn james of new york times felt that while ms beckinsale s emma is plainer looking than ms paltrow s she is altogether more believable and funnier jonathan brown of independent has described beckinsale s interpretation as most enduring modern performance as emma in 1997 beckinsale appeared opposite stuart townsend in comedy shooting fish one of most commercially successful british films of that year i d just had my wisdom teeth out beckinsale later recalled of initial audition i was also on very strong painkillers so it was not most conventional of meetings elley wrote of an incredibly laid back performance while thomas felt she just glows as an aristocrat

in an audiobook production of romeo and juliet directed by sheen 1998 2002 move to hollywood at this point in her career beckinsale began to seek work in united states something she has said wasn t a conscious decision my boyfriend was in a play on broadway so that s why we ended up in new york and my auditions happened to be for american films she starred opposite chloe sevigny in 1998 s last days of disco whit stillman film focused on a group of ivy league graduates socialising in manhattan disco scene of early 1980s beckinsale s attempt at an american accent was widely praised kenneth turan of los angeles times felt her role as bossy charlotte was beautifully played todd mccarthy of variety was unimpressed by film but noted that compensations include beckinsale looking incredible in a succession of black dresses whose character can get on your nerves even if actress doesn t her performance earned her a london critics circle film award film grossed 3 million worldwide also that year she starred as alice in a channel 4 production of through looking glass in 1999 beckinsale appeared opposite claire danes in brokedown palace a drama about two young americans forced to deal with thai justice system on a post graduation trip abroad a then 26 year old beckinsale played a young girl danes had hoped to become friends with beckinsale during shoot but found her complicated and prickly mccarthy said leads confirm their status as two of young actresses on scene today most worth watching finding beckinsale very effective at getting across layered character traits and emotions danes and beckinsale are exceptionally talented young actresses said thomas but unfortunately script s seriously underdeveloped context defeats their considerable efforts at every turn stephen holden of new york times felt that beckinsale s character never comes into focus film was a box office failure 2000 s golden bowl marked beckinsale s first role following birth of her daughter merchant ivory production was based on novel by henry james and also starred uma thurman and jeremy northam beckinsale s partner michael sheen hit northam on film set after he followed beckinsale to her trailer to scold her for forgetting a line holden noted most satisfying of four lead performances belong to british cast members ms beckinsale and mr northam who are better than their american counterparts at layers of emotional concealment adding each beat of beckinsale s performance registers precisely thomas felt her performance would take her to a new career level andrew sarris of new york observer asserted that she comes close to capturing sublimity of maggie despite obvious fact that no movie can capture elegant of james prose film grossed over 5 million worldwide beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with a leading role in war film pearl harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots played by ben affleck and josh hartnett she was drawn to project by script it s so unusual these days to read a script that has those old fashioned values to it not morals but movie values it s a big sweeping epic you just never get chance to do that director michael bay initially had doubts about casting actress i wasn t sure about her at first she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and i thought she was a little nasty it was easy to think of this woman as a slut he eventually decided to hire her because she wasn t too beautiful women feel disturbed when they see someone s too pretty he asked her to lose weight during filming in a 2004 interview actress noted that his comments were upsetting and said she wore leather trousers because it was snowing out it wasn t exactly like i had my nipple rings in she felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age if i had come on to a movie set at a younger age and someone had said you re a bit funny looking can you go on a diet i might have jumped off a building i just didn t have confidence to put that into perspective at time however speaking in 2011 she said she was very fond of bay pearl harbor received negative reviews owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly praised avid eyed ruby lipped kate beckinsale rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom she s like parker posey without irony a o scott of new york times noted that mr affleck and ms beckinsale do what they can with their lines and glow with shine of real movie stars however mike clark of usa today felt that usually appealing kate beckinsale is inexplicably submerged like her hospital colleagues under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of era didn t wear film was a commercial success grossing 449 million worldwide beckinsale s second film appearance of 2001 was in romantic comedy serendipity as love interest of john cusack it was filmed directly after pearl harbor and beckinsale found it a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar turan praised appealing and believable leads adding that beckinsale reinforces strong impression she made in cold comfort farm golden bowl and last days of disco after recovering nicely from her appearance in much maligned pearl harbor claudia puig of usa today felt that beckinsale s talents haven t been mined as effectively in any other film since cold comfort farm mccarthy found her energetic and appealing while elvis mitchell of new york times described her as luminous but determined in an uncomplimentary review of film ebert described her as a good actress but not good enough to play this dumb film has grossed over 77 million at worldwide box office in 2002 beckinsale starred in lisa s laurel canyon as a strait laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free spirited future mother in law independent film was another opportunity for beckinsale to work with christian bale her prince of jutland co star she found their sex scene awkward because she knew bale well if it was a stranger it would have been easier while frances s performance as bale s mother was widely praised beckinsale received negative reviews holden found film superbly acted with exception of ms beckinsale whose tense colourless alex conveys no inner life critic lisa schwarzbaum was unimpressed by tedious characters and criticised fussy performances of bale and beckinsale in particular film has grossed over 4 million worldwide 2003 2006 action roles thumb left upright beckinsale at 53rd san sebastian international film festival in 2005 beckinsale became known as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003 s underworld film was markedly different from her previous work and beckinsale has said she was grateful for change of pace after appearing in a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies adding that it was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when in real life i can t catch a ball if it s coming my way film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box office hit and has gained a cult following also that year she starred in little seen tiptoes with gary oldman and matthew mcconaughey in 2004 beckinsale starred in action horror film van helsing she was so surprised to be appearing in her second action film in two years it just seemed like a very good role beckinsale had just separated from her long term boyfriend michael sheen at time of filming and appreciated warm atmosphere created on set by director stephen sommers and co star hugh jackman i really did find that working with people like stephen and hugh made it possible to get through what i was going through film grossed over 120 million at us box office and over 300 million worldwide but it was not well reviewed mick lasalle of san francisco chronicle described her as a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker s whimsy while rex reed of new york observer felt she was desperately in need of a new agent also in 2004 beckinsale portrayed ava gardner in martin scorsese s howard hughes biopic aviator scorsese decided to cast beckinsale because i ve always liked her i ve seen all her work and i was glad that she agreed to audition beckinsale s performance received mixed reviews ken tucker of new york magazine said she played part in full va va voom blossom while lasalle felt that she manages to convince us that ava was one of great broads of all time however clark described it as one performance that doesn t come off though beckinsale has requisite beauty while peter bradshaw of guardian stated that gardner s rich voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as beckinsale sleepwalks through role as if she was advertising perfume film grossed over 213 million worldwide in 2006 beckinsale reprised her role as selene in successful vampire sequel underworld evolution directed by her husband it was first time she had been involved with a movie from moment it s a germ of an idea right through whole editing process her daughter had a small role as younger selene film was a box office success grossing 111 million worldwide beckinsale s second film appearance of 2006 was opposite adam sandler and christopher walken in click a comedy about an overworked family man who discovers a magical remote control that allows him to control time opportunity to play a mother was one of things that was attractive to me about part it was highly profitable grossing 237 million worldwide from a production budget of 82 5 million 2007 2008 focus on small scale drama beckinsale then made a return to smaller scale projects my experience is that i sort of stepped away from independent movies and did a couple of big movies but that s not necessarily how it s perceived by everybody else which i do understand i enjoy an action movie as much as next person but it s not something that i would like to do solely she explained that she had originally decided to appear in underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles it was assumed that i use a chamber pot and wear bloomers but that her action career kind of took off a little too much in 2007 beckinsale starred opposite sam rockwell in independent drama snow angels based on novel by stewart o nan harrowing film in which she played an overwhelmed single mother put beckinsale in kind of a tough place i did have my kid my husband and in fact my ex was around a lot so it was very nice to come home to my people whom i love puig felt beckinsale gives her best performance in years while richard corliss of time described it as her sharpest work yet however scott felt that her skill and discipline cannot overcome sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem hard as she works to convince us otherwise it s a stretch to believe that a woman with kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like glenn film grossed just 414 404 worldwide also in 2007 beckinsale appeared alongside luke wilson in vacancy a thriller set in an isolated motel sarah jessica parker was originally cast in part but she dropped out before filming began bradshaw felt wilson and beckinsale have chops for scary movies while gleiberman noted luke wilson with his hangdog defensive and kate beckinsale all sexy severity are ideally matched as a couple who hate each other however manohla dargis of new york times was unimpressed referring to beckinsale as reigning queen of bland b s film was profitable grossing 35 million worldwide from a production budget of 19 million thumb upright beckinsale at london premiere of live free or die hard in june 2007 in 2008 beckinsale appeared in winged creatures a film about how six different witnesses cope with aftermath of a shooting beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included dakota fanning jennifer hudson and forest whitaker it was a really really nice experience but it was quick said beckinsale of filming process i just felt a bit like i was shot through a cannon betsy sharkey of los angeles times felt she played role with a white trash verve and found her character s raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable however dargis felt that beckinsale and her cast mates have a tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just cliches film received a very limited theatrical release in new york and los angeles it was released simultaneously on dvd also in 2008 beckinsale starred in nothing but truth as a journalist who refuses to reveal her source film co starring vera farmiga and matt dillon was inspired by case of judith miller as part of her research for role i spent some time at l a times with some female reporters and i spoke to judith miller about her experience i really researched hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling brilliant experience ann hornaday of washington post asserted that beckinsale and farmiga played two of most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while and they ve been brought to life by two gifted actresses each working at top of her game beckinsale received a critic s choice award nomination for her performance film never received a full theatrical release after distributor filed for bankruptcy and film has grossed just 186 702 worldwide i have prayed prayed for film companies to go bankrupt on films i ve made and then this happens on one i love said beckinsale usually it s ones
