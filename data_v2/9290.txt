mesmerizingly elliptical story she commended in particular dreamy camera work and charged simple direction j hoberman wrote for village voice that few directors have revisited their earliest concerns with such vigor as van sant he concluded his review saying paranoid park is wonderfully lucid it makes confusion something tangible and heartbreak most natural thing in life todd mccarthy of variety magazine wrote that through immaculate use of picture sound and time director adds another panel to his series of pictures about disaffected disconnected youth he praised lovely cinematography and credibility of female characters though he felt that soundtrack was sometimes distracting writing for new york magazine david edelstein opined that film was a supernaturally perfect fusion of van sant s current conceptual art project head trip aesthetic and blake nelson s finely tuned first person young adult novel he felt that paranoid park was different from van sant s previous experimental films in that it works though he criticized nevins s clinically inexpressive acting rolling stones peter travers awarded film 3 5 out of 4 stars and commented that combination of soundtrack with visual miracles of cinematography a defiant slap at slick hollywood formula is mesmerizing in a review for hollywood reporter kirk honeycutt named film one of van sant s best movies yet alternatively william arnold of seattle post intelligencer graded film as a c and described it as a movie about its teen hero s inability to express his feelings to himself to his parents to his friends and unfortunately to audience he criticized amateurish cinematography half hearted attempts at mystery and wooden cast salon com s andrew o hehir wrote that paranoid parks highly aestheticized and stylized depictions of teenage life sometimes seem as if they were shot through wrong end of a telescope he felt that dialogue was repetitious and that teenage existence as portrayed in film was less realistic than most hollywood cliches new york press critic armond white wrote that in film van sant reaches out to teen subculture only to embalm its dissatisfaction in and found it to be full of art movie cliches david

very complicated la weeklys randall roberts praised soundtrack highly writing it doesn t happen too often that a film s music will tweak my visual and sonic filter to such an extent that i actually
