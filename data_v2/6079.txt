thumb frigg and her servants 1882 by carl emil doepler in norse mythology hlin is a goddess associated with goddess frigg hlin appears in a poem in poetic edda compiled in 13th century from earlier traditional sources prose edda written in 13th century by snorri sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry scholars have debated whether stanza referring to her in prose edda refers to frigg hlin serves as a given name in iceland and hlin receives veneration in modern era in germanic paganism s modern extension heathenry etymology scholars frequently explain meaning behind goddess s name as protector see for example orchard 1997 86 and lindow 2001 177 prose edda section gylfaginning derives name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested old norse proverb af er that at sa er hleinir scholars generally accept that theonym hlin derives from verb hleina however verb hleina in which section claims a derivation is obscure a hapax and translators have attempted to work around it in a variety of manners in some cases leaving verb untranslated examples include translations of anthony faulkes from this comes saying that someone who escapes finds refuge hleinir 1995 1987 and jesse byock from her name comes expression that he who escapes finds hleinir peace and quiet 2005 hopkins 2017 31 32 33 scholars have proposed a variety of derivations for verb verb is most commonly linked to old english and ancestors to modern english verb lean 19th century scholars including jacob grimm linked hleina to rare old norse noun meaning maple tree grimm links this derivation to a variety of tree figures found in folklore from modern era in northwest europe joseph hopkins 2017 comments that this derivation may deserve further investigation in light of potential connection between old norse goddess name and old norse common noun elm tree and says that potential of a protective tree goddess brings to mind a mysterious passage in prose edda involving rowan in which tree is referred to as thor s aid help salvation rescue hopkins 2017 31 32 33 35 attestations in poetic edda poem voluspa hlin receives a mention regarding foretold death of god odin during immense battle waged at ragnarok then is fulfilled hlin s second sorrow when odinn goes to fight with wolf and beli s slayer bright against surtr then shall frigg s sweet friend fall dronke 1997 21 death of odin stanza s second sorrow implies a first death scholars all but universally view this as a reference to death of god baldr frigg and odin s son hopkins 2017 30 some translators replace reference of hlin to a mention of frigg due to their interpretations of stanza see discussion in scholarly reception and interpretation section below examples include translations by olive bray 1908 carolyne larrington 1999 dodds 2014 and jackson crawford 2015 for discussion see hopkins 2017 31 32 in chapter 35 of prose edda book gylfaginning hlin is listed twelfth among a series of sixteen goddesses high tells gangleri earlier in book described as king gylfi in disguise that hlin is given function of protecting people whom frigg wishes to save from some danger high continues that from this comes saying that someone who escapes finds refuge faulkes 1995 30 verb hleina in this passage is obscure and has yielded a variety of translations see etymology section above in chapter 51 above mentioned voluspa stanza is quoted faulkes 1995 55 in chapter 75 of book skaldskaparmal hlin appears within a list of 27 asynjur names faulkes 1995 157 in skaldic poetry name hlin is frequent in kennings for women examples include hlin hlin of rings hlin hlin of velvet and arm hlin arm hlin name is already used frequently in this way by 10th century poet and remains current in skaldic poetry through following centuries employed by poets such as thordr kolbeinsson and einarr finnur jonsson 1931 263 name remained frequently used in woman kennings in rimur poetry sometimes as lin finnur jonsson 1926 28 175 245 in a verse in havardar saga isfirdings phrase a hlin fallen on hlin occurs some editors have emended brynjulfsson 1860 174 finnur jonsson 1912 191 1912 181 while others have accepted reading and taken hlin to refer to earth bjorn karel thorolfsson and gudni jonsson 1943 341 modern influence in line with a cultural practice to use old norse as personal names hlin appears as a given name for females in iceland like other goddesses from north germanic corpus hlin receives veneration in heathenry hopkins 2017 31 scholarly reception and interpretation although prose edda identifies hlin as a separate goddess than frigg many scholars identify hlin as another name for frigg for example andy orchard says that in voluspa hlin appears to be just another name for frigg and adds that numerous occurrences of name in skaldic poetry in poetic or kennings for women do nothing to dispel confusion orchard 1997 86 rudolf simek agrees that hlin seems to appear as another name for frigg in voluspa and that in skaldic poetry hlin was a well known mythological figure by 10th century simek states that hlin is likely simply another name for frigg and that snorri misunderstood her to be a goddess in her own right in his reading of voluspa stanza simek 2007 153 however in same work simek also says that goddesses saga hlin snotra var and vor should be considered vaguely defined figures who should be seen as female protective goddesses that are all responsible for specific areas of private sphere and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons simek 2007 274 some scholars express uncertainty at identifying hlin as another name for frigg and others reject identification altogether in a 2017 paper on topic hopkins agrees with simek s comparison to matrons and compares scholarly reception of goddess fulla another goddess closely associated with frigg to that of hlin like hlin name fulla full bountiful may be tempting to dismiss as a reading error on part of a prose edda author or as a poetic invention were it not for preservation of cognate theonym in second merseburg charm fulla would remain in a similarly ambiguous position like that of hlin easily overlooked dismissed or deconstructed correlations between prose edda and second merseburg incantation provide something of a cautionary tale namely by dismissing information found solely in prose edda one risks violating foundational maxim of absence of evidence is not evidence of absence there is no reason to doubt that hlin was an independent entity in old norse mythology and no positive evidence to suggest that hlin was merely a by name of frigg hopkins 2017 34 35 referencing iconography of early germanic matrons hopkins proposes an alternate reading of voluspa stanza in line with gylfaginning description of goddess in hopkins s reading of stanza hlin s sorrows are her inability to protect figures close to frigg first sorrow would therefore be death of baldr and second sorrow foretold death of odin hopkins 2017 35 notes references bjorn karel thorolfsson and gudni jonsson 1943 sogur reykjavik hid dronke ursula
