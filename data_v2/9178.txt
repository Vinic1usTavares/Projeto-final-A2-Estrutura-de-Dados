no pressure is a 2010 short film produced by global warming mitigation campaign 10 10 written by richard curtis and armstrong and directed by dougal wilson intended for cinema and television advertisements no pressure is composed of scenes in which a variety of men women and children in every day situations are graphically blown to pieces for failing to be sufficiently enthusiastic about 10 10 campaign to reduce co2 emissions film s makers said that they viewed no pressure as a funny and satirical tongue in cheek little film in over top style of monty python or south park before its release guardian described it as attention grabbing and pretty edgy film was withdrawn from public circulation by 10 10 on same day it was released due to negative publicity charities that had backed film stated they were absolutely appalled upon seeing it and several of 10 10 s corporate and strategic partners withdrew from partnership background and production film was made in an attempt to challenge no pressure attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change 10 10 highlighted urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 within four years in order to avoid disaster and that 300 000 real people are already killed by climate change annually lizzie gillet 10 10 global campaign director explained with climate change becoming increasingly threatening and talked about in media we wanted to find a way to bring this critical issue back into headlines while making people laugh we were therefore delighted when richard curtis agreed to write a short film for 10 10 campaign film was shot on a location at camden school for girls in london borough of camden in north london according to 10 10 over 50 film professionals and more than 40 actors and extras provided their services at no cost synopsis four minute film consists of a series of short scenes in which groups of people are asked if they are interested in participating in 10 10 project to reduce carbon emissions those failing to show enthusiasm for cause are gruesomely blown to pieces in first scene a bright and chirpy schoolteacher played by lyndsey marshal tells her class about 10 10 campaign and asks what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint she asks which students are planning to participate most raise their hands but two children shrug teacher reassures them that this is fine it s absolutely fine it s your choice and there is no pressure but then shifts papers on her desk to reveal a red buttoned detonator which she presses two children who did not want to participate explode covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts blood spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain night s homework to her horrified charges second scene shows a group of white collar workers in an office meeting office manager similarly explains purpose of 10 10 campaign and asks who will be participating while most raise their hands four raise their hands unconvinced manager reassures them that there is no pressure to participate but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant which he uses to blow up four workers splattering appalled co workers with gore third scene is set on a football pitch during team training coach played by david ginola asks players to explain 10 10 campaign that team is participating in they describe a range of energy saving measures which have been implemented by team and its fans however coach remains unmoved remarking campaign would distract him from football a player tells him that there s no pressure produces a detonator and blows him up unlike witnesses depicted in previous scenes team is not at all surprised and casually jogs away to resume training a brief interlude with captions explains campaign accompanied by music from radiohead in final scene actress gillian anderson is finishing voice over for interlude just seen sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint anderson remarks that she thought providing recording was a sufficient contribution sound engineer repeats film s catchphrase no pressure and detonates anderson before picking up to leave film ends with a shot of anderson s gory remains sliding down sound booth window with text cut your carbon by 10 no pressure reception upon its release no pressure provoked an immediate negative reaction in media and resulting controversy became widely referred to as by bloggers in daily telegraph james delingpole wrote that film was an ugly counterproductive eco propaganda movie and that with no pressure environmental movement has revealed snarling wicked homicidal misanthropy beneath its cloak of gentle bunny hugging righteousness website described it as crass tasteless and unfunny as it gets while melanie phillips in spectator commented on intended humorous aspect of film by writing that joke was only about blowing dissenters to bits and raining their flesh down on terrified people because exterminating human beings is acceptable to greens as a joke from which we can only assume at best indifference towards and at worst a profound loathing of human condition american environmentalist and writer bill mckibben lamented film on climate progress website where he wrote climate skeptics can crow it s kind of stupidity that hurts our side reinforcing in people s minds a series of preconceived notions not least of which is that we re out of control and out of touch not to mention off wall and also with completely misplaced sense of humor mckibben added there s no question that crap like this will cast a shadow for a time over our efforts and everyone else who s working on global warming mckibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10 10 in independent dominic lawson wrote as often as 10 10 tried to pull film off youtube their critics re posted it this at least proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement curtis had made when you try to satirise critics of your campaign and it turns out that those very critics embrace your film as demonstrating exactly what they find unbearable about climate obsessed eco lobby then you know that you have kicked ball into your own net film generated a huge reaction in blogosphere one comment to guardian read to suggest that people who disagree with you deserve to die is incredibly stupid imagine if some christian group in us did that to gays muslims or anyone else they disagree with outrage would be palpable and deserved guardian which was a key collaborator with 10 10 campaign since its launch and got exclusive rights to show film premiere responded to criticism by stating that film may have been somewhat tasteless but it was an imaginative attempt to challenge public apathy over climate change this statement originally ended and highly unusually for attempts to communicate about this subject funny too but this was later redacted a later report in newspaper by adam vaughan said that film intended as a tongue in cheek spoof of hectoring greens had created a huge amount of global coverage for 10 10 in print and on web report said that while many people had found film hilarious there was a predictable slating from climate sceptics as well as furious reactions from some environmentalists report also went on to describe other more reflective responses which had focused on effective communication psychology satire and ways of engaging with various audiences over climate change withdrawal although originally planned to be shown in cinema and television advertisements 10 10 removed film from their website and youtube later on 1 october 2010 on friday 2 october 10 10 placed a notice on their website saying many people found resulting film extremely funny but unfortunately some didn t and we sincerely apologise to anybody we have offended at 10 10 we re all about trying new and creative ways of getting people to take action on climate change unfortunately in this instance we missed mark oh well we live and learn this was criticised as a non apology apology by michelle malkin in litchfield county register and andrew in an opinion piece in new york times a spokesman for 10 10 also denied that withdrawal had been planned from beginning in order to generate publicity after removing video from youtube 10 10 issued a statement we won t be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on internet then on monday 5 october 10 10 director eugenie harvey issued a second more comprehensive apology stating we are sorry to our corporate sponsors delivery partners and board members who have been implicated in this situation despite having no involvement in film s production or release actionaid a charity which co ordinates a schools programme with 10 10 approved decision to withdraw film and stated our job is to encourage proactive decisions at class level to reduce carbon emissions we did it because evidence shows children are deeply concerned about climate change and because we see impacts of it in developing world where a lot of our work is so we think 10 10 campaign is very important but moment this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate in wake of film s withdrawal richard curtis admitted that attempt to draw attention to cause of lowering emissions may have backfired curtis said when you try to be funny on a serious subject it s obviously risky i hope people who don t like little film will still think about big issue and try to do something about it withdrawal of sponsors several sponsors withdrew their support of 10 10 as a result of no pressure film nick sharples sony europe s director of communications issued a statement saying we strongly condemn no pressure video which was conceived produced and released by 10 10 entirely without knowledge or involvement of sony and cutting ties with 10 10 as a result we have taken decision to disassociate ourselves from 10 10 at this time and eaga were removed from list of 10 10 sponsors and national magazine company was removed from list of 10 10 media partners at same time a spokesman for o2 a partner of 10 10 refused to disassociate itself from group 10 10 is an independent organisation and we don t ask for editorial control over content of its campaigns 350 org with whom 10 10 had been collaborating on 10 october 2010 day of action broke all current and future relations with 10 10 in a press release they said we respect 10 10
