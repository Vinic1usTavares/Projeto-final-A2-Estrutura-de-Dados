temple a landowner and former high sheriff of wiltshire pair became friends and temple visited macpherson grant in aberlour later that year staying until spring of 1865 when she returned to her father s house in wiltshire some weeks after temple had left macpherson grant returned to london and pair renewed their friendship with macpherson grant becoming acquainted with temple s social circle macpherson grant went on to ask temple s parents to allow her to come to live with her at aberlour permanently her parents were reluctant at first to accept arrangement but were eventually persuaded by macpherson grant s offer to make temple her heir macpherson grant went immediately to her solicitors in london and drew up a new will directing that her estate should not go to episcopal church as her previous instructions had dictated but to her own children should she have had any should she die without issue macpherson grant left her estate to an elderly aunt named margaret gordon and failing her to temple she is reported to have then met temple waiting in a carriage outside solicitor s office and presented her with a pen saying do you know what i have been doing i have been making you my heir and here is pen i did it with keep it macpherson grant and temple returned to live in aberlour house spending their time in field sports and stock raising newspapers carried stories of their shooting expeditions and livestock entries at agricultural shows macpherson grant promoted and supported various charitable causes especially those involving church their life together was described as being much like a marriage macpherson grant placed a ring upon ring finger of temple s left hand and temple referred to herself as in letters to macpherson grant this lifestyle was unusual for time and was described as remarkable tomfoolery in local press newspapers of time also commented on her strong minded nature and described her as very masculine in appearance and manly in dress however scale of her wealth and of her charitable donations allowed her to be accepted into society macpherson grant drank heavily during late 1860s temple encouraged her to stop and tried to prevent her drinking causing public scandal she went through periods of abstinence only to relapse her father also tried to convince her to reduce her intake and she temporarily stopped drinking when he moved into aberlour house in 1870 but started again after he died in april 1871 after his death and as her aunt margaret gordon had died in 1866 macpherson grant thought it necessary to reorganise her affairs on 31 may 1872 she had her london solicitors prepare a new will leaving her estate to her own children again only if she had had any at time of her death if she had no children her estate was to go to temple and temple s heirs her scottish solicitors warned her that they were unconvinced that this english document would satisfy requirements of scots law macpherson grant distressed by prospect that her will might be contested instructed her various solicitors to communicate with each other and come to an arrangement that would put matter beyond question on 8 march 1873 gibson craig co produced another will leaving whole of her estate in trust with a provision that temple inherit it or be paid a legacy of ps20 000 in event that any children of macpherson grant should contest settlement macpherson grant also gave instructions that her inheritor should become bearer of name and arms of grant of aberlour philanthropy macpherson grant continued to fund various enterprises of episcopal church she provided organ for inverness cathedral built in 1866 by architect alexander ross and in 1874 convinced canon charles jupp to come to aberlour to act as her personal chaplain with promise to build an orphanage with a church and school orphanage was founded in 1875 under jupp s administration it initially operated out of a cottage until new buildings were completed alexander ross was engaged to design orphanage and its chapel later known as st margaret s church and work on these started in 1875 temple s marriage also around this time captain harry farr yeatman a retired commander of royal navy visited aberlour it is not clear exactly when he arrived but in august 1875 there was a report in london standard about his success in shooting on macpherson grant s land by following december he had become engaged to be married to charlotte temple macpherson grant s response to this betrothal was mixed at times she seemed positive and offered to host wedding at aberlour house but she also showed distress at prospect of temple leaving her on 11 december 1875 shortly after engagement was announced a fire broke out at aberlour house cause of which is unknown and from which macpherson grant had to be rescued she became increasingly confused sometimes believing she had rescued her servant from blaze while at other times thinking she had sustained a head injury on 8 february 1876 yeatman and temple were married at st peter s church eaton square in london shortly before marriage temple had written to simon keir a partner of macpherson grant s agents at milne co directing that his accounting of sales no longer be sent to macpherson grant directly but rather to macpherson grant s edinburgh solicitor mr falconer dissatisfied with this new arrangement and with what he saw as temple s interfering in his affairs keir drew up a deed of revocation that would cancel macpherson grant s existing wills in november 1876 he visited aberlour and macpherson grant signed deed thereby revoking any claim that temple now mrs yeatman had on her estate by this time with temple gone macpherson grant was depressed mentally unstable and drinking heavily she died on 14 april 1877 after suffering a partial paralysis her death occurred before completion of orphanage and church and two weeks prior to her forty third birthday she was interred in aberlour church yard in a burial aisle she had previously erected for her parents legacy since she had signed deed of revocation but had not written a new will macpherson grant died intestate her trustee mr falconer determined that cousins on her father s side of family proctors should inherit her estate a court case ensued at second division of court of session wherein yeatmans solicitor mr fraser argued that macpherson grant had been coerced by keir into signing deed of revocation because he was aware of her declining health and that estate should go to mrs yeatman as previously agreed he further argued that it was highly improbable that macpherson grant would have wanted it to go to proctors whom she had most probably never met especially since they were related on her father s side while fortune had originally been amassed by her uncle on her mother s side who had never thought well of her father after fraser made his initial statement counsels for both parties retired to discuss case in private following more than an hour of negotiation they returned to court and lord advocate presiding in case announced that they had agreed terms estate was to pass to proctors and yeatman was to receive a settlement of ps10 000 worth approximately ps in figures she was also entitled to receive a gold watch that she had gifted to macpherson grant and a diamond brooch that had belonged to her value of which was to be deducted from settlement press noted at time that closure of case denied public full revelation of a curious an interesting and instructive romance later events left thumb
