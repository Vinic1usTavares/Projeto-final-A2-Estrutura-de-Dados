killings but described three day event as an unfortunate tragedy inherent to war and not a deliberate killing army rejected survivors demands for an apology and compensation united states president bill clinton issued a statement of regret adding next day that things happened which were wrong south korean investigators disagreed with u s report saying they believed that 7th cavalry troops were ordered to fire on refugees survivors group called u s report a whitewash ap later discovered additional archival documents showing that u s commanders ordered troops to shoot and fire on civilians at war front during this period these declassified documents had been found but not disclosed by pentagon investigators among undisclosed documents was a letter from u s ambassador in south korea stating

events of 1950 raising awareness of allegations inside south korea in that same year u s armed forces claims service in korea dismissed one no gun ri petition by asserting that any killings took place during combat survivors committee retorted that there was no battle at no gun ri but u s officials refused to reconsider in 1997 survivors filed a claim with a south korean compensation committee under binational status of forces agreement this time u s claims service responded by again citing what it claimed was a combat situation and by asserting that there was no evidence 1st cavalry division was in no gun ri area as survivors research indicated and as 1961 official u s army history of war confirms on april 28 1998 seoul government committee made a final ruling against no gun ri

dong a daily seoul december 7 2000 in korean on january 11 2001 two governments issued their separate reports u s report after years of dismissing allegations army acknowledged in its report that u s military had killed an unknown number of south korean refugees at no gun ri with small arms fire artillery and mortar fire and strafing but it held that no orders were issued to fire on civilians and that shootings were result of hostile fire from among refugees or was firing meant to control them at another point it suggested that soldiers may have misunderstood eighth army s stop refugees order to mean they could be shot at same time it described deaths as an unfortunate tragedy inherent to war and not a deliberate killing army report dismissed testimony of soldiers who spoke of orders to shoot at no gun ri because it said none could remember wording originating officer s name or having received order directly himself report questioned an early unverified south korean government estimate of 248 killed missing and wounded at no gun ri citing an aerial reconnaissance photograph of area said to have been taken eight days after killings ended that it said showed no indication of human remains or mass graves four years after this 2001 report seoul government s inquest committee certified identities of a minimum 218 casualties south korean report in their report south korean investigators acknowledged that no documents showed specific orders at no gun ri to shoot refugees but they pointed to gaps in u s supplied documents dealing with 7th cavalry and u s air force operations missing documents included 7th cavalry s journal or communications log for july 1950 record that would have carried no gun ri orders it was missing without explanation from its place at national archives south korean report said five former air force pilots told u s interrogators that they were directed to strafe civilians during this period and 17 veterans of 7th cavalry testified that they believed there were orders to shoot no gun ri refugees koreans noted that two of veterans were battalion communications specialists levine and crume and as such were in an especially good position to know which orders had been relayed citing eighth army order of july 26 to stop refugees korean report concluded that 7th cavalry was likely to have used all possible means to stop approaching refugees said south korea s national security director oh young ho we believe there was an order to fire a joint u s korean statement of mutual understandings issued with reports did not repeat u s report s flat assertion that no orders to shoot were issued at no gun ri statement of mutual understandings between united states and republic of korea on no gun ri investigations january 2001 korean investigators cast doubt on u s report s suggestion of possible gunfire from among refugees surviving documents said nothing about infiltrators at no gun ri even though they would have been 7th cavalry s first enemy killed in action in korea no gun ri survivors denied it emphatically and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by u s team spoke of hostile fire and then inconsistently regarding aerial imagery that u s report said suggested a lower death toll south korean investigators drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents said at least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives or buried in soldiers abandoned foxholes in first days after killings and others remained inside one underpass tunnel under thin layers of dirt out of sight of airborne cameras and awaiting later burial in mass graves in addition south korean military specialists questioned u s reconnaissance photos pointing out irregularities including fact that no gun ri frames had been spliced into roll of film raising possibility they were not as claimed from august 6 1950 eight days after killings clinton statement u s offer on day u s report was issued then president bill

report a whitewash of command responsibility this is not enough for massacre of over 60 hours of 400 innocent people who were hunted like animals said committee head chung eun yong survivors rejected notion that killings were not deliberate pointing to accounts from veterans and to documents attesting to front line orders to shoot civilians lawmakers of both ruling and opposition party in south korea criticized u s position former u s congressman pete mccloskey of california only one of eight outside advisers to u s inquiry to write a detailed analysis afterward agreed with koreans saying i thought army report was a whitewash in a letter to defense secretary cohen another u s adviser retired marine general bernard e trainor expressed sympathy with hard pressed u s troops of 1950 but said

either did not address or presented incomplete versions of key declassified documents some previously reported in news media news reports pointed out that u s review in describing july 1950 air force

ri was deliberately omitted from army s 2001 investigative report on no gun ri full text after army issued its report it was learned that it also had not disclosed its researchers discovery of at least 14 additional declassified documents showing high ranking commanders ordering or authorizing shooting of refugees in korean war s early months such as communications from 1st cavalry division commander gay and a top division officer to consider refugees north of front line fair game and to shoot all refugees coming across river in addition interview transcripts obtained through freedom of information act requests showed that army had not reported repeated testimony from ex soldiers that as one put it word i heard was kill everybody from 6 to 60 during their early days in korea in 2005 american historian conway lanz reported his discovery of a declassified document at national archives in which united states ambassador to korea in 1950 john j muccio notified state department on day no gun ri killings began that u s military fearing infiltrators had adopted a policy of shooting south korean refugee groups that approached u s lines despite warning shots pressed by south korean government pentagon eventually acknowledged it deliberately omitted muccio letter from its 2001 report law of war and no gun ri in disclaiming u s culpability in january 2001 then president clinton told reporters evidence was not clear that there was responsibility for wrongdoing high enough in chain of command in army to say that in effect government was responsible american lawyers for no gun ri survivors rejected that rationale saying that whether 7th cavalry troops acted under formal orders or not massacre of civilian refugees mainly elderly women and children was in and of itself a clear violation of international law for which united states is liable under doctrine of command responsibility and must pay compensation writing to army inspector general s office in may 2001 lawyers also pointed out that numerous orders were issued at war front to shoot civilians and said u s military s self investigation allowing enforcement to be subject to unbridled discretion of alleged perpetrator was an ultimate violation of victims rights in its 2005 report south korean government s inquest panel committee for review and restoration of honor for no gun ri victims cited six south korean legal studies as saying that no gun ri constituted a crime against humanity in this regard no gun ri massacre overtly violates basic principles of law of war and customary international law legal scholar tae ung baik wrote in one study committee itself concluded united states of america should take responsibility for no gun ri incident american experts in military law agreed that 1950 events violated laws of war prohibiting targeting of noncombatants but said that prosecuting ex soldiers a half century later was a practical impossibility nevertheless army secretary caldera said early in investigation that he couldn t rule out prosecutions a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th cavalry veterans from testifying later developments continuing appeals although often supported by south korean politicians and newspaper editorials no gun ri survivors repeated demands for a reopened u s investigation and compensation went unheeded meeting with south korean officials in 2001 survivors asked that their government seek action at international court of justice at hague and in u n human rights forums but were rebuffed in 2002 a spokesman for south korea s then governing party called for a new u s inquiry but defense ministry later warned national assembly that a reopened probe might damage u s south korean relations thumb 300px left
