william adam 1689 24 june 1748 was a scottish architect mason and entrepreneur he was foremost architect of his time in scotland mcwilliam p et al 1999 p 48 designing and building numerous country houses and public buildings and often acting as contractor as well as architect among his best known works are hopetoun house near edinburgh and duff house in banff his individual exuberant style built on palladian style but with baroque details inspired by vanbrugh and continental architecture in 18th century adam was considered scotland s universal architect john clerk of eldin first used term universal architect to describe adam in his unpublished life of robert adam gifford 1990 p 1 however since early 20th century architectural critics have taken a more measured view colin mcwilliam for instance finding quality of his work varied to an extreme degree as well as being an architect adam was involved in several industrial ventures and improvement schemes including coal mining salt panning stone quarries and mills in 1731 he began to build up his own estate in kinross shire which he named blair adam he was father of three architects john robert and james last two were developers of adam style biography early life william adam was born in linktown of abbotshall now a neighbourhood of kirkcaldy fife and was baptised on 24 october 1689 he was only surviving child of john adam d c 1710 a mason and helen cranstoun daughter of william cranstoun 3rd lord cranstoun his paternal grandfather was archibald adam a laird in angus gifford 1989 pp 68 75 adam probably attended grammar school in kirkcaldy until 1704 when he turned 15 and thereafter learned craft of masonry possibly from his father it is often suggested that adam was apprenticed to sir william bruce at kinross house although dates make this unlikely john fleming suggests that if adam trained under bruce at all it must have been at hopetoun house which bruce was building from 1699 1703 kinross was under construction from 1686 fleming pp 6 7 by 1717 adam was a fully qualified member of kirkcaldy masons guild gifford 1989 p 72 and before 1720 he travelled to france and low countries visiting country houses and viewing canal at ostend in 1714 adam entered into a partnership with william robertson of gladney a local laird to set up a brickworks at linktown venture was successful and adam has been credited with introducing manufacture of dutch pantiles into scotland gifford 1989 pp 73 74 on 30 may 1716 adam married robertson s daughter mary and couple moved into his home gladney house at abbotshall gifford 1989 p 75 thumb east front of hopetoun house designed and built by william adam over a period of over 20 years rise to fame it is not known how william adam became a successful architect from these beginnings but by 1721 he was engaged on major projects at floors castle where he executed a design by vanbrugh and designing extensions to hopetoun house john gifford links adam s rise with retirement of james smith most prominent architect of early 18th century who was in his 70s by this time gifford 1989 pp 76 77 like smith adam was a trained mason had social connections through his family and had financial backing of successful business ventures it was in 1721 that adam became a freemason being initiated in lodge of edinburgh mary s chapel no 1 cooper robert l d ed 2010 famous scottish freemasons pp 4 6 however unlike episcopalians smith and bruce adam was a presbyterian whig in a time of whig domination of british government scottish episcopalians were associated with jacobitism and as such found little favour with ruling hanoverian regime sir william bruce for example was imprisoned on at least three occasions between 1693 and his death in 1710 merely on account of his principles fenwick p 73 78 adam s beliefs were much more acceptable although he did manage to maintain relations with exiled jacobite and amateur architect john erskine earl of mar glendinning mckechnie 2004 p 103 adam s political stance allowed him to acquire influential patrons such as john dalrymple 2nd earl of stair and sir john clerk of penicuik gifford 1989 pp 80 81 who besides being his clients attempted to secure government positions and contracts for him gifford 1989 p 106 for example sir john clerk unsuccessfully proposed adam for city architect under town of edinburgh bill which would have seen him overseeing new public works in capital fleming p 34 in 1727 stair tried again unsuccessfully to have adam appointed surveyor of king s works in scotland although following year he acquired lesser position of clerk and storekeeper of king s works in scotland under master of works sir john anstruther gifford 1989 p 107 in 1730 adam was appointed principal mason to board of ordnance in north britain thumb colen campbell s design for wanstead house in 1727 adam and sir john clerk travelled to london visiting a number of country seats along way including cliveden wilton and wanstead house friedman p 37 in london adam attempted to make further political contacts as well as seeking out an engraver for his projected book of architectural plans which would eventually become vitruvius scoticus also while in london he sat to william aikman for his portrait gifford 1989 p 108 architect entrepreneur and laird by 1728 adam was firmly established as a successful architect with numerous ongoing business concerns including coal mining salt panning quarrying and agricultural improvements although in that year occurred death of his partner and father in law william robertson gifford 1989 pp 109 110 for same year william adam and alexander mcgill are called architects in subscribers list to james gibbs s book of architecture on 21 february 1728 adam was made a burgess of edinburgh gifford 1989 p 110 and moved with his family to a property on cowgate where he later built a large tenement gifford 1989 p 176 his business activities continued to expand since commission for hopetoun in 1721 he had leased quarries near queensferry which provided stone for his building contracts gifford 1989 p 179 starting in 1734 he leased lofts granaries and warehouses in leith and leased coal mines and salt pans at and later at nearby pinkie he built a canal in 1742 44 to serve mines gifford 1989 pp 176 178 other engineering works included an aqueduct cut through a hill at and in 1741 an attempt to promote a forth and clyde canal a project eventually realised by others some 30 years later fleming p 52 his main concern from 1731 became blair estate in kinross shire near kelty which he purchased that year for ps8 010 scots renaming estate blair adam he set about expanding and improving it planting trees enclosing land and setting up coal mines he established village of to house miners and built a small house although he seldom visited for any length of time gifford 1989 pp 176 178 blair adam remains home of adam family today thumb realised designs for south front top and north front of house of dun angus later life in 1741 adam was forced to initiate legal proceedings against william lord braco to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at duff house there was no formal contract and client and architect disagreed on costs for carved stonework adam sued for ps5 796 12s 11 1 3 d and matter was initially resolved in his favour however braco was a stubborn opponent and dragged out proceedings which were not resolved until just before adam s death after jacobite rising of 1745 adam s position as mason to board of ordnance brought him a number of large military contracts in highlands in 1746 position of master carpenter to board of ordnance became vacant and adam was quick to put forward his son john s name for consideration although he was unsuccessful in securing him post gifford 1989 p 183 his three eldest sons were all involved in family business by 1746 james and john both leaving edinburgh university early to join their father william adam succumbed to illness in late 1747 dying following summer he was buried in greyfriars kirkyard edinburgh where john adam designed family mausoleum built in 1753 this was restored by edinburgh city council and historic scotland in 1997 to mark 250th anniversary of his death architectural works thumb hamilton old parish church designed by adam in 1735 adam used a wide variety of sources for his designs and created an inventive personal style of decoration his chief influences were from english palladianism and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in colen campbell s vitruvius britannicus but adam mixed these with english baroque motifs from gibbs and vanbrugh glendinning and mckechnie 2004 p 1989 passim he relied greatly on a range of french italian and english pattern books including gibbs book of architecture from which he borrowed freely with little regard for consistency of style in addition he took inspiration from earlier scottish renaissance architecture and from his predecessors bruce and smith mckean p 258 during his nearly 30 year career as an architect adam designed extended or remodelled over 40 country houses and undertook numerous public contracts colvin pp 56 59 he also laid out landscape garden schemes for instance at and taymouth castle country houses his first commission seems to have been for extensions to hopetoun house near edinburgh for charles hope 1st earl of hopetoun contract was signed on 17 january 1721 gifford p 76 hopetoun had been built only 20 years before by sir william bruce and adam was retained to rebuild south east wing these works completed in 1725 aimed to give east front a bold new facade stepping forward at ends with curved sections according to john fleming nothing so ambitious or imaginative had ever before been attempted in scotland fleming p 47 over following years adam would return to hopetoun building south colonnade from 1726 north wing from 1728 and finally pavilions from 1736 these were not finished until 1742 year of earl s death and completed scheme was finished by adam s sons after his own death gifford 1989 pp 88 124 127 adam also laid out gardens possibly to designs by bruce whose axial style they follow gifford 1989 p 89 thumb in dumfriesshire a small house designed by adam in 1729 for alexander fergusson other early designs included drum house which boasted scotland s first venetian window fleming p 49 and mavisbank both near edinburgh mavisbank house constructed between 1723 and 1727 was first palladian villa in scotland a collaboration between adam and owner amateur architect sir john clerk of penicuik latter claimed much of credit and certainly criticised some of adam s suggestions although evidence suggests adam got his way on a number of points gifford 1989 pp 90 94 as at hopetoun here adam enjoyed an unusually close relationship with his client despite their differences of opinion fleming p 44 his most ambitious early work was baroque vanbrugh inspired house at arniston near gorebridge built for robert dundas a lawyer and politician linked to earl of stair arniston includes extensive grounds laid out by adam with a parterre and cascade and a main avenue centred on arthur s seat to north stucco work to hall at arniston is one of adam s finest interiors fleming p 51 thumb duff house a medieval castle in baroque dress duff house adam s major work of 1730s demonstrates his accretion of local and foreign influences presenting itself as a medieval castle in baroque dress dunbar p 106 built between 1735 and 1739 adam acted as contractor and architect to william lord braco james gibbs had recently built another house for lord braco but he declined commission for duff recommending adam for job main facade of duff house is remarkable for its height and with tall corner towers impression is of a highly vertical house this style is related to designs produced by exiled jacobite earl of mar an amateur architect who collaborated with adam at house of dun charles mckean compares duff to 17th century drumlanrig castle and places it within scottish architectural tradition like drumlanrig and heriot s hospital 1620s 1690s in edinburgh before it duff house has a double pile block flanked by taller square corner towers baroque dress at duff derives from vanbrugh and particularly park 1724 38 in dorset designs for pavilions and quadrant wings were never executed due to lord braco s dispute with adam braco never occupied or fitted out house for same reason thumb chatelherault duke of hamilton s hunting lodge 1731 43 adam s other houses of 1730s include house of dun in angus in dumfriesshire lawyers house in perthshire and haddo house in aberdeenshire his early unexecuted design for house of dun a collaboration with earl of mar is interesting as it appears to show a traditional tall scottish tower house complete with spiral stairs within walls but externally clad in neo classical detailing adam clearly took some inspiration from scottish vernacular fleming p 35 chatelherault duke of hamilton s dogg kennel and hunting lodge near hamilton was completed in 1743 his redecoration of duke s apartment in holyroodhouse was adam s most important interior design commission fleming p 59 in 1730s adam extended taymouth castle and laid out gardens although his work was largely demolished to make way for present building in 19th century adam s approach here mirrored work of bruce at balcaskie extending a scottish tower house to form a near symmetrical architectural composition after 1740 adam built only two houses cumbernauld house for earl of and cally house for alexander murray which was not complete until 1763 fleming p 56 from 1746 adam was acting as intendant general and contractor overseeing building of inveraray castle to a gothic design by roger morris his role was to correspond with architect on behalf of client archibald campbell 3rd duke of argyll and adam also offered morris his own advice on detail design fleming p 65 he also provided an early draft for layout of new town at inveraray walker pp 305 313 his last architectural work was for lord lovat in 1744 for a new house at castle stone was supplied but construction never started as lord lovat was out in jacobite rising of 1745 and his property was sacked by government troops fleming pp 63 64 public buildings thumb william adam s tay bridge at adam s first public building commissions were in aberdeen where he built town house or town hall from 1729 30 since demolished and robert gordon s hospital from 1730 32 now an independent school original edinburgh royal infirmary on infirmary street was an imposing building designed by adam in 1738 although based on a standard ordnance board barrack block fleming p 62 one of first infirmaries in world it was founded by physician alexander monro and was demolished in 1884 remnants of building can be found on various sites in city also in edinburgh adam built george watson s hospital from 1738 41 demolished 2004 which in 19th century was incorporated by david bryce as part of new royal infirmary in 1745 work was completed on william adam s new library for university of glasgow also since demolished adam s town house for dundee has also been demolished that of haddington remains but is much altered adam built only one church hamilton old parish church in 1733 while working on nearby chatelherault last jacobite rising occurred in 1745 when bonnie prince charlie attempted to seize british throne aided by rebellious scottish highlanders in aftermath of this unsuccessful coup highlands were extensively militarised by government and adam s ordnance board work consequently multiplied he and his sons carried out works at fort augustus fort william carlisle and castles of dumbarton stirling edinburgh blackness and fleming p 64 he was engaged in 1747 to provide mason work and brickwork for fort george near inverness although project only began shortly before adam s death gifford 1992 p 174 every summer until 1760 one of his sons spent summer at fort george supervising works under colonel skinner chief engineer for north britain thumb robert gordon s hospital aberdeen now robert gordon s college vitruvius scoticus in 1720s adam planned to publish a book of architectural drawings of scottish houses including his own work and that of others his vitruvius scoticus was started and named in response to colen campbell s vitruvius britannicus he commissioned some engravings during his 1727 trip to london and had begun to collect subscriptions further engraving were completed in edinburgh in 1730s by richard cooper project then stalled possibly due to lack of subscriptions only 150 were collected compared to over 700 for vitruvius britannicus although it may have been revived around time of adam s death in 1766 john adam attempted to restart project and collect fresh subscriptions although nothing came of this book was finally published in 1812 by john s son william and contained 160 plates including 100 of adam s own designs legacy william adam s dominant position in scottish architecture is reinforced by his lack of contemporaries colin mcwilliam in buildings of scotland lothian wondered whether scottish architecture at this period would have achieved very much without him adam s death coincided with final defeat of jacobite threat in 1746 and advance of scottish enlightenment which resulted in new styles of building becoming popular development of neoclassicism in late 18th century was paralleled by a revival of castle form of house which would lead to scottish baronial style glendinning mckechnie 2004 p 97 neither idiom however owed much to work of william adam as a practical man rather than a theorist adam never developed a strong enough style to exert a direct influence on course of building design his main bequest to architectural history were his three architect sons and in particular robert adam whose success as developer of adam style far outran that of his father although robert formed his own style through lengthy study in rome john fleming detects traces of his father s influence on all three of brothers work and suggests that adam principle of movement in architecture was partly inspired by william s admiration for vanbrugh more concretely fleming notes that working with their father gave brothers a solid grounding in technical aspects of architecture and introduced them to a set of clients which they might never otherwise have had access to fleming pp 74 75 critical appreciation although his contemporaries acclaimed adam s genius for architecture william adam s obituary in caledonian mercury cited in gifford 1990 p 1 recent architectural historians have found his work of more variable quality in 18th and 19th centuries he was accepted as scotland s universal architect and at end of 19th century macgibbon and ross suggested in castellated and domestic architecture of scotland that william was at least equal in talent of his son robert cited in gifford 1990 p 2 in 20th century a more critical view of adam s work was taken for example ian hannah in story of scotland in stone 1934 found adam to be a rather ordinary classical architect hannah p 306 arthur t bolton in introduction to his definitive work on robert and james adam 1922 dismissed father s work as heavy and ordinary and a mere compilation of ideas from vanbrugh and gibbs to kent cited in gifford 1990 p 3 john fleming lamented his ad hoc improvisation from source books improperly digested cited in gifford 1990 p 4 and decided that he cannot be allowed great distinction as an architect fleming p 73 john summerson disregards adam s work in architecture in britain 1530 1830 1953 as it does not fit into english palladian orthodoxy although john dunbar suggests that he could express himself convincingly enough in that idiom dunbar p 104 for instance at haddo house dunbar found adam s work as remarkable for its eclecticism as for its unevenness of quality and he went on to stress william adam s robustness and directness and found these appropriate to artistic climate of north britain gifford also stresses adam s scottish context pointing out that scotland was in many ways a foreign country during his working life and indeed was a separate country to england until 1707 adam should he argues be seen not as a provincial british architect but as architect of scotland gifford 1989 p 9 john fleming and colin mcwilliam are in agreement that adam was at his best as a collaborator fleming s comment that adam was at his best when guided by a man of taste who knew his own mind fleming p 72 is echoed by mcwilliam who suggests that william adam always did his best but did his best architecture when he was in touch not only with his source books but with other lively minds family william adam and mary robertson had ten surviving children janet jenny b 1717 born at linktown later managed their brothers london business john b 3 july 1721 born at linktown took over blair adam and other family businesses as well as practising architecture robert b 3 july 1728 born at linktown architect and best known of adam brothers james b 21 july 1732 architect business partner of robert william willie b

moderator of general assembly of church of scotland 1773 and 1784 though now chiefly remembered for his friendship with economist adam smith susannah married sir john clerk of eldin son of sir john clerk of penicuik birth dates of their five younger daughters are not recorded in addition another son named william and two daughters died in infancy after william adam s death his oldest son john inherited family business and immediately took his brothers robert and james into partnership which would last until late 1750s when robert established himself in london william adam s obituary in caledonian mercury noted that it is fortunate he has left behind him some promising young men to carry on what he has so happily begun cited in fleming p 66 john adam passed blair adam on to his own
