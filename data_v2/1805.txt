between stations square raised random battle encounter rate relative to its other role playing games ensuring players would have at least one enemy encounter during short playtime to maintain an interesting experience final fantasy legend was designed to be difficult and feature advanced gameplay described by kawazu as main difference between saga and final fantasy series square implemented several other ideas to distance games notably meat system to allow players to collect enemy abilities though these proved difficult to portray at first kawazu took a direct hand in shaping game s scenario development working alongside ishii takashi tokita and hiroyuki ito who were involved in other square projects at time ishii and ito developed game s world layout and geography as well ryoko
