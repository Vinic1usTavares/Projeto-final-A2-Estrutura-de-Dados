columbia plot fbi agents dana scully and fox mulder travel to browning montana to investigate killing of a native american man joseph goodensnake by local rancher jim parker killing appears to be motivated by a dispute over ownership of a tract of land although parker claims that he fired on a monstrous animal rather than a human parker s son lyle bears scars that lend credence to story at scene of shooting scully reasons that at short range from which goodensnake was shot it would have been impossible to mistake him for an animal however mulder finds tracks leading to area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature scully dismisses this but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby she believes that parkers knowingly killed goodensnake but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on body investigation is complicated by hostility mulder and scully face from native american population stemming from their experience with fbi during 1973 wounded knee incident goodensnake s sister gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death local sheriff charles tskany permits scully to make a cursory examination of goodensnake s body but forbids a full autopsy they discover that he had elongated canines similar to those of an animal and bears long healed scars similar to lyle s mulder tells scully of a similar incident in area forty years previously which was investigated by j edgar hoover and became fbi s first x file case as agents watch goodensnake s body being cremated in a traditional ceremony mulder shares with scully his belief that culprits in both current case and hoover s investigation are werewolves scully dismisses this theory and instead credits belief to clinical lycanthropy jim parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home and lyle is found naked and unconscious a few hundred yards away ish one of elder men of reservation explains to mulder legend of manitou a creature which can possess and transform a man and can pass to a new host through a bite or upon death of original host ish believes he had seen creature in his youth but was too frightened to confront it he says it happens every eight years to someone in region and that it has been that long since last sighting of a possible manitou mulder calls medical examiner who tells him that scully has taken lyle back to ranch and jim s blood type was found in lyle s stomach mulder and tskany hurry to parker ranch after firing on creature which escapes unharmed mulder finds scully hiding upstairs they search for creature which is shot by tskany as it lunges to attack them scully expresses disbelief on seeing lyle s body believing they
