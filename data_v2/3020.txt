being together was a very rare case i ve had over years ciara enjoyed her time with timberlake and valued opportunity to work with him as an artist and producer she also noted how passionate timberlake was about his work and mentioned his and positive attitude composition with love sex magic ciara moved in a more pop direction than her past music jordan sargent of popmatters noted that while a pop fan might see singer back in her mind creatively a ciara fan would see song as signal ing end of singer s career as it once was sargent stated that song sounds nothing like chrome plated crunk b nor moonlit balladry that ciara has staked her name on musically song is a dance pop r b number which makes use of electro and funk music as well as displaying disco and soul influences song has a minimalistic dance beat with a funky retro 70s style r b guitar as backdrop lauren carter of boston herald said that song is influenced by timberlake s disco funk work on futuresex lovesounds stating that it sounds like a reworked version of his bass heavy dance number sexy ladies carter commented that timberlake was ushering ciara away from her typically crunk laced stylings in favor of jt s electro slide ann powers of los angeles times said that song was madonna esque both ciara and timberlake provide verses accompanied by vocal whims and falsetto critical reception thumb left 205px

lovesounds calling song one of biggest anthems of year gennoe went on to call song highlight and saving grace of fantasy ride nick levine of digital spy said that track itself is nearly as sexy as promo clip commenting ciara purrs and timberlake if you ll pardon pun more than rises to occasion all in all love sex magic is pretty much spot on lauren carter of boston herald said it s not quite magic but it grows on you jeremy medina of entertainment weekly said hooking up with timberlake essentially guarantees a one way ticket back to chart supremacy so nice work there ciara medina went on

still curiously anonymous he noted that timberlake not a vocal powerhouse himself out sings ciara on track tom breihan of pitchfork media said that song was not bad and complimented song s disco feel he said that it gained ciara a radio foothold that had been hers to lose a couple of years ago and commented that it seemed like a bargain basement justin timberlake track sort of thing he could ve had lying around in a closet somewhere nearly three years after futuresex lovesounds breihan pointed out that timberlake s nerdy swagger really highlights ciara s total lack of presence jordan sargent of popmatters criticized song for being generic calling it a formulaic futuresex lovesounds disco retread commenting song probably could ve been given to any struggling female singer and become a hit

dance moves on a stage timberlake performs his verse seated onstage while ciara performs intricate tricks such as snaking under his legs then two begin to lightly move to track before ciara forms her body as an as he leans on her ciara and dancers perform choreography and cabaret style moves on pole bridge of song puts timberlake on ground and ciara standing over him turns and performs her
