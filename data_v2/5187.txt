life birth thumb left chateau d angouleme c 1800s edward was born at chateau d angouleme in angouleme then part of duchy of aquitaine his name edward of angouleme is a territorial designation referring to his birthplace this was a common naming practice in 14th century england through his father edward black prince he was a member of house of plantagenet and second but eldest surviving grandson of reigning english monarch edward iii edward was related to reigning french royal house of valois through his paternal grandmother philippa of hainault his mother joan was his father s first cousin once removed and was suo jure countess of kent edward s date of birth has been a matter of debate in dictionary of national biography article for his father edward s birth year is given as 1363 1364 or 1365 based on three contemporary chronicles including that of jean froissart a letter sent by joan of kent to edward iii on 4 february 1365 announces edward s birth on 27 january therefore this is date of birth most used news of edward s birth was so acceptable to his royal grandfather that king conferred upon messenger john delves an annuity of forty pounds per annum for life edward was baptized at chateau d angouleme in march 1365 black prince enjoyed luxury and edward s baptism was meant to show natives of aquitaine that they had a sovereign in black prince present were 154 lords and 706 knights and supposedly 18000 horses over ps400 were spent on candles alone edward s baptism was also celebrated with splendid tournaments one of his godparents was bishop jean de crois name black prince chose for his eldest son had been borne by three english kings and had already become a popular name with political implications by time edward and his brother richard b 1367 were born in yorkist times these were most popular names death thumb alt right wilton diptych after prolonged suffering edward died of bubonic plague although exact time of his death is not known date of january 1371 is commonly used wigmore chronicle of 1370 states that edward died around feast of saint michael 29 september this is probably correct date black prince found out about edward s death after he returned from siege of limoges he was very grieved in his heart but none can escape death edward s loss was a bitter grief to black prince and joan of kent and only increased severity of black prince s illness edward had already won a reputation for a christ like character and in his infancy historians have been willing to see seeds of those high qualities which distinguished his father and his grandfather which were denied to his brother richard ii black prince returned to england with joan and richard in 1371 and died there in 1376 of a wasting disease that had been ravaging his body for many years before black prince and his family left for england he left his brother john of gaunt in charge of arranging edward s funeral which took place in bordeaux and was attended by all of barons of gascony and poitou edward s body was exhumed in 1388 9 and transported back to england by robert bishop of aire who was acting under richard ii s orders it was at this time that edward was buried at langley also known as children s langley a priory on estate of kings langley between 1540 and 1607 church at kings langley was ruined and edward had already been re buried at church of austin friars by 1598 while richard could not have remembered edward well he still recalled his brother with pious affection thus edward is possibly featured on wilton diptych a small diptych which depicts richard kneeling before virgin possibly represented by joan of kent and child possibly represented by edward diptych is held at national gallery of london legacy thumb left a coin from reign of richard ii edward s early demise caused great pain to both richard and his parents historian alison weir states that from time black prince returned to england after edward s death he was a broken man edward s death also had a substantial impact on english history even during edward s lifetime fears that john of gaunt would claim throne existed parliament passed act of 1368 which permitted children born in english domains in france to inherit kingdom of england perhaps fearing that act of 1351 which established edward and richard s citizenship as english would not be enough to ensure their succession after edward iii s death and richard s ascension a regency led by john of gaunt was avoided nonetheless gaunt maintained his influential position in years that followed and acted as de facto regent until january 1380 although richard was only ten years old when he began his reign towards end of 1390s he began what historians consider to be a period of tyranny by time of edward s death england was in midst of fighting during hundred years war which had been started by edward iii richard made efforts to end war but was unsuccessful due to opposition from his magnates and french refusing to formally acknowledge their territorial losses by transferring land to english in 1399 richard was imprisoned in tower of london and abdicated in favour of his cousin earl of derby with richard s death on 14 february 1400 direct line of house of plantagenet was brought to an end ancestry endnotes footnotes bibliography category 1365 births category 1370
