channing though much of work was censored or reworded it left out details about her love affair with ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named james nathan blanchard 339 three editors believing public interest in fuller would be short lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure were not concerned about accuracy von mehren 342 for a time it was best selling biography of decade and went through thirteen editions before end of century book focused on her personality rather than her work detractors of book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her arrogance blanchard 340 beliefs fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women brooks 245 once equal educational rights were afforded women she believed women could push for equal political rights as well blanchard 132 she advocated that women seek any employment they wish rather than catering to stereotypical feminine roles of time such as teaching she once said if you ask me what office women should fill i reply any let them be sea captains if you will i do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office slater 4 she had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her 174 and disliked popular female poets of her time dickenson 172 fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands as she wrote i wish woman to live first for god s sake then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty by 1832 she had made a personal commitment to stay single blanchard 135 fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female there is no wholly masculine man no purely feminine but that both were present in any individual she suggested also that within a female were two parts intellectual side which she called minerva and lyrical or side muse von mehren 168 she admired work of emanuel swedenborg who believed men and women shared an angelic ministry as she wrote as well as charles fourier who placed woman on an entire equality with man unlike several contemporary women writers including mrs sigourney and mrs stowe she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as margaret douglas 261 fuller also advocated reform at all levels of society including prison in october 1844 she visited sing sing and interviewed women prisoners even staying overnight in facility gura 229 sing sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates many of whom were prostitutes blanchard 211 fuller was also concerned about homeless and those living in dire poverty especially in new york gura 230 she also admitted that though she was raised to believe that indian obstinately refused to be civilized her travels in american west made her realize that white man unfairly treated native americans she considered native americans an important part of american heritage blanchard 204 205 she also supported rights of african americans referring to this cancer of slavery deiss 93 and suggested that those who were interested in abolition movement follow same reasoning when considering rights of women as friend of negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage so should friend of woman assume that man cannot by right lay even well meant restrictions on woman slater 91 she suggested that those who spoke against emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support emancipation of italy deiss 94 fuller agreed with transcendental concern for psychological well being of individual von mehren 231 though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist von mehren 84 even so she wrote if being labeled a transcendentalist means that i have an active mind frequently busy with large topics i hope it is so rose anne c transcendentalism as a social movement 1830 1850 new haven ct yale university press 1981 181 she criticized people such as emerson however for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform slater 97 98 like other members of so called transcendental club she rebelled against past and believed in possibility of change however unlike others in movement her rebellion was not based on religion blanchard 125 126 though fuller occasionally attended unitarian congregations she did not entirely identify with that religion as biographer charles

upright title page of woman in nineteenth century 1845 margaret fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and in particular for being overly self confident and having a bad temper

to starry night a life of walt whitman chicago ivan r dee 1992 111 elizabeth barrett browning was also a strong admirer but believed that fuller s unconventional views were unappreciated in united states and therefore she was better off dead douglas 259 she also said that fuller s history of roman republic would have been her greatest work work she was preparing upon italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen her other writings being curiously inferior to impressions her conversation gave you dickenson 44 an 1860 essay collection historical pictures retouched by caroline healey dall called fuller s woman in nineteenth century doubtless most brilliant complete and scholarly statement ever made on subject gura 284 285 despite his personal issues with fuller typically harsh literary critic edgar allan poe wrote of work as a book which few women in country could have written and no woman in country would have published with exception of miss fuller noting its independence and unmitigated radicalism thoreau also thought highly of book suggesting that its strength came in part from fuller s conversational ability as he called it it was rich extempore writing talking with pen in hand dickenson 41 another admirer of fuller was susan b anthony a pioneer of women s rights who wrote that fuller possessed more influence on thought of american women than any woman previous to her time von mehren 2 fuller s work may have partially inspired seneca falls convention in 1848 dickenson 113 anthony along with elizabeth cady stanton and matilda joslyn gage wrote in their history of woman suffrage that fuller was precursor of women s rights agitation stanton elizabeth cady anthony susan b and gage matilda joslyn history of

rights of woman 1792 slater 89 90 though an early comparison between two women came from george eliot in 1855 dickenson 45 46 it is unclear if fuller was familiar with wollstonecraft s works in her childhood her father prevented her from reading them dickenson 133 in 1995 fuller was inducted into national women s hall of fame margaret fuller national women s hall of fame accessed july 23 2008

than an activist that she had shallow conceits and often looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely and despised those who like myself could not adopt her scale of valuation dickenson 47 48 influential editor rufus wilmot griswold who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty referred to woman in nineteenth century as an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female bayless joy rufus wilmot griswold poe s literary executor nashville vanderbilt university press 1943 121 new york writer charles frederick briggs said that she was wasting time of her readers especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not truly represent female character von mehren 196 english writer and critic matthew arnold scoffed

and posterity will not remember him duberman martin james russell lowell boston houghton mifflin company 1966 99 in response lowell took revenge in his satirical a fable for critics first published in october 1848 at first he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called most wholly negative characterization in work von mehren 294 referring to her as miranda lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own she was genuine only in her spite and when acting as censor she privately blows a of vanity neath her own nose duberman martin james russell lowell boston houghton mifflin company 1966 100 shortly after fuller s death her importance faded her obituary in newspaper she had once edited daily tribune said that her works had a few great sentiments but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance dickenson 40 as biographer abby slater wrote margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in company she kept slater 3 years later hawthorne s son julian wrote majority of readers will i
