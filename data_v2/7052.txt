tropical storm ana was first named storm of 2009 atlantic hurricane season and first tropical cyclone to impact caribbean islands during 2009 forming out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on august 11 ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on august 12 before weakening back to a depression following day system degenerated into a non convective remnant low as it tracked westward on august 14 depression regenerated roughly 1 075 mi 1 735 km east of leeward islands early on august 15 storm re attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and a barometric pressure of 1003 mbar hpa 29 65 inhg storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and unusually fast movement of ana in post storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on august 16 before reaching any landmasses numerous tropical storm watches were issued for lesser antilles puerto rico dominican republic between august 15 and 17 several islands took minor precautions for storm including st croix which evacuated 40 residents from flood prone areas ahead of storm in dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall in puerto rico up to of rain was reported causing street flooding and forcing evacuation of three schools meteorological history on august 9 national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave associated with a small area of convective activity between cape verde islands and western coast of africa system eventually spawned an area of low pressure as it tracked towards west after slowly organising for a few days nhc reported early on august 11 that system had developed into a tropical depression system at this time was located about 280 mi 455 km west of cape verde islands depression developed deep convection around center of circulation and continued to track generally towards west in response to a mid level subtropical ridge to north depression was expected to gradually intensify as it moved over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and into an area of low wind shear however it was anticipated that dry air would hamper depressions chances of intensifying further by august 12 nhc reported that tropical depression two was near tropical storm intensity after a burst of deep convection over center at this point system was not upgraded to a tropical storm however in a post storm analysis it was determined that system had attained tropical storm force winds peaking at 40 mph 65 km h for 12 hours on august 12 several hours later system became disorganized due to increased wind shear by afternoon of august 13 system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter degenerated into a non convective remnant low pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around center for 24 hours at this time nhc issued their final advisory on system but noted that there was possibility of regeneration thumb right remnants of ana near puerto rico on august 17 alt a disorganized mass of thunderstorms over puerto rico and dominican republic image depicts most of eastern caribbean and surrounding landmasses on august 14 roughly 24 hours after degenerating into a remnant low convection began to redevelop over system later that day a hurricane hunter reconnaissance plane deployed into system they found that system was regenerating and shortly after nhc began re issuing advisories on depression when it was located roughly 1 075 mi 1 735 km east of leeward islands depression continued to track westward in response to an upper level high over north atlantic early on august 15 nhc upgraded depression to a tropical storm giving it name ana as deep convection developed around center of circulation later that day wind shear caused convection to become displaced from circulation exposing center of ana again by august 16 forward motion of ana began to increase and storm quickly entered a region of dry stable air by afternoon a hurricane hunter reconnaissance mission did not find any evidence of tropical storm force winds resulting in ana being downgraded to a tropical depression it was determined in post storm analysis that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards and was no longer a tropical cyclone several hours later system redeveloped convection as it raced towards west northwest at 26 mph 42 km h early on august 17 radar imagery from guadeloupe and san juan puerto rico depicted a system without a closed low level circulation despite this nhc continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery later that day a final reconnaissance plane flew into storm and did not find a low level circulation following this nhc stated that ana had dissipated off coast of puerto rico despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave previous day remnants of ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration but land interaction with hispaniola and cuba destroyed any chance of redevelopment preparations and impact thumb left forecast track for ana on august 16 and tropical storm watches at 19th advisory alt colored map of a tropical storm s projected future track black dots connected by a black line indicate its estimated position at 12 hour intervals in beginning and 24 hour towards end of track path starts in eastern caribbean and ends in central gulf of mexico on august 15 a tropical storm watch was issued for much of leeward islands two days later watch was expanded to include puerto rico and areas in eastern dominican republic between cabo engano and cabo beata as ana weakened and dissipated watches were discontinued thumb right map of rainfall from ana in puerto rico alt map of rainfall in puerto rico only eastern and western edges of island have rainfall denoted by areas colored in tan in san maarten cruise agencies redirected ships to avoid storm and secured vessels docked at port several ships were moved to simpson bay lagoon where waves are generally small in st kitts officials evacuated 40 families in flood prone areas to shelters ahead of storm on august 17 national weather service in san juan puerto rico issued an urban and small stream flood advisory for all of eastern municipalities on island flights in area were delayed by several hours to avoid depression in dominican republic officials posted flood alerts for 12 provinces as remnants of ana were forecast to produce up to of rain in country general luna paulino of civil army activated relief agencies ahead of storm and notified residents of possible mandatory evacuations officials inspected dams threatened by storm to protect several towns and villages emergency officials stated that roughly 35 000 personnel were on standby in case of a disaster shelters were also prepped throughout country however these were not opened and residents who had voluntarily evacuated had returned home by afternoon of august 17 in nearby haiti officials placed country under yellow alert as remnants of ana could produce heavy rainfall over mountainous areas in st thomas sustained winds reached 28 mph 45 km h and gusts peaked at 40 mph 65 km h in puerto rico rainfall was limited due to storms fast motion triggering minor flooding but little damage a maximum of of rain fell in rio grande rains caused rio fajardo to rise resulting in issuance of an alert as officials warned it could overflow its banks several streets were temporarily shut down due to flooding including one tunnel and three schools had to be evacuated throughout island roughly 6 000 people were left without power as numerous branches were snapped off trees and knocked down power lines there were also reports of waterspouts and tornadoes associated with ana in puerto rico winds on island gusted up to 42 mph 67 km h remnants of ana produced widespread rainfall across hispaniola however there were no reports of damage from system see also other storms of same
