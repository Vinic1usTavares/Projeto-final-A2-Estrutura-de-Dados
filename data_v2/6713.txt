dyslexia also known as reading disorder is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence different people are affected to varying degrees problems may include difficulties in spelling words reading quickly writing words sounding out words in head pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads often these difficulties are first noticed at school when someone who previously could read loses their ability it is known as alexia difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn people with dyslexia have higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd developmental language disorders and difficulties with numbers dyslexia is believed to be caused by interaction of genetic and environmental factors some cases run in families dyslexia that develops due to a traumatic brain injury stroke or dementia is called acquired dyslexia underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within brain s language processing dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory vision spelling and reading skills dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching or opportunity to learn treatment involves adjusting teaching methods to meet person s needs while not curing underlying problem it may decrease degree or impact of symptoms treatments targeting vision are not effective dyslexia is most common learning disability and occurs in all areas of world it affects 3 7 of population however up to 20 of general population may have some degree of symptoms while dyslexia is more often diagnosed in men it has been suggested that it affects men and women equally some believe that dyslexia should be best considered as a different way of learning with both benefits and downsides classification dyslexia is divided into developmental and acquired forms this article is primarily about developmental dyslexia i e dyslexia that begins in early childhood oxford english dictionary 3rd ed dyslexia n oxford uk oxford university press 2012 a learning disability specifically affecting attainment of literacy with difficulty esp in word recognition spelling and conversion of letters to sounds occurring in a child with otherwise normal development and now usually regarded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with a genetic component acquired dyslexia occurs subsequent to neurological insult such as traumatic brain injury or stroke people with acquired dyslexia exhibit some of signs or symptoms of developmental disorder but requiring different assessment strategies and treatment approaches signs and symptoms in early childhood symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include delayed onset of speech and a lack of phonological awareness a common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards these behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia school age children with dyslexia may exhibit signs of difficulty in identifying or generating rhyming words or counting number of syllables in words both of which depend on phonological awareness they may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds or may blend sounds when producing words indicating reduced phonemic awareness difficulties with word retrieval or naming things is also associated with dyslexia people with dyslexia are commonly poor a feature sometimes called or dysgraphia which depends on orthographic coding problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may include difficulties with summarizing stories memorization reading aloud or learning foreign languages adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in spelling tests or when reading nonsense words a measure of phonological awareness associated conditions dyslexia often co occurs with other learning disorders but reasons for this comorbidity have not been clearly identified these associated disabilities include dysgraphia a disorder involving difficulties with writing or typing sometimes due to problems with eye hand coordination it also can impede direction or sequence oriented processes such as tying knots or carrying out repetitive tasks in dyslexia dysgraphia is often multifactorial due to impaired letter writing automaticity organizational and difficulties and impaired visual word forming which makes it more difficult to retrieve visual picture of words required for spelling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd a disorder characterized by problems sustaining attention hyperactivity or acting impulsively dyslexia and adhd commonly occur together approximately 15 or 12 24 of people with dyslexia have adhd and up to 35 of people with adhd have dyslexia auditory processing disorder a listening disorder that affects ability to process auditory information this can lead to problems with auditory memory and auditory sequencing many people with dyslexia have auditory processing problems and may develop their own logographic cues to compensate for this type of deficit some research suggests that auditory processing skills could be primary shortfall in dyslexia developmental coordination disorder a neurological condition characterized by difficulty in carrying out routine tasks involving balance fine motor control coordination difficulty in use of speech sounds problems with short term memory and organization causes thumb 300px inferior parietal lobule superior view animation researchers have been trying to find neurobiological basis of dyslexia since condition was first identified in 1881 for example some have tried to associate common problem among people with dyslexia of not being able to see letters clearly to abnormal development of their visual nerve cells neuroanatomy neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and positron emission tomography pet have shown a correlation between both functional and structural differences in brains of children with reading difficulties some people with dyslexia show less electrical activation in parts of left hemisphere of brain involved with reading such as inferior frontal gyrus inferior parietal lobule and middle and ventral temporal cortex over past decade brain activation studies using pet to study language have produced a breakthrough in understanding of neural basis of language neural bases for visual lexicon and for auditory verbal short term memory components have been proposed with some implication that observed neural manifestation of developmental dyslexia is task specific i e functional rather than structural of people with dyslexia indicate an interactive role of cerebellum and cerebral cortex as well as other brain structures in reading cerebellar theory of dyslexia proposes that impairment of cerebellum controlled muscle movement affects formation of words by tongue and facial muscles resulting in fluency problems that some people with dyslexia experience cerebellum is also involved in automatization of some tasks such as reading fact that some children with dyslexia have motor task and balance impairments could be consistent with a cerebellar role in their reading difficulties however cerebellar theory has not been supported by controlled research studies genetics research into potential genetic causes of dyslexia has its roots in post autopsy examination of brains of people with dyslexia observed anatomical differences in language centers of such brains include microscopic cortical malformations known as and more rarely vascular micro malformations and a smaller than usual size for gyrus previously cited studies and others suggest that abnormal cortical development presumed to occur before or during sixth month of fetal brain development may have caused abnormalities abnormal cell formations in people with dyslexia have also been reported in non language cerebral and subcortical brain structures several genes have been associated with dyslexia including and on chromosome 6 and on chromosome 15 gene environment interaction contribution of gene environment interaction to reading disability has been intensely studied using twin studies which estimate proportion of variance associated with a person s environment and proportion associated with their genes both environmental and genetic factors appear to contribute to reading development studies examining influence of environmental factors such as parental education and teaching quality have determined that genetics have greater influence in supportive rather than less optimal environments however more optimal conditions may just allow those genetic risk factors to account for more of variance in outcome because environmental risk factors have been minimized as environment plays a large role in learning and memory it is likely that epigenetic modifications play an important role in reading ability measures of gene expression histone modifications and methylation in human periphery are used to study epigenetic processes however all of these have limitations in extrapolation of results for application to human brain language orthographic complexity of a language directly affects how difficult it is to learn to read it brunswick nicola and federica 2010 cross cultural differences in unimpaired and dyslexic reading behavioral and functional anatomical observations in readers of regular and irregular orthographies chapter 12 in reading and dyslexia in different orthographies eds nicola brunswick sine mcdougall and paul de mornay davies psychology press english and french have comparatively deep phonemic orthographies within latin alphabet writing system with complex structures employing spelling patterns on several levels letter sound correspondence syllables and morphemes languages such as spanish italian and finnish have mostly alphabetic orthographies which primarily employ letter sound correspondence so called shallow orthographies which makes them easier to learn for people with dyslexia logographic writing systems such as chinese characters have extensive symbol use and these also pose problems for dyslexic learners pathophysiology thumb 140px corpus callosum view front part at top of image most people who are right hand dominant have left hemisphere of their brain specialize more in language processing in terms of mechanism of dyslexia fmri studies suggest that this specialization may be less pronounced or even absent in cases with dyslexia additionally anatomical differences in corpus callosum bundle of nerve fibers that connects left and right hemispheres have been linked to dyslexia via different studies data via diffusion tensor mri indicate changes in connectivity or in gray matter density in areas related to reading language finally left inferior frontal gyrus has shown differences in phonological processing in people with dyslexia neurophysiological and imaging procedures are being used to ascertain phenotypic characteristics in people with dyslexia thus identifying effects of certain genes dual route theory dual route theory of reading aloud was first described in early 1970s this theory suggests that two separate mental mechanisms or cognitive routes are involved in reading aloud one mechanism is lexical route which is process whereby skilled readers can recognize known words by sight alone through a dictionary lookup procedure other mechanism is or route which is process whereby reader can sound out a written word this is done by identifying word s constituent parts letters phonemes graphemes and applying knowledge of how these parts are associated with each other for example how a string of neighboring letters sound together dual route system could explain different rates of dyslexia occurrence between different languages e g consistency of phonological rules in spanish language could account for fact that spanish speaking children show a higher level of performance in non word reading when compared to english speakers diagnosis dyslexia is a heterogeneous dimensional learning disorder that impairs accurate and fluent word reading and spelling typical but not universal features include difficulties with phonological awareness inefficient and often inaccurate processing of sounds in oral language phonological processing and verbal working memory deficits snowling margaret j dyslexia a very short introduction oxford university press 2019 dyslexia

special education needs 13 no 1 7 14 assessment tests there are a wide range of tests that are used in clinical and educational settings to evaluate possibility that a person might have dyslexia if initial testing suggests that a person might have dyslexia such tests are often followed up with a full diagnostic assessment to determine extent and nature of disorder some tests can be administered by a teacher or computer others require specialized training and are given by psychologists some test results indicate how to carry out teaching strategies because a variety of different cognitive behavioral emotional and environmental factors all could contribute to learning to read a comprehensive evaluation should consider these different possibilities these tests and observations can include general measures of cognitive ability such as wechsler intelligence scale for children woodcock johnson tests of cognitive abilities or stanford intelligence scales low general cognitive ability would make reading more difficult cognitive ability measures also often try to measure different cognitive cognitive processes such as verbal ability nonverbal and spatial reasoning working memory and processing speed there are different versions of these tests for different age groups almost all of these require additional training to give and score correctly and are done by psychologists according to mather and schneider 2015 a confirmatory profile and or pattern of scores on cognitive tests confirming or ruling out reading disorder has not yet been identified mather n schneider d use of intelligence tests in diagnosis of specific reading disability screening or evaluation for mental health conditions parents and teachers can complete rating scales or behavior checklists to gather information about emotional and behavioral functioning for younger people many checklists have similar versions for parents teachers and younger people old enough to read reasonably well often 11 years and older to complete examples include behavioral assessment system for children and strengths and difficulties questionnaire all of these have nationally representative norms making it possible to compare level of symptoms to what would be typical for younger person s age and biological sex other checklists link more specifically to psychiatric diagnoses such as vanderbilt adhd rating scales or screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders scared screening uses brief tools that are designed to catch cases with a disorder but they often get false positive scores for people who do not have disorder screeners should be followed up by a more accurate test or diagnostic interview as a result depressive disorders and anxiety disorders are two three times higher in people with dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is more common as well review of academic achievement and skills average spelling reading ability for a dyslexic is a percentage ranking 16 well below normal in addition to reviewing grades and teacher notes standardized test results are helpful in evaluating progress these include group administered tests such as iowa tests of educational development that a teacher may give to a group or whole classroom of younger people at same time they also could include individually administered tests of achievement such as wide range achievement test or woodcock johnson which also includes a set of achievement tests individually administered tests again require more specialized training screening screening procedures

screening check used by united kingdom schools during year one in medical setting child and adolescent psychiatrist m s thambirajah emphasizes that g iven high prevalence of developmental disorders in school aged children all children seen in clinics should be systematically screened for developmental disorders irrespective of presenting problem s thambirajah recommends screening for developmental disorders including dyslexia by conducting a brief developmental history a preliminary psychosocial developmental examination and obtaining a school report regarding academic and social functioning management through use of compensation strategies therapy and educational support individuals with dyslexia can learn to read and write there are techniques and technical aids that help to manage or conceal symptoms of disorder reducing stress and anxiety can sometimes improve written comprehension for dyslexia intervention with alphabet writing systems fundamental aim is to increase a child s awareness of correspondences between graphemes letters and phonemes sounds and to relate these to reading and spelling by teaching how sounds blend into words reinforced collateral training focused on reading and spelling may yield longer lasting gains than oral phonological training alone early intervention can be successful in reducing reading failure there is some evidence that use of specially tailored fonts may help with dyslexia these fonts which include dyslexie opendyslexic and lexie readable were created based on idea that many of letters of latin alphabet are visually similar and may therefore confuse people with dyslexia dyslexie and opendyslexic both put emphasis on making each letter more distinctive in order to be more easily identified benefits however might largely be due to added spacing between words in terms of music and any possible positive effects on people with dyslexia until now there is currently no evidence or data showing that music education significantly improves reading skills of adolescents with dyslexia prognosis dyslexic children require special instruction for word analysis and spelling from an early age while there are fonts that may help people with dyslexia better understand writing this might simply be due to added spacing between words prognosis generally speaking is positive for individuals who are identified in childhood and receive support from friends and family new york educational system indicates a daily uninterrupted 90 minute block of instruction in reading furthermore instruction in phonemic awareness phonics vocabulary development reading fluency so as to improve individuals reading ability epidemiology percentage of people with dyslexia is unknown but it has been estimated to be as low as 5 and as high as 17 of population while it is diagnosed more often in males some believe that it affects males and females equally there are different definitions of dyslexia used throughout world but despite significant differences in writing systems dyslexia occurs in different populations dyslexia is not limited to difficulty in converting letters to sounds and chinese people with dyslexia may have difficulty converting chinese characters into their meanings chinese vocabulary uses logographic monographic non alphabet writing where one character can represent an individual phoneme phonological processing hypothesis attempts to explain why dyslexia occurs in a wide variety of languages furthermore relationship between phonological capacity and reading appears to be influenced by orthography history dyslexia was clinically described by oswald in 1881 but term dyslexia was coined in 1883 by rudolf berlin an ophthalmologist in stuttgart berlin rudolf no title des correspondence sheet of wurttemberg medical association 53 1883 209 webster s third new international dictionary history and etymology for dyslexia s v dyslexia noun springfield ma merriam webster 1961 rev 2016 he used term to refer to case of a young boy who had severe difficulty learning to read and write despite showing typical intelligence and physical abilities in all other respects in 1896 w pringle morgan a british physician from seaford east sussex published a description of a reading specific learning disorder in a report to british medical journal titled congenital word blindness distinction between phonological versus surface types of dyslexia is only descriptive and without any etiological assumption as to underlying brain mechanisms however studies have alluded to potential differences due to variation in performance society and culture as is case with any disorder society often makes an assessment based on incomplete information before 1980s dyslexia was thought to be a consequence of education rather than a neurological disability as a result society often those with disorder there is also sometimes a workplace stigma and negative attitude towards those with dyslexia if instructors of a person with dyslexia lack necessary training to support a child with condition there is often a negative effect on student s learning participation research thumb 120px writing systems most dyslexia research relates to alphabetic writing systems and especially to european languages however substantial research is also available regarding people with dyslexia who speak arabic chinese hebrew or other
