thumb left to right director zack snyder with actors henry cavill and russell crowe at world premiere of man of steel in sydney australia 2013 henry cavill as kal el clark kent a kryptonian sent by his parents to earth as an infant to escape destruction of his homeworld krypton and raised under mental guidance of farmers in smallville kansas until he is inspired by holographic message from his late father to become earth s greatest protector superman is depicted as being 33 years old at least from moment he is found in present timeline of film superman states that he has been on earth for 33 years when he is in fbi custody cavill is first british and non american actor to play character he was previously cast in superman flyby which was ultimately shelved and was considered for role in 2006 film superman returns but lost to brandon routh cavill stated there s a very real story behind superman character he explained that everyone s goal has been to explore difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities including his birth name kal el and his alter ego clark kent cavill also stated that he s alone and there s no one like him referring to superman s vulnerabilities that must be incredibly scary and lonely not to know who you are or what you are and trying to find out what makes sense where s your baseline what do you draw from where do you draw a limit with power you have in itself that s an incredible weakness in an interview with total film magazine cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5 000 calories a day training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on muscle mass cooper timberline was cast as 9 year old clark kent and dylan sprayberry was cast as 13 year old clark kent amy adams as lois lane a reporter for daily planet newspaper and love interest of clark kent adams was selected from a list of actresses that included zoe saldana olivia wilde and mila kunis there was a big giant search for lois snyder said for us it was a big thing and obviously a really important role we did a lot of auditioning but we had this meeting with amy adams and after that i just felt she was perfect for it adams auditioned for role three times once for unproduced superman flyby and second time for superman returns before landing current role adams was confirmed to play lois lane in march 2011 while announcing role snyder said in a statement we are excited to announce casting of amy adams one of most versatile and respected actresses in films today amy has talent to capture all of qualities we love about lois smart tough funny warm ambitious and of course beautiful on portraying lois lane adams stated that film would feature a lois lane who is an independent feisty woman but set in a more identifiable world adams said that she has become more of a free ranging journalist someone who likes to be hands on nature of newspaper business has changed so much there is so much more pressure michael shannon as general zod a kryptonian general with same superpowers as superman bent on transforming earth into a new krypton under his reign viggo mortensen was considered for role snyder stated zod is not only one of superman s most formidable enemies but one of most significant because he has insights into superman that others don t michael is a powerful actor who can project both intelligence and malice of character making him perfect for role when goyer was asked about why zod was chosen as villain he stated way christopher nolan and i have always approached movies as well is you never say hey which villain would be cool for this movie you start with story first what kind of story what kind of theme do you want to tell so we worked that out then usually villain becomes obvious in terms of who s going to be appropriate antagonist for that when you guys see movie only villain we could ve used was zod and kryptonians i mean when you see what whole story is nothing else would have even made sense shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to terence stamp s original take on zod to follow terence stamp s iconic performance in original it is daunting but i just focused on one day at a time it s interesting that when we started with this we did a lot of training together and i think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit it is a very physical movie at end of day that s a good way to find your way into it as an actor kevin costner as jonathan kent clark s adoptive father snyder explained his reason for his casting on screen couple is solely for realism i think thing you realize when you look at diane and kevin in our decision to cast them so far you sort of get a sense of how tonally we re looking at movie and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors and we re taking this movie very seriously in terms of tone of having those guys you re talking about having a situation where whatever action is or whatever drama of movie is our first priority is to make sure it s rendered in most realistic way we can get at diane lane as martha kent clark s adoptive mother lane was first cast member to join film after cavill this was a very important piece of casting for me because martha kent is woman whose values helped shape man we know as superman snyder said in release we are thrilled to have diane in role because she can convey wisdom and wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination laurence fishburne as perry white editor in chief of daily planet and boss of lois lane fishburne is first african american to play perry white in a live action film fishburne stated that he modeled his character after ed bradley stating that my inspiration really is late ed bradley who was a cbs correspondent on 60 minutes for many years legendary ed bradley was a friend a mentor and a role model for me particularly because he worked in journalism and he was kind of guy who walked with kings but he had common touch and so he was my inspiration for perry antje traue as faora ul general zod s sub commander and a commander of kryptonian military who is completely devoted and loyal to zod gal gadot was offered role but declined because she was pregnant at that time this allowed her to be later cast as wonder woman in film s sequel about role of faora traue said in an interview what i liked about her was that as a woman we have certain doubts and we think too much sometimes about ourselves and all these things they re not there for faora she s a bred warrior so to really focus on that aspect that fear is a chemical reaction and that it was bred out of her and she doesn t have it it s liberating when you actually think about it that you re just a one track mind there s no filter there s no double meaning she gets orders and she answers those orders without a question ayelet zurer as lara lor van kal el s biological mother and loyal wife to jor el julia ormond had previously been announced as cast but dropped out connie nielsen was in negotiations for role before zurer was cast nielsen was subsequently cast as queen hippolyta in wonder woman christopher meloni as col nathan hardy a united states air force officer call sign guardian assigned to united states northern command russell crowe as jor el a kryptonian scientist who is kal el s biological father sean penn and clive owen were also considered for role crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of script to portray jor el stating that it was one of those things where that s how it was connecting me that s question that jor el faces that s situation that he s in crowe also comments on his preparation for film stating that when i signed on well one i didn t realize that i would be wearing spandex cause you know that s superman s costume i didn t realize that i d have to fit into it as well crowe said but i also didn t realize type of organizer that zack snyder is cause this was really old school prep this is sort of david lean level preparation and i really appreciated him and i was on movie for three and a half or four months before i even got in front of camera additionally harry lennix plays lieutenant general calvin swanwick a united states army general officer and deputy commander of united states northern command christina wren plays capt carrie ferris a united states air force officer and assistant to general swanwick richard schiff plays dr emil hamilton a scientist who works with united states armed forces for darpa carla gugino portrays voice of kryptonian a i service robot screenrant mackenzie gray plays jax ur a kryptonian scientist who is one of general zod s followers michael kelly plays steve lombard an employee of daily planet and rebecca buller plays jenny

took pitches from comic book writers screenwriters and directors on how to successfully restart superman film series comic book writers grant morrison mark waid geoff johns and brad meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot i told them it s not that bad just treat superman returns as ang lee hulk morrison said incredible hulk has proven audience will forgive you and let you redo franchise said waid morrison s idea was similar to his work on all star superman while waid s was akin to superman birthright mark millar teaming with director matthew vaughn also planned an epic eight hour superman trilogy each installment released a year apart similar to lord of rings millar compared it to godfather trilogy in which it would chronicle entire life of superman from early days of krypton to finale where superman loses his powers as sun starts to go supernova in august 2008 warner bros suggested a reboot of film series studio executive jeff robinov planned to have film released either by 2010 or 2011 explaining superman returns didn t quite work as a film in way that we wanted it to it didn t position character way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 now plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all paul levitz stated in an interview that batman holds key to superman reboot he elaborated everyone is waiting for nolan to sign on for another batman once that happens release date for superman and all other future projects will follow in february 2009 mcg who previously planned to direct superman flyby expressed interest in returning to superman franchise august 2009 saw a court ruling in which jerry siegel s family recaptured 50 of rights to superman s origins and siegel s share of copyright in action comics 1 in addition a judge ruled that warner bros did not owe families additional royalties from previous films however if they did not begin production on a superman film by 2011 then siegel estate would have been able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film plot of man of steel employs a nonlinear narrative and tells parts of story in flashback during story discussions for dark knight rises in 2008 david s goyer told christopher nolan his idea regarding how to present superman in a modern context impressed with goyer s concept nolan pitched idea to studio who hired nolan to produce and goyer to write based on financial and critical success of dark knight nolan admired bryan singer s work on superman returns for its connection to richard donner s version stating that a lot of people have approached superman in a lot of different ways i only know way that has worked for us that s what i know how to do emphasizing idea that batman exists in a world where he is only superhero and a similar approach to man of steel would assure integrity needed for film each serves to internal logic of story they have nothing to do with each other nolan however clarified that new film would not have any relationship with previous film series jeff robinov president of warner bros pictures group spoke to entertainment weekly and allowed a peek over wall of secrecy surrounding their dc comics plans it s setting tone for what movies are going to be like going forward in that it s definitely a first step plans included for film to contain references to existence of other superheroes alluding to possibility of a further dc universe and setting tone for a shared fictional universe of dc comics characters on film guillermo del toro with whom goyer worked on blade ii turned down director s position on reboot because of his commitment on a film adaptation of at mountains of madness while robert zemeckis was also approached ben affleck who would eventually be cast as bruce wayne batman in film s sequel darren aronofsky duncan jones jonathan matt reeves and tony scott were considered as potential directors before zack snyder was hired in october 2010 casting began following november snyder confirmed both booster gold and batman references in film indicating their presence in dc shared film universe when zod destroys a satellite words wayne enterprises are scrolled on satellite film s storyboard was created by filipino american storyboard artist jay oliva in his first live action feature film project along with snyder oliva has cited japanese anime shows dragon ball z and birdy mighty as an inspiration for film s epic battle scenes during film s brainstorming oliva pitched idea as i could come up with something i ve never seen in live action american cinema and only in anime filming principal photography began on august 1 2011 at an industrial park near dupage airport under codename autumn frost zack snyder expressed reluctance to shooting film in 3 d due to technical limitations of format and instead chose to shoot film two dimensionally and convert film into 3 d in post production for a 2 d 3 d and imax 3 d release snyder also chose to shoot film on film instead of digitally because he felt it would make film a big movie experience cinematographer amir shot film with panavision millennium xl2 cameras and c series anamorphic lenses filming was expected to last for two to three months production took place in plano illinois on august 22 to 29 according to an interview with michael shannon filming would continue until february 2012 man of steel filmed in chicago area california and burnaby s mammoth studios which was transformed into superman s home planet of krypton and myriad extraterrestrial aircraft metro lands on vancouver s north shore waterfront hosted shoot for dramatic oil rig rescue that introduces audiences to superman and nanaimo british columbia feature prominently in film s first hour trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as alaska in film filming took place in chicago loop from september 7 to 17 vancouver production took place from september 21 2011 to january 20 2012 to celebrate 60th birthday anniversary of late christopher reeve who was first actor who played superman in films chicago shoot was a unit project meaning that filming could partake numerous establishing shots as well as cutaways and may not necessarily include principal cast members design man of steel features a redesigned superman costume by james acheson and michael wilkinson costume preserves color scheme and s logo but adopts darker tones and notably does not feature red trunks usually worn by superman zack snyder said costume is a modern aesthetic he and producers attempted to devise a suit featuring red trunks but could not design one that fit into tone of film leading to their removal from suit because of wilkinson s unavailability snyder chose acheson to design suit however he only started developing it and wilkinson finished development when he returned and designed other character s costumes as well due to substantial weight a practical suit would yield kryptonian armor for general zod was constructed through cgi to allow shannon freedom of movement in a march 2014 interview with esquire wilkinson explained reason for look of superman s redesigned suit effects john dj desjardin served as visual supervisor for man of steel with weta digital mpc and double negative providing visual effects for film zack snyder wanted film to appear very natural because there s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief and we visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so desjardin noted that intent in shooting film was to utilize handheld devices to make film feel like a documentary style film we had to think about what that would mean since we also had to photograph some crazy action said desjardin so for a lot of previs we did we d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was a lot of rules are battlestar galactica rules for space cams that gary developed for that miniseries where we want to make sure if we re translating camera at all it makes sense unless action is so over top like in end where superman is beating up zod we had to break it a bit thumb 320px left alien like planet landscapes creatures and architecture were created by weta digital to further enhance worldbuilding process of planet krypton for first act of film taking place on planet krypton weta digital placed alien like planet environments creatures and principal means of display a technology filmmakers called liquid geometry weta digital visual effects supervisor dan lemmon explained that it s a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field and machine is able to control that magnetic field so that collection of beads behave almost like three dimensional pixels and they can create a surface that floats in air and describes whatever thing is you re supposed to be seeing beads of display which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight bevel were designed to create a surface of object to depict inside a console like figure in modeling and animation aspect of liquid geometry goodwin explained we had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets so instead of going through route of reducing polygon count to something usable what we would then do you would take model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it and extract matrix onto animation and copy these points onto matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that model would after animation artists duplicated beads onto animated geometry for a pre simulated lighting version to get approval on how object would read sims were then run on all targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of surface which would have its own set of parameters said goodwin bead size or turbulence that would crawl along surface constantly updating orientation was based on normal provided by surface that was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as final target for simulation after simulation process weta digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove to control noise lighting solutions directly worked on set weta utilized renderman to take advantage of improved ray tracing and instancing objects sequences where superman utilizes close combat fight scenes with other kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for filmmakers and visual effects crew desjardin explained when we do these fights and these hyper real things we don t want to do traditional ok i m a cameraman i m shooting a clean plate i m going to pan over here to follow action that s not really there yet but we ll put action in later because that s us animating characters to camera so we would do that animation with characters grappling punching or flying away and we would take real guys up until point until they were supposed to do that and we d cut then we d put an environment camera there and take environment and then a camera for reference of actors and get each moment so then we had a set of high res stills for environment and characters then in post we take digi doubles and animate them according to speeds we want them to move in our digital environment mpc handled visual effects for smallville encounter sequence before providing visual effects shots were previsualized for fight choreography after live action portions of scene would be filmed in small pieces if say superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away we would shoot our start position and end position and then bridge that gap with cg takeovers says guillaume mpc visual effects supervisor a camera rig would then obtain key frames of choreographed actor it s a six still camera rig that s built on a pipe rig so that you can run it in at end of a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression said desjardin and then we could use those hi res stills to project onto cg double and get really accurate transition lighting and color right from set on set a camera rig was used to capture environment of sequence dubbed cam visual effects crew would mount a canon eos 5d and a motorized nodal head allowing crew to capture environment at a 360 degree angle with resolution for every shot process would take approximately two to four minutes set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be onto geometry full screen digital doubles were a major component for fighting sequences digital armor was also added along with energy based kryptonian helmets and facs were conducted with actors and polarized and non polarized reference photos were taken superman s cape and costume were scanned in high detail cape in particular became a direct extensions of superman s actions for sequences involving terraforming of city metropolis double negative handled visual effects for sequence in order to construct a metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic double negative utilized esri s to help procedurally deliver city that was a much more sci fi based role said double negative visual effects supervisor ged wright so we took what they had done and extended it a great deal work we were doing was based around downtowns for new york l a and chicago and that gave us building volumes for heights we d skin those volumes with kit parts but most of it then had to fall down so we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of work as well for destruction of buildings studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events bullet physics software was a heavily impacted component for utilization of destruction we wanted to be able to run an event and trigger all these secondary events whether it was glass or dust simulations all of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way said wright one of advantages of this was that because it was all based around a limited number of input components you can make sure they re modeled in a way they re usable in effects you can model something but they ll be another stage to rig it for destruction fire smoke and water stimulation tools were developed at double negative studio studio transitioned between existing proprietary volume rendering software to rendering in mantra for elements such as fireball sims double negative also used in house fluids tool squirt to handle larger scale sims and interaction for more tightly coupled volumes and particles regarding battle between superman and zod double negative implemented real photography onto its digital doubles music hans zimmer initially denied popular rumors that he would be composing film s score however in june 2012 it was confirmed that zimmer would in fact be doing so after all to completely distinguish man of steel from previous films iconic superman march by john williams was not used hans zimmer s soundtrack for man of steel was released publicly on june 11 2013 an unofficial rip of musical score from third trailer entitled an ideal of hope confirmed to be a cut down version of track what are you going to do when you are not saving world was released on april 19 2013 in late april 2013 official track listing of two disc deluxe edition was revealed themes many reviewers interpreted man of steel as a religious allegory especially since warner bros set up a website www com that contains a nine page pamphlet entitled jesus original superhero justin craig compares kal el s struggle to passion of christ stating that kal el is more than willing to sacrifice himself to save people of earth originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to world decides to turn himself over to zod to save humanity from annihilation craig also states that there is an allegory to trinity within man of steel jor el returns to kal el on earth as a ghost guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation before jor el sends his son off to earth baby moses style he tells his wife that like jesus he ll be a god to them paul asay of washington post writes that superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross a fact that craig also mentioned in his assessment of film protagonist of film is also 33 years old and seeks counsel at a church writing for huffington
