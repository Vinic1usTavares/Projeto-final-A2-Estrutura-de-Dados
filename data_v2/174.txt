russian monitor admiral lazarev was name ship of her class of monitors built for imperial russian navy in late 1860s she was assigned to baltic fleet upon completion and remained there for her entire career aside from one accidental collision in 1871 her service was uneventful ship was reclassified as coast defense ironclad in 1892 and often served as a training ship there was an unsuccessful proposal to convert her into an aircraft carrier in 1910 admiral lazarev was stricken from navy list in 1907 and sold for scrap in 1912 she sank while under tow to germany later that year design and description thumb left right elevation and plan from brassey s naval annual 1888 admiral lazarev class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors and had an overall length of a beam of and a maximum draft of ships were designed to displace but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced they were fitted with a plough shaped ram their crew consisted of between 269 274 officers and crewmen admiral lazarev class ships had a single two cylinder horizontal direct acting steam engine that drove a single propeller using steam provided by four rectangular fire tube boilers engine was designed to produce a total of which gave a lightly loaded admiral lazarev a speed of from when she ran her sea trials in october 1871 they had a range of about at a speed of and were fitted with a light fore and aft sailing rig to steady them and aid in maneuvering mclaughlin pp 115 16 122 23 armament monitors were originally designed to be armed with six 20 caliber obukhov rifled muzzle loading guns a pair in each coles type turret around 1874 1875 guns were replaced by three 17 caliber 11 inch rifled guns based on a krupp design during russo turkish war of 1877 1878 a 9 inch mortar was fitted to attack thin deck armor of enemy ships but accuracy was poor and it was later removed probably in early 1880s a more powerful 22 caliber 11 inch gun was installed aboard admiral lazarev and her sister ship during 1880s mclaughlin pp 118 19 light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to admiral lazarev class during russo turkish war when a pair of 4 pounder guns were mounted on roofs of fore and aft gun turrets and a 4 barreled engstrem quick firing qf gun by early 1890s admiral light armament consisted of two baranov qf guns five qf hotchkiss guns replacing 4 pounders and a pair of qf hotchkiss five barreled revolving cannon monitors could also carry 12 15 mines intended to be used to create a secure anchorage mclaughlin pp 119 20 armor hull of admiral lazarev class monitors was completely covered by wrought iron armor that was thick amidships and thinned to aft and forward of main belt turrets had of armor except around gun ports where it thickened to conning tower was thick and deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch mclaughlin pp 121 22 construction and service admiral lazarev was named for admiral mikhail lazarev silverstone p 371 who circumnavigated globe taking part in discovery of antarctica and later became commander of black sea fleet monitor was ordered on 24 may 1865 from carr and macpherson shipyard saint petersburg although formal keel laying was not until 29 may 1867 construction was delayed by changes to design and late deliveries of components she was launched on 21 september and then transferred to kronstadt for fitting out as shallow waters around saint petersburg prevented deep draft ships from being completed this added more delays as dockyard there lacked equipment to efficiently fit out ships and she officially entered service in 1872 at cost of 1 289 300 rubles mclaughlin pp 113 14 ship was assigned to baltic fleet upon completion but she was not fully equipped until around 1872 admiral lazarev was accidentally rammed by monitor in kronstadt harbor on 22 october 1871 and had a hole punched in her hull below waterline by latter s ram a large amount of water flooded in and admiral lazarev took on an eight degree list as it leaked through poorly sealed watertight bulkheads but nearby ships were able to pump out water before she capsized mclaughlin pp 114 124 25 accident prompted an investigation that concluded that quality control of riveting and caulking of watertight bulkheads needed to be improved and it recommended testing that by flooding interior compartments during construction that recommendation was not followed until after loss of in a similar incident in 1897 in meantime admiral lazarev was fitted with an improved bilge system for evaluation designed by lieutenant stepan makarov that connected all of ship s pumps to main bilge drain this proved successful and it became a standard feature of later russian ships mclaughlin p 124 ship had her boilers replaced in 1881 p 123 and again around 1900 1903 possibly with cylindrical boilers watts p 107 she was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 february 1892 and frequently served with artillery training detachment of baltic fleet during russo japanese war of 1904 1905 admiral lazarev was deployed to latvia to reinforce defenses there ship was stricken on 14 august p 125 although one naval architect proposed a conversion into a flush decked aircraft carrier in july 1910 turrets and superstructure would be removed and replaced by a full length flight deck measuring supported on stanchions above original deck aircraft would be stowed below flight deck and a small navigation bridge fitted there as well funnel would be split and redirected to exhaust on each side outboard of flight deck this may have been first serious proposal by a designer for an aircraft carrier that utilized most of features of modern carriers mclaughlin pp 126 27 although perfectly feasible given low take off and landing speeds of aircraft of day proposal was not accepted possibly because it would have been relatively expensive at a time when naval ministry was struggling to finance dreadnought battleships and other modern ships admiral lazarev was sold to german shipbreakers and sank in october 1912 while under tow mclaughlin pp 125 127 notes footnotes
