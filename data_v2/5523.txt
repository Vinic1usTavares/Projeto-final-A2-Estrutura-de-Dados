fictional space colony compound game follows a female mercenary fighting against berserk robots it was directed by shinji mikami to avoid similarities with devil may cry and resident evil game designers emphasized defensive and rhythmic maneuvers and a delicate feminine game world game was developed on a tight schedule in an attempt to offset capcom s poor fiscal year however it received mixed reviews and failed commercially several critics found game repetitive and unintuitive they were divided on its gameplay mechanics some disliked its controls specifically inability to move and shoot simultaneously while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games mikami repurposed ideas from p n 03 for game vanquish gameplay and plot thumb left alt a horizontally rectangular

enemy player controls vanessa z schneider a freelance mercenary working on colonized planets she is contracted by a mysterious client to destroy computerized armament management system cams robots that have gone berserk robots of this type had been responsible for killing vanessa s parents to combat cams vanessa wears aegis suits powered exoskeletons that allow her to fire energy beams from her palms and to perform powerful attacks called energy drives it depletes energy meter grants temporary invulnerability to vanessa and damages multiple enemies at checkpoints player uses points earned from defeated robots to purchase aegis suits suit upgrades and energy drives player may play trial missions randomly generated levels between missions to score extra points cams robots attack in set patterns and their next moves are indicated by visual and aural cues player avoids these attacks via evasive spins rolls and other maneuvers vanessa cannot move while attacking and so player must often use environment as cover defeated enemies sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer which multiplies points earned from enemies destroyed consecutively each mission takes place in a series of rooms that contain a fixed number of enemies and may include a boss robot at end of a mission player receives a score based on number of rooms explored and enemies destroyed late in game vanessa discovers a clone of herself in a cams facility but is forced to abandon her when building s self destruct sequence is initiated after destroying cams central core vanessa encounters a digital projection of client whose appearance is identical to her own she speculates that she is a clone of client but client counters that none of their memories may be real vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary development in november 2002 capcom announced capcom five a group of video games developed by capcom production studio 4 and overseen by resident evil creator shinji mikami among these titles was p n 03 directed by mikami capcom conceived capcom five to bring new intellectual property to industry which company viewed at time as stagnant according to hiroyuki kobayashi p n 03 team s goal was to make a game both fun to watch and fun to play team focused on game s audiovisuals action and speed and they tried to balance tension experienced on battlefield and exhilaration of taking out enemies mikami wanted p n 03 to evoke same feelings as classic nintendo games while staff felt background graphics were important they prioritized excitement in game world during planning stage p n 03 was originally a wargame referred to as robot war game five days into development staff created a preliminary demonstration of graphics mikami was unsatisfied with this prototype and decided to rework project as a third person shooting game director wanted to name game jaguar to reflect vanessa s cat like agility however other staff members disliked name some claimed that it failed to describe game while others thought that white jaguar was a better title mikami chose p n 03 as a hint to game s plot thumb alt a horizontally rectangular video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a space station a woman in a white and grey suit holding a large black gun ducks underneath a blue beam of light early versions of p n 03 highlighted shooting gameplay and featured protagonist with a gun which was removed due to time constraints early coverage of p n 03 by gamespot and ign highlighted game s acrobatics and shooting p n 03s gameplay was initially similar to that of devil may cry vanessa attacked with two pistols and performed acrobatic moves like dante feeling that it resembled devil may cry too closely mikami altered game to reward players for performing defensive moves mikami wanted vanessa to use guns but developers couldn t complete animated graphics for weapons in time for release guns were replaced with energy bolts fired from character in an effort to meet yearly sales goals capcom developed p n 03 quickly and released it in march 2003 many of capcom s releases for year had underperformed viewtiful joe another capcom five title was delayed into next fiscal year to decrease possible sales that had to be offset after leaving capcom mikami later incorporated ideas he intended for p n 03 into 2010 game vanquish kobayashi aimed to avoid conventions established in resident evil such as that series dark masculine world with p n 03 kobayashi wanted to portray a white world with feminine delicate lines to that end staff applied a minimalist approach to visuals used fine drawn lines and emphasized visibility and creativity in game world to maintain game s delicate image developers tried to make visuals easy to view and understand team crafted gameplay to avoid button mashing instead players were meant to observe enemy attack patterns and think before acting mechanical designer shou sakai tried to craft things that would stick in player s mind because of tight development schedule 3d models had to be created immediately after their designs were completed sakai described lack of time as toughest part of process mikami was indifferent to main character s gender during early creation process he left decision to his staff who ultimately chose a female character because p n 03 takes place in a space colony mikami wanted vanessa s country of origin to be ambiguous to that end she was given a combination of french german and english names vanessa s movements were animated freehand without motion capture technology designers posed vanessa crouched on her hands and knees to resemble a jaguar as an homage to jaguar title staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish kobayashi wanted vanessa to be a cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past in retrospect he was proud of character s style and movements release capcom five were first announced as games exclusive to nintendo gamecube however capcom later ported most of titles to other consoles at end of 2002 company confirmed that game would be released in 2003 on gamecube in january 2003 company slated game for a march release in japan but retracted exclusivity announcement at a press conference prior to 2003 electronic entertainment expo however capcom reaffirmed that p n 03 would be available only for gamecube in end p n 03 was only capcom five title to remain exclusive to system p n 03 was first of capcom five to be released before game s debut in japan capcom distributed playable demos to stores and released screenshots to media upon game s release capcom shipped 25 000 copies to japanese retailers under 11 000 units were sold which made game japan s 26th best selling title during last week of march 2003 these low sales failed to help capcom meet its yearly sales goals north american localization was announced in july 2003 few aspects of game were changed for north american market capcom advertised a free t shirt as a pre order incentive in north america promotional sunglasses modeled after vanessa s were also released reception p n 03 failed commercially and received mixed reviews with scores of 64 and 63 on review aggregate websites gamerankings and metacritic respectively electronic gaming monthlys three reviewers characterized game as shallow repetitive and devoid of plot and character development mark macdonald of magazine criticized vanessa s inability to move and shoot at same time by contrast reviewer for edge wrote p n 03 may be rather short and its premise simple but grace under fire has rarely been done better writer favorably compared its gameplay to that of space invaders in that game rewards skill above all else and mastery brings huge satisfaction reviewer cited vanessa as one of game s high points in a 2009 retrospective review edge magazine staff echoed its previous praise of p n 03 but acknowledged game s awkward control mechanics staff commented that vanessa s potentially fluid movement is difficult to execute but that challenge of mastering control scheme is part of game s charm gamepros mike weigand called game a long intense thumb busting shooter that tests trigger fingers and patience levels he found environments and enemies repetitive but he cited strong aesthetics and a slick reward system as redemptive features weigand summarized that while game lacks depth it may be recommended to those who crave a shoot em up with old school inflections paul byrnes of gmr found p n 03 to be a boring and repetitive missed opportunity he felt that it lacked flow thanks in large part to vanessa s clumsily staccato movements and inability to move and shoot simultaneously game informers andrew reiner wrote that p n 03s setting animations and protagonist give it an undeniable allure of freshness and originality however he disliked game s control system and wrote that blowing away robots gets old rather quickly reiner called p n 03s length which he estimated to be four hours its most disappointing aspect greg kasavin of gamespot wrote that you ll almost certainly be unimpressed with repetitive and cumbersome action at heart of p n 03 he disliked game s separation into brief discrete sections and while he saw game s design as a reference to that of older games he found that p n 03 lacked extremely precise controls and smooth colorful graphics of titles that inspired it kasavin summarized it as a short uninspired game that s yet another would be imitator of capcom s own devil may cry matt casamassina of ign wrote that players will want to like game but that its design flaws and sloppy execution are impossible to overlook he found it to be shallow and repetitive and he wrote that its fast pace and unresponsive control setup combine to place game at war with itself however he believed that p n 03 is not a disaster merely a disappointment and that it sits solidly in average country in a 2012 retrospective from eurogamer chris schilling called game outcast of shinji mikami s work criticizing its plot and calling its control scheme its biggest obstacle he later added if at times its appeal can be hard to pin down that doesn t mean it should be so easily forgotten mentioning satisfaction of beating bosses in game notes references external links via internet archive via internet archive p n 03 at mobygames category 2003 video games category capcom
