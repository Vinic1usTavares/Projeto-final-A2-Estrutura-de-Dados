that had previously incorporated technology were guns mounted on wittelsbachs design department of reichsmarineamt imperial navy office adopted these guns for new battleships along with an increase from to for secondary battery owing to increased threat from torpedo boats as torpedoes became more effective though braunschweig class marked a significant improvement over earlier german battleships its design fell victim to rapid pace of technological development in early 1900s british battleship armed with ten 30 5 cm 12 in guns was commissioned in december 1906 just over a year after hessen

major training cruise prince heinrich commander of high seas fleet had pressed for such a cruise previous year arguing that it would prepare fleet for overseas operations and break up monotony of training in german waters though tensions with britain over developing anglo german naval arms race were high fleet departed kiel on 17 july passed through kaiser wilhelm canal to north sea and continued on to atlantic during cruise hessen stopped at santa cruz de tenerife in canary islands fleet returned to germany on 13 august autumn maneuvers followed from 27 august to 12 september later that year fleet toured coastal german cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures next year 1909 followed much same pattern as in 1908 another cruise into atlantic was conducted from 7 july to 1 august during which hessen stopped in el ferrol spain while on way back to germany high seas fleet was received by british royal navy at spithead late in year admiral henning von holtzendorff became commander of high seas fleet his tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation owing to increased threat posed by latest underwater weapons like submarines and naval mines and to fact that new s were too wide to pass through kaiser wilhelm canal accordingly fleet was transferred from kiel to wilhelmshaven on 1 april 1910 in may 1910 fleet conducted training maneuvers in kattegat between norway and denmark these were in accordance with holtzendorff s strategy which envisioned drawing royal navy into narrow waters in kattegat annual

battleships starting with nassau class as part of this process hessen was scheduled to be withdrawn into reserve on 26 august 1914 with her place in ii squadron taken by new dreadnought but rising tensions in europe during july crisis which led to outbreak of world war i interrupted that plan hessen therefore remained in service with squadron oldest battleship in service with main fleet following germany s entry into war in early august hessen and rest of squadron were sent to altenbruch roadstead to support defense of german bight at mouth of elbe in october squadron went to baltic for maneuvers and while transiting kaiser wilhelm canal on 26 october she ran aground and had to be pulled free by tugboats squadron returned to north sea on 17 november having completed training exercises ii squadron joined rest of high seas fleet for offensive operations against britain first of these was raid on scarborough hartlepool and whitby on 15 december battlecruisers of i scouting group attacked towns in an attempt to lure out part of british grand fleet while battleships of high seas fleet waited in support in hopes of ambushing and destroying any british forces that sortied out during night of 15 16 december german battle fleet of twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six british battleships skirmishes between rival destroyer screens convinced german commander admiral friedrich von ingenohl that he was confronted with entire grand fleet and so he broke off engagement and turned for home hessen was in shipyard in kiel for maintenance from 22 february 1915 to 6 march after which she returned to guard duties off altenbruch starting on 10 march squadron exercises in baltic took place from 18 march to 1 april and

in north sea taking part in sorties on 11 12 september and 23 24 october from 6 to 23 december she went to wilhelmshaven for maintenance which was followed by squadron training in baltic from 25 december to 20 january 1916 she immediately went to in hamburg for more repair work which lasted from 22 january to 15 march on 26 march after more baltic exercises hessen was pronounced ready for further offensive operations on 5 april admiralstab admiralty staff determined that ships of ii squadron should be periodically sent to guard danish straits hessen performed this duty from 10 to 20 april when she was replaced by hessen returned to north sea and was present for another attack on british coast on 24 25 april this time battlecruisers bombarded yarmouth and lowestoft during this operation battlecruiser was damaged by a british mine and had to return to port prematurely visibility was poor so operation was quickly called off before british fleet could intervene and inflict further losses hessen relieved preussen in straits on 4 may remaining there until 20th she returned to rest of squadron at altenbruch on 23 may to begin preparing for next major fleet operation battle of jutland 500px thumb diagram of battle of jutland showing major movements alt german fleet sailed to north and met british fleet sailing from west both fleets conducted a series of turns and maneuvers during chaotic battle hessen took part in battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 hessen and five ships of formed ii battle squadron under command of konteradmiral kadm rear admiral franz mauve on 31 may at 02 00 cet vadm franz von hipper s battlecruisers of i scouting group steamed out towards skagerrak followed by rest of high seas fleet an hour and a half later during run to north scheer ordered fleet to pursue british v battle squadron at top speed slower deutschland class ships quickly fell behind faster dreadnoughts by 19 30 grand fleet had arrived on scene confronting scheer with significant numerical superiority german fleet was severely hampered by presence of slower deutschland class ships ordering an immediate turn towards germany would have sacrificed slower ships scheer decided to reverse course of fleet with gefechtskehrtwendung a maneuver that required every unit in german line to turn 180deg simultaneously six ships of ii battle squadron having fallen behind could not conform to new course following turn and fell back to disengaged side of german line mauve considered moving his ships to rear of line astern of iii battle squadron dreadnoughts but decided against it when he realized movement would interfere with maneuvering of hipper s battlecruisers instead he attempted to place his ships at head of line late in day hessen and deutschland class ships performed a vital blocking action that covered withdrawal of german battlecruisers vice admiral david beatty s battlecruisers had attacked german ships in darkness which had turned westward to evade their attackers and mauve had continued in a southerly course which placed his ships between british and german battlecruisers british battlecruisers turned their attention to pre dreadnoughts which in turn altered their course to southwest in order to bring all of their guns to bear on british ships in darkness only muzzle flashes from british ships could be seen as a result hessen and other ii squadron ships held their fire at approximately 03 00 on 1 june a group of british destroyers launched a torpedo attack against german battle line at 03 07 hessen narrowly avoided a torpedo but directly ahead was struck by at least one at 03 10 torpedo is believed to have detonated one of ship s 17 cm 6 7 in shell magazines destroying ship aboard hessen it was assumed that a submarine had destroyed pommern at 03 12 hessen fired her main battery at an imagined submarine she and several other battleships engaged imaginary submarines again at 05 06 and again at 05 13 gunfire from hessen and during latter incident nearly hit light cruisers and scheer ordered them to cease fire at 06 55 hessen and mistook a mine buoy dropped by battleship for a periscope and attacked it in course of battle hessen had fired five 28 cm rounds thirty four 17 cm shells and twenty four 8 8 cm rounds she was not damaged in engagement later operations experience at jutland proved that pre dreadnoughts of ii squadron were a hindrance to more modern units of fleet and so admiralstab decided that ships should be withdrawn from service as their crews could be used more effectively elsewhere hessen spent remainder of 1916 alternating between guard duty off altenbruch and danish straits on 18 november she went to to assist dreadnought which had run aground there starting in december hessen was employed as a target ship in baltic this was to be her last active service during war on 12 december she was decommissioned and disarmed after eleven years of service with fleet hessen was thereafter used as a depot ship in brunsbuttel for i submarine flotilla along with old coastal defense ship while in reserve at brunsbuttel hessen was jokingly referred to as sms sms

january 1925 she received her old gun armament back with exception her tertiary battery she received only four of 8 8 cm guns with another four in high angle anti aircraft mounts four torpedo tubes were installed in above water casemates in main deck her coal fired cylindrical boilers were replaced with a pair of new oil fired models after spending first half of year conducting sea trials and individual training hessen joined fleet for a voyage to norway in june reminiscent of old peacetime summer cruises of imperial fleet fleet training exercises followed later in year at start of 1926 hessen was tasked with clearing paths for merchant vessels in iced over baltic she also made visits to ports of libau latvia and reval estonia during this period ship joined pre dreadnought flagship of vadm konrad mommsen for a trip to spain that lasted from 12 may to 19 june during cruise hessen visited canary islands and cape verde in central atlantic in july hessen and torpedo boat visited

paid a visit to bergen and sognefjord norway in july 1934 before participating in what would be her final annual fleet maneuvers later that year she departed kiel on 25 september and steamed to wilhelmshaven where she was decommissioned on 12 november her crew were sent to new armored ship which replaced hessen in fleet on 31 march 1935 hessen was struck from naval register and converted into a target ship her armament was removed hull was lengthened and new machinery was installed longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments which brought number up to 15 from original 13 ship s superstructure was cut down nearly entirely hessen retained only a single funnel a tower foremast and two armored barbettes for main battery turrets her reciprocating machinery was replaced with steam turbines ship had a crew of 80 but could be operated by remote control when being used as a target work lasted from 11 april 1935 to 1 april 1937 beginning in april she conducted sea trials and on 12 july she was formally assigned to gunnery training unit in what had previously been renamed kriegsmarine first ship to use hessen as a target was light cruiser on 30 august that year hessen served in this capacity through world war ii on 31 march 1940 hessen acted as an icebreaker for auxiliary cruisers and on their trip from kiel to north sea she and her control ship ex
