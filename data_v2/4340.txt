hailed m i a as a musical super sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard bodied pop tracks bad girls come walk with me exodus that boil and steam most mutant genres into submission gavin haynes of nme wrote mia takes basic template of right now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time he continued beats are constantly morphing and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you likewise alexis petridis of guardian noted like woman who made it matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting if it s hard to take in anything other than small doses you can t help but be glad it exists however petridis also acknowledged abrasiveness of album s sonic scope more characteristic is an unyielding punishing rhythmic assault on which only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section he then goes on to admit that in a way that s highest compliment you can pay her a decade into her career mia still doesn t sound like anyone else other reviewers were more critical of album writing for pitchfork lindsay zoladz described title track as a re tread of m i a s earlier song bird flu and sexodus as cardboard stiff and said that album as a whole unlike her most potent releases sounds less interested in pushing and prodding culture forward and more content to soar safely above it a v clubs marah eakin characterised album as disjointed and said
