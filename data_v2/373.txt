eugene fitzherbert born horace later renamed flynn rider is a fictional character who appears in walt disney animation studios 50th animated feature film tangled its short film tangled ever after and 2017 television series tangled series character is voiced by american actor zachary levi who decided to audition for role upon learning that he would also be providing character s singing voice levi s duet with singer and co star mandy moore i see light would go on to become actor s first professionally recorded song and musical debut loosely based on prince in brothers grimm fairy tale rapunzel flynn is a wanted thief who seeks refuge in rapunzel s tower after stealing a crown blackmailed by rapunzel into taking her to see kingdom s floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday flynn undergoes a change of heart as he gradually begins to fall in love with rapunzel flynn was created by directors nathan greno and byron howard because they felt that incarcerated rapunzel needed someone to escort her out of tower he was conceived as a thief as opposed to a traditional prince in favor of making him a funnier and edgier character originally written as a british farmer flynn was ultimately developed into a swashbuckling thief inspired by fictional characters han solo and indiana jones and actors gene kelly and errol flynn flynn rider was named after latter flynn has divided film critics while some reviewers enjoyed character s refreshing humor rebelliousness and sarcasm in comparison to traditional disney princes others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious while panning his narration additionally flynn has also been strongly accused of being a marketing tool exploited by disney to attract a larger male audience to tangled however both character s romantic comedy esque relationship with rapunzel and levi s vocal performance have received widespread acclaim flynn is also considered to be among most appealing disney heroes by vanity fair e and cosmopolitan development conception filmmaker walt disney himself had first attempted to adapt brothers grimm fairy tale rapunzel into a feature length animated film during 1930s and 1940s however project was eventually abandoned because original fairy tale was considered too small when they were first approached to direct tangled in 2008 directors nathan greno and byron howard decided that it would be best to blow up scale of film and transform it into a big event while updating and modernizing story for a new audience flynn was conceived because directors felt that rapunzel needed to get out of tower so she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she s going in original fairy tale rapunzel s love interest is a prince however greno and howard decided to make him a thief dubbed a subtle yet startling twist for disney by new york times in order to avoid creating a character who is too safe opting for a funnier and edgier antihero instead greno elaborated when you look back at some of past disney princes a lot of them are kind of soft and they re not like people we think are that cool continuing they re good guys so i guess we sort of took that to other extreme however some of filmmakers themselves were concerned that flynn was becoming too edgy greno revealed that there were people who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors well it s not a prince it s a thief he s kind of a ladies man and he s very arrogant greno summarized flynn s conception and development to orange originally flynn was conceived as a british farmer named bastian until his voice actor was finally cast directors cited actors errol flynn and gene kelly and star wars character han solo among several individuals by whom flynn was inspired greno explained that having flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin especially in contrast to rapunzel who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower so she has a very limited world view and flynn could complement that as this worldly guy film s change in title from rapunzel to more gender neutral tangled is due in part to flynn s role and involvement first observing that disney tradition is to name movie after princess directors had initially thought that film would be structured like cinderella where there s cinderella and then a prince that pops into movie once in a while this changed however as flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character howard explained that when nathan and i figured out that this film was really about two characters flynn and rapunzel we knew that changing title would be a good idea meanwhile title tangled summarizes relationship between protagonists flynn and rapunzel and antagonist mother gothel additionally flynn also narrates film providing it with an ironic counterpoint according to children s literature and learner empowerment children and teenagers in english language education author janice bland as an example of first person voice over narration flynn s narration compels viewer to identify with flynn and rapunzel voice greno and howard were not particularly interested in casting solely a list actors as voices of main characters flynn and rapunzel instead directors simply searched for actors who had right voice for these characters writing for reelviews film critic james berardinelli felt that directors decision mirrored disney s approach during late 1980s and early 1990s when big name stars were often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents hundreds of actors and singers auditioned and were considered for role of rapunzel s love interest among them comedian dan fogler and american idol alum clay aiken however role of flynn rider was ultimately won by american actor zachary levi because he according to greno nailed his audition levi auditioned for role after he first received a telephone call from his agent informing him about film identifying himself as a huge disney nut levi was immediately sold on project his interest was further cemented by fact that he would also be providing character s singing voice additionally levi appears to have a history playing male characters who are surrounded by tough strong women required to audition a song in style of a singer songwriter levi decided to perform james taylor s sweet baby james for directors thumb flynn is voiced by american actor zachary levi whose academy award nominated duet with pop singer mandy moore i see light marked his musical debut when levi was first cast as voice of flynn character had been scripted as a british farmer at time requiring levi to voice him with a british accent until flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an american accent although flynn and rapunzel share several scenes together during film levi and singer mandy moore his co star who provides voice of rapunzel recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts which levi cited as one of challenges he endured while working on film in addition to having to star in television series chuck simultaneously levi s starring role on chuck required actor to constantly shed a character and take on another character and shed that character and then go back to something else however levi and moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet i see light levi was not intimidated by thought of recording song describing experience as an added bonus however he admitted to having been nervous to sing with moore a professional singer and working with composer alan menken although actor identifies himself as no stranger to singing due to his background in musical theatre levi s performance of i see light is considered to be his big singing debut because it was his first time recording a song professionally it took levi approximately one year to record all of his dialogue due in part to his busy schedule levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time recording each of his lines at least twice actor s voice ultimately helped shape and develop flynn s character howard explained he s so smart and clever and his adlibs are so great and you like him straight away he brings that to flynn on levi s own influence on his character actor explained that flynn s voice was really just a slight variation of his own wanting to sound more appropriate for film s medieval setting levi cleaned up his own diction and made things a little bit more polished referring to flynn s accent as mid atlantic describing tangled as a very family friendly version of romancing stone 1984 levi studied and channelled film s star american actor michael douglas and english legend robin hood however when levi heard his performance in its entirety for first time after film s release actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance explaining i felt like i sounded incredibly nasally and i was plugged up likening experience to hearing one s voice played back on an answering machine characterization design and analysis greno and howard wanted flynn to be funny and sarcastic as opposed to snarky one occasion in particular involved an animator having flynn respond to rapunzel s excitement by simply walking away from her in silence directors did not like this because according to greno flynn did this reaction where he treated her like she s nuts although both directors agreed that flynn s reaction was funny greno and howard wanted characters to connect emotionally during this scene screenwriter dan fogelman said that flynn is at his best when he s playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them likening him to english actor cary grant fogelman concluded at his heart he s really kind of a lost soul who doesn t quite know what he wants and who he is howard cited fictional characters ferris bueller and indiana jones as influences because these characters like flynn are skilled but have a human side to them flynn is considered an antihero because he is quick witted and agile stealing to survive and he is also extremely narcissistic originally character resembled a burlier leading man described by greno as a muscular commoner farm boy however directors had always envisioned flynn as a dashing thief to assist with development of flynn s design howard and greno held a large meeting with thirty of tangleds female employees calling it hot man meeting employees were encouraged to bring in pictures of their favorite hunky men hot man meeting was created because directors who found that they were very much impressed with rapunzel s design felt that flynn needed to be up to rapunzel s level greno described hot man meeting as crazy elaborating photos of all hottest men in hollywood were being thrown around a room photos being torn in half and pasted back together eyes were ripped from one picture and put on another heads were torn from photos concluding i ve never seen anything like it howard cited american actor clark gable and english footballer david beckham among several celebrities by whom flynn was influenced during meeting joking that employees eventually started using nathan and me as examples of what not to do defending flynn s personality levi explained that deep down flynn has a good core although that characteristic is brought out of him through purity love and naivete of rapunzel actor concluded that these are two very different characters that end up learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure according to colin covert of star tribune flynn teaches rapunzel about courage rob vaux of mania com described character s relationship with rapunzel as a partners in crime sort of chemistry filled with mischief and odd while establishing a rhythm wholly their own rapunzel eventually convinces flynn to go by his birth name eugene fitzherbert which conny described in her book how fairy tales live happily ever after analyzing art of adapting fairy tales as more humane stephen d of decent films guide called flynn a charismatic bad boy comparing him to sinbad from dreamworks sinbad legend of seven seas 2003 similarly new york times brooks barnes felt that making leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for disney and flynn is glib in a way that many people now associate with dreamworks on flynn s thievery entertainment weeklys lisa schwarzbaum determined that character only steals because he s basically a nice guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities according to tison pugh author of disney middle ages a fairy tale and fantasy past flynn amalgamates comedy action hero with swashbuckling romantic sensations of errol flynn layering them over a fairy tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine romantic nostalgia of film s setting while serving as a source of comic relief at times steve persall of tampa bay times believes that flynn carries most of film s modern humor likewise jennie punter of globe and mail described flynn as film s main source of action humour and eventually romance appearances flynn debuted in tangled 2010 as a sought after bandit who discovers refuge in rapunzel s secluded tower after stealing a crown there character is blackmailed by rapunzel who seizes crown in order to convince flynn to guide her to floating lanterns in time for her eighteenth birthday while mother gothel her vain controlling guardian is absent flynn is pursued by a police horse named maximus vengeful stabbington brothers two former accomplices of his and gothel who grows increasingly obsessed with retrieving rapunzel in order to continue using her hair to grant her eternal life meanwhile flynn falls in love with rapunzel and undergoes a change of heart only to be apprehended by stabbington brothers who hand him over to officials who sentence him to death maximus helps him escape and return to rapunzel s tower to rescue her however upon seeing rapunzel tied up and gagged gothel fatally stabs him rapunzel convinces gothel to let her use her hair to heal him promising to submit to her if she is allowed to heal him with her hair a dying flynn protests preferring to die than let rapunzel become a prisoner to gothel so he uses a shard of a shattered mirror to cut her hair which causes it to lose its power and turn brown causing gothel to age into dust flynn to his blood loss but is saved by leftover magic in one of rapunzel s tears by falling in love with rapunzel flynn undergoes a dramatic change of heart he stops thieving and returns to

georgie hobbs of little white lies lauded flynn as a hero invested with enough colour to liven up what could have been a monochromatic role margot harrison of seven days concluded that character is better than a prince meanwhile amy nicholson of inland empire weekly reviewed character as a significant improvement upon traditional disney heroes writing if anything tangled is one more step forward in disney s slow march to treat male suitors like equals from its early nameless princes to here a dude with a full on personality and nearly equal screen time tyler hanley of palo alto weekly observed that flynn talks in a laid back way that helps make his character both likable and relatable ian bunting of daily record concluded that although male characters sometimes get shortchanged in disney movies flynn is one of their better efforts to add to aladdin mowgli and beast virtually an equal amount of critics were less impressed with flynn anthony quinn of independent described character as a fop while tom huddleston of time out called him bland scotsman wrote it s a shame prominence of rapunzel s wayward love interest needlessly distracts from film michael phillips of

he talks out of side of his mouth makes him look like dick cheney at a poetry slam los angeles turan believes that film s initial shakiness is amplified by irritating and overly glib nature of flynn

described character s opening monologue as clunky william goss of moviefone compared flynn to a modern day chris evans pine type and his glib narration combined with a hasty prologue almost makes it feel like writer dan fogelman is trying too hard to make this a boys and girls club however goss relented voice over tapers off though and levi proves to be a suitably cocky foil to neurotic love interest meanwhile critics lauded character s relationship and chemistry with rapunzel enthusiastically likening it to that of a romantic comedy writing for mountain xpress ken hanke felt that what works best is interplay between two leads concluding these animated characters are frankly more believable and charismatic than human ones in love and other drugs sandie angulo chen of common sense
