biographer michael smith suggests that crean would have been a better choice for polar party than edgar evans who was weakened by a recent hand injury of which scott was unaware crean considered one of toughest men in expedition had led a pony across barrier and had thus been saved much of hard labour of man hauling smith p 161 scott s critical biographer roland huntford records that surgeon edward l atkinson who had accompanied southern party to top of beardmore had recommended either lashly or crean for polar party rather than edgar evans huntford last place on earth p 455 scott in his

endurance was beset in weddell sea pack ice in early efforts to free her crean narrowly escaped being crushed by a sudden movement in ice shackleton p 31 ship drifted in ice for months eventually sinking on 21 november shackleton informed men that they would drag food gear and three lifeboats across pack ice to snow hill or robertson island away because of uneven ice conditions pressure ridges and danger of ice breakup which could separate men they soon abandoned this plan men pitched camp and decided to wait they hoped that clockwise drift of pack would carry them to paulet island where they knew there was a hut with emergency supplies alexander p 98 but pack ice held firm as it carried men well past paulet island and did not break up until 9 april crew then had to sail and row three

four fittest men detailed by shackleton to find a safe camping ground shackleton p 147 shackleton decided that rather than waiting for a rescue ship that would probably never arrive one of lifeboats should be strengthened so that a crew could sail it to south georgia and arrange a rescue after party was settled on a penguin rookery above high water mark a group of men led by ship s carpenter harry mcnish began modifying one of lifeboats james caird in preparation for this journey which shackleton would lead frank wild who would be in command of party remaining on elephant island wanted

work james caird around coast but boat s rudder had broken off after their initial landing and some of party were in shackleton s view unfit for further travel three fittest men shackleton crean and worsley were decided to trek across island s glaciated surface in a hazardous 36 hour journey to nearest manned whaling station alexander p 156 this trek was first recorded crossing of mountainous island completed without tents sleeping bags or map their only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter s adze a length of alpine rope and screws from james caird hammered through their boots to serve

life crean remained an extremely modest man when he returned to kerry he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in antarctic indeed there is no reliable evidence of crean giving any interviews to press smith p 312 it has been speculated that this may have been because kerry was a hotbed of irish nationalism and later irish republicanism and along with county cork
