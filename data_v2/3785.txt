sir boyle roche 1st baronet october 1736 as cited in some sources including earlier versions of dictionary of national biography give date as 1743 however since later date would make roche rather young to have served with such distinction he would have been 15 at battle on snowshoes and already a lieutenant 16 at siege of quebec and 19 at capture of el morro earlier date seems more reasonable 5 june 1807 was an irish politician after a distinguished career in north america with british army roche became a member of irish house of commons in 1775 generally acting in support of viceregal government he is better remembered for language of his speeches than for his politics they were riddled with mixed metaphors mr speaker i smell a rat i see him forming in air and darkening sky but i ll nip him in bud malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity for what has posterity ever done for us roche may have been richard brinsley sheridan s model for mrs while arguing for a bill roche once said it would surely be better mr speaker to give up not only a part but if necessary even whole of our constitution to preserve remainder while these irish bulls have led many writers to portray roche as a buffoon other biographers have interpreted them not as blunders but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour roche ended his political career with passage of act of union 1800 which he supported he chose not to attempt to enter british house of commons and retired on a government pension until his death married but childless in 1807 life early life family background and military service boyle roche was born youngest of three sons to jordan roche and ellen white in

during battle on snowshoes near what is now lake george new york in march 1758 and later returned to his regiment it is possible that roche served with wolfe at siege of quebec in 1759 it is a certainty that he distinguished himself in 1762 during capture of el morro in havana by 1770 he had become a major in 28th foot he was knighted for his bravery at el morro in 1776 retiring from army he obtained an office in irish revenue department in 1775 in same year boyle roche entered irish house of commons as member of parliament mp for tralee a seat he held until 1776 although he was one of first volunteers to fight rebellious colonials in 1776 his contribution to that conflict was mainly in area of recruitment he successfully enlisted 500 volunteers in one weekend in limerick alone a feat which so gratified lord kenmare that he paid roche an additional bounty of half a guinea per man roche s flamboyant recruiting methods were described by edinburgh advertiser as follows yesterday major boyle roche representative in parliament for tralee who is raising a body of men for his majesty s service began recruiting here and met with great success which is not surprising if we consider his connexions and uncommon support he has received from noblemen and gentlemen of this province his method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed procession which was as follows major roche bearing a large purse of gold captain cowley a great number of likely recruits an elegant band of music consisting of french horns oboes and bassoons playing god save king a large brewer s dray with five barrels of beer horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with two with cockades to serve beer recruiting serjeant drums and fifes another division of recruits returning soldiers prodigious concourse of spectators following speech was made by major roche to populace being appointed through favour of our most excellent governor to raise a body of men for service of his majesty i think it a most happy circumstance of my life to be instrument of leading you to honour and renown laurels fought for and obtained in all parts of globe through war have procured us a fame so

honoured will you my dear countrymen permit those laurels to fade or those actions to be forgotten no forbid it heaven let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity and a confirmation of our loyalty a more critical period never presented itself nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to illustrious house of hanover than present

their preservation his sacred majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us and i hope your instinct prompts you to obey dictates of so grand a master let us then my brave and loyal countrymen join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in glorious cause of our creator our king and our country in dublin roche was a member of kildare street club thomas hay sweet escott club makers and club members 1913 pp 329 333 thumb 250px irish house of commons by francis wheatley 1780 member of parliament roche continued on in grattan parliament representing from 1777 to 1783 portarlington from 1784 to 1790 tralee again from 1790 to 1798 and old leighlin from 1798 until union with great britain in 1801 from beginning of his parliamentary career roche ranged himself on side of government and for his services he was granted a pension appointed chamberlain to viceregal court and on 30 november 1782 was created a baronet for office of chamberlain he was thought to be eminently qualified by his handsome figure graceful address and ready wit qualities which were set off by a frank open and manly disposition it was during this period in 1782 that roche coined term protestant ascendancy apparently members of cabinet wrote speeches for sir boyle which he somewhat imperfectly committed to memory in general mastering substance but frequently producing through his love of language and ornament travesties on original words through this he gained his lasting reputation as an inveterate perpetrator of irish bulls boyle s memory was indeed excellent on one occasion he illustrated both accuracy of his memory and audacity of his character at expense of a brother member edmond stanley anxious to produce an effect in an important debate had been at pains to reduce his speech to writing unluckily stanley happened to drop his manuscript in coffee room and walked back into house unconscious of his loss sir boyle finding document speedily mastered its contents and rising at first opportunity delivered speech almost verbatim in hearing of its dismayed and astonished author his apology afterward only added insult to injury on another occasion he amused and relieved house irritated by prospect of being obliged to listen to reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read documents simultaneously and thus dispose of business in a few minutes beyond these efforts he was also author of a bill to enact among other things that every quart bottle should contain a quart this is sometimes quoted as every pint bottle should contain a quart however older and more detailed sources such as give quart instead of pint substitution of pint appears to be an emendation of later authors determined to show roche to be a fool and possibly a drink loving fool at that volunteer convention right thumb 250px 4th viscount kenmare chief service boyle roche rendered his government was in connection with volunteer convention of november 1783 in which he acted a part only less remarkable than his immunity from opprobrium which might have been expected to attach to it question of admitting roman catholics to franchise was at time being agitated and found many warm supporters in convention proposal was extremely obnoxious to irish government and on second day of meeting secretary of state george ogle announced that roman catholics in person of lord kenmare had relinquished idea of making any claim further than religious liberty they then enjoyed and gave as his authority for this extraordinary statement sir boyle roche by whom it was confirmed ten days later lord kenmare who had not been in dublin at time denied that he had given least authority to any person to make any such statement in his name however his disavowal came too late anti catholic party in convention had found time to organize themselves and when intended reform bill took shape it was known that admission of roman catholics to franchise was not to form part of scheme several months later on valentine s day sir boyle explained himself in a public letter starting with a description of his alarm upon hearing that bishop of derry then frederick hervey and his associates were bent on extending legislative privilege i thought a crisis was arrived in which lord kenmare and heads of that body should step forth to disavow those wilde projects and to profess their attachment to lawful powers unfortunately his lordship was at a great distance and most of my other friends were out of way i therefore resolved on a bold stroke and authorized only by sentiments of persons in question took action he added that while he regretted that his message had been disowned by lord kenmare that was of less consequence since his manoeuvre had succeeded to admiration some believe that sir boyle who was related to lord kenmare and often represented his views in commons was also stating lord kenmare s true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge but in a way that provided kenmare plausible deniability sir boyle fought hard for union gentlemen may tither and tither and tither and may think it a bad measure but their heads at present are hot and will so remain till they grow cool again and so they can t decide right now but when day of judgement comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union for himself he declared that his love for england and ireland was so great that he would have two sisters embrace like one brother his life in politics those who placidly accept judgement that boyle roche was fool of grattan parliament should reflect on fact that for almost 25 years he served as gentleman usher and master of ceremonies to irish court an office for which a dignified and decorous demeanor is among chief essentials roche was also capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional once upon hearing his opponent john philpot curran expostulate that he could be guardian of his own honour sir boyle offered his congratulations to honourable member on his possession of a sinecure on another occasion when opposition tried to cough him down in a debate sir boyle met interruption by producing some bullets with observation i have here some excellent pills to cure a cough his personal courage being beyond dispute this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for remainder of his speech marriage retirement and death thumb 250px mary lady roche by gilbert stuart ca 1790 on 20 october 1778 boyle roche married mary frankland of great hall near thirsk yorkshire daughter of admiral sir thomas frankland bt whose family name goes back to time of william conqueror although childless boyle and lady mary appeared to have lived a life of uninterrupted happiness after union and dissolution of irish parliament boyle received a ps400 pension and in addition ps300 annually in his capacity as surveyor of kenmare river a post which had been invented as a reward and required no work thus provided for he was able to spend rest of his days in comfort boyle roche died at his house in 63 eccles street dublin on 5 june 1807 and was buried in st mary s church dublin on 9 june mary lived on until 1831 boyle roche s bird roche is perhaps best known for once excusing an absence in parliament thus mr speaker it is impossible i could have been in two places at once unless i were a bird this quotation was referenced by ambrose bierce in devil s dictionary in his definition of ubiquity in recent times ubiquity has not always been understood not even by sir boyle roche for example who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird but roche was not uttering a here he was quoting and quoting correctly line appears in s play devil of a wife as follows wife i cannot be in two places at once husband rowland surely no
