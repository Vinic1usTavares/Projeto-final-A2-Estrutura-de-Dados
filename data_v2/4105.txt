production development director christopher nolan conceived film in mid 1990s when he and his future wife emma thomas sailed across english channel following path of many small boats in dunkirk evacuation nolan considered improvising entire film instead of writing a script but thomas convinced him otherwise in 2015 nolan wrote a 76 page screenplay which was about half length of his usual scripts and his shortest to date its precise structure necessitated fictional characters rather than ones based on eyewitnesses story is told from three perspectives land one week of action sea one day of action and air one hour of action nolan structured film from point of view of characters intending to use visuals rather than dialogue and backstory he wanted to incorporate so called snowball effect that he had previously used only in third acts of his other films nolan said that he approached research as though it were for a documentary and was attracted to project because of its inversion of hollywood formula battle of dunkirk was not a victory and did not involve american armed forces but nevertheless demanded a large scale production to be put on screen nolan postponed dunkirk until he had acquired sufficient experience directing large scale action films to convey perspective of soldiers on beach for whom contact with enemy was extremely limited and intermittent he did not show germans on screen he omitted scenes with winston churchill and generals in war rooms as he did not want to get bogged down in politics of situation nolan showed key members of crew eleven films that had inspired him all quiet on western front 1930 wages of fear 1953 alien 1979 speed 1994 unstoppable 2010 greed 1924 sunrise 1927 ryan s daughter 1970 battle of algiers 1966 chariots of fire 1981 and foreign correspondent 1940 only two of which are war films historical consultant was author joshua levine who also wrote book adaptation dunkirk history behind major motion picture levine accompanied nolan while interviewing veterans during these interviews nolan was told a story of soldiers seen walking into sea in desperation which he incorporated into screenplay production team and scouting locations were chosen before nolan and thomas solicited warner bros pictures to make film nolan and his production designer nathan crowley toured beach of dunkirk while location scouting and decided to film there despite logistical challenges discarding suffolk as an alternative crowley set up a makeshift art department in nolan s old garage as is tradition and colourised black and white photographs to better understand visual representation design aesthetic was made to look as contemporary as possible hoyte van hoytema who had previously collaborated with nolan on interstellar was chosen as director of photography hollywood reporter stated that nolan made a deal with warner bros to receive a 20 million salary plus 20 of box office gross however vanity fair reported that nolan agreed to receive a low upfront salary in exchange for a large backend percentage pre production began in january 2016 for uniforms costume designer jeffrey kurland aimed to balance historical accuracy with aesthetics that would favour film stock as original heavy wool fabric had not been produced since 1940 it was made from scratch tailored for main cast and over a thousand extras uniforms were made in a factory in pakistan and boots by a shoemaker in mexico costume department then spent three weeks ageing them at longcross studios each garment was made to look distinct in regiment and personality tommy wears a large greatcoat while alex dons highlander cut kurland found references at museums in contemporary magazines photo archives and books mole was rebuilt over four months from original blueprints sand was brought from dunkirk to create make up consistent with environment oil and tar were specially made and prosthetics were water and fire resistant casting after first hand accounts of evacuation revealed how young and inexperienced soldiers had been nolan decided to cast young and unknown actors for beach setting he was also adamant that all of cast be british john and toby whale were casting directors for dunkirk tom hardy kenneth branagh and mark rylance were in talks to join ensemble as supporting characters in late 2015 fionn whitehead was cast as lead in march 2016 while jack lowden aneurin barnard and harry styles were added shortly after cillian murphy joined following month james d arcy barry keoghan and tom glynn

styles was cast for his old fashioned face as stated by nolan he won role after auditioning against hundreds of candidates when nolan was unaware of his renown as a singer murphy spoke to nolan and read about psychological trauma soldiers endured to understand his character s ptsd nolan chose rylance for his work in theatre and performance in wolf hall as research rylance piloted his character s boat every day listened to audio recordings at imperial war museum and read accounts of men like mr dawson between takes he encouraged rehearsal through improvised scenes which nolan said deepened characterizations principal cast members did their own stunts john nolan uncle of christopher played blind man filming thumb right moonstone during filming with nolan rylance glynn carney and keoghan on board principal photography commenced on 23 may 2016 in dunkirk planned so as to avoid bastille day and coincide with dates of real evacuation production continued for four weeks in netherlands one

dunkirk during filming filming in dunkirk took place at location of real evacuation while street scenes were shot in nearby malo les bains because most of buildings in dunkirk were destroyed in war shooting times on beach and mole were determined by tidal patterns french labour strikes and working time regulations also affected schedule to minimise need for computer generated imagery cgi cardboard cut out props of soldiers and military vehicles created illusion of a large army real or scale model fighter aircraft and real warships and private boats provided realism that could not be achieved from cgi scale models were created via 3d printing mole set was frequently rebuilt after being damaged by bad weather because french authorities had prohibited pyrotechnic charges to protect marine life air cannons were used instead six thousand extras were needed in france early scenes of film were shot at weymouth harbour and final scenes at swanage railway station universal pictures

were filmed crashing into english channel real spitfires were provided by imperial war museum duxford and owner dan friedkin piloted one that was shot landing on beach in dunkirk these takes had to be done within forty five minutes before tide came back in imax cameras were attached to fighter planes using specially made snorkel and periscope lenses in back and front and large scale mockups were submerged with cable rigs for a crash scene scroggins aviation and uk performed period aviation reconstruction a piper enabled filming from air also with imax cameras front and rear dogfights over channel were shot by an aerial unit based at lee on solent airfield hardy and lowden spent final stages of shooting schedule on a cliffside in palos verdes inside purpose built cockpit gimbals with limited contact with rest of cast and crew principal photography ended on 2 september 2016 after sixty eight days film was shot in natural lighting using both imax 65 mm and 65 mm large format film stock in panavision system 65 with more imax footage than in any of nolan s previous films an estimated seventy five percent sparsity of dialogue made it possible for imax cameras which are notoriously noisy to be used as primary format panavision and imax lenses enabled filming at night for first time in a feature film imax cameras were used hand held which steven spielberg and ron howard advised as best way to shoot on vessels post production nolan s regular collaborator lee smith returned to edit dunkirk beginning in september 2016 after smith had assembled shots unsupervised while filming was still in progress editing took place in los angeles with an audio mixing team of eight people nolan said you stop seeing wood for trees and singled out editing of aerial sequences as a particular challenge likening this to a chess game limited computer generated imagery was applied to improve some scenes but none consisted entirely of cgi weather continuity presented less of a challenge than was expected with filming both in europe and california at least ten to fifteen feature length versions were cut to further refine dramatic impact once a cut was completed only then did they apply music post production had fifty four hours of raw footage to work with only usable sounds from production recordings were voices everything else was recreated sound designer richard king sent two sound mixers to audio record spitfires at imperial war museum duxford using twenty four microphones unable to find an actual dive siren of a stuka dive bomber king reverse engineered one from old photographs in an attempt to replicate sound for scenes in which ships gave out sounds of people in distress voices were captured using an adr loop group c 4 and liquid propane were blown up to record sound for explosions also featured were whistles attributed to german bombs during second world war bomb noises were made to increase in pitch closer they got to impact to stay true to reality double negative undertook visual effects work while which assisted as production s film laboratory also handled release prints music hans zimmer began working on score in 2016 continued for eleven months and eventually created a 100 minute demo for intensity script was written to accommodate auditory illusion of a shepard tone which had previously been explored in nolan s 2006 film prestige this was coupled with sound of nolan s own pocket watch which he recorded and sent to zimmer to be synthesised additional music was provided by lorne balfe andrew kawczynski steve and benjamin nimrod from edward elgar s enigma variations is part of theme which was slowed down to six beats per minute with added bass notes to avoid it sounding sentimental instrumentation included a double bass and fourteen cellos played in high register king relayed to zimmer sound of a boat engine which served as a reference for tempo zimmer visited dunkirk set for inspiration taking back a jar of sand and

historical evacuation it accurately depicts a few royal air force planes dogfighting luftwaffe over sea limited to one hour of operation by their fuel capacity in 1940 destroyers and fighter planes were indeed held back from battle as royal navy and air force would have been sole defenders against invasion also noted were accurate depictions of how a small boat attempted to evade aerial attack and of how soldiers returning to england saw a civilian population largely unaware of or unaffected by war british officers did initially refuse to evacuate french soldiers although churchill later insisted that french be evacuated alongside british realism of film was acknowledged by dunkirk veterans although branagh said that some thought it was louder than battle thumb 200px hispano buchon masquerading as a bf 109e wearing a temporary paint scheme for film although some events are based on true history characters and storyline are fictional branagh s role is a composite character when beach scenes were shot weather was worse than during real evacuation nolan explained that this helped to understand danger faced by pleasure boats in one scene an officer gives a salute without wearing his military beret which a veteran pointed out as inaccurate protocol to differentiate german planes their noses were painted yellow this was not actually done until a month after dunkirk involvement of french african and indian soldiers was either limited or left out contemporary shots were used for aerial views of town whereas dunkirk was in ruins by time of evacuation design of
