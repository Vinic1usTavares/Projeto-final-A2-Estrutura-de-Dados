a9 motorway is a north south motorway in croatia with a length of beginning in pula largest city on istrian peninsula it runs north to croatian motorway and expressway network at kanfanar interchange here it meets a8 motorway forming istrian y road system a9 continues north from here to kastel and plovanija border crossings into slovenia motorway represents a significant north south transportation corridor in croatia and is a part of european route e751 motorway s national significance is reflected in positive economic impact on cities and towns it connects as well as its importance to tourism in croatia importance of motorway for tourism is particularly high during summer tourist seasons when traffic volume increases by more than 80 a9 motorway construction works began in 1988 with its first section opening in 1991 second one following next year and extending completed route to just lack of funding caused delays in further development and in 1995 bina istra was awarded a 32 year build operate transfer concession to develop istrian y including a9 construction soon resumed and by 2006 entire route was completed as a two lane expressway with grade separated intersections in 2008 further construction works were initiated aimed at upgrading newly built road to a six lane motorway by june 2011 entire a9 route was brought up to motorway standard except for mirna bridge and limska draga viaduct motorway is planned to connect to slovenian h5 expressway motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation except at two bridges all intersections of a9 motorway are grade separated and as of september 2011 there are 10 exits and 6 rest areas along route since motorway is tolled using a ticket system each exit includes a toll plaza and a9 motorway and a8 motorway have an integrated toll system in place route description alt a view of motorway bridge from pavement level thumb 250px left approach to mirna

traffic as it runs along adriatic sea coast linking a large number of tourist resorts motorway runs for between border crossing access roundabout junction of d200 and d510 state roads at its northern end and d66 state road serving pula and pula airport at its southern end route connects towns and resorts in western southern and central parts of istria through a total of 9 interchanges and state road network acting as feeder roads route largely runs about inland relative to west coast of istria serving a number of tourist resorts such as and umag via eponymous interchange with and county roads and novigrad via there is also an alternate southern link to umag via state road this part of route generally follows a north south path as it approaches mirna river after crossing river route turns southeast towards visnjan thereafter a9 route resumes original north south orientation to baderna interchange with road serving porec and medaki interchange with d21 road d21 runs generally parallel to a9 and it is accessible from all a9 interchanges directly or through short connectors from there route again turns to southeast to cross lim valley after crossing valley which is spanned by limska draga viaduct it reaches kanfanar interchange interchange is a junction of a9 and a8 routes forming istrian y system while providing access to rovinj via d303 road between kanfanar and pula

motorway has ten interchanges in addition to roundabout at northern terminus providing access to numerous towns and cities and croatian state road network an automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along motorway it consists of measuring control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary such as at interchanges viaducts bridges and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions possible restrictions and other information to motorway users a9 motorway mainly runs through coastal plains and rolling hills of istria although northern part of route traverses two large valleys requiring two large structures mirna bridge and limska draga viaduct to carry route

modern road between istria peninsula and rest of croatia subsequently municipalities in istria started a public loan to fund construction of ucka tunnel which started in 1976 works were completed in 1981 and also included construction of a long two lane expressway section between matulji and y shape formed by a9 motorway and a8 expressway was originally defined by rijeka and istria spatial planning documents and later incorporated in spatial planning documents of republic of croatia in 1988 defining kanfanar interchange as a junction between a9 and a8 routes first section of a9 to be built was a section between medaki and kanfanar its construction started in 1988 and was completed in 1991 including viaduct across lim valley section between buje and nova vas was built between 1990 and 1992 between 1997 and 1999 all sections between medaki and vodnjan were completed construction works on section between umag and medaki started in 2003 and were completed by 2005 finally construction of southernmost section between vodnjan and pula started in 2005 and was completed by end of 2006 marking completion of istrian y as a two lane expressway with grade separated intersections upgrading expressway to a four lane motorway started on october 6 2008 upgrade was scheduled to take place in two stages designated by bina istra as 2a and 2b 2a stage entailed

section of road and a completed tube of ucka tunnel concession agreement also mandated construction maintenance and management of roads and their upgrade to motorway standards dual carriageway when annual average daily traffic aadt reaches 10 000 vehicles or when average summer daily traffic reaches 16 000 vehicles latter was achieved in 2005 and motorway upgrade works started in 2008 even
