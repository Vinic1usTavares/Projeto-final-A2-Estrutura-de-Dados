game named final fantasy trading card game is produced by square enix and hobby japan first released japan in 2012 with an english version in 2016 game has been compared to magic gathering and a tournament circuit for game also takes place common elements although most final fantasy installments are independent many gameplay elements recur throughout series most games contain elements of fantasy and science fiction and feature recycled names often inspired from various cultures history languages and mythology including asian european and middle eastern examples include weapon names like excalibur and masamune derived from arthurian legend and japanese masamune respectively as well as spell names holy meteor and ultima beginning with final fantasy iv main series adopted its current logo style that features same typeface and an emblem designed by japanese artist yoshitaka amano emblem relates to a game s plot and typically portrays a character or object in story subsequent remakes of first three games have replaced previous logos with ones similar to rest of series plot and themes thumb final fantasy v is typical of earlier games in series in that heroes must attempt to retrieve crystals to save world from an ancient evil central conflict in many final fantasy games focuses on a group of characters battling an evil and sometimes ancient antagonist that dominates game s world stories frequently involve a sovereign state in rebellion with protagonists taking part in rebellion heroes are often destined to defeat evil and occasionally gather as a direct result of antagonist s malicious actions another staple of series is existence of two villains main villain is not always who it appears to be as primary antagonist may actually be subservient to another character or entity main antagonist introduced at beginning of game is not always final enemy and characters must continue their quest beyond what appears to be final fight stories in series frequently emphasize internal struggles passions and tragedies of characters and main plot often recedes into background as focus shifts to their personal lives games also explore relationships between characters ranging from love to rivalry other recurring situations that drive plot include amnesia a hero corrupted by an evil force mistaken identity and self sacrifice magical orbs and crystals are recurring in game items that are frequently connected to themes of games plots crystals often play a central role in creation of world and a majority of final fantasy games link crystals and orbs to planet s life force as such control over these crystals drives main conflict classical elements are also a recurring theme in series related to heroes villains and items other common plot and setting themes include gaia hypothesis an apocalypse and conflicts between advanced technology and nature characters series features a number of recurring character archetypes most famously every game since final fantasy ii including subsequent remakes of original final fantasy features a character named cid cid s appearance personality goals and role in game non playable ally party member villain vary dramatically however two characteristics many versions of cid have in common are 1 being a scientist or engineer and 2 being tied in some way to an airship party eventually acquires every cid has at least one of these two traits biggs and wedge inspired by two star wars characters of same name appear in numerous games as minor characters sometimes as comic relief later games in series feature several males with effeminate characteristics recurring creatures include chocobos and moogles chocobos are large often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long distance travel for characters moogles on other hand are white stout creatures resembling teddy bears with wings and a single antenna they serve different capacities in games including mail delivery party members and saving game chocobo and moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate games final fantasy is also well known for its enemy monsters and creatures gameplay in final fantasy games players command a party of characters as they progress through game s story by exploring game world and defeating opponents enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring a trend which changed in final fantasy xi and final fantasy xii player issues combat orders like fight magic and item to individual characters via a menu driven interface while engaging in battles throughout series games have used different battle systems prior to final fantasy xi battles were turn based with protagonists and antagonists on different sides of battlefield final fantasy iv introduced active time battle atb system that augmented turn based nature with a perpetual time keeping system designed by hiroyuki ito it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring player to act before an enemy attacks and was used until final fantasy x which implemented conditional turn based ctb system this new system returned to previous turn based system but added nuances to offer players more challenge final fantasy xi adopted a real time battle system where characters continuously act depending on issued command final fantasy xii continued this gameplay with active dimension battle system final fantasy xiiis combat system designed by same man who worked on x was meant to have an action oriented feel emulating cinematic battles in final fantasy vii advent children latest installment to franchise final fantasy xv introduces a new open combat system unlike previous battle systems in franchise open combat system ocs allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario allowing for free range attacks and movement giving a much more fluid feel of combat this system also incorporates a tactical option during battle which pauses active battle to allow use of items like most rpgs final fantasy installments use an experience level system for character advancement in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies character classes specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters are another recurring theme introduced in first game character classes have been used differently in each game some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into story while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout game though used heavily in many games such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile characters still match an archetype but are able to learn skills outside their class magic is another common rpg element in series method by which characters gain magic varies between installments but is generally divided into classes organized by color white magic which focuses on spells that assist teammates black magic which focuses on harming enemies red magic which is a combination of white and black magic blue magic which mimics enemy attacks and green magic which focuses on applying status effects to either allies or enemies other types of magic frequently appear such as time magic focusing on themes of time space and gravity and summoning magic which evokes legendary creatures to aid in battle and is a feature that has persisted since final fantasy iii summoned creatures are often referred to by names like espers or and have been inspired by mythologies from arabic hindu norse and greek cultures different means of transportation have appeared through series most common is airship for long range travel accompanied by chocobos for travelling short distances but others include sea and land vessels following final fantasy vii more modern and futuristic vehicle designs have been included development and history origin thumb hironobu sakaguchi creator of final fantasy series alt a man sitting in a chair and speaking in a microphone in mid 1980s square entered japanese video game industry with simple rpgs racing games and platformers for nintendo s famicom disk system in 1987 square designer hironobu sakaguchi chose to create a new fantasy role playing game for cartridge based nes and drew inspiration from popular fantasy games enix s dragon quest nintendo s legend of zelda and origin systems s ultima series though often attributed to company allegedly facing bankruptcy sakaguchi explained that game was his personal last ditch effort in game industry and that its title final fantasy stemmed from his feelings at time had game not sold well he would have quit business and gone back to university despite his explanation publications have also attributed name to company s hopes that project would solve its financial troubles in 2015 sakaguchi explained name s origin team wanted a title that would abbreviate to ff which would sound good in japanese name was originally going to be fighting fantasy but due to concerns over trademark conflicts with roleplaying gamebook series of same name they needed to settle for something else as word final was a famous word in japan sakaguchi settled on that according to sakaguchi any title that created ff abbreviation would have done game indeed reversed square s lagging fortunes and it became company s flagship franchise following success square immediately developed a second installment because sakaguchi assumed final fantasy would be a stand alone game its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor while some of gameplay elements such as character advancement system were overhauled this approach has continued throughout series each major final fantasy game features a new setting a new cast of characters and an upgraded battle system video game writer john harris attributed concept of reworking game system of each installment to nihon falcom s dragon slayer series with which square was previously involved as a publisher company regularly released new games in main series however time between releases of final fantasy xi 2002 final fantasy xii 2006 and final fantasy xiii 2009 were much longer than previous games following final fantasy xiv square enix stated that it intended to release final fantasy games either annually or biennially this switch was to mimic development cycles of western games in call of duty assassin s creed and battlefield series as well as maintain fan interest design for original final fantasy sakaguchi required a larger production team than square s previous games he began crafting game s story while experimenting with gameplay ideas once gameplay system and game world size were established sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into available resources a different approach has been taken for subsequent games story is completed first and game built around it designers have never been restricted by consistency though most feel each game should have a minimum number of common elements development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each game and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out as a base for entire structures first five games were directed by sakaguchi who also provided original concepts he drew inspiration for game elements from anime films by hayao miyazaki series staples like airships and chocobos are inspired by elements in castle in sky and nausicaa of valley of wind respectively sakaguchi served as a producer for subsequent games until he left square in 2001 yoshinori kitase took over directing games until final fantasy viii and has been followed by a new director for each new game hiroyuki ito designed several gameplay systems including final fantasy vs job system final fantasy viiis junction system and active time battle concept which was used from final fantasy iv until final fantasy ix in designing active time battle system ito drew inspiration from formula one racing he thought it would be interesting if character types had different speeds after watching race cars pass each other ito also co directed final fantasy vi with kitase kenji terada was scenario writer for first three games kitase took over as scenario writer for final fantasy v through final fantasy vii kazushige nojima became series primary scenario writer from final fantasy vii until his resignation in october 2003 he has since formed his own company nojima partially or completely wrote stories for final fantasy vii final fantasy viii final fantasy x and final fantasy x 2 he also worked as scenario writer for spin off series kingdom hearts daisuke watanabe co wrote scenarios for final fantasy x and xii and was main writer for xiii games thumb upright final fantasy vi artwork by yoshitaka amano who provided designs for much of series artistic design including character and monster creations was handled by japanese artist yoshitaka amano from final fantasy through final fantasy vi amano also handled title logo designs for all of main series and image illustrations from final fantasy vii onward tetsuya nomura was chosen to replace amano because nomura s designs were more adaptable to 3d graphics he worked with series from final fantasy vii through final fantasy x for final fantasy ix however character designs were handled by shuko murase toshiyuki itahana and shin nagasawa nomura is also character designer of kingdom hearts series compilation of final fantasy vii and fabula nova crystallis final fantasy other designers include mihara and akihiko yoshida mihara was character designer for final fantasy xi and yoshida served as character designer for final fantasy tactics square produced vagrant story and final fantasy xii graphics and technology because of graphical limitations first games on nes feature small sprite representations of leading party members on main world screen battle screens use more detailed full versions of characters in a side view perspective this practice was used until final fantasy vi which uses detailed versions for both screens nes sprites are 26 pixels high and use a color palette of 4 colors 6 frames of animation are used to depict different character statuses like healthy and fatigued snes installments use updated graphics and effects as well as higher quality audio than in previous games but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design snes sprites are 2 pixels shorter but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames 11 colors and 40 frames respectively upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions first game includes non player characters npcs player could interact with but they are mostly static in game objects beginning with second game square used predetermined pathways for npcs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama in 1995 square showed an interactive sgi technical demonstration of final fantasy vi for then next generation of consoles demonstration used silicon graphics s prototype nintendo 64 workstations to create 3d graphics fans believed demo was of a new final fantasy game for nintendo 64 console however 1997 saw release of final fantasy vii for sony playstation switch was due to a dispute with nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges as opposed to slower and cheaper but much higher capacity compact discs used on rival systems final fantasy vii introduced 3d graphics with fully pre rendered backgrounds it was because of this switch to 3d that a cd rom format was chosen over a cartridge format switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of creative staff for final fantasy vii and subsequent 3d games in series thumb left final fantasy viii along with vii and ix used pre rendered backgrounds starting with final fantasy viii series adopted a more photo realistic look like final fantasy vii full motion video fmv sequences would have video playing in background with polygonal characters composited on top final fantasy ix returned to more stylized design of earlier games in series although it still maintained and in many cases slightly upgraded most of graphical techniques used in previous two games final fantasy x was released on playstation 2 and used more powerful hardware to render graphics in real time instead of using pre rendered material to obtain a more dynamic look game features full 3d environments rather than have 3d character models move about pre rendered backgrounds it is also first final fantasy game to introduce voice acting occurring throughout majority of game even with many minor characters this aspect added a whole new dimension of depth to character s reactions emotions and development taking a temporary divergence final fantasy xi used playstation 2 s online capabilities as an mmorpg initially released for playstation 2 with a pc port arriving six months later final fantasy xi was also released on xbox 360 nearly four years after its original release in japan this was first final fantasy game to use a free rotating camera final fantasy xii was released in 2006 for playstation 2 and uses only half as many polygons as final fantasy x in exchange for more advanced textures and lighting it also retains freely rotating camera from final fantasy xi final fantasy xiii and final fantasy xiv both make use of crystal tools a middleware engine developed by square enix music thumb upright nobuo uematsu composer of most of final fantasy soundtracks final fantasy games feature a variety of music and frequently reuse themes most of games open with a piece called prelude which has evolved from a simple 2 voice arpeggio in early games to a complex melodic arrangement in recent installments victories in combat are often accompanied by a victory fanfare a theme that has become one of most recognized pieces of music in series basic theme that accompanies chocobo appearances has been rearranged in a different musical style for each installment a piece called prologue and sometimes final fantasy originally featured in first game is often played during ending credits although leitmotifs are common in more character driven installments theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements nobuo uematsu was chief music composer of final fantasy series until his resignation from square enix in november 2004 other composers include masashi hamauzu hitoshi sakimoto and junya nakano uematsu was allowed to create much of music with little direction from production staff sakaguchi however would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring different areas of game world once a game s major scenarios were completed uematsu would begin writing music based on story characters and accompanying artwork he started with a game s main theme and developed other pieces to match its style in creating character themes uematsu read game s scenario to determine characters personality he would also ask scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about technical limitations were prevalent in earlier games sakaguchi would sometimes instruct uematsu to only use specific notes it was not until final fantasy iv on snes that uematsu was able to add more subtlety to music reception overall final fantasy series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful though each installment has seen different levels of success series has seen a steady increase in total sales it sold over 10 million units worldwide by early 1996 45 million by august 2003 63 million by december 2005 and 85 million
