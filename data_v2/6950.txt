yucamane or is an andesitic stratovolcano in tacna region of southern peru it is part of peruvian segment of central volcanic zone one of three volcanic belts of andes generated by subduction of nazca plate beneath south america plate peru s active volcanoes ubinas sabancaya and el misti are also part of central volcanic zone yucamane together with volcanoes yucamane chico and calientes farther north forms a pleistocene volcanic group yucamane is constructed mainly by lava flows with subordinate pyroclastic deposits and it has a well preserved summit crater with fumarolic activity volcanic group was active in pleistocene epoch with several explosive eruptions occurring during holocene epoch at yucamane proper last dated eruption of yucamane occurred 1 320 bce whether there were historical eruptions is unclear as some eruptions attributed to yucamane probably took place at tutupaca geography and geomorphology yucamane lies in tacna region candarave province candarave district of peru west of lake vilacota town of candarave lies southwest from volcano and city of tacna south a number of mostly agricultural towns exist on its slopes such as aricota tarata and yucamane pampa as well as irrigation infrastructure and major roads sulfur was mined on volcano in past area of yucamane is accessible by a number of roads including international ilo highway and a road leads up northwestern flank of yucamane to a point close to mountain pass between yucamane and calientes edifice of volcano and surrounding region are part of vilacota maure protected area regional andes are longest mountain range on earth extending from tierra del fuego archipelago in southernmost south america to venezuela in north in southern peru andes consist of several mountain chains including western cordillera and eastern cordillera with elevations of up to which are separated from each other by altiplano more than 2 000 volcanoes exist in andes mainly in countries of argentina bolivia chile colombia ecuador and peru among these is nevado del ruiz which erupted in 1985 in colombia seven volcanoes have been active in peru since arrival of spaniards but volcanic activity is typically poorly recorded in peru owing to remote nature of region and scarce population yucamane is part of central volcanic zone one of three major volcanic belts in andes which spans countries of peru bolivia chile and argentina in peru about four hundred heavily eroded volcanoes make up volcanically active area along with active volcanoes el misti sabancaya and ubinas volcanoes andagua volcanic field casiri chachani coropuna firura huaynaputina tutupaca and yucamane may have been active in recent history largest historical eruption in peru occurred in 1600 at huaynaputina and caused 1 500 fatalities and severe economic damage another major eruption occurred 2 000 years before present at el misti volcano finally three volcanoes ampato chachani and coropuna have heights exceeding local yucamane is a mountain whose height is variously given as or it is a high compound volcano with an about wide summit crater this depression in turn has a smaller crater with a diameter of nested within summit crater has a young appearance and due to youth of volcano there is little trace of glaciation yucamane has a conical shape and is formed primarily by lava flows with some block and ash flows and pyroclastic flows lava flows are thick and often show characteristic flow ridges they are especially prevalent on upper western and upper southern flanks of volcano while eastern flank has a higher proportion of pyroclastic flows as does far southern flank based on slope angle a yucamane i volcano which forms lower part of volcano and has a more gentle slope has been distinguished from a yucamane ii which sits atop yucamane i and has steeper slopes on southeastern flank a secondary volcanic centre high mal paso can be found this cone is wide and has a partially destroyed crater several other volcanoes lie north of yucamane such as or high yucamane chico and or high calientes which form a long north south volcanic chain with yucamane other volcanoes in area include san pedro and much older nazaparco nazaparco consists of andesitic rocks and rhyolitic block and ash flows while yucamane chico and calientes are surrounded by radially extending lava flows like yucamane proper calientes have a degraded summit crater these older volcanoes are eroded and show evidence of sector collapses and glaciation which has left moraines at elevations of about this volcanic complex is part of cordillera del barroso mountain chain in southern peru yucamane fault runs in a north south direction across volcanoes and another fault that runs northwest southeast is named yucamane chico fault yucamane chico volcano roughly coincides with intersection of these faults hydrology slopes of volcano drain westward eastward and southward towards calientes and rivers in east and west of yucamane respectively both rivers flow southward and ultimately join to form river which ends in pacific ocean water in these rivers contains large quantities of arsenic derived from volcanic rocks including yucamane s volcanic rocks arsenic in drinking water is linked to internal organ damage and cancer geology off western coast of south america nazca plate subducts beneath south america plate at a rate of about this subduction process is responsible for volcanic activity in andes subducting slab releases fluids which induce formation of melts which are then erupted on surface as volcanism subduction process is not uniform along plate margin variations in dip of subducting nazca plate occur along its length and volcanic activity is concentrated in three belts northern volcanic zone central volcanic zone and southern volcanic zone where angle of subduction is steep enough volcanism in region has been active since jurassic with remnants of oldest volcanic arc recognizable in peruvian coastal cordillera during miocene epoch volcanic activity occurred along entire length of peru pliocene pleistocene activity on other hand is confined to southern peru as part of central volcanic zone with volcanic centres concentrated in western cordillera volcanoes in peru were first catalogued in 1962 and 1966 with a major compilation being published in 1991 by de silva and francis these volcanoes include composite volcanoes ignimbrites lava domes and lava flow fields yucamane is constructed on a basement formed by paleozoic tacaza group lavas of lower tacaza formation jurassic yura group sediments of formation and neogene volcanic huaylillas formation parts of this basement crop out on southern side of yucamane this basement in turn consists of two major tectonic blocks southern arequipa terrane and northern paracas massif both are formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and are covered by mesozoic sedimentary and cenozoic volcanic rocks petrology yucamane has erupted andesite basaltic andesite trachyandesite and dacite which define a potassium rich calc alkaline suite andesites make up bulk of outcropping edifice these andesitic rocks contain phenocrysts of amphibole biotite hornblende oxides plagioclase and quartz climate and natural features region has a dry tropical climate with precipitation on yucamane amounting to about most of it falls during summer months and amount of precipitation decreases southwestward towards coast and away from mountains after precipitation events mountain is sometimes covered with snow average temperatures in region vary between throughout year vegetation around volcano includes a humid tundra with overall low vegetation density on its upper slopes and paramo and montane steppe vegetation east west and south of volcano on its lower slopes respectively woods have been observed on its flanks which are otherwise covered by pastures lower on volcano scorpion species ninapo is named after volcano term ninapo is a portmanteau of quechua word for fire spitting mountain this scorpion was discovered on sides of volcanoes yucamane and el misti eruptive history yucamane chico and calientes are of possibly pre pleistocene epoch age while yucamane is younger activity of calientes and yucamane however overlapped in time and both have generated lava flows which lie above moraines nazaparco was dated to 6 23 0 1 million years ago while dates of 540 000 270 000 and 126 000 3 000 before present on an older stage are reported for caliente yucamane itself has lava flows dated at 380 000 300 000 23 000 1 000 and 3 000 2 000 years before present tephrochronology has shown occurrence of an eruption 44 000 2 130 2 910 years ago another one occurred 36 450 250 years ago and generated a lateral blast yet another event occurred 3 270 50 3 085 35 years before present during course of this eruption yucamane expelled at least of material in form of pumice lapilli and tephra this eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 5 fallout deposits reached quelccaya ice cap and influenced chemistry of lakes close to ice cap activity during late pleistocene and holocene epochs was mainly explosive with vulcanian eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions among others which generated volcanic ash falls block and ash flows pyroclastic flows and pyroclastic surges in total about 4 5 explosive eruptions occurred in post glacial time and left tephra deposits over southern and southeastern flanks of edifice historical activity eruptions reported in 1787 1802 1862 and 1902 in region have also been attributed to yucamane although some may actually have occurred at tutupaca 1787 and 1902 events involved emission of ash an 1874 edition of arequipa based el newspaper states that yucamane was bursting and steaming in 1787 there does not appear to be any volcanic material more recent than 3 270 50 3 085 35 eruption however overall historical records are fragmentary and scarce and global volcanism program recognizes 1 320 bce eruption as most recent event yucamane is fumarolically active in its summit crater fumaroles are most recognizable after precipitation and are not very intense presently yucamane is considered to be a dormant volcano thermal anomalies of about of uncertain origin have been observed on yucamane by satellite imagery caliente geothermal field east of yucamane which includes geysers and hot springs appears to be unrelated to yucamane hazards peruvian geological agency ingemmet has published ash fall lava flow and pyroclastic flow hazard maps for yucamane and additional hazard maps are available on its website according to these western eastern and southern flanks could be threatened by lava flows whereas older volcanoes protect much of northern flank hazards from pyroclastic flows extend farther down to laguna aricota lake southwest of volcano hazards from lava flows derive from their ability to bury land and to ignite flammable materials as well as possible creation of lava dams on rivers and outburst floods when they break while high speed and temperatures of pyroclastic flows threatens people with asphyxiation burial and burns more than 9 000 people live in danger zone ash fall from an eruption could extend southeastward to border with chile and affect towns of candarave and tarata volcanic earthquakes like 1999 ticsani earthquakes at a volcano farther north and volcanic gases constitute additional dangers see also notes references sources category stratovolcanoes of peru category mountains of tacna region
