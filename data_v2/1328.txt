shin megami tensei as a chance to develop a game with company s brand on it main staff included director yosuke niino producer hideyuki yokoyama programmer and future megami tensei director kouji okada writers ryutaro ito and suzuki and composer tsukasa masuko kazuma kaneko worked on multiple aspects of game including character and sprite design world s concept and visual design and creation of visual assets atlus saw game as a remake of previous game in megami tensei series digital devil story megami tensei ii as such staff knew what would happen with story so development went smoothly an early factor in game was inclusion of a law hero and a chaos hero and a protagonist who would initially be neutral and whose actions would affect their alignment kaneko defined this blending of different alignments as a sort of hodgepodge when compared to future games in series when designing it team slowly decided that they wanted to break then current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content that feeling along with granting it a sense of reality through use of dark imagery would later define series main theme of shin megami tensei was a person waking up to inevitable destruction and being able to do nothing but rely on their own abilities scenario took a long time to finalize being revised a number of times by multiple staff members during earlier drafts it was planned that finale of story would take place in israel after an extensive journey across japan one of reasons development team chose tokyo as main setting was that its turbulent history going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters made it comparable with fantasy settings of other games at time in a later interview an atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it antithesis of traditional fantasy rpgs adding that this resulted in game developing a punk spirit because of post apocalyptic setting of megami tensei ii development team wanted to depict a time before apocalypse decision to set game in tokyo was made by suzuki and kaneko and was influenced by manga such as violence jack devilman and fist of north star kichijoji was decided to be game s starting point due to kaneko suzuki and ito all having lived in or near area or having visited it often abandoned terminal echo building there fascinated them making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets with rest of building feeling like a ghost town this fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in game while designing maps kaneko wanted to use wire frame models but super famicom s limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped by end of development multiple members of staff voiced dissatisfaction with final product ito and suzuki felt that portrayals of law and chaos heroes were imbalanced with chaos hero being too emotional and law hero being unsympathetic they also saw demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master okada while commenting on what improvements would be made for next game stated that there were too many useless items in game niino felt that game s pacing and flow needed to be addressed as after naming characters player immediately is prompted to divide their status points character designs in addition to handling graphics kaneko designed character and demon designs for game hero s and heroine s clothes were designed to be futuristic heroine was designed to be a protector with clothes inspired by american football equipment law hero and chaos hero have ordinary clothes at first chaos hero was designed to look unsophisticated with a bad posture and military clothes after their metamorphoses law hero wears clothes designed to look priestly kaneko did not have a specific form in mind when designing them but thought they looked gucci like chaos hero s clothes after his metamorphosis were designed to be similar to character piccolo from dragon ball manga series his hair style was also based on dragon ball specifically on that of super saiyan transformations in that series kaneko wanted chaos hero to change back and forth between human and demon form to tie in more closely with this design theme but concept was abandoned during production all characters had names attached to them to help with identification during event planning character louis was inspired by character of same name from 1987 movie angel heart some characters such as stephen and general gotou are based on real life people in game files they are identified as and mishima respectively according to ito character thorman s name was originally inspired by norse god of thunder but after release he realized that name was highly similar to that of harry s truman american president who approved atomic attacks against japan for demon design kaneko took inspiration from medieval woodblock prints wooden carvings from south america masks from micronesia and terracotta figurines from middle east his designs of angelic characters were influenced by descriptions from book of ezekiel of angels having multiple strange forms such as multiple arms or heads in addition to traditional demons and monsters kaneko designed versions of less frequented figures from celtic and southeast asian mythology theme he used when drawing them was fear which extended to both obvious threats and internal dread creatures evoked graphics for most demons were directly drawn as sprites without concept art to make sure that design and graphics would work within hardware limitations of super famicom certain important characters and some demons who player would be guaranteed to meet were drawn as concept art first several demons were designed in a way that allowed parts of their graphics to be reused for instance demon cerberus body is also used for and nue with a different color palette demon fusions were designed around dichotomy of law and chaos but in hindsight it was stated that this provided little fusion variety music game s music was composed by tsukasa masuko with arrangements by masuko and tatsuya nishiwaki masuko considered shin megami tensei to be an experimental work it was first time he had created music for super famicom so he was not familiar with console s specifications during composition he needed to check specifications repeatedly to see what he could do within hardware limitations for pc engine port music was arranged by hitoshi sakimoto a soundtrack album shin megami tensei law chaos disc was released on february 24 1993 by victor entertainment under catalog number vicl 7 it includes two discs first contains music as it sounds in game and second contains arrangements by nishiwaki a second album shin megami tensei sound collection was released on march 5 2003 by sme visual works under catalog number svwc 6 it includes music from original and playstation versions of shin megami tensei shin megami tensei ii and shin megami tensei if along with selected tracks from shin megami tensei nine release shin megami tensei was first released on super famicom on october 30 1992 in japan it remained exclusive to that region for 22 years it was first megami tensei title not to be published by namco instead it was published by atlus which caused some complaints as to why namco was not publishing game a fan translation of super famicom version has been developed subsequent ports were released on pc engine december 25 1993 mega cd february 25 1994 playstation may 31 2001 and game boy advance march 28 2003 atlus was responsible for playstation port and staff were divided on whether to make it a complete port or something new those who wanted a direct port won through pc engine port included added story scenes sims co ltd was in charge of mega cd port which included additional demons game boy advance version which was first time shin megami tensei appeared on a portable platform included ability to exchange demons and items using platform s data exchange capacities it also featured remastered music and alterations to ease playing experience game was released in february 2012 for ios and november of that year for android these mobile ports were based on game boy advance version including all port s features ios port was localized and released in north america and europe in march 18 2014 localization shin megami tensei as with many other early megami tensei titles was initially not localized for west due to its controversial content such as portrayal of religious elements this content clashed with nintendo s strict content policy guidelines playstation port was also prevented from being localized by sony s then current approval policy possibility of later localization after series became established in west were stalled due to age of game which would have put it at a disadvantage in modern gaming market according to nich editor of english version of shin megami tensei it was already too late to localize playstation and game boy advance versions of game by time megami tensei series had taken off in us atlus normally does not have an interest in localizing mobile games but saw ios version of game as a perfect opportunity to fill in one of gaps in series localization project was slow at first as it took time to extract files from game so localization team started by playing game in order to find out what kinds of dialogue text and system messages it contained after receiving files they translated text which was then sent to editors edited text was sent back to translators who checked that nothing had been lost in translation after which text was inserted into game a challenge for localization team was character limitations only four rows of text with 28 characters each were able to be displayed at a time and at some points this had to be limited even further in order to avoid graphical glitches this was solved by modifying game to allow for more text boxes as needed later megami tensei games which had been localized before shin megami tensei influenced localization as several of them include terms or quotes from game for instance catastrophe in shin megami tensei is referred to as great cataclysm in devil summoner raidou vs soulless army while persona 4 and shin megami tensei iv include several quotes and terms from game already translated shin megami tensei quotes from persona 4 localization were reused verbatim in localization of shin megami tensei reception according to ito super famicom release was a great success for company helping establishing it as both a developer and publisher while a success game also received criticism from players for its high encounter rate and difficulties using map and in game instructions at end of 2001 playstation version was 119th best selling video game of year in japan with 85 991 sold copies on release famitsu magazine gave original super famicom version a score of 36 out of 40 with all four reviewers giving it a 9 out of 10 this made it one of their three highest rated games of 1992 along with dragon quest v and world of illusion starring mickey mouse and donald duck shin megami tensei was also one of only eleven games to have received a famitsu score of 36 40 or above up until 1992 for subsequent console ports famitsu gave scores of 25 40 28 40 md 30 40 ps and 27 40 gba website toucharcade said that they loved game and that it was one of their favorite role playing games on ios they did however think that game was bad at explaining things including system of saving one s progress pocket gamer too thought that things were not explained enough for instance they said that game does not guide players from point a to point b and often does not even let players know where to start looking for point b rpgfan echoed this and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around wondering where to go gamezebo said they did not think battle system was particularly exciting but appreciated how conversation system and demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to game british newspaper metro found game more entertaining than most role playing games from its time gamezebo found ios version s touch screen based virtual buttons clumsy to use while pocket gamer found interface to work reasonably well while using landscape mode and rpgfan found interface to be excellent both gamezebo and toucharcade wished game had been a universal app so that it could have been played on other devices than iphone and ipod touch without having graphics upscaled several reviewers appreciated game s plot gamezebo said that it was an aspect of game that stood out in a positive way and pointed out how good they thought english translation was toucharcade called story one of game s strengths and said that it was impressive despite how it had a tendency to be ham fisted metro appreciated how game avoided role playing cliches such as how it took place in a modern japan rather than in a tolkien esque fantasy world they also liked its unrestrained style of storytelling rpgfan found story to be good and macabre and surprisingly relevant even in 2014 they disliked that there was very little character development and how scenes that traditionally would be poignant especially death scenes were handled in a nonchalant manner toucharcade called graphics good but not great though reasonable given game s age but that some demon designs were spectacular works of art rpgfan found majority of game s graphics to be functional but not too appealing and said that it was easy to get lost due to bland textures of walls and floors they did however like graphics used in battles and story sections which they found well drawn and detailed they praised designs of game s female characters especially lamia and yuriko but felt that designs of male characters were bland toucharcade found music to be fantastic rpgfan said that every piece fits into scene where it is played but that few were memorable they did note ginza as an exception which they felt was so well composed that it would sound good in any format legacy success of shin megami tensei led to multiple sequels over coming years and made megami tensei franchise more popular development on a sequel began immediately after success of shin megami tensei shin megami tensei ii which directly continued story of shin megami tensei was released in 1994 multiple other shin megami tensei titles have followed and brought series acclaim overseas kaneko s concept of chaos hero s transformation was resurrected as main gameplay mechanic of shin megami tensei digital devil saga game developer toby fox cited shin megami
