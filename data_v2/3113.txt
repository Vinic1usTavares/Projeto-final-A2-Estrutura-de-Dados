fifth test cashman p 199 wisden cricketers almanack wrote that his batting featured wristy cuts and vigorous hooks opining that there were few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch wisden said that his slow and loopy leg spin was a clever mixture of leg breaks and googlies india toured australia for first time in 1947 48 mccool played in three tests without much success scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets nevertheless he was selected as part of australian team to tour england in 1948 that would be known as invincibles he took 57 wickets on tour but bowling for long periods caused him to continually tear a callus on his third finger used to impart spin on ball as a result his captain don bradman felt compelled to leave him out of test matches feeling that his finger would not be able to handle necessarily long bowling spells this decision was aided by then existing rule allowing a new ball to be used every 55 overs allowing bradman to use his fast bowlers more often for rest of his career mccool was troubled by skin rubbing off his spinning finger mccool and his fellow fringe members of squad ron hamence and doug ring would refer themselves as ground staff as it was unlikely that tour selectors would include them in test team that tour donald bradman referred to these players as in an appreciation of mccool for 1959 testimonial year granted by somerset cricket writer alan gibson who knew mccool well in his later cricket career at somerset wrote that omission distressed him greatly at time though he could be philosophical enough about it later he played in all five tests on tour against south africa he took 51 wickets in all matches including 5 41 in second test at newlands in 1950 51 mccool was leading wicket taker in sheffield shield competition however he was not selected in test team against touring english nor against west indies following season english cricket prior to 1953 australian team to tour england mccool signed

low average of 10 2 runs per wicket and he also made 678 runs at an average of 33 9 following year he played less often his 547 runs came at better average of 42 1 but his 52 wickets cost 13 1 apiece and east lancashire who had finished either first or second in championship ten times in previous twelve seasons finished 10th out of 14 he did not return to east lancashire for 1955 season due to being contracted to play county cricket for somerset cricket writer alan gibson who knew mccool well wrote that after he had made decision to come an extension of qualifying period for overseas cricketers kept him waiting even longer change to rules was made by advisory county cricket committee at a meeting on 9 march 1954 delayed by change to rules mccool had a five year stint from 1956 in english county cricket somerset having finished on bottom of county championship table for four years between 1952 1955 had embarked on a renewal programme part of programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign including an offer to mccool that saw him return to first class cricket at age of 39 at somerset mccool was an instant success as a batsman scoring 1 967 runs in his first season including three centuries and a highest score of 141 after four seasons somerset came off bottom of county championship to 15th out of 17 and wisden was in no doubt of mccool s influence much of credit for all round improvement went to one man mccool it wrote at start of season it was hoped that former australian test leg break bowler would lend power and variety to attack from that viewpoint his 45 wickets at over thirty runs apiece might be counted disappointing but with bat mccool exceeded all expectations he was one of most consistent scorers in country and he failed by only 34 to reach 2 000 runs in his first season of county cricket mccool was backbone of a mediocre batting side and he never departed from his natural attacking style contemporary stats put number of runs scored by mccool in 1956 at 1 966 against touring australians that season he made 90 and 116 first innings 90 coming out of 139 in two and a half hours and including 15 fours second innings century out of 167 in just 95 minutes with four sixes and 14 fours wisden reported that he was very severe on ian johnson and jack wilson over 1956 57 new year mccool was one of a party of 12 cricketers all but one of them test players who made a brief trip to india to play two first class matches in celebration of silver jubilee of bengal cricket association in a side raised by lancashire secretary geoffrey howard mccool did not play in first match and in second he replaced jock livingston team s only wicketkeeper who had been taken ill during first game mccool made only 23 and 1 with bat but he stumped vinoo mankad off bowling of dooland one of only two stumpings in his career as a very occasional wicketkeeper back in england in 1957 he was joined at taunton by another australian bill alley but still finished as leading scorer for county with 1 678 runs in all matches to go with 44 wickets in wet summer of 1958 somerset finished third in championship their highest position since 1892 mccool s contribution was 1 590 runs and 46 wickets at for him low average of 23 runs each in this season mccool made his highest score for somerset 169 out of a total of 314 against worcestershire at stourbridge and in last match of season he produced his best bowling figures of his career taking eight second innings nottinghamshire wickets for 74 runs on what wisden described as a sporting pitch in contrast to 1958 1959 season was hot and dry and mccool s figures improved he made 1769 runs at an average of more than 40 runs per innings and took 64 first class wickets more than in any other somerset season mccool s final season with somerset before his retirement was 1960 and he signed off with 1 222 runs and 29 wickets in 138 matches across five seasons for somerset mccool made 7 913 runs at an average of 33 82 he also took 219 wickets at 28 05 but in his five years with county he was never first choice spin bowler in his first two seasons somerset used australian born slow left arm orthodox bowler john mcmahon as main spin bowler with young off spin bowler brian langford also bowling more than mccool when mcmahon left langford took over as top spin bowler and by 1960 was bowling four times number of overs that mccool took but mccool had also lost some of his control at this stage he could do beguiling things with ball though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration says history of somerset cricket he also made 146 catches many of them at first slip where he stood rather deeper than usual his influence on somerset s recovery from trough of early 1950s was considerable a later somerset history says occasionally some of younger pros didn t relish way he treated them maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own but their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable playing style right thumb 200px colin mccool s test career batting performances mccool had a round arm bowling action releasing ball with his arm almost parallel to ground before he developed problems with skin on his spinning finger he was in spite of his unorthodox action able to generate sharp spin cricket writer jack pollard said of mccool mccool was almost unplayable on badly prepared pitches so wide and sharp was turn of his leg breaks and that he made even state i e first class batsmen look inept on advice of coaches and ex players mccool attempted to alter his action to a more orthodox style on several occasions but always returned to his natural style a short man but with a strong build as a batsman he was a vigorous hooker and a wristy cutter scoring mostly square of wicket he was particularly good against spin bowling even on difficult pitches during his time at somerset he was known for turning a match with his cracking strokes in an hour alan gibson wrote we hardly think of him as a stylist and he was mostly a back foot player getting greater number of his runs in segments fanning out from point and square leg but he was enjoyable to watch compact tidy combining powerful hitting with delicate placing in best somerset tradition he was always after bowling and in best australian tradition he always relished a fight but he also adapted his style to suit english pitches in an early innings for somerset he was out trying to hook a ball from trevor bailey hook he decided was a stroke to be used sparingly on english pitches mccool was constantly amending his technique that season 1956 whenever he spotted a flaw in his method again and again he held somerset batting together nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for task of holding up a losing side in a damp english summer he was renowned for his catching often spending an hour at a time practising catching a ball thrown into side of a roller normally used to prepare cricket pitch journalist and former team mate bill o reilly said after mccool s death in 1986 if colin had played in last 10 years he would have been regarded as one of greatest all rounders ever in australian cricket he was a great batsman a wonderful bowler and one of best slips fieldsmen i have ever seen personality and personal life accounts of mccool in his somerset period portray him as a thoughtful but slightly aloof character off field he was a quiet man wrote david foot he was a contemplative pipe smoker in corner of dressing room says another account and somewhat intolerant of others who appeared less committed than he was occasionally some of younger pros didn t relish way he treated them maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own alan gibson wrote about him more he thought about game a lot many australian cricketers do more than english cricketers probably but mccool was in some ways an australian he had a and gentleness which do not always spring to mind as familiar australian qualities but he had plenty of australian determination gibson wrote that mccool did not quite come to terms with west country he went on he missed sunshine there s no winter he said and beer s better and f off spinners don t turn i think an additional reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting conventions of english cricket as it was then there was a somerset committee member who liked and admired him and would greet him with morning mccool that committee member was seeking to be courteous he would have thought it pompous to say mr mccool and impertinent to say colin but it infuriated colin he thought it a reflection on his status he would have preferred something like hi col you old bastard worlds were too far apart left thumb mccool left with invincibles teammate arthur morris at a function in 1979 mccool was given a testimonial season by somerset in 1959 after just three years with county and circumstances were unusual enough for it to be remarked on in county s year book published in winter before season although colin mccool has played for county for three seasons only this testimonial is a fitting reward for his valuable services as an all rounder and off field where his influence is most marked after retirement from first class cricket at end of 1960 season in england mccool returned to australia taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at beach on central coast of new south wales he continued playing club cricket in newcastle competition for belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55 rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue it was alarming to an old pro like me who prided himself on length and directions to have ball slip out of my fingers out of control mccool was author of two books on cricket cricket is a game which was an autobiography and best way to play cricket both published in 1961 john arlott reviewing them in wisden 1962 said first was full of trenchant good sense humour anecdote and shrewd observation second book arlott wrote was to best of this reviewer s knowledge first cricket book to be initially published in modern paper back format it was he added full of good instruction and sets down some genuine cricket wisdom with freshness and vitality he married dorothy in 1943 in sydney dorothy mccool s middle name is cited in entry for russel mccool in this directory his son russ mccool
