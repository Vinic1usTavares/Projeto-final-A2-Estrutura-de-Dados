henry iii 1 october 1207 16 november 1272 also known as henry of winchester was king of england lord of ireland and duke of aquitaine from 1216 until his death son of king john and isabella of angouleme henry assumed throne when he was only nine in middle of first barons war cardinal guala declared war against rebel barons to be a religious crusade and henry s forces led by william marshal defeated rebels at battles of lincoln and sandwich in 1217 henry promised to abide by great charter of 1225 which limited royal power and protected rights of major barons his early rule was dominated first by hubert de burgh and then peter des roches who re established royal authority after war in 1230 king attempted to reconquer provinces of france that had once belonged to his father but invasion was a debacle a revolt led by william marshal s son richard broke out in 1232 ending in a peace settlement negotiated by church following revolt henry ruled england personally rather than governing through senior ministers he travelled less than previous monarchs investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles he married eleanor of provence with whom he had five children henry was known for his piety holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities king was particularly devoted to figure of edward confessor whom he adopted as his patron saint he extracted huge sums of money from jews in england ultimately crippling their ability to do business and as attitudes towards jews hardened he introduced statute of jewry attempting to segregate community in a fresh attempt to reclaim his family s lands in france he invaded poitou in 1242 leading to disastrous battle of taillebourg after this henry relied on diplomacy cultivating an alliance with frederick ii holy roman emperor henry supported his brother richard in his bid to become king of romans in 1256 but was unable to place his own son edmund on throne of sicily despite investing large amounts of money he planned to go on crusade to levant but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in gascony by 1258 henry s rule was increasingly unpopular result of failure of his expensive foreign policies and notoriety of his poitevin half brothers lusignans as well as role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts a coalition of his barons initially probably backed by eleanor seized power in a coup d etat and expelled poitevins from england reforming royal government through a process called provisions of oxford henry and baronial government enacted a peace with france in 1259 under which henry gave up his rights to his other lands in france in return for king louis ix recognising him as rightful ruler of gascony baronial regime collapsed but henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across england continued in 1263 one of more radical barons simon de montfort seized power resulting in second barons war henry persuaded louis to support his cause and mobilised an army battle of lewes occurred in 1264 where henry was defeated and taken prisoner henry s eldest son edward escaped from captivity to defeat de montfort at battle of evesham following year and freed his father henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on remaining rebels but was persuaded by church to mollify his policies through dictum of kenilworth reconstruction was slow and henry had to acquiesce to various measures including further suppression of jews to maintain baronial and popular support henry died in 1272 leaving edward as his successor he was buried in westminster abbey which he had rebuilt in second half of his reign and was moved to his current tomb in 1290 some miracles were declared after his death however he was not canonised

was eldest son of king john and isabella of angouleme little is known of henry s early life he was initially looked after by a wet nurse called ellen in south of england away from john s itinerant court and probably had close ties to his mother henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters richard joan isabella and eleanor and various older illegitimate siblings in 1212 his education was entrusted to peter des roches bishop of winchester under his direction henry was given military training by philip d aubigny and taught to ride probably by ralph of st samson little is known about henry s appearance he was probably around tall and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build with a drooping eyelid henry grew up to occasionally show flashes of a fierce temper but mostly as historian david carpenter describes he had an amiable easy going and sympathetic personality he was unaffected and honest and showed his emotions readily easily being moved to tears by religious sermons at start of 13th century kingdom of england formed part of angevin empire spreading across western europe henry was named after his grandfather henry ii who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from scotland and wales through england across english channel to territories of normandy brittany maine and anjou in north west france onto poitou and gascony in south west for many years french crown was relatively weak enabling first henry ii and then his sons richard and john to dominate france in 1204 john lost normandy brittany maine and anjou to philip ii of france leaving english power on continent limited to gascony and poitou john raised taxes to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands but unrest grew among many of english barons john sought new allies by declaring england a papal fiefdom owing allegiance to pope in 1215 john and rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty magna carta treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power demobilised rebel armies and set up a power sharing arrangement but in practice neither side complied with its conditions john and loyalist barons firmly repudiated magna carta and first barons war erupted with rebel barons aided by philip s son future louis viii who claimed english throne for himself war soon settled into a stalemate with neither side able to claim victory king

kingdom and requested that his son be placed into guardianship of william marshal one of most famous knights in england loyalist leaders decided to crown henry immediately to reinforce his claim to throne william knighted boy and cardinal guala papal legate to england then oversaw his coronation at gloucester cathedral on 28 october in absence of archbishops of canterbury or york he was anointed by bishops of worcester and exeter and crowned by peter des roches royal crown had been either lost or sold during civil war or possibly lost in wash so instead ceremony used a simple gold corolla belonging to queen isabella young king inherited a difficult situation with over half of england occupied by rebels and most of his father s continental possessions still in french hands he had substantial support from guala who intended to win civil war for henry and punish rebels guala set about strengthening ties between england and papacy starting with coronation itself where henry gave homage to papacy recognising pope as his feudal lord pope honorius iii declared that henry was pope s vassal and ward and that legate had complete authority to protect henry and his kingdom as an additional measure henry took cross declaring himself a crusader and so entitled to special protection from rome two senior nobles stood out as candidates to head henry s regency government first was william who although elderly was renowned for his personal loyalty and could help support war with his own men and material second was ranulf de blondeville earl of chester and one of most powerful loyalist barons william diplomatically waited until both guala and ranulf had requested him to take up post before assuming power william then appointed des roches to be henry s guardian freeing

of country in a bid to take advantage of this henry encouraged rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for return of their lands and reissued a version of magna carta albeit having first removed some of clauses including those unfavourable to papacy move was not successful and opposition to henry s new government hardened in february louis set sail for france to gather reinforcements in his absence arguments broke out between louis s french and english followers and cardinal guala declared that henry s war against rebels was a religious crusade this resulted in a series of defections from rebel movement and tide of conflict swung in henry s favour louis returned at end of april and reinvigorated his campaign splitting his forces into two groups sending one north to besiege lincoln castle and keeping one in south to capture dover castle when he learnt that louis had divided his army william marshal gambled on defeating rebels in a single battle william marched

english throne in return his followers would be given back their lands any sentences of excommunication would be lifted and henry s government would promise to enforce magna carta proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards rebels particularly clergy who had joined rebellion in absence of a settlement louis remained in london with his remaining forces on 24 august 1217 a french fleet arrived off coast of sandwich bringing louis soldiers siege engines and fresh supplies hubert de burgh henry s justiciar set sail to intercept it resulting in battle of sandwich de burgh s fleet scattered french and captured their flagship commanded by eustace monk who was promptly executed when news reached louis he entered into fresh peace negotiations henry isabella louis guala and william came to agreement on final treaty of lambeth also known as treaty of kingston on 12 and 13 september treaty was similar to first peace offer but

ignoring instructions from centre and even henry s loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles illegally constructed fortifications called adulterine castles had sprung up across much of country network of county sheriffs had collapsed and with it ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues powerful welsh prince llywelyn posed a major threat in wales and along welsh marches despite his success in winning war william had far less success in restoring royal power following peace in part this was because william was unable to offer significant patronage despite expectations from loyalist barons that they would be rewarded william attempted to enforce traditional rights of crown to approve marriages and but with little success nonetheless william was able to reconstitute royal bench of judges and reopen royal exchequer government issued charter of forest which attempted to reform royal governance of forests regency and llywelyn came to

des roches and hubert de burgh a former justiciar three were appointed by a great council of nobility at oxford and their government came to depend on these councils for authority hubert and des roches were political rivals with hubert supported by a network of english barons and des roches backed by nobles from royal territories in poitou and touraine hubert moved decisively against des roches in 1221 accusing him of treason and removing him as king s guardian bishop left england for crusades pandulf was recalled by rome same year leaving hubert as dominant force in henry s government initially new government had little success but in 1220 fortunes of henry s government began to improve pope allowed henry to be crowned for a second time using a new set of royal regalia fresh coronation was intended to affirm authority of king henry promised to restore powers of crown and barons swore that they would give back royal castles and pay their debts to crown on threat of excommunication hubert accompanied by henry moved into wales to suppress llywelyn in 1223 and in england his forces steadily reclaimed henry s castles effort against remaining recalcitrant barons came to a head in 1224 with siege of bedford castle which henry and hubert besieged for eight weeks when it finally fell almost all of garrison were executed meanwhile louis viii of france allied himself with hugh de lusignan and invaded first poitou and then gascony henry s army in poitou was under resourced and lacked support from poitevin barons many of whom had felt abandoned during years of henry s minority as a result province quickly fell it became clear that gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from england in early 1225 a great council approved a tax of ps40 000 to dispatch an army which quickly retook gascony in exchange for agreeing to support henry barons demanded that king reissue magna carta and charter of forest this time king declared that charters were issued of his own spontaneous and free will and confirmed them with royal seal giving new great charter and charter of forest of 1225 much more authority than any previous versions barons anticipated that king would act in accordance with these definitive charters subject to law and moderated by advice of nobility early rule 1227 34 invasion of france thumb upright alt sketch of henry at sea henry travelling to brittany in 1230 by matthew paris henry assumed formal control of his government in january 1227 although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday following year king richly rewarded hubert de burgh for his service during his minority years making him earl of kent and giving him extensive lands across england and wales despite coming of age henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for first few years of his rule and retained hubert as his justiciar to run government granting him position for life fate of henry s family lands in france still remained uncertain reclaiming these lands was extremely important to henry who used terms such as reclaiming his inheritance restoring his rights and defending his legal claims to territories in diplomatic correspondence french kings had an increasing financial and thus military advantage over henry even under john french crown had enjoyed a considerable although not overwhelming advantage in resources but since then balance had shifted further with ordinary annual income of french kings almost doubling between 1204 and 1221 louis viii died in 1226 leaving his 12 year old son louis ix to inherit throne supported by a regency government young french king was in a much weaker position than his father and faced opposition from many of french nobility who still maintained their ties to england leading to a sequence of revolts across country against this background in late 1228 a group of potential norman and angevin rebels called upon henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance and peter de dreux duke of brittany openly revolted against louis and gave his homage to henry henry s preparations for an invasion progressed slowly and when he finally arrived in brittany with an army in may 1230 campaign did not go well possibly on advice of hubert king decided to avoid battle with french by not invading normandy and instead marching south into poitou where he campaigned ineffectually over summer before finally progressing safely onto gascony he made a truce with louis until 1234 and returned to england having achieved nothing historian huw ridgeway describes expedition as a costly fiasco richard marshal s revolt henry s chief minister hubert de burgh fell from power in 1232 his old rival peter des roches returned to england from crusades in august 1231 and allied himself with hubert s growing number of political opponents he put case to henry that justiciar had squandered royal money and lands and was responsible for a series of riots against foreign clerics hubert took sanctuary in merton college chapel but henry had him arrested and imprisoned in tower of london des roches took over king s government backed by poitevin baronial faction in england who saw this as a chance to take back lands which they had lost to hubert s followers in previous decades des roches used his new authority to begin stripping his opponents of their estates circumventing courts and legal process complaints from powerful barons such as william marshal s son richard grew and they argued that henry was failing to protect their legal rights as described in 1225 charters a fresh civil war broke out between des roches and richard s followers des roches sent armies into richard s lands in ireland and south wales in response richard allied himself with prince llywelyn and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in england henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that louis of france might seize opportunity to invade brittany where truce was about to expire while he was distracted at home edmund rich archbishop of canterbury intervened in 1234 and held several great councils advising henry to accept dismissal of des roches henry agreed to make peace but before negotiations were completed richard died of wounds suffered in battle leaving his younger brother gilbert to inherit his lands final settlement was confirmed in may and henry was widely praised for his humility in submitting to slightly embarrassing peace meanwhile truce with france in brittany finally expired and henry s ally duke peter came under fresh military pressure henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist and brittany fell to louis in november for next 24 years henry ruled kingdom personally rather than through senior ministers henry as king kingship government and law thumb alt engraving of great seal engraving of henry s great seal royal government in england had traditionally centred on several great offices of state filled by powerful independent members of baronage henry abandoned this policy leaving post of justiciar vacant and turning position of chancellor into a more junior role a small royal council was formed but its role was ill defined appointments patronage and policy were decided personally by henry and his immediate advisers rather than through larger councils that had marked his early years changes made it much harder for those outside henry s inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances particularly against king s friends henry believed that kings should rule england in a dignified manner surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual he thought that his predecessors had allowed status of crown to decline and sought to correct this during his reign events of civil war in henry s youth deeply affected king and he adopted edward confessor as his patron saint hoping to emulate way in which anglo saxon king had brought peace to england and reunited his people in order and harmony henry tried to use his royal authority leniently hoping to appease more hostile barons and maintain peace in england as a result despite a symbolic emphasis on royal power henry s rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional he generally acted within terms of charters which prevented crown from taking extrajudicial action against barons including fines and expropriations that had been common under john charters did not address sensitive issues of appointment of royal advisers and distribution of patronage and they lacked any means of enforcement if king chose to ignore them henry s rule became lax and careless resulting in a reduction in royal authority in provinces and ultimately collapse of his authority at court inconsistency with which he applied charters over course of his rule alienated many barons even those within his own faction thumb left alt photo of winchester great hall great hall of winchester castle constructed by henry term parliament first appeared in 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of royal court and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout henry s reign they were used to agree upon raising of taxes which in 13th century were single one off levies typically on movable property intended to support king s normal revenues for particular projects during henry s reign counties began to send regular delegations to these parliaments and came to represent a broader cross section of community than simply major barons despite various charters provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by needs of immediate politics sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint on other occasions problem would simply be ignored royal eyres courts which toured country to provide justice at local level typically for those lesser barons and gentry claiming grievances against major lords had little power allowing major barons to dominate local justice system power of royal sheriffs also declined during henry s reign they were now often lesser men appointed by exchequer rather than coming from important local families and they focused on generating revenue for king their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among lower classes unlike his father henry did not exploit large debts that barons frequently owed to crown and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him court thumb alt photo of silver coin a long cross penny showing henry s head royal court was formed round henry s trusted friends such as richard de clare brothers hugh and roger bigod and humphrey de bohun and henry s brother richard henry wanted to use his court to unite his english and continental subjects and it included simon de montfort originally a french knight who had married henry s sister eleanor and become earl of leicester in addition to later influxes of henry s savoyard and lusignan relatives court followed european styles and traditions and was heavily influenced by henry s angevin family traditions french was spoken language it had close links to royal courts of france castile holy roman empire and sicily and henry sponsored same writers as other european rulers henry travelled less than previous kings seeking a tranquil more sedate life and staying at each of his palaces for prolonged periods before moving on possibly as a result he focused more attention on his palaces and houses henry was according to architectural historian john goodall most obsessive patron of art and architecture ever to have occupied throne of england henry extended royal complex at westminster in london one of his favourite homes rebuilding palace and abbey at a cost of almost ps55 000 he spent more time in westminster than any of his predecessors shaping formation of england s capital city he spent ps58 000 on his royal castles carrying out major works at tower of london lincoln and dover both military defences and internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved at windsor a huge overhaul of castle produced a lavish palace complex whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in england and wales tower of london was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters although henry primarily used castle as a secure retreat in event of war or civil strife henry also kept a menagerie at tower a tradition begun by his father and his exotic specimens included an elephant a leopard and a camel henry reformed system of silver coins in england in 1247 replacing older short cross silver pennies with a new long cross design due to initial costs of transition henry required financial help of his brother richard to undertake this reform but recoinage occurred quickly and efficiently between 1243 and 1258 king assembled two great hoards or stockpiles of gold in 1257 henry needed to spend second of these hoards urgently and rather than selling gold quickly and depressing its value henry decided to introduce gold pennies into england following popular trend in italy gold pennies resembled gold coins issued by edward confessor but overvalued currency attracted complaints from city of london and was ultimately abandoned religion thumb alt sketch of henry carrying relic henry carrying relic of holy blood to westminster in 1247 by matthew paris henry was known for his public demonstrations of piety and appears to have been genuinely devout he promoted rich luxurious church services and unusually for period attended mass at least once a day he gave generously to religious causes paid for feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans he fasted before commemorating edward confessor s feasts and may have washed feet of lepers henry regularly went on pilgrimages particularly to abbeys of st albans and walsingham priory although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems henry shared many of his religious views with louis of france and two men appear to have been slightly competitive in their piety towards end of his reign henry may have taken up practice of curing sufferers of scrofula often called king s evil by touching them possibly emulating louis who also took up practice louis had a famous collection of passion relics which he stored at sainte chapelle and paraded holy cross through paris in 1241 henry took possession of relic of holy blood in 1247 marching it through westminster to be installed in westminster abbey which he promoted as an alternative to sainte chapelle henry was particularly supportive of mendicant orders his confessors were drawn from dominican friars and he built mendicant houses in canterbury norwich oxford reading and york helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities he supported military crusading orders and became a patron of teutonic order in 1235 emerging universities of oxford and cambridge also received royal attention henry reinforced and regulated their powers and encouraged scholars to migrate from paris to teach at them a rival institution at northampton was declared by king to be a mere school and not a true university support given to henry by papacy during his early years had a lasting influence on his attitude towards rome and he defended mother church diligently throughout his reign rome in 13th century was at once both centre of europe wide church and a political power in central italy threatened militarily by holy roman empire during henry s reign papacy developed a strong central bureaucracy supported by benefices granted to absent churchmen working in rome tensions grew between this practice and needs of local parishioners exemplified by dispute between robert grosseteste bishop of lincoln and papacy in 1250 although scottish church became more independent of england during period papal legates helped henry continue to apply influence over its activities at a distance pope innocent iv s attempts to raise funds began to face opposition from within english church during henry s reign in 1240 papal emissary s collection of taxes to pay for papacy s war with holy roman emperor frederick ii resulted in protests ultimately overcome with help of henry and pope and in 1250s henry s crusading tithes faced similar resistance jewish policies jews of england were considered property of crown and they had traditionally been used as a source of cheap loans and easy taxation in exchange for royal protection against antisemitism jews had suffered considerable oppression during first barons war but during henry s early years community had flourished and became one of most prosperous in europe this was primarily result of stance taken by regency government which took a range of measures to protect jews and encourage lending this was driven by financial self interest as they stood to profit considerably from a strong jewish community in england their policy ran counter to instructions being sent from pope who had laid out strong anti jewish measures at fourth lateran council in 1215 william marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from church in 1239 henry introduced different policies possibly trying to imitate those of louis of france jewish leaders across england were imprisoned and forced to pay fines equivalent to a third of their goods and any outstanding loans were to be released further huge demands for cash followed ps40 000 was demanded in 1244 for example of which around two thirds was collected within five years destroying ability of jewish community to lend money commercially financial pressure henry placed on jews caused them to force repayment of loans fuelling anti jewish resentment a particular grievance among smaller landowners such as knights was sale of jewish bonds which were bought and used by richer barons and members of henry s royal circle as a means to acquire lands of lesser landholders through payment defaults henry had built domus in london in 1232 to help convert jews to christianity and efforts intensified after 1239 as many as 10 percent of jews in england had been converted by late 1250s in large part due to their deteriorating economic conditions many anti jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice circulated in 1230s 50s including account of little saint hugh of lincoln in 1255 event is considered particularly significant as first such accusation endorsed by crown henry intervened to order execution of who had confessed to murder in return for his life and removed 91 jews to tower of london 18 were executed and their property expropriated by crown at time jews were mortgaged to richard of cornwall who intervened to release jews that were not executed probably also with backing of dominican or franciscan friars henry passed statute of jewry in 1253 which attempted to stop construction of synagogues and enforce wearing of jewish badges in line with existing church pronouncements it remains unclear to what extent king actually implemented statute by 1258 henry s jewish policies were regarded as confused and were increasingly unpopular amongst barons taken together henry s policies up to 1258 of excessive jewish taxation anti jewish legislation and propaganda caused a very important and negative change personal rule 1234 58 marriage thumb upright alt medieval genealogical picture early chronology showing henry top and his children l to r edward margaret beatrice

married eleanor of provence daughter of raymond berengar count of provence and beatrice of savoy eleanor was well mannered cultured and articulate but primary reason for marriage was political as henry stood to create a valuable set of alliances with rulers of south and south east of france over coming years eleanor emerged as a hard headed firm politician historians margaret howell and david carpenter describe her as being more combative and far tougher and more determined than her husband marriage contract was confirmed in 1235 and eleanor travelled to england to meet henry for first time pair were married at canterbury cathedral in january 1236 and eleanor was crowned queen at westminster shortly afterwards in a lavish ceremony planned by henry there was a substantial age gap between couple henry was 28 eleanor only 12 but historian margaret howell observes that king was generous and warm hearted and prepared to lavish care and affection on his wife henry gave eleanor extensive gifts and paid personal attention to establishing and equipping her household he also brought her fully into his religious life including involving her in his devotion to edward confessor despite initial concerns that queen might be barren henry and eleanor had five children together in 1239 eleanor gave birth to their first child edward named after confessor henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations giving lavishly to church and to poor to encourage god to protect his young son their first daughter margaret named after eleanor s sister followed in 1240 her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to poor henry s third child beatrice was named after his mother in law and born in 1242 during a campaign in poitou their fourth child edmund arrived in 1245 and was named after 9th century saint concerned about eleanor s health henry donated large amounts of money to church throughout pregnancy a third daughter katherine was born in 1253 but soon fell ill possibly result of a degenerative disorder such as rett syndrome and was unable to speak she died in 1257 and henry was distraught henry s children spent most of their childhood at windsor castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family after eleanor s marriage many of her savoyard relatives joined her in england at least 170 savoyards arrived in england after 1236 coming from savoy burgundy and flanders including eleanor s uncles boniface became archbishop of canterbury and william became henry s chief adviser for a short period henry arranged marriages for many of them into english nobility a practice that initially caused friction with english barons who resisted landed estates passing into hands of foreigners savoyards were careful not to exacerbate situation and became increasingly integrated into english baronial society forming an important power base for eleanor in england poitou and lusignans thumb alt sketch of henry at sea eleanor of provence l and henry r returning to england from poitou in 1243 by matthew paris in 1241 barons in poitou including henry s step father hugh de lusignan rebelled against rule of louis of france rebels had counted on aid from henry but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army not arriving in france until next summer henry s campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by hugh switching sides and returning to support louis on 20 may henry s army was surrounded by french at taillebourg henry s brother richard persuaded french to delay their attack and king took opportunity to escape to bordeaux simon de montfort who fought a successful rearguard action during withdrawal was furious with king s incompetence and told henry that he should be locked up like 10th century carolingian king charles simple poitou rebellion collapsed and henry entered into a fresh five year truce his campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over ps80 000 in aftermath of revolt french power extended throughout poitou threatening interests of lusignan family in 1247 henry encouraged his relatives to travel to england where they were rewarded with large estates largely at expense of english barons more poitevins followed until around 100 had settled in england around two thirds of them being granted substantial incomes worth ps66 or more by henry henry encouraged some to help him on continent others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents or fought on henry s behalf in european campaigns many were given estates along contested welsh marches or in ireland where they protected frontiers for henry community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer poitou and rest of his french lands and many of lusignans became close friends with his son edward presence of henry s extended family in england proved controversial concerns were raised by contemporary chroniclers especially in works of roger de wendover and matthew paris about number of foreigners in england and historian martin notes xenophobic overtones of their commentary term poitevins became loosely applied to this grouping although many came from anjou and other parts of france and by 1250s there was a fierce rivalry between relatively well established savoyards and newly arrived poitevins lusignans began to break law with impunity pursuing personal grievances against other barons and savoyards and henry took little or no action to restrain them by 1258 general dislike of poitevins had turned into hatred with simon de montfort one of their strongest critics scotland wales and ireland henry s position in wales was strengthened during first two decades of his personal rule following death of llywelyn great in 1240 henry s power in wales expanded three military campaigns were carried out in 1240s new castles were constructed and royal lands in county of chester were expanded increasing henry s dominance over welsh princes dafydd llywelyn s son resisted incursions but died in 1246 and henry confirmed treaty of woodstock following year with owain and llywelyn ap gruffudd llywelyn great s grandsons under which they ceded land to king but retained heart of their princedom in gwynedd in south wales henry gradually extended his authority across region but campaigns were not pursued with vigour and king did little to stop marcher territories along border becoming increasingly independent of crown in 1256 llywelyn ap gruffudd rebelled against henry and widespread violence spread across wales henry promised a swift military response but did not carry through on his threats ireland was important to henry both as a source of royal revenue an average of ps1 150 was sent from ireland to crown each year during middle of his reign and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters major landowners looked eastwards towards henry s court for political leadership and many also possessed estates in wales and england 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among barons enabling henry to redistribute irish lands to his supporters in 1250s king gave out numerous grants of land along frontier in ireland to his supporters creating a buffer zone against native irish local irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as english power increased across region these lands were in many cases unprofitable for barons to hold and english power reached its zenith under henry for medieval period in 1254 henry granted ireland to his son edward on condition that it would never be separated from crown henry maintained peace with scotland during his reign where he was feudal lord of alexander ii henry assumed that he had right to interfere in scottish affairs and brought up issue of his authority with scottish kings at key moments but he lacked inclination or resources to do much more alexander had occupied parts of northern england during first barons war but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat alexander married henry s sister joan in 1221 and after he and henry signed treaty of york in 1237 henry had a secure northern frontier henry knighted alexander iii before young king married henry s daughter margaret in 1251 and despite alexander s refusal to give homage to henry for scotland two enjoyed a good relationship henry had alexander and margaret rescued from edinburgh castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage alexander s government during rest of his minority years european strategy thumb alt sketch of elephant henry s elephant given to him by louis ix of france by matthew paris henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in france after collapse of his military campaign at battle of taillebourg henry s resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of french crown and by end of 1240s it was clear that king louis had become preeminent power across france henry instead adopted what historian michael clanchy has described as a european strategy attempting to regain his lands in france through diplomacy rather than force building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on french king in particular henry cultivated frederick ii hoping he would turn against louis or allow his nobility to join henry s campaigns in process henry s attention became increasingly focused on european politics and events rather than domestic affairs crusading was a popular cause in 13th century and in 1248 louis joined ill fated seventh crusade having first made a fresh truce with england and received assurances from pope that he would protect his lands against any attack by henry henry might have joined this crusade himself but rivalry between two kings made this impossible and after louis s defeat at battle of al mansurah in 1250 henry instead announced that he would be undertaking his own crusade to levant king began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around levant imposing efficiency savings on royal household and arranging for ships and transport he appeared almost over eager to take part henry s plans reflected his strong religious beliefs but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for return of his possessions in france henry s crusade never departed as he was forced to deal with problems in gascony where harsh policies of king s lieutenant simon de montfort had provoked a violent uprising in 1252 which was supported by king alfonso x of neighbouring castile english court was split over problem simon and eleanor argued that gascons were to blame for crisis while henry backed by lusignans blamed simon s misjudgment henry and eleanor quarrelled over issue and were not reconciled until following year forced to intervene personally henry carried out an effective if expensive campaign with help of lusignans and stabilised province alfonso signed a treaty of alliance in 1254 and gascony was given to henry s son edward who married alfonso s half sister eleanor delivering a long lasting peace with castile on way back from gascony henry met with louis for first time in an arrangement brokered by their wives and two kings became close friends gascon campaign cost more than ps200 000 and used up all money intended for henry s crusade leaving him heavily in debt and reliant on loans from his brother richard and lusignans sicilian business thumb alt illuminated manuscript picture 14th century representation of pope innocent iv l and louis ix r 1248 henry did not give up on his hopes for a crusade but became increasingly absorbed in a bid to acquire wealthy kingdom of sicily for his son edmund sicily had been controlled by frederick ii of holy roman empire for many years a rival of pope innocent iv on frederick s death in 1250 innocent started to look for a new ruler one more amenable to papacy henry saw sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in east with minimal consultation within his court henry came to an agreement with pope in 1254 that edmund should be next king innocent urged henry to send edmund with an army to reclaim sicily from frederick s son manfred offering to contribute to expenses of campaign innocent was succeeded by alexander iv who was facing increasing military pressure from empire he could no longer afford to pay henry s expenses instead demanding that henry compensate papacy for ps90 000 spent on war so far this was a huge sum and henry turned to parliament for help in 1255 only to be rebuffed further attempts followed but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered alexander grew increasingly unhappy about henry s and in 1258 sent an envoy to england threatening to excommunicate henry if he did not first pay his debts to papacy and then send promised army to sicily parliament again refused to assist king in raising this money instead henry turned to extorting money from senior clergy who were forced to sign blank charters promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of king s efforts raising around ps40 000 english church felt money was wasted vanishing into long running war in italy meanwhile henry attempted to influence outcomes of elections in holy roman empire which would appoint a new king of romans when more prominent german candidates failed to gain traction henry began to back his brother richard s candidature giving donations to his potential supporters in empire richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned holy roman emperor but continued to play a major role in english politics his election faced a mixed response in england richard was believed to provide moderate sensible counsel and his presence was missed by english barons but he also faced criticism probably incorrectly for funding his german campaign at england s expense although henry now had increased support in empire for a potential alliance against louis of france two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully for henry a peace treaty could allow him to focus on sicily and his crusade later reign 1258 72 revolution thumb alt painting of edward i probable late 13th or early 14th century depiction of henry s eldest son edward in 1258 henry faced a revolt among english barons anger had grown about way king s officials were raising funds influence of poitevins at court and his unpopular sicilian policy resentment of abuse of purchased jewish loans even english church had grievances over its treatment by king welsh were still in open revolt and now allied themselves with scotland henry was also critically short of money although he still had some reserves of gold and silver they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures including campaign for sicily and his debts to papacy critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join crusades and was simply intending to profit from crusading tithes to compound situation harvests in england failed within henry s court there was a strong feeling that king would be unable to lead country through these problems discontent finally erupted in april when seven of major english and savoyard barons simon de montfort roger and hugh bigod john fitzgeoffrey peter de montfort peter de savoy and richard de clare secretly formed an alliance to expel lusignans from court a move probably quietly supported by queen on 30 april roger bigod marched into westminster in middle of king s parliament backed by his co conspirators and carried out a coup d etat henry fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen half chosen by king and half by barons his own nominees to council drew heavily on hated lusignans pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in june passing a set of measures known as provisions of oxford which henry swore to uphold these provisions created a smaller council of 15 members elected solely by barons which then had power to appoint england s justiciar chancellor and treasurer and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments pressure from lesser barons and gentry present at oxford also helped to push through wider reform intended to limit abuse of power by both king s officials and major barons elected council included representatives of savoyard faction but no poitevins and new government immediately took steps to exile leading lusignans and to seize key castles across country disagreements between leading barons involved in revolt soon became evident de montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on authority and power of major barons as well as crown others such as hugh bigod promoted only moderate change while conservative barons such as de clare expressed concerns about existing limitations on king s powers henry s son edward initially opposed revolution but then allied himself with de montfort helping him to pass radical provisions of westminster in 1259 which introduced further limits on major barons and local royal officials crisis thumb alt painting of henry and louis ix 14th century representation of henry visiting louis ix of france over next four years neither henry nor barons were able to restore stability in england and power swung back and forth between different factions one of priorities for new regime was to settle long running dispute with france and at end of 1259 henry and eleanor left for paris to negotiate final details of a peace treaty with king louis escorted by simon de montfort and much of baronial government under treaty henry gave up any claim to his family s lands in north of france but was confirmed as legitimate ruler of gascony and various neighbouring territories in south giving homage and recognising louis as his feudal lord for these possessions when de montfort returned to england henry supported by eleanor remained in paris where he seized opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of barons henry finally returned to retake power in england in april 1260 where conflict was brewing between de clare s forces and those of de montfort and edward henry s brother richard mediated between parties and averted a military confrontation edward was reconciled with his father and de montfort was put on trial for his actions against king henry was unable to maintain his grip on power and in october a coalition headed by de montfort de clare and edward briefly seized back control within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well henry continued to publicly support provisions of oxford but he secretly opened discussions with pope urban iv hoping to be absolved from oath he had made at oxford in june 1261 king announced that rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter coup with support of edward he purged ranks of sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of royal castles baronial opposition led by de montfort and de clare were temporarily reunited in their opposition to henry s actions convening their own parliament independent of king and establishing a rival system of local government across england henry and eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army facing threat of open civil war barons backed down de clare switched sides once again de montfort left for exile in france and baronial resistance collapsed henry s government relied primarily on eleanor and her savoyard supporters and it proved short lived he attempted to settle crisis permanently by forcing barons to agree to treaty of kingston this treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between king and barons using richard as an initial adjudicator backed up by louis of france should richard fail to generate a compromise henry softened some of his policies in response to concerns of barons but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular sicilian policy he had done nothing significant to deal with concerns over baronial and royal abuse of jewish debts henry s government was weakened by death of de clare as his heir gilbert sided with radicals king s position was further undermined by major welsh incursions along marches and pope s decision to reverse his judgement on provisions this time confirming them as legitimate by early 1263 henry s authority had disintegrated and country slipped back towards open civil war second barons war thumb alt cloth drawing a 13th century depiction of mutilation of simon de montfort s body following battle of evesham in 1265 de montfort returned to england in april 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in oxford to pursue a renewed anti poitevin agenda revolt broke out shortly afterwards in welsh marches and by october england faced a likely civil war between henry backed by edward bigod and conservative barons and de montfort de clare and radicals rebels leveraged concern among knights over abuse of jewish loans who feared losing their lands a problem henry had done much to create and nothing to solve in each case following rebels employed violence and killings in a deliberate attempt to destroy records of their debts to jewish lenders de montfort marched east with an army and london rose up in revolt where 500 jews died henry and eleanor were trapped in tower of london by rebels queen attempted to escape up river thames to join edward s army at windsor but was forced to retreat by london crowds de montfort took pair prisoner and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in henry s name rebels completely replaced royal government and household with their own trusted men de montfort s coalition began to quickly fragment henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across england henry appealed to louis of france for arbitration in dispute as had been laid out in treaty of kingston de montfort was initially hostile to this idea but as war became more likely again he decided to agree to french arbitration as well henry went to paris in person accompanied by de montfort s representatives initially de montfort s legal arguments held sway but in january 1264 louis announced mise of amiens condemning rebels upholding king s rights and annulling provisions of oxford louis had strong views of his own on rights of kings over those of barons but was also influenced by his wife margaret who was eleanor s sister and by pope leaving eleanor in paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements henry returned to england in february 1264 where violence was brewing in response to unpopular french decision second barons war finally broke out in april 1264 when henry led an army into de montfort s territories in midlands and then advanced south east to re occupy important route to france becoming desperate de montfort marched in pursuit of henry and two armies met at battle of lewes on 14 may despite their numerical superiority henry s forces were overwhelmed his brother richard was captured and henry and edward retreated to local priory and surrendered following day henry was forced to pardon rebel barons and reinstate provisions of oxford leaving him as historian adrian jobson describes little more than a figurehead with henry s power diminished de montfort cancelled many debts and interest owed to jews including those held by his baronial supporters de montfort was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across country in france eleanor made plans for an invasion of england with support of louis while edward escaped his captors in may and formed a new army edward pursued de montfort s forces through marches before striking east to attack his fortress at kenilworth and then turning once more on rebel leader himself de montfort accompanied by captive henry was unable to retreat and battle of evesham ensued edward was triumphant and de montfort s corpse was mutilated by victors henry who was wearing borrowed armour was almost killed by edward s forces during fighting before they recognised king and escorted him to safety in places now leaderless rebellion dragged on with some rebels gathering at kenilworth which henry and edward took after a long siege in 1266 they continued targeting jews and their debt records remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up and final rebels holed up in isle of ely surrendered in july 1267 marking end of war reconciliation and reconstruction henry quickly took revenge on his enemies after battle of evesham he immediately ordered sequestration of all rebel lands triggering a wave of chaotic looting across country henry initially rejected any calls for moderation but in october 1266 he was persuaded by papal legate de fieschi to issue a less draconian policy called dictum of kenilworth which allowed for return of rebels lands in exchange for payment of harsh fines statute of marlborough followed in november 1267 which effectively reissued much of provisions of westminster placing limitations on powers of local royal officials and major barons but without restricting central royal authority most of exiled poitevins began to return to england after war in september 1267 henry made treaty of montgomery with llywelyn recognising him as prince of wales and giving substantial land concessions in final years of his reign henry was increasingly infirm and focused on securing peace within kingdom and his own religious devotions edward became steward of england and began to play a more prominent role in government henry s finances were in a precarious state as a result of war and when edward decided to join crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary henry was concerned that edward s absence might encourage further revolts but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over next two years to raise money although henry had initially reversed de montfort s anti jewish policies including attempting to restore debts owed to jews where these could be proven he faced pressure from parliament to introduced restrictions on jewish bonds particularly their sale to christians in final years of his reign in return for financing henry continued to invest in westminster abbey which became a replacement for angevin mausoleum at fontevraud abbey and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury edward confessor in a lavish new shrine personally helping to carry body to its new resting place death thumb alt photograph of henry s tomb henry s tomb in westminster abbey london edward left for eighth crusade led by louis of france in 1270 but henry became increasingly ill concerns about a fresh rebellion grew and next year king wrote to his son asking him to return to england but edward did not turn back henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join crusades himself but he never regained his full health and on evening of 16 november 1272 henry died in westminster probably with eleanor in attendance he was succeeded by edward who slowly made his way back to england via gascony finally arriving in august 1274 at his request henry was buried in westminster abbey in front of church s high altar in former resting place of edward confessor a few years later work began on a grander tomb for king and in 1290 edward moved his father s body to its current location in westminster abbey his gilt brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within abbey grounds by william unlike other effigies of period it is particularly naturalistic in style but it is probably not a close likeness of henry himself eleanor probably hoped that henry would be recognised as a saint as his contemporary louis ix of france had been indeed henry s final tomb resembled shrine of a saint complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics when king s body was exhumed in 1290 contemporaries noted that body was in perfect condition and that henry s long beard remained well preserved which at time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity miracles began to be reported at tomb but edward was sceptical about these stories reports ceased and henry was never canonised in 1292 henry s heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at fontevraud abbey with bodies of his angevin family legacy historiography thumb alt photograph of great charter great charter of 1225 in national archives kew first histories of henry s reign emerged in 16th and 17th centuries relying primarily on accounts of medieval chroniclers in particular writings of roger of wendover and matthew paris these early historians including archbishop matthew parker were influenced by contemporary concerns about roles of church and state and examined changing nature of kingship under henry emergence of english nationalism during period and what they perceived to be malign influence of papacy during english civil war historians also drew parallels between henry s experiences and those of deposed charles i by 19th century victorian scholars such as william stubbs james ramsay and william hunt sought to understand how english political system had evolved under henry they explored emergence of parliamentary institutions during his reign and sympathized with concerns of chroniclers over role of poitevins in england this focus carried on into early 20th century research into henry such as kate norgate s 1913 volume which continued to make heavy use of chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues with a distinctive nationalistic bias after 1900 financial and official records from henry s reign began to become accessible to historians including pipe rolls court records correspondence and records of administration of royal forests carpenter 1990 p 5 thomas tout made extensive use of these new sources in 1920s and post war historians brought a particular focus on finances of henry s government highlighting his fiscal difficulties this wave of research culminated in sir maurice powicke s two major biographical works on henry published in 1948 and 1953 which formed established history of king for next three decades henry s reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after 1950s no substantial biographies of henry were written after powicke s and historian john beeler observed in 1970s that coverage of henry s reign by military historians remained particularly thin at end of 20th century there was a renewed interest in 13th century english history resulting in publication of various specialist works on aspects of henry s reign including government finance and period of henry s minority current historiography notes both henry s positive and negative qualities historian david carpenter judges henry to have been a decent man who failed as a ruler because of his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform a theme echoed by huw ridgeway who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court but who considers him to have been essentially a man of peace kind and merciful popular culture chronicler matthew paris depicted henry s life in a series of illustrations which he sketched and in some cases water coloured in margins of chronica majora paris first met henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with king although paris disliked many of henry s actions and illustrations are frequently unflattering henry is a character in purgatorio second part of dante s divine comedy completed in 1320 king is depicted sitting alone in purgatory to one side of other failed rulers rudolf i of germany ottokar ii of bohemia philip iii of france and henry i of navarre as well as charles i of naples and peter iii of aragon dante s symbolic intent in depicting henry sitting separately is unclear possible explanations include it being a reference to england not being part of holy roman empire and or it indicating that dante had a favourable opinion of henry due to his unusual piety plays of william shakespeare do not feature henry as a significant character unlike many other medieval kings and within modern popular culture henry iii has a minimal presence and has not been a prominent subject of films theatre or television historical novels which feature henry iii as a
