favourably of manners and attitudes of italian women who had received convent educations he disapproved of what he called clairmont s loose morals and bedlam behavior and didn t want her to influence allegra he also believed that his daughter given her illegitimacy would have a far better chance of marrying well in italy than she would in england a roman catholic girl with a suitable dowry raised in a convent would have a decent chance of marrying into high italian society he wanted child to become a roman catholic which he viewed as best religion if claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with child s morals or education she mistakes she never shall wrote byron in a letter to richard belgrave hoppner in september 1820 girl shall be a christian and a married woman if possible her mother

to see allegra before he left for pisa and assuring him how much she is loved on back of this letter byron wrote sincere enough but not very flattering for she wants to see me because it is fair to

called a doctor to see her who determined that allegra was suffering little slow fevers her father was informed byron did not visit but approved use of any medical interventions deemed necessary she
