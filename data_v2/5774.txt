how finn must go up wizard steps to achieve love in reference to latter sanchez noted that it was indirect foreshadowing for what was to come in show episode marks introduction of earl of lemongrab according to moynihan character was undefined in beginning he and tom redefined him to make him stranger and more distinct so people would remember him as a villain a rough design for lemongrab was made by moynihan herpich later added his cloths and sword character s original name was but this was later changed character itself voiced by justin roiland after hearing roiland s audio moynihan noted that it was as if a dream came true due in part to roiland giving distinct voice to lemongrab that moynihan had imagined kent osborne later noted that voicing lemongrab is taxing and that when roiland finishes delivering his lines he is often covered in sweat too young also featured first use of lemongrab s catchphrase unacceptable although it was used by moynihan in fourth season sequel to
