led zeppelin had achieved sustained commercial and critical success from both their studio albums and live shows they were keen to record on location using rolling stones mobile studio as it had been an enjoyable experience for their untitled fourth album released previous year after touring australia in april 1972 group decided to take mobile studio to mick jagger s home stargroves a manor house and country estate in hampshire eddie kramer returned as recording engineer some songs from album had initially been tried out in earlier sessions such as no quarter which was first attempted during a session at headley grange estate in east hampshire both guitarist and producer jimmy page and bassist keyboardist john paul jones had installed home studios which allowed them to arrive at stargroves with complete compositions and arrangements page s home studio used some of equipment from pye mobile studios which had been used to record who s 1970 live album live at leeds because of his home studio he was able to present a complete arrangement of rain song including non standard guitar tunings and a variety of dynamics and over hills and far away featuring multiple guitar parts meanwhile jones had developed a new arrangement of no quarter once group were settled in stargroves they composed other songs through jam sessions together further recording took place at olympic studios in may and during band s 1972 north american tour additional recording sessions were conducted at electric lady studios in new york some songs which were recorded from these various sessions did not make it onto houses of holy some of them were released on later albums a series of rock n roll covers including songs that appeared on elvis presley s elvis golden records were recorded at electric lady studios which remain unreleased composition this album was a stylistic turning point in lifespan of led zeppelin composition and production used on album lay foundations which would be used again on subsequent releases according to band s biographer dave lewis while barnstorming effect of early era was now levelling off and though devoid of electricity of zeppelin i and ii sheer diversity of third album and lacking classic status of fourth houses of holy nevertheless found its rightful niche album largely abandoned their previous music s weighty dark blues rock distortion in favor of a clean expansive rock sound as evinced by page s sharper brighter guitar tone it was also likely most eclectic musically of their albums in opinion of consequence of sound writer kristofer lenz who observed swing rhythms on dancing days and experiments with reggae and psychedelic music on d yer mak er and no quarter respectively pete prown and hp newquist have called it a diverse collection of rockers ballads reggae funk and fifties style rock n roll side one album s opening track song remains same was originally a page composed instrumental called overture plant added lyrics that referred to group s experiences on tour and it was given a working title of campaign his lead vocal was sped up slightly in final mix while page played a rickenbacker twelve string guitar and a fender telecaster for live performances he used gibson eds 1275 double neck guitar that had already been established for playing stairway to heaven in concert rain song was composed at page s home studio including entire arrangement and vocal melody he was inspired to write song after george harrison complained that led zeppelin never did any ballads opening chords are same as harrison s song something which featured on beatles abbey road backing track was recorded at olympic with a working title of slush plant added some sensitive lyrics which matched music jones added a string section played on mellotron while page played acoustic and danelectro electric guitars in various different tunings song was regularly performed live with page using gibson eds 1275 page and plant revived track for their 1994 95 tour over hills and far away was written about hippie lifestyle including references to open road song was developed in two halves with a quiet acoustic section leading into a livelier electric one song was one of first to be introduced into led zeppelin s live set being first played in mid 1972 crunge was written by bonham and developed out of a jam at stargroves he decided to create a funk beat that stepped on and off beat making it impossible to dance to plant improvised a set of lyrics in manner of james brown over music parodying brown s take it to bridge vocal style towards end of track to further show that song was a tongue in cheek joke group considered putting dance steps to song on cover at one stage track was occasionally performed as an impromptu piece in concert usually in middle of another song such as fast guitar solo section in dazed and confused side two dancing days was inspired by enjoyable sessions at stargroves and lyrics show a general optimism to life kramer recalled group dancing around in garden at stargroves listening to playback of final mix a promotional copy of track was sent out by atlantic for radio play in march 1973 as a preview for album d yer mak er originated with bonham trying to combine reggae with 1950s doo wop by leaving a short off beat jones later disapproved of track saying it was treated as a joke and not thought out well but plant thought it could be a hit and suggested it should be released as a single led zeppelin s general policy was to not release singles in uk and though test and promotional pressings were produced there rest of group vetoed idea in us it became a top 20 hit no quarter was composed by jones an early arrangement of song was attempted for their fourth album but abandoned jones reworked track to add acoustic and electric piano and various synthesizers track quickly became a live favourite and was featured at every show from 1973 through 1979 providing jones with an extended solo showcase in middle and a jam session with a variety of different styles plant revived song for his 1990 tour and it was performed by page and plant in 1994 jones performed a solo instrumental performance on tour in 1999 and plant performed it solo again in 2005 it was part of set at ahmet ertegun tribute concert in 2007 ocean began with bonham shouting we ve done four already but now we re steady and then they went 1 2 3 4 referring to number of takes already recorded title and lyrics refer to group s fans and their devotion to band middle of track features an a cappella vocal break sung by plant bonham and jones while ending was another pastiche of doo wop style unreleased material album s title track was recorded at olympic and mixed at electric lady it was ultimately left off album as there were enough tracks to fill two sides of an lp and was released on follow up physical graffiti in 1975 that album also included black country woman recorded in garden at stargroves for houses of holy another track from stargroves sessions walter s walk was eventually released on coda in 1982 artwork and packaging thumb cover was shot at giant s causeway northern ireland cover art for houses of holy was inspired by arthur c clarke s novel childhood s end cover is a collage of several photographs which were taken at giant s causeway northern ireland by aubrey powell of hipgnosis this location was chosen ahead of an alternative one in peru which had also been considered photo shoot featured two children stefan and samantha gates it was a frustrating affair over course of ten days shooting was done first thing in morning and at sunset in order to capture light at dawn and dusk but desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds photos of two children were taken in black and white and were multi printed to create effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on album cover results were unsatisfactory but some accidental tinting effects in post production created a suitable cover inner sleeve photograph was taken at dunluce castle nearby causeway in february 2010 stefan gates was featured on a bbc radio 4 documentary about cover he said there was something sinister about image though his sister disagreed he also admitted never having heard album programme ended with gates returning to giant s causeway and listening to album on a portable player after which he said that a great weight had been lifted from him houses of holy was first album by group to not have an eponymous title but like previous one neither band s name nor album title was printed on sleeve however manager peter grant did allow atlantic records to add a wrap around paper title band to us copies of sleeve that had to be broken or slid off to access record first cd release of album in 1980s had title logos printed on cover itself in 1974 album was nominated for a grammy award in category of best album package cover was rated number 6 on vh1 s 50 greatest album covers in 2003 page has stated that album cover was second version submitted by hipgnosis first by artist storm thorgerson featured an electric green tennis court with a tennis racket on it furious that thorgerson was implying by means of a visual pun that their music sounded like a racket band fired him and hired powell in his place release and reception this was led zeppelin s final studio release on atlantic records before forming their own label swan song records in 1974 which would be distributed by atlantic it was also only led zeppelin album that contained complete printed lyrics for each song although intended for release in january 1973 delays in producing album cover meant that it was not released until march when band was on its 1973 european tour album was promoted heavily before commencement of led zeppelin s subsequent north american tour ensuring that it had ascended top of american chart by beginning of tour because much of album had been recorded almost a year previously many of songs which are featured on album had already been played live by led zeppelin on their concert tours of north america japan europe and uk in 1972 73 houses of holy originally received mixed reviews with much criticism from music press being directed at off beat nature of tracks such as crunge and d yer mak er gordon fletcher from rolling stone called album one of dullest and most confusing albums i ve heard this year believing band had digressed from epitome of everything good about rock to a watered down heavy metal act however album was a commercial success and topped uk charts and spent 39 weeks on billboard 200 albums chart including two weeks at number one their longest stint since led zeppelin iii album was number four on billboard magazine s

favourably while mocking solemnity of no quarter and finding some tracks derivative of previous albums he found side one solid led with sprung rhythm and a james brown tribute parody ripoff in crunge
