river weaver is a river navigable in its lower reaches running in a curving route anti clockwise across west cheshire northern england improvements to river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and work which included eleven locks was completed in 1732 an unusual clause in enabling act of parliament stipulated that profits should be given to county of cheshire for improvement of roads and bridges but navigation was not initially profitable and it was 1775 before first payments were made trade continued to rise and by 1845 over ps500 000 had been given to county major trade was salt arrival of trent and mersey canal at anderton in 1773 was detrimental to salt trade at first but ultimately beneficial as salt was tipped down chutes from canal into barges on river navigation access to river was improved in 1810 by weston canal which provided a link to weston point where boats could reach river mersey at most states of tide as water was deeper navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900 with original locks being replaced by five much larger locks capable of handling 1000 tonne coasters with opening of manchester ship canal a new lock was constructed at weston marsh which gave direct access to ship canal without having to pass through docks at weston point all water from river entered canal nearby and any surplus was released into mersey through weaver sluices which were located just upstream of junction a notable feature is anderton boat lift which is near northwich and links weaver with trent and mersey canal some above it was opened in 1875 to allow canal boats to reach weaver and although closed on safety grounds in 1983 it was refurbished and reopened in 2002 many of structures of navigation are of historical importance and are grade ii listed they include hayhurst swing bridge and northwich town bridge which are believed to be earliest swing bridges powered by electricity both have a sectional pontoon which is immersed in river and carries about 80 per cent of weight of bridge dutton horse bridge which carries towpath over weir stream at dutton is one of earliest surviving laminated timber structures dutton railway viaduct which was built by joseph locke and george stephenson for grand junction railway is grade ii listed and a civic celebration was held on its completion as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to workers during its construction route river weaver is more than long from its source in hills of west cheshire just south of peckforton castle and within a few hundred metres of source of river it initially flows in a south easterly direction towards border with shropshire fed by tributaries some of which rise in north shropshire first of three canal crossings occurs just before village of when llangollen canal crosses its course after flowing through village it passes to west of cheshire village of where it starts to flow approximately northwards across cheshire plain shortly afterwards shropshire union canal is carried over it on moss hall aqueduct first significant town on river is market town of nantwich where a watermill was a feature from 13th century 100m further north an early 19th century stone bridge with a single span crosses river continuing northwards it passes under middlewich branch of shropshire union canal before village of church minshull aqueduct carrying canal was designed by thomas telford and was built of brick with stone bands between 1827 and 1833 river flows through a central arch and there are flood relief arches on each side of channel two waterways run roughly parallel for several miles they diverge near winsford current head of navigation and at northwich river turns to flow north west across north cheshire below winsford course of river has been altered several times by construction of cuts and locks to enable small ships to trade on it river formerly joined river mersey at weston marsh but since construction of manchester ship canal begun in 1887 it has flowed into canal from where surplus water enters mersey by weaver sluices just upstream of junction tidal river section below frodsham has been bypassed by weston canal since 1810 and is no longer navigable as frodsham lock is derelict history river runs through cheshire salt producing area but was not deep enough to allow boats to reach salt mines it was tidal for around to pickering s wharf and salt from mines was carried by pack horse to wharf where it was loaded into barges these used ebbing tide to carry them back down river by early 17th century coal was being transported into area so that it could be used to evaporate brine and as industry expanded there were calls to improve river to simplify this trade there was opposition to initial schemes however from landowners who feared flooding and from carriers who feared a loss of trade which resulted in bills laid before parliament in 1711 1715 1718 and 1720 being defeated construction in 1720 first act of parliament to authorise improvements to river was obtained by three gentlemen of cheshire act was dated 23 march 1720 and authorised work between frodsham bridge and winsford bridge rates for tolls were set which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once cost of construction had been met and profits were then to be used to maintain bridges and highways within cheshire each year justices of peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue act included powers to improve witton brook from weaver to witton bridge following a plea by owner of brine workings near middlewich who felt they would be disadvantaged by new navigation a separate act was obtained on 7 june 1721 to authorise improvements to river dane but did not result in any work being undertaken progress was slow as only richard vernon of original three undertakers was actively engaged on project and he could not reach agreement with commissioners stalemate was broken when vernon died in 1726 and new undertakers were appointed work on weaver was completed by 1732 at a cost of ps15 885 eleven timber locks and weirs had been constructed but no work had been carried out on witton brook river had been improved by dredging and construction of a series of cuts with locks and weirs to manage drop of around over between winsford and river mersey barges of up to 40 tons could reach winsford and boats called weaver flats were predominant vessels these either sailed up river or were bow hauled by teams of men navigation was not initially profitable and amount of money owing to undertakers gradually rose to a peak of ps19 659 by 1740 toll receipts improved and by 1757 debts had been reduced to ps9 809 in september 1757 merchants from liverpool complained about run down state of navigation to liverpool corporation who offered to pay for a survey merchants then offered to take over navigation but commissioners wanted to keep control of it and paid ps17 000 to undertakers which repaid outstanding debt and bought navigation rights deal was completed on 11 october 1758 commissioners largely ignored survey which had been carried out by henry berry and decided to enlarge locks to wide work began on a new cut lock and weir at pickerings but in 1759 navigation was cut in half by collapse of a salt pit at northwich commissioners discovered that they could not sue for damages as provisions of 1721 act no longer covered way in which they were operating and so a second act of parliament was obtained on 22 may 1760 this changed way in which debts were managed and gave commissioners powers to sue and to appoint a management committee it also stipulated that all locks should be with a draught of but actual depth exceeded debts continued to increase as commissioners borrowed more money to fund improvements new weir and lock at pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt work had started on witton brook in 1756 but plans were revised in 1764 to increase navigable depth to and this work was completed in 1765 development proposed trent and mersey canal was seen as a threat by trustees of navigation for it ran parallel to river weaver for some distance near anderton however commissioners pressed on with upgrading river completing new locks at barnton in 1771 and at acton bridge in 1778 they also set about repaying their debts which were liquidated in july 1775 resulting in some of profits being given to county of cheshire as stated in original act trent and mersey was completed in may 1777 and had an immediate effect on trade which dropped by 25 per cent particularly in winsford area downturn was short lived as salt trade developed figures reaching their former levels by 1783 and climbing another 40 per cent to 171 719 tons by 1790 ultimately trent and mersey generated significant trade for navigation for in 1793 a system of chutes was constructed at anderton to enable salt from narrow boats on canal to be tipped into weaver flats moored in a dock some below level of canal steady increase in traffic encouraged trustees to press on with improvements witton brook was widened in 1788 and lock was raised but subsidence caused by salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826 a longer term solution was provided by decision to move northwich lock to a new site below town when work was finished in 1829 witton brook lock was no longer necessary and was removed new cuts and locks were built through 1790s at vale royal newbridge hartford and hunts and butty meadow lock was removed in response to petitions construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792 and was completed as far as anderton by mid 1793 it was later extended to winsford and bow hauling of boats by men was ended weston canal thumb right weaver sluices on manchester ship canal discharge water from weaver into mersey below frodsham barges carrying salt had to negotiate a tidal section of river to reach mersey from where cargo would be taken to liverpool or manchester for distribution worldwide water levels were inadequate for mersey flats at neap tides resulting in them having to wait for days at frodsham in 1796 users of navigation suggested that it should be extended to weston point where water was deeper trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls but users objected and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties finally trustees obtained a third act on 8 august 1807 which authorised construction of a cut from frodsham to weston point trustees insisted that their own engineer john johnson should oversee work but project was too large for him and ran over time and budget he was sacked in 1809 after serving navigation for 29 years and thomas telford was asked to complete work he managed project with samuel fowls as engineer at weston point a new lock connected cut to a basin and tide gates connect basin to mersey this cut was called weston canal and was completed in 1810 a fourth act was obtained on 2 may 1825 which altered some of details of previous act and an act of 22 may 1829 noted that weston canal had been completed it stated that trustees had built a basin piers and a lighthouse at weston point that weston canal was officially a branch of river weaver and that trustees would make no additional charges for using section no tolls had been collected since 1816 once construction costs had been repaid progress trustees investigated idea of a junction canal from winsford to middlewich branch of ellesmere and chester canal in 1830 but felt that water supply would be a problem new cuts were constructed at barnton crowton and aston grange between 1832 and 1835 and they then planned to construct a second lock beside each of original locks william was asked for advice on whether river could be adapted for seagoing ships and although he said it could he did not think it would be cost effective work was then started on making river deep throughout and building double locks suitable for 100 ton vessels which were by 1845 winnington acton and hunts locks had been improved trade was good with tolls generating ps38 363 in 1845 from carriage of 778 715 tons of goods all of improvements had been funded from toll revenue and over ps500 000 had been given to county of cheshire in line with original act further improvements to make river suitable for coasters began in 1856 when edward leader williams was appointed as engineer he oversaw complete reconstruction of navigation between 1870 and 1900 a programme which was designed to ensure that river remained attractive to carriers and which ensured its profitability 12 locks of 1830s were replaced by five much larger locks and most of bridges were replaced by swing bridges which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use river construction of a connection between river and trent and mersey canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875 because of difference in level a vertical boat lift was designed by edwin clark using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system a descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter pistons which raised other tank design was a success but fluid became contaminated resulting in corrosion of pistons lift was replaced by a new design where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys with small electric motors to overcome friction new lift was built over top of old one so that it could continue to be used until new one was ready and work was carried out by staff of navigation supervised by engineer j a saner it was completed in 1906 and continued in use until 1983 when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion it had been expected that use of chutes to transfer salt between canal and river would cease once lift was opened but by turn of 19th century although there were 190 000 tons of cargo using lift each year 38 000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute from middle of 19th century some of salt traffic transferred to railways and use of pipelines through which brine was pumped also affected trade but as that source of revenue declined a chemical industry developed in area around northwich which became major source of income for navigation locks thumb right signals between chambers at hunt s lock northwich railway viaducts behind locks on river are paired with two lock chambers side by side and in most cases larger lock also has intermediate gates so that ships of varying length can be accommodated without undue waste of water maximum size of locks is above anderton boat lift and below it lock at weston point docks is slightly narrower at boat lift is designed for canal craft rather than ships and so can hold vessels up to with a draught of connections thumb left 160px anderton boat lift access to navigation was improved for traditional canal boats with opening of runcorn and weston canal which was completed in 1859 canal left weston canal at weston point and provided a link to runcorn docks near which two flights of locks connected to bridgewater canal this link was severed in 1966 when runcorn to widnes road bridge was constructed half of runcorn and weston canal was filled in at same time significant change occurred when manchester ship canal was opened in 1894 tidal section of river below frodsham now flowed into ship canal rather than river mersey and exit lock from weston docks also joined canal rather than estuary a new ship lock was constructed at weston marsh which provided a more convenient route to ship canal than alternative route through weston point docks weston canal has been little used since although it is possible for pleasure craft to reach weaver from ship canal it is a commercial waterway and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by amount of paperwork and requirements of operating company situated just below northwich anderton boat lift is now normal route for leisure boats to reach river following its closure in 1983 a trust was created to campaign for its restoration lift became a scheduled ancient monument in 1994 and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999 it reopened in 2002 and is once more hydraulically powered use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built navigation is managed by british waterways as far as winsford bridge beyond this are winsford bottom flash and winsford top flash both are shallow lakes resulting from subsidence in underlying salt mines it is possible for some canal boats to explore bottom flash but depth of water is limited and great care is needed flash is used for yacht racing by winsford flash sailing club which is based on lake tourism weaver is a river of contrasts with quiet wooded reaches and heavily industrialised sites commercial shipping has largely ceased but ship sized locks remain for leisure boaters most of movable bridges provide a clearance of although swing bridge at newbridge on vale royal cut only has headroom of boats which require bridges to be opened must give prior notice there is a salt museum at northwich which was renamed as weaver hall museum and workhouse in 2010 to reflect its expanding scope and historic building in which it is housed and a visitor centre at anderton lift which is popular with boaters and non boaters alike there are however few facilities for recreational boater rowing is popular on river weaver with competitive clubs in runcorn northwich and acton bridge grange school fishing is another pastime which takes place along river several clubs lease fishing rights for different parts of river from british waterways as it holds populations of bream three types of carp chub dace eels perch pike roach rudd and tench fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends lower reaches of weaver between frodsham railway viaduct and manchester ship canal are used for sailing weaver sailing club is based at frodsham and uses a stretch of river for activities which include youth training and racing of several types of dinghy sailboats their training courses are accredited by royal yachting association structures navigation has a number of structures which because of their age have historic value and are listed on listed building register at vale royal lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in 1890s a swing bridge crosses chamber sluice at upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers a swing bridge made of wood and iron crosses small lock which was large lock until construction of new large lock in 1890s this has three sets of gates and could accommodate a train of four barges when outer gates were used again a swing bridge crosses lock gates are opened by a pelton water turbine mechanism and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically lock keeper s cottage is also grade ii listed it was built in 1850s but was moved northwards by during 1890 reconstruction thumb right hunt s locks with northwich railway viaduct in background below locks a five arched red sandstone viaduct constructed in 1837 crosses valley it was built by joseph locke and carried grand junction railway hunt s locks also consist of a pair smaller one from 1860s and larger one with three sets of gates from 1890s steel semaphore signals control access to locks and again movement of gates employs a pelton turbine weir to east of locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches which also support floodgates structure is baroque in style northwich railway viaduct spans both lock cut and weir stream and was built in 1860s it consists of 48 round arches constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone with iron spans over channels it is around long provides of headroom over navigation and also crosses river dane hayhurst swing bridge carries road over navigation and was manufactured by a handyside and co ltd of derby and london in 1899 it is an asymmetric bowstring lattice girder bridge and its timber framed control cabin is also listed this and town bridge which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design are believed to be two earliest swing bridges in britain to be powered by electricity both bridges were designed by j a saner who was navigation s engineer and incorporate a sectional pontoon which is immersed in river and carries about 80 per cent of weight of bridge because of risk of subsidence from salt workings bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow deck level to be maintained hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of ps33 5 million winnington bridge next downstream was built between 1908 and 1909 to replace first bridge which was built in 1901 original design was flawed and hence bridge was replaced after only 7 years a pedestrian walkway was later fitted on downstream side of new bridge thumb left dutton horse bridge an early laminated timber structure saltersford locks were built in 1874 using red sandstone and limestone and replaced a lock built on barnton cut between 1832 and 1835 pelton turbines which control gates were built to stoney s patent and carry plates which indicate that they were manufactured by hanna donald wilson of paisley acton swing bridge is a symmetrical bowstring girder swing bridge which was built in situ between 1931 and 1933 on an island in centre of river it was first swung across channel on 10 august 1933 j a saner was again designer dutton locks are of a similar design and age to those at saltersford and pelton turbines were made by northern foundry co ltd of oldham who are described as turbine makers on cast iron covers dutton sluice some to north east of lock was built in 1870s in a similar baroque style to hunt s weir but is larger with eight arches each carrying a sluice gate where weir stream rejoins main channel towpath is carried over it on horse bridge which was designed by j a saner navigation s engineer in 1915 and erected in 1916 it is one of earliest surviving laminated timber structures and consists of two arches both over long below locks joseph locke and george stephenson built another viaduct for grand junction railway which was completed in 1836 and is grade ii listed it has 20 arches and was built at a cost of ps54 440 by a london civil engineering contractor called david mcintosh a civic celebration was held on its completion as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to workers during its construction navigation has since been re routed and now passes through a different arch of structure weir at frodsham was built in 1785 although it has been altered subsequently main curved section is wide and there are two sluices at southern end adjacent lock which was designed by robert pownall and george leigh in 1781 was modified in 1830 and later but most traffic was using weston cut by time of 1890s upgrade and so it retained some of its original features it is derelict and water flow is controlled by a concrete and steel sluice erected in mid 20th century a red sandstone and limestone bridge carries a56 road over channel below lock it was built in 1850 and has three arches a56 crosses main channel on sutton swing bridge which was built in 1920s there have been problems with stability of road surface and options to secure its long term future and appearance were discussed in 2010 frodsham viaduct completed in 1850 and built in brown bricks with a cast iron central arch was built for birkenhead lancs cheshire junction railway by contractor thomas brassey engineer for project was alexander rendel oxygen levels in august 2012 oxygen levels in river were found to be low following death of thousands of fish environment agency were notified and aerated water while they investigated cause of problem this was thought to result from naturally occurring algae which deplete oxygen on which fish depend and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide which is used to improve oxygen levels in water and traces of detergent reaction results in an unpleasant looking foam building up on surface although foam is not hazardous winsford and district angling association who use river for fishing believe it will take many years to restore six species of fish affected by incident points of interest tributaries flood brook r lowe s brook r beckett s brook r dell brook r blackamoor brook r catton brook l warburton s
