he can pick star when comic book guy sees homer he considers homer perfect for role as he wants everyman to be played by a middle aged fat man but studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for role so they hire celebrity fitness trainer lyle mccarthy to get homer into shape after a month homer becomes fit and movie begins production soon afterward however mccarthy leaves homer for another client without mccarthy to keep him in shape homer starts eating again and gains all weight back homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer and movie begins to go over budget studio executives and comic book guy worry that film will not be successful final version of movie features scenes with fat homer and physically fit homer merged upsetting and confusing audience after premiere of film mccarthy returns and offers to get homer into shape again which homer accepts studio executives offer to let comic book guy direct sequel on condition that comic book guy lie to fans and say he liked film though pleased by offer comic book guy rejects it and openly criticizes movie online and thus it becomes a box office failure and everyman is never

was a fan of superbad they decided to ask producers of show if they could write an episode in 2006 ricky gervais co creator of office received credit for writing season 17 episode homer simpson this is your wife rogen and goldberg thought if gervais got to write one maybe they could try they were invited to simpsons writers room where they pitched several episode ideas one was accepted and they wrote an outline with help of some feedback from regular writers rogen commented that he and goldberg wanted to show with episode how hollywood generally ruins superhero films he said that whole joke is that homer is cast to play a guy who s an everyman and they try to make him into this physically fit guy rogen also noted that plot mirrors situation he was in while working on film green hornet when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role show runner al jean commented that writers tried not to repeat comic book film theme from radioactive man episode instead they decided to parody fact that almost every comic book has been turned into a film jean commented that that scene in episode in which studio executives are trying to think up an idea that hasn t been done really is what they are doing these days in real life table read took place in august 2008 and production on episode began soon after that rogen later said that we sat down for a read through and three hours later i m in a studio improv ing with homer simpson it was single greatest day of my life rogen also guest stars in episode as character lyle mccarthy making him second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it gervais also appeared in episode he wrote simpsons creator matt groening also makes an appearance in episode reception in its original american broadcast in united states on

steve fritz of newsarama called episode amazing and commented that overall comic book theme was perfect reviewers for tv guide cited matt groening s cameo dinner table scene homer trying to lose weight at kwik e mart and opening scene where bart questions comic book guy about spider man as highlights of episode robert canning of ign was positive about homer whopper giving it an 8 6 10 rating he commented that first act of episode was strongest while others were weaker canning believed reason for this was that viewers have already seen homer struggle with his weight countless times and rogen s trainer though funny much of time will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role he added however that rogen and goldberg are able to find a few new angles with weight jokes so it s not a complete loss overall canning thought homer whopper was a good start to twenty first season and although plot may not be very original writers added freshness to proceedings a v clubs emily vanderwerff did not think script was as good as gervais but commented that rogen and goldberg managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere she added that she thought hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on show but specificity of what episode was making fun of trainers who help stars slim down in this case helping homer slim down went a long way toward making episode palatable vanderwerff concluded that while episode didn t try anything new she had fun with it all same ultimately giving episode a b references external links category simpsons season 21 episodes
