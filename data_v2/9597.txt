quantum realm and retrieve her they arrange to buy a part needed for tunnel from black market dealer sonny burch who has realized potential profit that can be earned from pym s research and double crosses them donning wasp outfit hope fights off burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman lang tries to help fight off this ghost but woman escapes with pym s lab which has been shrunk down to size of a suitcase pym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner bill foster with hope and lang foster helps them locate lab where ghost captures trio and reveals herself to be ava starr her father elihas another of pym s former partners died along with his wife during experiment that caused ava s unstable state foster reveals that ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition and they plan to cure her using janet s quantum energy believing that this will kill janet pym refuses to help them and escapes with hope lang and lab opening a stable version of tunnel pym hope and lang are able to contact janet who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before unstable nature of realm separates

in time for a now suspicious woo to release him at end of his house arrest ava and foster go into hiding in a mid credits scene pym lang hope and janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help ava remain stable while lang is in quantum realm doing this other three turn to dust cast paul rudd as scott lang ant man a former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength following events of captain america civil war in which lang escapes from raft prison director peyton reed said that he s a fugitive in most of first ant man movie he s just a bigger fugitive now rudd was interested in lang being a regular person rather than innately heroic or super and to be driven by his desire to be a responsible parent evangeline lilly as hope van dyne wasp daughter of hank pym and janet van dyne who is handed down a similar suit and wasp mantle from her mother writers were excited to properly introduce character as wasp showing her power set how she fights and what are injustices that matter to her lilly felt character has incredible satisfaction in becoming wasp something that she has been waiting for her whole life which is essentially an affirmation from her father her relationship with lang is more complicated than in first film and includes anger towards his actions during captain america civil war lilly felt it was important that hope be an extremely empathetic and compassionate person and to always push for feminine qualities to be apparent when she is dealing with situations in her fight sequences lilly wanted to move away from more masculine muay thai and mma style of fighting she learned for first film noting that hope moves differently than a man so her fights should have elegance grace and femininity with a signature style young girls could enjoy and emulate lilly worked with writers to help ensure hope was able to represent a modern woman without becoming stereotype of a motherly figure madeleine mcgraw portrays a young hope van dyne michael pena as luis lang s former cellmate and a member of his x con security crew there was less opportunity for pena to improvise compared to first film where he and rudd were still developing character during filming creative team wanted to feature another scene of luis riffing a long story as he did in first film but did not want to repeat themselves they were able to take a different approach by giving character truth serum in scene for this film walton goggins as sonny burch a low level criminal type who seeks to obtain pym s technology for sale on black market bobby cannavale as jim paxton a police officer and husband to lang s ex wife maggie judy greer as maggie lang s former wife tip t i harris as dave a member of lang s x con security crew david dastmalchian as kurt a member of lang s x con security crew hannah john kamen as ava starr ghost a woman with molecular instability who can phase through objects she is only considered a villain because her attempts at survival clash with heroes goals character is traditionally portrayed as male in comics but creative team believed that character s gender was irrelevant to its portrayal and felt casting a woman would be more interesting it also allowed them to continue theme of fathers and daughters seen with other characters in film john kamen enjoyed this blank slate aspect allowing her to mold character as her own producer stephen broussard said that they wanted to cast a lesser known actress to help maintain mystery of character and john kamen blew us away portrays a young ava starr abby ryder fortson as cassie daughter of lang and maggie randall park as jimmy woo an fbi agent and lang s parole officer michelle pfeiffer as janet van dyne original wasp who is lost in quantum realm she is pym s wife and hope s mother pfeiffer was reed s dream casting for role since his time working on first film and he ensured that he received her input on character he noted that character has spent 30 years in quantum realm so there is a question regarding how that has affected her producer kevin feige explained that character ages over those 30 years even though time works differently in quantum realm to avoid any sci fi weirdness that could take away from emotional reunions with pym and hope in film michelle pfeiffer was de aged to portray young janet van dyne with hayley lovitt acting as a reference double lovitt had portrayed janet in first film before pfeiffer s involvement in franchise with reed explaining that she had been cast for first film due to her saucer like michelle pfeiffer eyes laurence fishburne as bill foster an old friend of pym who was once his assistant on project goliath fishburne had approached marvel about joining mcu pitching them a few ideas for whom he could portray before marvel offered him role of foster in film despite having already portrayed perry white for dc extended universe fishburne said that he had always fantasized about being in an mcu film admitting that he considered himself a marvel guy reed likened rivalry between foster and pym to that of steve jobs and bill gates and wanted an actor who can go toe to toe with michael douglas laurence fishburne was de aged to portray young ben foster with langston fishburne laurence s son acting as a reference double michael douglas as hank pym a former s h i e l d agent entomologist and physicist who became original ant man after discovering subatomic particles that make transformation possible pym has grown a lot closer to his daughter hope since first film and according to feige he has that joy of fatherhood in watching her become a superhero in her own right reed was attracted to morally dubious decisions pym sometimes makes michael douglas was de aged to portray young hank pym with dax griffin acting as a reference double having done so for first film as well additionally stan lee co creator of titular heroes has a cameo in film as a man whose car gets shrunk by accident michael cerveris appears as ava s father elihas starr while steele plays his wife catherine tim heidecker and brian huskey appear in cameos as a whale boat captain named daniel and a teacher at cassie s school respectively sonny burch s team of men includes as goran kostic as and rob archer as knox while sean portrays stoltz burch s fbi inside man and jimmy woo s subordinate tom scharpling and jon wurster of best show make brief appearances as burch s suv drivers production development in june 2015 ant man director peyton reed expressed interest in returning for a sequel or prequel to that film saying that he had really fallen in love with these characters and felt there s a lot of story to tell with hank pym a month later pym actor michael douglas said he was not signed for any additional films but would look forward to more if it comes my way and expressed desire to have his wife catherine zeta jones cast as janet van dyne for a potential follow up evangeline lilly who played daughter of pym and van dyne hope van dyne wanted to see michelle pfeiffer in role producer kevin feige revealed that studio had a supercool idea for next ant man film and if audiences want it we ll find a place to do it reed also mentioned that there had been talks of making a standalone adventure with hank pym as ant man possibly including original opening to ant man featuring jordi which was cut from final film eric eisenberg of cinema blend opined that a standalone adventure with pym and cut sequence would be a good candidate to revive marvel one shots short film series by end of july david dastmalchian expressed interest in returning for a sequel as kurt in october 2015 marvel studios confirmed sequel titled ant man and wasp with a scheduled release date of july 6 2018 reed was in negotiations to direct sequel by end of month and announced his return in november along with confirmation of paul rudd and lilly returning as scott lang ant man and hope van dyne wasp respectively despite being offered chance to direct sequels in past reed had never done so out of a lack of interest but was excited to work on ant man and wasp because there was a lot more story to tell with these characters that i have a genuine affection and kind of protective feeling about he was also able to build sequel from ground up as he joined first film late in process following departure of original writer and director edgar wright and wanted to explore elements that he had set up in first film he first began work on an outline for sequel which he thought could be weird unique and different now that characters origins had been established on being first mcu film to have a female character in title with wasp reed called it organic and noted wasp s final line in ant man it s about damn time as very much about her specific character and arc in that movie but it is absolutely about a larger thing it s about damn time we re going to have a fully realized very complicated hero in next movie who happens to be a woman reed would push to ensure wasp received equal publicity and merchandise for film and wanted to explore backstory of janet van dyne as well he had definite ideas of who should portray that character reed said alternate title wasp and ant man was briefly considered but was not chosen due to fan expectation given comics history of phrase ant man and wasp that month adam mckay one of writers of ant man expressed interest in returning to write film and douglas confirmed that he was in talks to return as well thumb upright left director peyton reed was excited to develop sequel from ground up after joining first ant man late in process reed stated in early december that film may call back to heist film genre and tone of ant man but that ant man and wasp would have an entirely different genre template he hoped to incorporate additional flashback sequences in film as well as explore pym s various identities from comics and his psychology reed also said he was excited about exploring and discovering film version of ant man and wasp relationship that is a romantic partnership and a heroic partnership in comics a different dynamic than we ve seen in rest of mcu an actual partnership additionally reed mentioned that pre production would probably start in october 2016 with filming scheduled for early 2017 production writers for first film gabriel ferrari and andrew barrer signed on to write script along with rudd with writing starting in earnest in january 2016 next month mckay stated that he would be involved with film in some capacity by april four writers and reed had been holed up in a room brainstorming story with reed promising that it would have stuff in it that you ve never ever seen in a movie before feige added that they wanted to stay true to what made ant man so unique and different and teased potential of seeing giant man version of lang that had been introduced in captain america civil war 2016 despite being intimately involved in writing and development of script reed did not take or receive a writing credit on film in june 2016 reed said that for inspiration from comics he had been looking at early avengers stuff and all way up to nick spencer stuff now and was focusing on iconic images that could be replicated in film over story beats from comics he added that there was definitely a chance for michael pena tip t i harris and dastmalchian to reprise their respective roles as luis dave and kurt from first film at san diego comic con 2016 feige stated that reed and rudd were still working on script and that filming was now expected to begin in june 2017 rudd elaborated that they had turned in a treatment but it s so preliminary we ll see we have an idea of what it might look like but it could change a lot from where we re at now next month pena was confirmed to be returning as luis while filming was revealed to be taking place in atlanta georgia in early october an initial script had been completed for film that was awaiting approval from marvel reed later revealed that early drafts of script included a cameo appearance from captain america appearing during luis flashback sequences as he was recapping lang s involvement in airport battle in captain america civil war however writers chose to remove appearance in final script since events of civil war were already referenced frequently in film and this instance didn t feel organic to story pre production at start of november 2016 reed said that film s production would transition from writing phase to official prep that month beginning with visual development reed reiterated his excitement for introducing wasp and really designing her look way she moves power set and figuring out sort of who hope van dyne is as a hero reed was inspired by films after hours 1985 midnight run 1988 and what s up doc 1972 for look and feel of ant man and wasp while first film was more of a heist film reed described this as part action film part romantic comedy and was inspired by works of elmore leonard where there are villains but we also have antagonists and we have these roadblocks to our heroes getting to where they need to be he also stated his disappointment in giant man introduction happening in civil war rather than an ant man film but noted that appearance provided character development opportunities between lang pym and van dyne since pym is very clear in first movie about how he feels about stark and how he feels about avengers and being very protective of this technology that he has and so reed thought pym would be pissed and van dyne would feel betrayed which was reed s in for those characters starting dynamics reed added that he spends a lot of time talking with other writers and directors of mcu films and that he and writers on this film wished to maintain our little ant man corner of universe because it s a whole different vibe tonally quantum physicist michalakis from institute for quantum information and matter at california institute of technology returned to consult on film after doing same on ant man and explained science behind getting extremely small to filmmakers michalakis described subatomic realm as a place of infinite possibility an alternative universe where laws of physics and forces of nature as we know them haven t crystallized and suggested it should be represented in film by beautiful colors changing constantly to reflect transience in february 2017 douglas confirmed that he would reprise his role as hank pym in film during hollywood premiere of guardians of galaxy vol 2 in april dastmalchian confirmed his return as kurt and a month later harris confirmed his return as dave as well through that may marvel was meeting with several actresses for a key role in sequel with hannah john kamen cast in part at beginning of june following month randall park joined cast as jimmy woo and walton goggins was cast in an undisclosed role at san diego comic con 2017 park s casting was confirmed john kamen and goggins roles were revealed to be ghost and sonny burch respectively and casting of pfeiffer as janet van dyne and laurence fishburne as bill foster was announced judy greer was confirmed to be reprising her role as maggie from previous film following week louise served as costume designer on film after doing so for marvel s spider man homecoming 2017 and worked with ivo coveney to create superhero suits for film based on designs by andy park suits are updated for film from 1960s inspired designs used in first ant man to more modern designs wasp suit included practical wings which were replaced with digital wings for when they are expanded and ready for flight russo brothers directors of avengers infinity war and avengers endgame which were filming while ant man and wasp was preparing to film were in constant discussion with reed in order to ensure story elements would line up between films joe russo added that ant man and wasp would have some plot elements that stitch in closely with avengers infinity war more so than some of other films leading up to avengers films reed knew ant man and wasp would be a fairly stand alone movie but could not ignore events of infinity war with biggest connection occurring in film s mid credit scene since events of ant man and wasp occur over 48 hours timeline in relation to infinity war was left purposefully ambiguous with reed noting there had been discussions of placing little easter eggs along way to start to reveal to audience where movie takes place in timeline but t hat felt not very fun to us and kind of obvious reed also liked how film ends with closure and on a positive note and then to bang give audience a gut punch right after main credits with sequence showing hank pym janet van dyne and hope van dyne disintegrating due to events of avengers infinity war film also has a post credit scene that shows ant who doubled for lang while under house arrest performing a drum solo filming thumb additional filming took place in san francisco setting of film including for an action sequence on lombard street pictured principal photography began on august 1 2017 at pinewood atlanta studios in fayette county georgia under working title cherry blue dante served as director of photography shooting on arri alexa 65 cameras with some sequences being shot with a frazier lens at start of filming marvel revealed that bobby cannavale and abby ryder fortson would also reprise their roles from first film respectively as paxton and cassie and that chris mckenna and erik sommers had contributed to screenplay film s lab and quantum tunnel set was inspired by time tunnel 1966 67 and was largest physical set built for an mcu film which reed jokingly said was a little counter intuitive for sequence where janet van dyne communicates through lang inspiration was taken from all of me 1984 in which lily tomlin s character is trapped in body of steve martin s character there were discussions about having pfeiffer perform scene first to give rudd an idea of how she would act but group ultimately decided to let rudd invent scene completely himself for chamber in ghost s lair production team under production designer shepherd frankel wanted to create an environment that was unique to mcu and designed chamber with fresnel lenses to give it concentric circle patterns that served a practical purpose for film s story as well as differentiating esthetics of it from other sets and creating mystery about character chamber is surrounded by support shapes to create this feeling of desperation and yearning for family and stability filming also took place in metro atlanta with filming locations including atlanta international school midtown and buckhead districts of atlanta and samuel m inman middle school in city s virginia highland neighborhood as well as emory university and atlanta motor speedway in hampton georgia additional filming took place in san francisco in september 2017 in savannah georgia in late october and in hawaii production wrapped on november 19 2017 post production in late november lilly said that characters would try to enter quantum realm in film and their potential success would open a whole entire new multi verse to enter into and play around in for mcu film includes a clip from animal house 1978 which reed was reminded of while discussing quantum realm science for film reed insisted that film be shorter than two hours since it would be following massive epic infinity war and because it is an action comedy and it didn t want to overstay its welcome dan and craig wood edited film film s main credits sequence is a table top version of its action sequences and was created by elastic an alternative idea that had been considered was to create a fake behind scenes documentary that would have made film look like it was a 1950s era godzilla movie with people in suits stomping on model cityscapes visual effects visual effects for film were created by dneg scanline vfx method studios luma pictures lola vfx industrial light magic cinesite rise fx rodeo fx crafty apes perception nyc digital domain and third floor dneg worked on over 500 shots including effects for ghost which were shared with other vendors third act chase sequence and final ghost fight as hank and janet are returning from quantum realm for macro photography sequences in film dneg took a different approach from their work in ant man due to issues including trying to get a camera to seem small enough to capture small actions though some of film was shot with a frazier lens that provides extra depth of field dneg would still need to re project road higher and raise floor level to simulate a tiny sized camera as third act chase sequence was mainly shot in atlanta while being set in san francisco dneg vfx supervisor alessandro noted it required extensive environment work with background elements in some shots not being salvageable at all dneg ultimately created 130 unique environments for chase clear angle aided dneg with lidar surveying and photography of san francisco and were able to get their information for lombard street down to millimeter resolution lola once again worked on de aging sequences with douglas pfeiffer and fishburne flashback sequences featuring a younger hank pym were set around same time as flashback sequences of ant man so lola were able to use a similar process referencing douglas appearance in wall street 1987 and having actor on set in a different wardrobe and wig lola vfx supervisor trent claus felt pfeiffer s was less complicated since she has aged incredibly well and still has big hair and a big smile pfeiffer s work from ladyhawke 1985 and other films around that time was referenced for fishburne his son served as his younger double and helped inform lola how older fishburne s skin would have looked in certain lighting situations films lola looked to for fishburne s younger self included boyz n hood 1991 and deep cover 1992 lola also made fishburne thinner and all actors had their posture adjusted luma worked on scenes where ant man and wasp infiltrate ghost s hideout where they had to recreate entire environment with cgi they also created first quantum tunnel sequence where ghost receives her powers and flashback missile launch which had to be replicated exactly from how it appeared in ant man new version of quantum realm designed by reed and production vfx supervisor stephane ceretti was created by method method studios vfx supervisor andrew hellen explained we did a lot of research into macro and cellular level photography and played with different ways to visualize quantum mechanics it has a very magical quality with a scientific edge we also used glitching effects and macro lensing to ground footage and keep it from feeling too terrestrial method also worked on sequence when lang is size of a preschooler and created digital doubles for ant man and wasp method used same level of detail on digital double suits regardless of what scale they were music in june 2017 reed confirmed that christophe beck who composed score for ant man would return for ant man and wasp beck reprised his main theme from ant man and also wrote a new one for wasp that he wanted to be high energy and show that she is more certain of her abilities than lang when choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout film beck tried to choose wasp theme more often so there would be enough newness in score to feel like it s going new places and isn t just some retread hollywood records and marvel music released soundtrack album digitally on july 6 2018 marketing concept art and pre cgi video for film was shown at 2017 san diego comic con in january 2018 hyundai motor america announced that 2019 hyundai would play a significant role in film with other hyundai vehicles also appearing first trailer for film was released on january 30 2018 on good morning america and used guitar riff from adam and ants ants invasion david betancourt of washington post called release day after widely praised black panther premiere a smart move with black panther and avengers infinity war also releasing in 2018 it can be easy to forget that hey there an ant man sequel coming this year so marvel studios giving us a quick reminder with this trailer release is logical tracy brown writing for los angeles times praised how trailer prominently featured lilly s van dyne showing she was always meant to be a superhero a second trailer was released on may 1 2018 following a teaser video featuring infinity war cast asking where were ant man and wasp in that film graeme mcmillan of hollywood reporter felt trailer made film feel very much like an intentional antidote for or at least alternative to grimness of infinity wars downbeat ending calling it a smart move since it could be considered a palate cleanser and proof that marvel has more to offer before audiences dive back into core narrative with next year s captain marvel in june 2018 feige presented several scenes from film at ant man and wasp nano battle an attraction inspired by film opened at hong kong disneyland on march 31 2019 it features rudd and lilly reprising their roles in clips that were made during film s reshoots promotional partners for film included dell synchrony financial and sprint disney spent around 154 million worldwide promoting film release theatrical ant man and wasp had its world premiere at el capitan theatre in hollywood on june 25 2018 and was released in united states on july 6 2018 where it opened in 4 206 theaters of which 3 000 were in 3d 403 were in imax over 660 were in premium large format and over 220 were in d box and 4d film was scheduled to be released in united kingdom on june 29 2018 but was rescheduled in november 2017 to august 3 2018 in order to avoid competition with 2018 fifa world cup charles gant of guardian and screen international noted worry for film distributors is that audiences will be caught up in tournament so it s easier to play safe and not date your film at this time especially during group stage when all qualifying nations are competing tom butler of yahoo movies uk added that unlike first film which was one of lowest grossing mcu films in uk anticipation levels for film are at an all time high following events of infinity war and uk audiences will probably have found out what happens in film well before it opens in uk cinemas and this could have a negative impact on its box office potential butler and huw fullerton of radio times both opined delay could also be in part because of disney also delaying united kingdom release of incredibles 2 to july 13 2018 a month after its united states release and not wanting to compete with itself with two films this in turn led fans in country to start a change org petition to have disney move release date up several weeks similarly to how avengers infinity wars united states release was moved up a week previous may home media ant man and wasp was released on digital

rolling stone gave film 3 out of 4 stars and praised rudd and lilly saying secret of ant man and wasp is that it works best when it doesn t try so hard when it lets charm trump excess and proves that less can be more even in marvel universe richard roeper of chicago sun times praised lightweight tone as a treat and a breath following dramatically heavy conclusion of avengers infinity war he also praised cast especially rudd and fortson as well as visual effects and inventive use of shrinking and growing in action scenes manohla dargis at new york times felt film s fast bright and breezy tone was a vast improvement over first film praising reed s direction she also praised rudd felt lilly found her groove in film and wrote that supporting cast all had scene steal ing sequences simon abrams of rogerebert com said film was good enough a messy but satisfying sequel that he felt managed to juggle its many subplots while giving rudd s lang some decent character development varietys owen gleiberman called film faster funnier and more cunningly confident than original and felt reed was able to give film enough personality to overcome its two hour runtime and effects heavy climax he did caution that this was not quite same thing as humanity but it s enough to qualify as miniature version at washington post ann hornaday called film instantly forgettable and criticized its plot which she felt included some filler subplots but found film to be no less enjoyable because of this she particularly praised rudd along with action and effects writing for boston globe ty burr called film perfect summer air conditioning movie finding it fun funny superficial and an improvement over first he also wrote that film had too many subplots and not enough of pfeiffer but was pleased with lack of connection that overall story had to rest of mcu and with focus on pop trash comedy stephanie writing for time said it was hard to actively dislike film which she thought had reasonably fun action and stand out moments between rudd and fortson but she was not as impressed with larger effects heavy action sequences and felt focus on lilly as a better hero than rudd was just checking off boxes in
