tropical storm norman was a weak tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern mexico in october 2006 twelfth named storm of 2006 pacific hurricane season norman developed on october 9 from a tropical wave well to southwest of mexico unfavorable conditions quickly encountered system and within two days of forming norman dissipated as its remnants turned to east thunderstorms gradually increased again as it interacted with a disturbance to its east and on october 15 cyclone regenerated just off coast of mexico center became disorganized and quickly dissipated bringing a large area of moisture which dropped up to 6 inches 150 mm of rainfall to southwestern mexico rainfall from storm flooded about 150 houses of which 20 were destroyed one person was injured and initially there were reports of two people missing due to storm however it was not later confirmed meteorological history a tropical wave moved off coast of africa on september 21 moving across atlantic ocean and caribbean sea with little development on october 1 it entered eastern pacific ocean and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on october 5 initially system was disorganized although gradual development was expected as conditions in upper levels of atmosphere were expected to become more favorable on october 7 it developed a broad low pressure area and by next day it was located in eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather western portion of system later developed into tropical storm olivia eastern system developed organized convection near its center and developed into tropical depression fifteen e at 0000 utc on october 9 about 765 mi 1235 km southwest of southern tip of baja california peninsula upon first becoming a tropical cyclone depression was moving north northwestward around western periphery of a weak ridge first forecast advisory by national hurricane center nhc forecast depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing baja california peninsula located over warm water temperatures system developed an area of organized deep convection near center with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using dvorak technique nhc upgraded depression to tropical storm norman about 12 hours after it first formed strengthening continued and norman attained peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h early on october 10 at time it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward however some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to southeast shortly after peaking in intensity southwesterly wind shear increased which led to a decrease in convection coverage at same time a trough extending from california southward caused norman to stall and turn to east convection rapidly became separated from center by late on october 10 center was located about 115 miles 185 km from nearest thunderstorms by then it had weakened to tropical depression status and early on october 11 norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530 miles 855 km southwest of cabo san lucas mexico remnants of norman continued to east and later to east southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance off coast of mexico initially re development of norman was not expected as disturbance was instead given possibility for further development on october 13 nhc noted that remnants of norman were merging with disturbance to its east during interaction convection redeveloped and organized around remnant low of norman and early on october 15 it reformed into a tropical depression near coast of southwestern mexico with warm waters and favorable upper level conditions norman was predicted to re attain tropical storm status before moving ashore however center quickly became less organized turning northward and northwestward within larger tropical disturbance late on october 15 it is estimated tropical depression norman dissipated 23 miles 37 km south and offshore of manzanillo colima although satellite imagery suggested center may have dissipated inland preparations and impact right thumb satellite image of regenerated norman near mexican
