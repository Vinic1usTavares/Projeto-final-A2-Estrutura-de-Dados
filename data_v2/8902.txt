song has been covered by a number of other artists including roger mcguinn byrds billy preston hugo race terence trent d arby mick farren caetano veloso marilyn scott and duhks bob dylan s version dylan wrote it s alright ma i m only bleeding in summer of 1964 although he was prepared to take his time developing song as he did with mr tambourine man he finished it in time for inclusion on bringing it all back home album which was recorded in january 1965 dylan first performed it s alright ma i m only bleeding live on october 10 1964 at philadelphia town hall version included on bringing it all back home was recorded on january 15 1965 same day that other three songs on side 2 of album mr tambourine man gates of eden and it s all over now baby blue were recorded with tom wilson producing it was long thought that four songs that make up side 2 of bringing it all back home were recorded in one long take this is not true but gates of eden was recorded in a single take and it s alright ma i m only bleeding was recorded in one take after a single false start false start can be heard on both 6 disc and 18 disc versions of bootleg series vol 12 cutting edge 1965 1966 released in 2015 dylan biographer howard sounes described it s alright ma i m only bleeding as a grim masterpiece only accompaniment is dylan s guitar playing folk blues riffs and up and down chord progressions author sean has noted that song s chord structure is similar to that used by everly brothers in their hit recording of wake up little susie lyrics of it s alright ma i m only bleeding express dylan s anger at what he sees as hypocrisy commercialism consumerism and war mentality inherent in contemporary american culture but unlike those in his earlier protest songs do not express optimism in possibility of political solutions in his book bob dylan performing artist author paul williams has suggested that song addresses possibility that most important and least articulated political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality and it s coming at us from every direction williams goes on to say that song successfully paints a portrait of an alienated individual identifying characteristics of world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its rules as such a major target in song is old established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted while it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with previous song on album gates of eden critique in it s alright ma i m only bleeding is more direct and less allusive author michael gray has commented that although vitriol dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs it s alright ma i m only bleeding is a transitional song in that it does not express optimism in possibility of political solutions instead dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would become his trademark however with political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs along with a more complex figurative language howard sounes notes that song features some of dylan s most memorable images opening lines begin song s torrent of apocalyptic images darkness at break of noon shadows even silver spoon handmade blade child s balloon eclipses both sun and moon to understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying critic andy gill links opening line of song to title of arthur koestler s bleak novel darkness at noon set in great stalinist purge of 1938 in soviet russia for gill dylan is suggesting that human spirit can be cast into darkness by dead hand of communism as well as by american capitalism according to seth rogovoy this opening echoes book of ecclesiastes 1 17 which reads i observed all deeds beneath sun and behold all is futile there are echoes of ecclesiastes throughout song another example is although masters make rules for wise man and fools author of ecclesiastes laments 2 15 16 fate of fool will befall me also to what advantage then have i become wise but i come to conclusion that this too was futility because wise man and fool are both forgotten wise man dies just like fool one of most famous lines from song reminds listeners that even most powerful people will ultimately be judged but even president of united states sometimes must have to stand naked these lines seemed particularly prescient when dylan performed song on his 1974 tour with band a few months before richard nixon resigned as president of united states as a result of watergate crisis after song has confronted sex religion and politics it ends with lines and if my thought dreams could be seen they d probably put my head in a guillotine but it s alright ma it s life and life only dylan s preoccupations in lyrics extend beyond socio political commentary and touch on urgent matters of personal experience challenge to live and grow in face of uncertainty he not busy being born is busy dying jimmy carter would later refer to line in his presidential nomination speech at 1976 democratic national convention though it addresses matters of self which supersede politics in process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism throughout song words pour out quickly with dylan barely taking a breath between lines so that intricate rhyming structure is often missed in verses and aab in chorus dylan has cited it s alright ma i m only bleeding as one of his songs that means most to him in 1980 he said i don t think i could sit down now and write it s alright ma again i wouldn t even know where to begin but i can still sing it in 1997 dylan told new york times i ve written some songs that i look at and they just give me a sense of awe stuff like it s alright ma just alliteration in that blows me away it s alright ma song has featured in dylan s live concerts throughout his long career dylan s website records that as of march 2015 song has

blood influence clinton heylin in his biography bob dylan behind shades revisited wrote that recording opened up a whole new genre of finger pointing song not just for dylan but for entire panoply of pop heylin adds that it s alright ma probably contained more memorable aphorisms than any of dylan s songs one of these lines is he not busy being born is busy dying from song s second verse which was used by jimmy carter in his 1976 presidential nomination acceptance speech at democratic national convention during his presidential campaign in 2000 al gore told talk show host oprah winfrey that this was his favorite quotation writer and journalist christopher hitchens quoted from song s lyrics in his last article for vanity fair written shortly before his death from esophageal cancer hitchens posted at top of his essay verse of it s alright ma that ends with words that he who is not busy being born is busy dying another memorable line is money doesn t talk it swears which appears in oxford dictionary of quotations in addition columbia dictionary of quotations lists this as well as three other lines from song although masters make rules for wisemen and fools but even president of united states sometimes must have to stand naked and everything from toy guns that spark to flesh colored christs that glow in dark it s easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred other well known lines include propaganda all is phony and advertising signs they con you into thinking you re one in a 2005 reader s poll reported in mojo magazine it s alright ma i m only bleeding was listed as 8 all time greatest bob dylan song and a similar poll of artists ranked song at 21 in 2002 uncut magazine listed it as 5 all time dylan song song was featured in final episode
