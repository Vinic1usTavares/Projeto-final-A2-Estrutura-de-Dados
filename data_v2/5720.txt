bohrium is a synthetic chemical element with symbol bh and atomic number 107 it is named after danish physicist niels bohr as a synthetic element it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature all known isotopes of bohrium are extremely radioactive most stable known isotope is 270bh with a half life of approximately 61 seconds though unconfirmed 278bh may have a longer half life of about 690 seconds in periodic table it is a d block transactinide element it is a member of 7th period and belongs to group 7 elements as fifth member of 6d series of transition metals chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as heavier homologue to rhenium in group 7 chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly but they compare well with chemistry of other group 7 elements history thumb left upright element 107 was originally proposed to be named after niels bohr a danish nuclear physicist with name nielsbohrium ns this name was later changed by iupac to bohrium bh discovery two groups claimed discovery of element evidence of bohrium was first reported in 1976 by a soviet research team led by yuri oganessian in which targets of bismuth 209 and lead 208 were bombarded with accelerated nuclei of chromium 54 and manganese 55 respectively two activities one with a half life of one to two milliseconds and other with an approximately five second half life were seen since ratio of intensities of these two activities was constant throughout experiment it was proposed that first was from isotope bohrium 261 and that second was from its daughter dubnium 257 later dubnium isotope was corrected to dubnium 258 which indeed has a five second half life dubnium 257 has a one second half life however half life observed for its parent is much shorter than half lives later observed in definitive discovery of bohrium at darmstadt in 1981 iupac iupap transfermium working group twg concluded that while dubnium 258 was probably seen in this experiment evidence for production of its parent bohrium 262 was not convincing enough in 1981 a german research team led by peter and gottfried munzenberg at gsi helmholtz centre for heavy ion research gsi fur schwerionenforschung in darmstadt bombarded a target of bismuth 209 with accelerated nuclei of chromium 54 to produce 5 atoms of isotope bohrium 262 this discovery was further substantiated by their detailed measurements of alpha decay chain of produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of fermium and californium iupac iupap transfermium working group twg recognised gsi collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report proposed names thumb left naming ceremony conducted at gsi on 7 september 1992 for namings of elements 107 108 and 109 as nielsbohrium hassium and meitnerium in september 1992 german group suggested name nielsbohrium with symbol ns to honor danish physicist niels bohr soviet scientists at joint institute for nuclear research in dubna russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 which was finally called dubnium and german team wished to recognise both bohr and fact that dubna team had been first to propose cold fusion reaction to solve controversial problem of naming of element 105 dubna team agreed with german group s naming proposal for element 107 there was an element naming controversy as to what elements from 104 to 106 were to be called iupac adopted symbol uns as a temporary systematic element name for this element in 1994 a committee of iupac recommended that element 107 be named bohrium not nielsbohrium since there was no precedent for using a scientist s complete name in naming of an element this was opposed by discoverers as there was some concern that name might be confused with boron and in particular distinguishing of names of their respective oxyanions and borate matter was handed to danish branch of iupac which despite this voted in favour of name bohrium and thus name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997 names of respective oxyanions of boron and bohrium remain unchanged despite their homophony isotopes list of bohrium isotopes isotope half life n 54cr 2n 54cr n

or by observing decay of heavier elements twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260 262 264 267 270 272 274 and 278 one of which bohrium 262 has a known metastable state all of these but unconfirmed 278bh decay only through alpha decay although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission lighter isotopes usually have shorter half lives half lives of under 100 ms for and 262mbh were observed 266bh and 271bh are more stable at around 1 s and 267bh and 272bh have half lives of about 10 s heaviest isotopes are most stable with 270bh and 274bh having measured half lives of about 61 s and 40 s respectively and even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278bh appearing to have an even longer half life of about 690 s proton rich isotopes with masses 260 261 and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium while neutron rich isotopes with masses 265 266 267 were created in of actinide targets five most neutron rich ones with masses 270 271 272 274 and 278 unconfirmed appear in decay chains of 282nh 288mc 294ts and 290fl respectively these eleven isotopes have half lives ranging from about ten milliseconds for 262mbh to about one minute for 270bh and 274bh extending to about twelve minutes for unconfirmed 278bh one of longest lived known superheavy nuclides predicted properties chemical bohrium is fifth member of 6d series of transition metals and heaviest member of group 7 in periodic table below manganese technetium and rhenium all members of group readily portray their group oxidation state of 7 and state becomes more stable as group is descended thus bohrium is expected to form a stable 7 state technetium also shows a stable 4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable 4 and 3 states bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well higher 7 oxidation state is more likely to exist in oxyanions such as analogous to lighter permanganate and perrhenate nevertheless bohrium vii is likely to be unstable in aqueous solution and would probably be easily reduced to more stable bohrium iv technetium and rhenium are known to form volatile m tc re so bohrium should also form volatile oxide oxide should dissolve in water to form acid rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from halogenation of oxide chlorination of oxide forms oxychlorides so bho3cl should be formed in this reaction fluorination results in and for heavier elements in addition to rhenium compounds and ref7 therefore oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka rhenium properties hans georg nadler rhenium and rhenium compounds ullmann s encyclopedia of industrial chemistry wiley vch weinheim 2000 since oxychlorides are asymmetrical and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down group they should become less volatile in order tco3cl reo3cl bho3cl this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds values are for tco3cl and reo3cl are 51 kj mol and 61 kj mol respectively experimental value for bho3cl is 77 8 kj mol very close to theoretically expected value of 78 5 kj mol physical and atomic bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close packed crystal structure c a 1 62 similar to its lighter congener rhenium it should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37 1 g cm3 which would be third highest of any of 118 known elements lower than only meitnerium 37 4 g cm3 and hassium 41 g cm3 two following elements in periodic table in comparison densest known element that has had its density measured osmium has a density of only 22 61 g cm3 this results from bohrium s high atomic weight lanthanide and actinide contractions and relativistic effects although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical and sample would quickly decay atomic radius of bohrium is expected to be around 128 pm due to relativistic stabilization of 7s orbital and destabilization of 6d orbital bh ion is predicted to have an electron configuration of rn 5f14 7s2 giving up a 6d electron instead of a 7s electron which is opposite of behavior of its lighter homologues manganese and technetium rhenium on other hand follows its heavier congener bohrium in giving up a 5d electron before a 6s electron as relativistic effects have become significant by sixth period where they cause among other things yellow color of gold and low melting point of mercury bh2 ion is expected to have an electron configuration of rn 5f14 6d3 7s2 in contrast re2 ion is expected to have a xe configuration this time analogous to manganese and technetium ionic radius of hexacoordinate heptavalent bohrium is expected to be 58 pm heptavalent manganese technetium and rhenium having values of 46 57 and 53 pm respectively pentavalent bohrium should have a larger ionic radius of 83 pm experimental chemistry in 1995 first report on attempted isolation of element was unsuccessful prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as trivalent actinides group 5 elements and polonium in 2000 it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important bohrium behaves like a typical group 7 element a team at paul scherrer institute psi conducted a chemistry reaction using six atoms of 267bh produced in reaction between 249bk and 22ne ions resulting atoms were and reacted with a hcl o2 mixture to form a volatile oxychloride reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues technetium as and rhenium as isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride this placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7 adsorption enthalpies of oxychlorides of technetium rhenium and bohrium were measured in this experiment agreeing very well with theoretical predictions and implying a sequence of decreasing oxychloride volatility down group 7 of tco3cl reo3cl bho3cl 2 bh 3 2 hcl 2 longer lived heavy isotopes of bohrium produced as daughters of heavier elements offer advantages for future radiochemical experiments although heavy isotope 274bh requires a rare and highly radioactive berkelium target for its production isotopes 272bh 271bh and 270bh can be readily produced as daughters of more easily produced moscovium and nihonium isotopes references external links bohrium at periodic table of videos university of nottingham category chemical elements category transition metals
