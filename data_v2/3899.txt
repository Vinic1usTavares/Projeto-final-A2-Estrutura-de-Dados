touchdown pass from roger staubach to drew pearson in game s final seconds a play in which vikings observers claim that pearson should have been penalized for pass interference vikings also lost to

network ranked vikings as second most snake bitten franchise of all time behind only cleveland browns under head coach dennis green vikings were perennial playoff contenders throughout 1990s but they experienced little success once they reached postseason in first round of 1998 nfl draft vikings selected wide receiver randy moss who despite his talent was passed by several teams even those in need of a wide receiver due to concerns surrounding moss s misbehavior and multiple arrests during high school and college moss used this as motivation to make teams who passed on him regret their decision that year moss set nfl record for most touchdown receptions by a rookie with 17 and combined with future hall of fame wide receiver cris carter and quarterback randall cunningham he formed centerpiece of vikings offensive attack which also set an nfl record by scoring 556 points during season vikings defense was led by future hall of fame defensive tackle john randle and was ranked sixth overall in points allowed during season vikings finished regular season with a record of 15 1 and held first overall seed in nfc playoffs two previous nfl teams to finish regular season with 15 wins 1984 san

team history as described by atlanta sports journalist terence moore moore singled out 1980 divisional playoff game against dallas cowboys in which falcons gave up a 14 point lead en route to a defeat as well as a 6 turnover performance during their 1991 divisional playoff defeat against washington redskins as notable examples of frustration prior to 1998 season falcons had never advanced to nfc championship game let alone to a super bowl 1998 season was not expected to be any different as falcons had failed to reach playoffs previous two seasons and only made playoffs twice in previous fifteen seasons however head coach dan reeves who was hired before previous season had overhauled roster in an attempt to reverse team s fortunes thirty eight of fifty three players on 1998 falcons team had been brought in by reeves over previous year including journeyman quarterback chris chandler who had a career best season in 1998 running back jamal anderson also posted a career high 1846 rushing yards which led nfc that year and defense finished fourth overall in points allowed as a result falcons won nfc west with a record of 14 2 and clinched 2nd overall seed in nfc playoffs behind

orleans saints on december 13 reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery team was coached by defensive coordinator rich brooks for final two regular season games reeves was able to return to team in time for their first playoff game in which falcons beat their division rival san francisco 49ers to clinch a spot in conference championship despite an impressive season they were not expected to match up well against vikings who had beaten teams by an average of 23 22 points at home that year and were installed as 11 point favorites for championship game game summary falcons won coin toss

falcons failed to score after an incomplete pass turned ball over on downs with six minutes left in game vikings then drove down to falcons 22 yard line where an incomplete pass on 3rd down set up a field goal attempt by gary anderson anderson s kick incompletion on 3rd down stopped clock with 2 11 left in game field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by nfl standards because game was played indoors at metrodome there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected kick ball was snapped on 4th down with punter mitch berger holding from left hash mark vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback michael booker on left side of line of scrimmage and cornerbacks ronnie bradford and ray buchanan on right who ran into anderson and knocked him to ground after kick ball sailed about a foot wide left of upright with 2 07 left on game clock afterward anderson momentarily stood on field with arms akimbo before heading to sideline as falcons players celebrated around him a converted field goal would have given vikings a 10 point lead which would have almost certainly clinched victory according to pro football prospectus and nfl network documentary missing rings citing a mathematical algorithm by sports analytics company new york post reported that vikings had a 95 23 chance of winning game had anderson converted field goal end of regulation and overtime 193px thumb atlanta falcons placekicker morten andersen pictured here in 2010 kicked game winning field goal in overtime to lift

griffith dropped an interception off of a deflected pass which would have also almost certainly clinched victory instead chandler threw a touchdown pass to mathis on next play tying game 27 27 with 49

41 yard line before being stopped on 3rd down and they punted ball back to vikings on ensuing drive cunningham attempted a deep pass to moss that was narrowly broken up by eugene robinson had pass been completed it most likely would have resulted in a touchdown and victory for vikings instead vikings had to punt on 4th down again falcons then drove to vikings 21 yard line where morten andersen converted a 38 yard field goal for win aftermath player reactions after game gary anderson was described as inconsolable although vikings still led by seven points at time his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on team espn contributor ben goessling noted how swiftly it pulled bottom out from under a team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point writing for website sporting news jeff diamond vikings general manager at time observed that our team played rest of game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at most critical time randle concurred describing his reaction to kick as i was standing there like someone just punched me in my stomach and was like oh my god oh my god carter openly wept in locker room after game and was affected so badly by loss that he considered retirement walking off that field and losing like that carter reflected i didn t even know if i wanted to play football anymore because i just i felt like that i would never win after that he went on to call game most devastating loss that i ve ever been a part of both carter and fellow hall of fame member randle believed that 1998 vikings team was their best chance at winning a super bowl neither player ever reached super bowl in their careers randle described feeling after game as it s like driving down a street and getting every green light for next ten miles and you re just cruising along and it s just smooth and all of a sudden you re getting there you re almost there and all of a sudden fucking light turns red and you get randle further laments loss due to background of many of his teammates whom he described as misfits guys who just got their second chance beyond moss s legal troubles carter had been released by philadelphia eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues and cunningham was released by eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by nfl teams cunningham drew on his religious faith to persevere through loss believing that god had a reason for everything to happen years later he reflected it just wasn t our destiny to be in super bowl that s my conclusion because if it was we would have gone immediately after game he expressed this belief in an attempt to console carter following season cunningham was benched for poor play after six games and was released by vikings at end of year he also would never play in a super bowl overjoyed with victory falcons players also wept after game and team ripped open pillows and threw feathers in celebration on their charter flight back to atlanta buchanan stated that win feels like a miracle due to negative perception of falcons in years past this team was dirt people stepped on us and wiped their feet on doormat now we feel like a bunch of michael jordans chandler joked that due to his game winning field goal morten andersen gets to keep his green card referring to andersen s danish nationality while running back jamal anderson felt vindicated for media s continuous focus on vikings in days leading up to game which made him feel disrespected falcons defensive end chuck smith questioned vikings toughness because of ease with which they had won during season it s one thing to beat up on people said smith but how do you react when someone s finally hitting you back we ve been slugging it out all year years later smith went on to criticize gary anderson in particular for his missed field goal and its contribution to vikings loss media analysis by virtue of their loss 1998 vikings became first team in nfl history to compile a regular season record of 15 1 and not win super bowl fox sports nbc sports and nfl network each named team as one of five greatest not to win super bowl and coach dennis green believed that 1998 vikings would have been considered best nfl team of their generation had they gone on to win in a 2018 retrospective sports illustrated called 1998 vikings greatest team never to make it loss had a dramatic effect on minnesota sports culture as 1998 vikings were considered team most likely to deliver a super bowl championship to a franchise that had already suffered multiple heartbreaking defeats numerous publications have noted influence that loss had on vikings fan base brian offensive coordinator of 1998 vikings went as far as stating i m not sure city had ever rebounded from it damon of cbs radio and don banks of sports illustrated both consider vikings loss in championship game as one of most devastating in nfl history with banks noting that vikings have never completely recovered from that game this perception has also extended into popular culture as game became a plot point in episode little minnesota of television show how i met your mother when robin a canadian character asks significance of a banner in a minnesota themed bar that reads i m drinking till i forget 1999 nfc championship gary anderson s missed kick has been singled out as main contributing factor to vikings loss as falcons were able to capitalize on late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win game considering this impact on game s outcome and historic performances of anderson and 1998 vikings team miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in greater history of nfl paul allen play by play radio announcer for vikings and dan barreiro both consider miss as one of most devastating moments in history of minnesota sports according to chad hartman another sports radio host based in minneapolis anderson will always be known as guy who was a part of screwing up vikings trip to super bowl even though he had this magnificent season espn voted miss as most memorable play in vikings history and espn contributor ben goessling believes that miss influenced misfortunes that franchise faced in subsequent years including three further nfc championship losses in 2000 2009 and 2017 cunningham concurred by claiming with that kick it just seemed like whole franchise went wide left anderson has claimed that in greater context miss was not particularly notable and it is only remembered because falcons won game buchanan who was attempting to block anderson s kick believes that anderson would not have been able to convert field goal regardless since if kick was on target it would have hit buchanan in face mask vikings backup quarterback brad johnson echoed this sentiment stating i think someone got loose on left end and they almost blocked it and anderson tried to slice it in there some sportswriters as well as randle have defended anderson claiming that vikings defense deserves real blame for loss for allowing atlanta to tie game after anderson s miss barreiro also criticized performance of cunningham whom he felt did not handle pressure of game well and called dreadful down stretch vikings coach dennis green has been criticized for his decision to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before end of regulation radio host bob author of best minnesota sports arguments called it one of all time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport of green s play call peter king of sports illustrated wrote minnesota coach dennis green did a great job this year but if he doesn t wake up and stare at ceiling in next few days and say out loud boy i screwed that one up then he s not being honest with himself nonetheless local minneapolis newspaper star tribune has contended that taking a knee was correct decision due to performance of vikings offense whose struggles that day were also noted by carter falcons missed playoffs following season and would not return until 2002 following 2001 season chandler was released by team and jamal anderson retired due to a knee injury franchise would not reach super bowl again until 2016 season when they lost in overtime to new england patriots 34 28 as a result their win in 1998 nfc championship game stood as franchise s proudest moment for years particularly due to atmosphere of pessimism that surrounded franchise at time an nfl films retrospective on falcons season noted that years of pain were wiped away in one unforgettable afternoon and dan weiner stated that 1998 season was a dream come true for once atlanta falcons made believers of us all in 2010 espn named 1998 team as greatest falcons team of all time and network also voted morton andersen s game winning field goal as top play in falcons history

having had surgery and you could have heard a pin drop we wanted to hear every last word he had to say reeves described his time during season as more rewarding than any other teams i ve been involved in and to falcons special teams coach joe decamillis reeves leadership that season was his best coaching job ever cbs called reeves return an amazing comeback that people will be talking about for years chandler was considered to be offensive hero of game despite attention that vikings offense received during season media analysis before game noted that vikings defense needed to focus on shutting down falcons running back jamal anderson feeling overlooked chandler used coverage as extra motivation in a retrospective for website geoff detailed end of game in which he claims that chandler embarked on drive of his life an 8 play 71 yard masterpiece finding mathis from 16 yards out for tying score playoffs in hours before afc championship game denver broncos were watching nfc championship game on jumbotron at mile high stadium to see who they would play in super bowl xxxiii should they defeat new york jets broncos head coach mike shanahan expressed surprise at anderson s missed kick and running back terrell davis said that falcons subsequent victory put broncos in mindset that they had won super bowl already as their greatest potential challenge had been eliminated this distraction nearly cost broncos game against jets as broncos played a very poor game tim connolly vikings team president at time recalled that shanahan insinuated relief that broncos were not playing vikings when two met at a reception after conference championship games two weeks later in super bowl falcons played broncos game pitting coach dan reeves against his former team and their star quarterback john elway reeves had led broncos to three super bowl appearances all losses and he was fired as broncos head coach after 1992 nfl season afterward elway was quoted as saying these last three years have been hell i know i would not have been back here if dan reeves had been here it wasn t worth it to me i didn t enjoy it it wasn t any fun and i got tired of working with him reeves responded by saying just tell him it wasn t exactly heaven for me either one of these days i hope he grows up maybe he ll mature sometime during his tenure reeves had also fired shanahan who was an assistant coach on team and these points of contention became a media storyline entering game nonetheless all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed falcons lost super bowl xxxiii by a score of 34 19 which earned broncos their second consecutive super bowl victory game was anticipated as a match up between vikings and broncos and falcons presence in game
