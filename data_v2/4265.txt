1880 united states presidential election was 24th quadrennial presidential election held on tuesday november 2 1880 voter turnout rate was one of highest in nation s history incumbent president rutherford b hayes did not seek re election keeping a promise made during 1876 campaign after longest convention in party s history divided republicans chose another ohioan representative james a garfield as their standard bearer democratic party chose general winfield scott hancock of pennsylvania as their nominee dominance of two major parties began to fray as an upstart left wing party greenback party nominated another civil war general for president iowa congressman james b weaver in a campaign fought mainly over issues of civil war loyalties tariffs and chinese immigration garfield and hancock each took just over 48 percent of popular vote weaver and two other minor candidates neal dow and john w phelps together made up remaining percentage election of 1880 was sixth consecutive presidential election won by republicans second longest winning streak in american history after democratic republican party during period 1800 1824 in end popular vote totals of two main candidates were separated by 1 898 votes smallest victory in popular vote ever recorded in electoral college however garfield s victory was decisive he won nearly all of populous northern states to achieve a majority of 214 electoral votes to 155 for hancock hancock s sweep of southern states was not enough for victory but it cemented his party s dominance of region for generations this is first presidential election in which people in every state at time were able to vote for president in 1876 colorado appointed electors by state legislature due to insufficient time to organize an election in 1864 1872 some states skipped out due to civil war or reconstruction and before then some states used state legislature including south carolina which used system up through 1860 background since before civil war two major parties were republicans and democrats and after end of reconstruction era in 1877 national electorate was closely divided between them party membership was only partly based on ideology party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background as well as civil war loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters most northern protestants voted republican as did black southerners on other hand white southerners and northern catholics generally voted democratic tariff reform and gold standard also divided country and major parties monetary debate was over basis for value of united states dollar nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in united states until civil war when mounting costs of war forced united states congress to issue greenbacks dollar bills backed by government bonds greenbacks helped pay for war but resulted in most severe inflation since american revolution after war bondholders and other creditors especially in north wanted to return to a gold standard at same time debtors often in south and west benefited from way inflation reduced real value of their debts and workers and some businessmen liked way inflation made for easy credit issue cut across parties producing dissension among republicans and democrats alike and spawning a third party greenback party in 1876 when both major parties nominated hard money candidates i e candidates who favored gold backed currency instead of soft money greenbacks that generated inflation monetary debate intensified as congress effectively demonetized silver in 1873 and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879 while limiting their circulation as 1880 election season began nation s money was backed by gold alone but issue was far from settled tariff policy was a source of conflict in late 19th century american politics during civil war congress raised protective tariffs to new heights this was done partly to pay for war but partly because high tariffs were popular in north a high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive which made it easier for american businesses to sell goods domestically republicans supported high tariffs as a way to protect american jobs and increase prosperity democrats generally condemned them as a source of higher prices for goods whereas higher revenues that they generated for federal government were not needed after conclusion of civil war many northern democrats supported high tariffs however for same economic reasons that northern republicans did in interest of party unity they often sought to avoid question as much as possible four years earlier in election of 1876 republican rutherford b hayes of ohio defeated democrat samuel j tilden of new york in one of most hotly contested presidential elections in nation s history results initially indicated a democratic victory but electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before new president was to be inaugurated members of both parties in congress agreed to convene a bipartisan electoral commission which ultimately decided race for hayes for democrats stolen election became a rallying cry and democratic majority in house of representatives spent much of 1878 investigating it although they failed to turn up any new evidence against their republican foes at first tilden was seen as front runner for 1880 nomination for leading republicans hayes s inauguration in 1877 signaled start of backroom maneuverings for nomination in 1880 even before his election hayes had pledged not to run for a second term leaving path to white house open in 1880 his cabinet selections alienated many party leaders as well deepening growing divide within republican party between forces loyal to new york senator roscoe conkling and those loyal to maine senator james g blaine conventions parties agreed on their respective platforms and nominees at conventions which met in summer before election republicans republican convention met first convening in chicago illinois on june 2 of men vying for republican nomination three strongest candidates leading up to convention were former president ulysses s grant senator james g blaine and treasury secretary john sherman grant had been leading military commander for northern forces during civil war and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877 he was seeking an unprecedented third term in office he was backed by conkling s faction of republican party now known as stalwarts they are mainly known for their opposition to civil service reforms sought by president hayes blaine a senator and former representative from maine was backed by half breed faction of party which did support civil service reform sherman brother of civil war general william tecumseh sherman was a former senator from ohio serving in hayes s cabinet he was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of major factions on first ballot grant and blaine gleaned 304 and 285 votes respectively while sherman received 93 none of candidates were close to victory and balloting continued in order to determine a winner many more ballots were taken but no candidate prevailed after thirty fifth ballot blaine and sherman delegates switched their support to new dark horse candidate representative james a garfield from ohio on next ballot garfield won nomination when he received 399 votes most of them former blaine and sherman delegates to placate grant faction garfield s ohio supporters suggested levi p morton for vice president morton declined based on conkling s advice they next offered nomination to chester a arthur another new york stalwart conkling also advised him to decline but he accepted he was nominated and longest ever republican national convention was adjourned on june 8 1880 democrats later that month democrats held their convention in cincinnati ohio six men were officially candidates for nomination at convention and several others also received votes of these two leading candidates were major general winfield scott hancock from pennsylvania and senator thomas f bayard from delaware tilden was not officially a candidate but he wielded a heavy influence over convention tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign leading some delegates to defect to other candidates while others stayed loyal to their old standard bearer as convention opened some delegates favored bayard a conservative senator while others supported hancock a career soldier and civil war hero still others flocked to men they saw as surrogates for tilden including henry b payne from ohio an attorney and former congressman and samuel j randall from pennsylvania speaker of united states house of representatives first round of balloting was inconclusive with hancock and bayard leading count before second round tilden s withdrawal from campaign became known for certain delegates then shifted to hancock who was nominated william hayden english a conservative politician and businessman from swing state of indiana was nominated for vice president others greenback party convention gathered in chicago in mid june using hall recently vacated by republicans party was a newcomer to political scene in 1880 having arisen as a response to economic depression that followed panic of 1873 mostly in nation s west and south during civil war congress had authorized greenbacks a form of money redeemable in government bonds rather than in gold as was traditional after war many democrats and republicans in east sought to return to gold standard and government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation reduction of money supply combined with economic depression made life harder for debtors farmers and industrial laborers greenback party hoped to draw support from these groups beyond their support for a larger money supply they also favored an eight hour work day safety regulations in factories and an end to child labor six men were candidates for greenback nomination james b weaver an iowa congressman and civil war general was clear favorite but two other congressmen benjamin f butler from massachusetts and hendrick b wright from pennsylvania also commanded considerable followings weaver triumphed quickly winning a majority of 850 delegates votes on first ballot barzillai j chambers a texas businessman and confederate veteran was likewise nominated for vice president on initial vote more tumultuous was fight over platform as delegates from disparate factions of left wing movement clashed over women s suffrage chinese immigration and extent to which government should regulate working conditions a convention of prohibition party also met that month in cleveland ohio prohibitionists more of a movement than a party focused their efforts on banning alcohol most party members came from pietist churches and most were former republicans only twelve states sent delegates to convention and platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of day focusing instead on evils of alcohol for president prohibitionists nominated neal dow a civil war general from maine as mayor of portland dow helped to pass maine law which banned sale of alcohol in city it became model for temperance laws around country finally a revived anti masonic party nominated john w phelps another civil war general on a platform of opposition to freemasonry political gave weaver little chance of victory and dow and phelps none at all candidates garfield thumb garfield arthur election poster james abram garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an ohio farm by his widowed mother he worked at various jobs including on a canal boat in his youth beginning at age 17 he studied at williams college in williamstown massachusetts from which he graduated in 1856 a year later garfield entered politics as a republican he married lucretia rudolph in 1858 and served as a member of ohio state senate 1859 1861 garfield opposed confederate secession served as a major general in union army during civil war and fought in battles of middle creek shiloh and chickamauga he was first elected to congress in 1862 to represent ohio s 19th district throughout garfield s extended congressional service after civil war he firmly supported gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator garfield initially agreed with radical republican views regarding reconstruction but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen after his nomination garfield met with party leaders in an attempt to heal schism between stalwarts and half breeds in his formal letter to party accepting his nomination written with advice from party leaders he endorsed ideas of high tariffs and sound money but drew particular attention to issues of chinese immigration and civil service reform on both garfield sought a moderate path he called for some restrictions on former through treaty renegotiation with chinese government he straddled divide on civil service reform saying that he agreed with concept while promising to make no appointments without consulting party leaders a position 20th century biographer allan peskin called inconsistent as was traditional at time garfield conducted a front porch campaign returning to his home for duration of contest and leaving actual campaigning to surrogates hancock thumb hancock english election poster winfield scott hancock was born and raised in pennsylvania he attended united states military academy at west point and served in army for four decades including service in mexican american war and as a union general in civil war known to his army colleagues as hancock superb he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at battle of gettysburg in 1863 where he led defense of pickett s charge his military service continued after civil war as hancock participated in military reconstruction of south and army s presence at western frontier during reconstruction he sided with then president andrew johnson in working for a quick end to military occupation of south and a return to government by pre war establishment hancock s reputation as a war hero at gettysburg combined with his status as a prominent democrat with impeccable unionist credentials and pro states rights views made him a quadrennial presidential possibility hancock was officially notified of his nomination in july and responded with traditional letter of acceptance as garfield had democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement which according to biographer david m jordan was bland and general after scorning previous years of republican rule hancock sought to tamp down fears that election of a democrat would overturn results of war and reconstruction a common republican campaign theme unlike garfield hancock had no record in elected office but acceptance letter gave no further indication of his political preferences hancock remained on active duty during campaign at his post on governors island in new york harbor weaver upright thumb weaver chambers campaign ribbon james baird weaver was born in ohio and moved to iowa as a boy when his family claimed a homestead on frontier he became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers joining and quitting several political parties in furtherance of progressive causes in which he believed after serving in union army in civil war weaver returned to iowa and worked for election of republican candidates after making several unsuccessful attempts at republican nominations to various offices and growing dissatisfied with conservative wing of party in 1877 weaver switched to greenback party advocating an increased money supply and stricter regulation of big business as a greenbacker with democratic support weaver won election to house of representatives in 1878 unlike major party candidates weaver planned to take field himself giving speeches around country his running mate chambers was to do same until a fall from a train in july disabled him for duration of campaign as greenbackers had only ticket that included a southerner he hoped to make inroads in that region weaver s path to victory already unlikely was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where democratic and greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote republicans his party s message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in south as greenbackers would face same obstacles republicans did in face of increasing black disenfranchisement campaign thumb left a cartoon from harper s weekly suggests that defeated confederates will overturn results of civil war should hancock be elected bloody shirt hancock and democrats expected to carry solid south while much of north was considered safe territory for garfield and republicans most of campaign would involve a handful of close states including new york and a few of midwestern states national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there practical differences between major party candidates were few and republicans began campaign with familiar theme of waving bloody shirt reminding northern voters that democratic party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war and that if they held power they would reverse gains of that war dishonor union veterans and pay confederate soldiers pensions out of federal treasury with fifteen years having passed since end of war and union generals at head of all of major and minor party tickets appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting voters democrats for their part campaigned on character of candidates they attacked garfield for his connection with credit mobilier of america scandal of early 1870s in which many members of congress were bribed by credit mobilier corporation a railroad construction company garfield s precise involvement was unknown but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest democrats used incident as a contrast with hancock who as a career army officer stood apart from congress and lobbyists many in republican party were reluctant to directly criticize hero of gettysburg but they did characterize hancock as uninformed on issues and some of his former comrades in arms gave critical speeches regarding his character democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve nation jordan later characterized their message as simply our man is better than your man greenbackers saw impact of civil war loyalties more acutely as they vied for southern votes weaver embarked on a speaking tour of south in july and august although local greenback parties had seen some recent success national party with an ex republican union general at head of ticket faced more opposition party s courtship of black voters too threatened white democratic establishment leading to violent outbursts at weaver s rallies and threats against his supporters as weaver campaigned in north in september and october republicans accused him of purposely dividing vote to help democrats win a plurality in marginal states although weaver refused to cooperate with democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors in state level races greenback candidates did often combine with democrats to defeat republican candidates in september gubernatorial race in maine one such fusion ticket nominated harris m plaisted who narrowly defeated incumbent republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party surprise defeat sent a shock through garfield campaign and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving bloody shirt tariffs and immigration thumb hancock s blunder about tariffs may have harmed his standing with northern industrial workers after their defeat in maine republicans began to emphasize policy differences more one significant difference between them and democrats was a purposely vague statement in democratic platform endorsing a tariff for revenue only garfield s campaigners used this statement to paint democrats as unsympathetic to plight of industrial laborers a group that benefited from a high protective tariff tariff issue cut democratic support in industrialized northern states which were essential in establishing a democratic majority hancock made situation worse when attempting to strike a moderate stance he said tariff question is a local question while not completely inaccurate tariff preferences often reflected local concerns statement was at odds with democrats platform and suggested that hancock did not understand issue change in tactics appeared to be effective as october state elections in ohio and indiana resulted in republican victories there discouraging democrats about their chances following month democratic party leaders had selected english as hancock s running mate because of his popularity in indiana with their state level defeat there some talked of dropping english from ticket but he convinced them that october losses owed more to local issues and that democratic ticket could still carry indiana if not ohio in november in last weeks before election issue of chinese immigration entered race both major parties as well as greenbackers pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from china which native born workers in western states believed was depressing their wages on october 20 however a democratic newspaper published a letter purportedly from garfield to a group of businessmen pledging to keep immigration at current levels so that industry could keep workers wages low garfield denounced letter as a ruse but not before one hundred thousand copies of newspaper were mailed to california and oregon once letter was exposed as a forgery garfield biographer peskin believes it may even have gained votes for republican in east but it likely weakened him in west results extremely close election with very high turnout reflected typical pattern of gilded age democrats were assured of a solid south electoral vote as well as most of border states republicans captured northeast and midwest winning critical swing states of new york ohio and indiana republicans captured electoral vote 214 155 but popular vote margin was under 8000 out of over 9 million votes cast republicans won house of representatives 147 135 but senate was evenly split with vice president casting deciding vote justin doenecke presidential election of 1880 in when all ballots were counted fewer than 2 000 votes separated garfield and hancock closest popular vote of any american presidential election before or since voters showed their interest in election by turning out in record numbers 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot among largest percentages in american history each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of vote weaver won more than 3 percent tripling greenback total of four years earlier other minor party candidates fared far worse as dow and phelps earned 0 1 and 0 01 percent respectively narrow victory carried over into congressional vote as republicans won house by a twelve seat margin and senate was evenly divided garfield carried crucial state of new york by 20 000 votes out of 1 1 million cast there other states were much closer hancock s margin of victory in california was only 144 votes in electoral college vote was more decisive as expected hancock carried south and border states but garfield swept all but one of northern states exception was new jersey which he lost by just two thousand votes both candidates carried nineteen states but garfield s triumphs in more populous north translated into a 214 155 electoral college victory sectional divide of vote more deeply enforced republicans retreat from south after reconstruction and demonstrated that they could win without competing there weaver s resistance to fusion had no effect on result combined democratic and greenback vote would have carried indiana but not any other of states garfield won and result would still have been a republican majority in electoral college hancock was convinced that republicans won new york by fraud lacking evidence and mindful of turmoil caused by disputed election four years earlier democrats did not pursue matter irregularities in virginia a split in democratic party over payment of state debts led to two democratic electoral slates being nominated one by regular debt paying funder democrats other by readjuster or anti debt paying faction of party both slates were pledged to hancock ticket republicans initially hoped split could lead garfield to win state but results were otherwise readjuster ticket received 31 527 votes but funder democrats took 96 449 votes enough to defeat republicans whose slate had 84 020 although hancock won georgia s popular vote easily there was an irregularity in that state s electoral votes according to article ii section 1 clause 3 of constitution congress may determine time of choosing electors and day on which they shall give their votes which day shall be same throughout united states in 1792 congress had set date for electoral college to vote on first wednesday in december which in 1880 fell on december 1 however georgia s electors failed to cast their ballots on december 1 instead voting on following wednesday december 8 congress chose to count georgia s vote in official tally anyway had they not done so hancock s electoral vote would have been 144 not 155 detailed results cartographic gallery results by state results

arthur served as president after garfield s 1881 assassination as garfield entered office in march 1881 republican party schism that had been patched up for election tore apart once more garfield appointed blaine to cabinet and conkling s stalwart faction became irked at their lack of control over patronage even in conkling s home state of new york garfield appointed william h robertson a civil service reform supporter to most lucrative government post in new york and refused to withdraw nomination despite conkling s protests in response conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in closely divided senate to a halt in may conkling and fellow new york senator thomas c platt resigned from senate in protest two stalwarts expected new york legislature to them in triumph instead legislature deadlocked for months eventually declining to return either man to senate before that result was known however tragedy struck as charles guiteau a mentally unstable man
