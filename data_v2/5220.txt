gallipoli campaign also known as dardanelles campaign battle of gallipoli or battle of canakkale was a campaign of first world war that took place on gallipoli peninsula gelibolu in modern turkey from 17 february 1915 to 9 january 1916 entente powers britain france and russian empire sought to weaken ottoman empire one of central powers by taking control of straits that provided a supply route to russia allies attack on ottoman forts at entrance of dardanelles in february 1915 failed and was followed by an amphibious landing on gallipoli peninsula in april 1915 to capture ottoman capital of constantinople istanbul in january 1916 after eight months fighting with approximately 250 000 casualties on each side land campaign was abandoned and invasion force withdrawn it was a costly defeat for allies and for sponsors especially first lord of admiralty 1911 1915 winston churchill campaign was considered a great ottoman victory in turkey it is regarded as a defining moment in history of state a final surge in defence of motherland as ottoman empire retreated struggle formed basis for turkish war of independence and declaration of republic of turkey eight years later with mustafa kemal ataturk who rose to prominence as a commander at gallipoli as founder and president campaign is often considered to be beginning of australian and new zealand national consciousness 25 april

mediterranean an idea originally presented by boghos nubar in 1914 this plan was developed by secretary of state for war field marshal earl kitchener to sever capital from syria palestine and egypt alexandretta was an area with a christian population and was strategic centre of empire s railway network its capture would have cut empire in two vice admiral sir richard peirse east indies station ordered captain frank larkin of to alexandretta on 13 december 1914 and french cruiser were also there kitchener was working on plan as late as march 1915 and was beginning of british attempt to incite an arab revolt alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than france could allocate and politically france did not want british operating in their sphere of influence a position to which britain had agreed in 1912 by late 1914 on western front franco british counter offensive of first battle of marne had ended and belgians british and french had suffered many casualties in first battle of ypres in flanders war of manoeuvre had ended and been replaced by trench warfare german empire and austria hungary closed overland trade routes between britain and france in west and russia in east white sea in arctic north and sea of okhotsk in far east were icebound in winter and distant from eastern front baltic sea was blockaded by kaiserliche marine imperial german navy and entrance to black sea through dardanelles was controlled by ottoman empire while ottomans remained neutral supplies could still be sent to russia through dardanelles but prior to ottoman entry into war straits had been closed in november ottomans began to mine waterway french minister of justice aristide briand proposed in november to attack ottoman empire but this was rejected and an attempt by british to bribe ottomans to join allied side also failed later that month winston churchill first lord of admiralty proposed a naval attack on dardanelles based in part on erroneous reports of ottoman troop strength churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships which could not operate against german high seas fleet in a dardanelles operation with a small occupation force provided by army it was hoped that an attack on ottomans would also draw bulgaria and greece formerly ottoman possessions into war on allied side on 2 january 1915 grand duke nicholas of russia appealed to britain for assistance against ottomans who were conducting an offensive in caucasus planning began for a naval demonstration in dardanelles to divert ottoman troops from caucasia naval campaign attempt to force straits thumb upright 1 5 graphic map of dardanelles on 17 february 1915 a british seaplane from flew a reconnaissance sortie over straits two days later first attack on dardanelles began when a strong anglo french task force including british dreadnought began a long range bombardment of ottoman coastal artillery batteries british had intended to use eight aircraft from ark royal to spot for bombardment but harsh conditions rendered all but one of these a short type 136 unserviceable a period of bad weather slowed initial phase but by 25 february outer forts had been reduced and entrance cleared of mines after this royal marines were landed to destroy guns at kum kale and seddulbahir while naval bombardment shifted to batteries between kum kale and frustrated by mobility of ottoman batteries which evaded allied bombardments and threatened minesweepers sent to clear straits churchill began pressuring naval commander admiral sackville carden to increase fleet s efforts carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 march sent a cable to churchill stating that fleet could expect to arrive in istanbul within 14 days a sense of impending victory was heightened by interception of a german wireless message that revealed ottoman dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition when message was relayed to carden it was agreed main attack would be launched on or around 17 march it transpired that carden suffering from stress was placed on sick list by medical officer and command was taken over by admiral john de robeck 18 march 1915 thumb 400px panoramic view of allied fleet in dardanelles on 18 march 1915 allied fleet comprising with an array of cruisers and destroyers began main attack against narrowest point of dardanelles where straits are wide despite some damage to allied ships engaging forts by ottoman return fire minesweepers were ordered along straits in ottoman official account by 2 00 p m all telephone wires were cut all communications with forts were interrupted some of guns had been knocked out in consequence artillery fire of defence had slackened considerably struck a mine causing her to capsize in two minutes with just 75 survivors out of a total crew of 718 minesweepers manned by civilians retreated under ottoman artillery fire leaving minefields largely intact and struck mines and irresistible was sunk with most of her surviving crew rescued inflexible was badly damaged and withdrawn there was confusion during battle about cause of damage some participants blamed torpedoes was sent to rescue irresistible struck a mine and was abandoned eventually to sink french battleships and sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by ottoman minelayer ten days before and were also damaged losses forced de robeck to sound general recall to protect what remained of his force during planning of campaign naval losses had been anticipated and mainly obsolete battleships unfit to face german fleet had been sent some of senior naval officers like commander of queen elizabeth commodore roger keyes felt that they had come close to victory believing that ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition but views of de robeck first sea lord jackie fisher and others prevailed allied attempts to force straits using naval power were terminated due to losses and bad weather planning to capture turkish defences by land to open way for ships began two allied submarines tried to traverse dardanelles but were lost to mines and strong currents preparations for invasion allied landing preparations thumb upright 1 0 french troops land at lemnos 1915 after failure of naval attacks troops were assembled to eliminate ottoman mobile artillery which was preventing allied minesweepers from clearing way for larger vessels kitchener appointed general sir ian hamilton to command of mediterranean expeditionary force mef soldiers from australian imperial force aif and new zealand expeditionary force nzef were encamped in egypt undergoing training prior to being sent to france australian and new zealand troops were formed into australian and new zealand army corps anzac commanded by lieutenant general sir william birdwood comprising volunteer 1st australian division and new zealand and australian division anzac troops were joined by regular 29th division and royal naval division french corps expeditionnaire d orient orient expeditionary corps consisting of metropolitan and colonial troops was subsequently placed under hamilton s command over following month hamilton prepared his plan and british and french divisions joined australians in egypt hamilton chose to concentrate on southern part of gallipoli peninsula at cape helles and seddulbahir where an unopposed landing was expected allies initially discounted fighting ability of ottoman soldiers naivete of allied planners was illustrated by a leaflet that was issued to british and australians while they were still in egypt underestimation of ottoman military potential stemmed from a sense of superiority among allies because of decline of ottoman empire and its poor performance in libya in 1911 and balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 allied intelligence failed to adequately prepare for campaign in some cases relying on information gained from egyptian travel guides troops for assault were loaded on transports in order they were to disembark causing a long delay which meant that many troops including french at mudros were forced to detour to alexandria to embark on ships that would take them into battle a five week delay until end of april ensued during which ottomans strengthened their defences on peninsula although bad weather during march and april might have delayed landings anyway preventing supply and reinforcement following preparations in egypt hamilton and his headquarters staff arrived at mudros on 10 april anzac corps departed egypt in early april and assembled on island of lemnos in greece on 12 april where a small garrison had been established in early march and practice landings were undertaken british 29th division departed for mudros on 7 april and royal naval division rehearsed on island of skyros after arriving there on 17 april that day british submarine tried to run straits but hit a submarine net ran aground and was shelled by a turkish fort killing its commander lieutenant commander theodore s brodie and six of his crew survivors were forced to surrender allied fleet and british and french troops assembled at mudros ready for landings but poor weather from 19 march grounded allied aircraft for nine days and on 24 days only a partial programme of reconnaissance flights were possible ottoman defensive preparations thumb left upright 1 0 dispositions of ottoman 5th army ottoman force prepared to repel a landing on either side of straits was 5th army this force which initially consisted of five divisions with another en route was a conscript force commanded by sanders many of senior officers in 5th army were also german ottoman commanders and senior german officers debated best means of defending peninsula all agreed that best defence was to hold high ground on ridges of peninsula there was disagreement as to where enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces lieutenant colonel mustafa kemal was familiar with gallipoli peninsula from his operations against bulgaria in balkan wars and forecast that cape helles southern tip of peninsula and gaba tepe were likely areas for landing kemal believed that british would use their naval power to command land from every side at tip of peninsula at gaba tepe short distance to eastern coast meant that allies could easily reach narrows right angled bend in middle of dardanelles sanders considered bay on asiatic coast to be most vulnerable to invasion since terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack most important ottoman batteries guarding straits and a third of 5th army was assembled there two divisions were concentrated at bulair at north end of gallipoli peninsula to protect supply and communication lines to defences further down peninsula 19th division kemal and 9th division were placed along aegean coast and at cape helles on tip of peninsula sanders kept bulk of ottoman forces inland in reserve leaving a minimum of troops guarding coast 3rd division and a cavalry brigade arrived from istanbul in early april bringing front line strength of ottomans to which sanders concentrated in three groups a maximum effort to improve land and sea communications was ordered to move reinforcements swiftly to danger points troops moved at night to avoid allied air reconnaissance sanders strategy was opposed by ottoman commanders including kemal who believed that defenders were too widely dispersed to defeat invasion on beaches sanders was certain that a rigid system of defence would fail and that only hope of success lay in mobility of three groups particularly 19th division near boghali in general reserve ready to move to bulair gaba tepe or asiatic shore thumb upright 1 0 heavy artillery from german inland gun emplacement 1915 time needed by british to organise landings meant that sanders colonel hans kannengiesser and other german officers supported by esat pasha iii corps had more time to prepare their defences sanders later noted british allowed us four good weeks of respite for all this work before their great disembarkation this respite just sufficed for most indispensable measures to be taken roads were constructed small boats built to carry troops and equipment across narrows beaches were wired and improvised mines were constructed from torpedo warheads trenches and gun emplacements were dug along beaches and troops went on route marches to avoid lethargy kemal whose 19th division was vital to defensive scheme observed beaches and awaited signs of an invasion from his post at boghali near ottomans created a small air force with german assistance and had four aircraft operating around canakkale in february conducting reconnaissance and army co operation sorties from 11 april an ottoman aircraft made frequent flights over mudros keeping watch on assembly of british naval force and an airfield was established near gallipoli landings thumb left upright 1 25 landing at gallipoli april 1915 allies planned to land and secure northern shore to capture ottoman forts and artillery batteries so that a naval force could advance through narrows and sea of marmara towards istanbul scheduled for 23 april but postponed until 25 april due to bad weather landings were to be made at five beaches on peninsula 29th division was to land at helles on tip of peninsula and then advance upon forts at kilitbahir anzacs with 3rd australian infantry brigade spearheading assault were to land north of gaba tepe on aegean coast from where they could advance across peninsula cutting off ottoman troops in kilitbahir and stop reinforcements from reaching cape helles this sector of gallipoli peninsula became known as anzac area held by british and french became known as helles sector or helles french made a diversionary landing at kum kale on asian shore before re embarking to hold eastern area of helles sector royal naval division simulated landing preparations at bulair as a diversion and a new zealand officer bernard freyberg swam ashore under fire to light flares to distract defenders from real landings freyberg was later awarded distinguished service order arrangements for naval gunfire support to landings had originally included bombarding beaches and approaches but was changed to engagement of ridges during landings with beaches only to be shelled prior to landings no decision was ultimately made on issue of close support and it was left up to initiative of individual ships captains a reluctance to approach shore later impacted on landings at v and w beach where some of heaviest losses among infantry occurred while naval gunfire was of some assistance at s x and anzac even then its effectiveness was limited by initial confusion ashore broken terrain thick vegetation and lack of observation kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by royal naval air service rnas and allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from 3 squadron rnas commander charles samson which arrived at tenedos at end of march aircraft were unopposed by small ottoman air force at first and during planning force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet allies intelligence needs and make up for lack of adequate maps after landings allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance observed naval gunfire reported on ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids anzac cove allocated northern landing birdwood s force included 1st australian division major general william bridges and new zealand and australian division major general sir alexander godley a force of about force was to land and advance inland to cut lines of communication to ottoman forces in south 1st

transports into ships boats and be towed close to shore by steamboats and then row ashore thumb upright 1 0 landing of covering force from battleships red and destroyers orange at anzac cove 25 april 1915 at on morning of 25 april first wave of troops from 3rd brigade began moving towards shore on lighters and ships boats covering force landed approximately too far north in a bay just south of ari burnu due to undetected currents or a navigational error landing was more difficult over ground which rose steeply from beaches unlike objective to south which was more open landing site was garrisoned by only two ottoman companies but from positions on commanding ground ottomans inflicted numerous casualties on australians before being overcome broken terrain prevented a coordinated drive inland with australians on unfamiliar ground and with inaccurate maps in maze of steep ravines spurs and dense scrub australian parties that got forward quickly lost contact and were broken up into small groups some australian troops reached second ridge but fewer still reached their objectives and having become dispersed covering force could provide little support to follow up force 1st and 2nd brigades then new zealand and australian division landed on beaches around ari burnu but became entangled which took time to reorganise about four hours after landings began bulk of 1st australian division was ashore safely and its leading elements were pushing inland by mid morning kemal had reorganised defenders for a counter attack on commanding heights of chunuk bair and sari bair right flank of small lodgement taken by australians was driven in at with most of being lost during afternoon and evening left flank was pushed back from and nek by evening bridges and godley recommended re embarkation birdwood agreed but after advice from navy that re embarkation was impossible hamilton ordered troops dig in instead ottoman counter attack was eventually repulsed and australians established a perimeter roughly from walker s ridge in north to shell green in south anzac casualties on first day numbered around killed or wounded failure to secure high ground led to a tactical stalemate with landings contained by defenders in a perimeter less than long australian submarine lieutenant commander henry stoker penetrated straits on night of 24 25 april as landings

and sent a wireless report to fleet landing at cape helles was going well but landing at anzac cove was not as successful and anzac commander lieutenant general sir william birdwood contemplated re embarkation of his troops success of ae2 was a consideration in birdwood deciding to persist and reports about ae2 were relayed to soldiers ashore to improve morale stoker was ordered to generally run amok and with no enemies in sight he sailed into sea of marmara where ae2 cruised for five days to give impression of greater numbers and made several attacks against ottoman ships which failed because of mechanical problems with torpedoes cape helles helles landing was made by 29th division major general aylmer hunter weston division landed on five beaches in an arc about tip of peninsula

man s land dates and sweets from ottoman side and cans of beef and packs of cigarettes from allied side conditions at gallipoli grew worse for everyone as summer heat and poor sanitation resulted in an explosion in fly population eating became extremely difficult as unburied corpses became bloated and putrid precarious allied lodgements were poorly situated which caused supply and shelter problems a dysentery epidemic spread through allied trenches at anzac and helles while ottomans also suffered heavily from disease which resulted in many deaths evacuation after failure of august offensive gallipoli campaign drifted ottoman success began to affect public opinion in britain with criticism of hamilton s performance being smuggled out by keith murdoch ellis bartlett and other reporters stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to air of gloom and possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 october 1915 hamilton resisted suggestion fearing damage to british prestige but was sacked shortly afterwards and replaced by lieutenant general sir charles monro autumn and winter brought relief from heat but also led to gales blizzards and flooding resulting in men

with on 6 november rendezvous was kept by german u boat instead which torpedoed and sank e20 killing all but nine of crew situation at gallipoli was complicated by bulgaria joining central powers in early october 1915 british and french opened a second mediterranean front at salonika by moving three divisions from gallipoli and reducing flow of reinforcements a land route between germany and ottoman empire through bulgaria was opened and germans rearmed ottomans with heavy artillery capable of devastating allied trenches especially on confined front at anzac modern aircraft and experienced crews in late november an ottoman crew in a german albatros c i shot down a french aircraft over gaba tepe and austro hungarian and artillery units arrived providing a substantial reinforcement of ottoman artillery monro recommended evacuation to kitchener who in early november visited eastern mediterranean after consulting with commanders of viii corps at helles ix corps at suvla and anzac kitchener agreed with monro and passed his recommendation to british cabinet who confirmed decision to evacuate in early december due to narrowness of no man s land and winter weather many casualties were anticipated during embarkation untenable nature of allied position was made apparent by a rainstorm on 26 november 1915 downpour at suvla lasted for three days and there was a blizzard in early december rain flooded trenches drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into lines following snow killed still more men from exposure suvla and anzac were to be evacuated in late december last troops leaving before dawn on 20 december troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 december and ruses such as william scurry s self firing rifle which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to trigger were used to disguise allied departure at anzac cove troops maintained silence for an hour or more until curious ottoman troops ventured to inspect trenches whereupon anzacs opened fire a mine was detonated at nek which killed soldiers allied force was embarked with australians suffering no casualties on final night but large quantities of supplies and stores fell into ottoman hands thumb upright 1 0 left w beach helles on 7 january 1916 just prior to final evacuation helles was retained for a period but a decision to evacuate garrison was made on 28 december unlike evacuation from anzac cove ottoman forces were looking for signs of withdrawal having used interval to bring up reinforcements and supplies sanders mounted an attack on british at gully spur on 7 january 1916 with infantry and artillery but attack was a costly failure mines were laid with time fuzes and that night and on night of 7 8 january under cover of a naval bombardment british troops began to fall back from their lines to beaches where makeshift piers were used to board boats last british troops departed from lancashire landing around 04 00 on 8 january

predictions of up to and mules and of equipment were removed that could not be embarked were killed so as not to fall into ottoman hands and were left behind with smashed wheels as at anzac large amounts of supplies including 15 british and six french unserviceable artillery pieces which were destroyed gun carriages and ammunition were left behind hundreds of horses were slaughtered to deny them to ottomans a sailor was killed by debris from a magazine that exploded prematurely and a lighter and a picket boat were lost shortly after dawn ottomans retook helles in final days of campaign

when three shot down two rnas aircraft aftermath military repercussions thumb upright 1 0 respect to monument anzac soldier injured in arms of turkish troops historians are divided about how they summarise campaign s result broadbent describes campaign as a close fought affair that was a defeat for allies while carlyon views overall result as a stalemate peter hart disagrees arguing that ottoman forces held allies back from their real objectives with relative ease while haythornthwaite calls it a disaster for allies campaign did cause enormous damage to ottoman national resources and at that stage of war allies were in a better position to replace their losses than ottomans but ultimately allied attempt at securing a passage through dardanelles proved unsuccessful while it diverted ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in middle east campaign also consumed resources allies could have employed on western front and also resulted in heavy losses on allied side allied campaign was plagued by ill defined goals poor planning insufficient artillery inexperienced troops inaccurate maps poor intelligence overconfidence inadequate equipment and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels geography also proved a significant factor while allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit terrain to their advantage ottoman commanders were able to utilise high ground around allied landing beaches to position well sited defences that limited ability of allied forces to penetrate inland confining them to narrow beaches campaign s necessity remains subject of debate and recriminations that followed were significant highlighting schism that had developed between military strategists who felt allies should focus on fighting on western front and those who favoured trying to end war by attacking germany s soft underbelly its allies in east british and french submarine operations in sea of marmara were one significant area of success of gallipoli campaign forcing ottomans to abandon sea as a transport route between april and december 1915 nine british and four french submarines carried out 15 patrols sinking one battleship one destroyer five gunboats 11 troop transports 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight allied submarines sunk in strait or in sea of marmara during campaign there was always one british submarine in sea of marmara sometimes two in october 1915 there were four allied submarines in region e2 left sea of marmara on 2 january 1916 last british submarine in region four e class and five b class submarines remained in mediterranean sea following evacuation of helles by this time ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in area while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed official german naval historian admiral eberhard von later concluded that had sea lanes of communication been completely severed ottoman 5th army would likely have faced catastrophe as it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses effectively dislocating ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways gallipoli marked end for hamilton and stopford but hunter weston went on to lead viii corps on first day of battle of somme competence of australian brigade commanders john monash 4th infantry brigade and harry chauvel 1st light horse brigade new zealand and australian division was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command influence of kitchener waned after coalition government was formed in may 1915 partly because of growing sense of failure in dardanelles and culminated in kitchener being over ruled on support for french at salonika in early december 1915 when his influence on cabinet was at its lowest campaign gave confidence to ottomans in their ability to defeat allies in mesopotamia turks surrounded a british expedition at kut al amara forcing their surrender in april 1916 ottoman forces in southern palestine were poised to launch an attack against suez canal and egypt defeat at battle of romani however and lack of materials to complete military railway necessary for such an operation marked end of that ambition optimism gained from victory at gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and british remained on offensive in middle east for rest of war thumb upright 1 0 left sphinx one of battlefield s most distinctive physical landmarks lessons of campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as normandy landings in 1944 and during falklands war in 1982 lessons of campaign influenced us marine corps amphibious operations during pacific war and continue to influence us amphibious doctrine in 1996 theodore wrote that between wars campaign became a focal point for study of amphibious warfare in britain and united states in 2008 glenn wahlert wrote that gallipoli involved all four types of amphibious operations raid demonstration assault and withdrawal russell weigley wrote that analysis of campaign before second world war led to a belief among most of armed forces of world that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in italy tarawa and gilberts arguably this perception continued until normandy in june 1944 hart wrote that despite pessimistic analyses after 1918 situation after 1940 meant that landings from sea were unavoidable and it was only after normandy that belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome memory of gallipoli weighed heavily upon australians during planning of huon peninsula campaign in late 1943 in september australians made their first opposed amphibious landing since gallipoli at battle of finschhafen in new guinea landing was hampered by navigational errors and troops came ashore on wrong beaches but they had been trained according to lessons of gallipoli and quickly reorganised to push inland political effects political repercussions in britain had begun during battle fisher resigned in may after bitter conflict with churchill crisis that followed after conservatives learned that churchill would be staying forced prime minister h h asquith to end his liberal government and form a coalition government with conservative party asquith government responded to disappointment and outrage over gallipoli and kut by establishing commissions of inquiry into both episodes which had done much to destroy its faltering reputation for competence dardanelles commission was set up to investigate failure of expedition first report being issued in 1917 with final report published in 1919 following failure of dardanelles expedition sir ian hamilton commander of mef was recalled to london in october 1915 ending his military career churchill was demoted from first lord of admiralty as a condition of conservative entry to coalition but remained in cabinet in sinecure of chancellor of duchy of lancaster churchill resigned in november 1915 and left london for western front where he commanded an infantry battalion of royal scots fusiliers early in 1916 asquith was partly blamed for gallipoli and other disasters and was overthrown in december 1916 when david lloyd george proposed a war council under his authority with conservatives in coalition threatening to resign unless plan was implemented after failure to reach agreement lloyd george and then asquith resigned followed by lloyd george becoming prime minister lloyd george formed a new government from which churchill active again in house of commons from june 1916 was excluded because of conservative opposition in summer of 1917 churchill was eventually appointed to cabinet level post of minister of munitions but not to war cabinet final report of commission was issued in 1919 concluding that with forces available success was dependent on government giving priority to expedition and leaving british expeditionary force in france to make do commissioners found that hamilton had been over optimistic from beginning and had added to stopford s difficulties on 8 august 1915 hamilton emerged from investigation more favourably than perhaps was justified partly because he made devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from deliberations of commission hamilton was never given another army appointment casualties gallipoli casualties not including illness 371

france and flanders proportion of disease casualties to battle casualties was considerably higher in gallipoli campaign than it was on campaigns of western front cecil aspinall oglander british official historian gave number of ottoman troops evacuated sick largest cause of non battle admissions to hospital for british troops was dysentery with infected and another having diarrhoea other notable conditions were frostbite with gonorrhea and rheumatic fever allegations were made that allied forces had attacked or bombarded ottoman hospitals and hospital ships on several occasions between start of campaign and september 1915 by july 1915 hospitals had been built with and three hospital ships were in area french government disputed these complaints through red cross and british responded that if it happened then it was accidental russia in turn claimed that ottomans had attacked two of their hospital ships and but ottoman government replied that vessels had been victims of
