stepping outside he is taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by barbara even though he had been gone for less than a minute barbara claims he had been gone for two hours she and adam notice that they now lack reflections and they discover a handbook for recently deceased and realize they did not survive crash jane immediately sells house to deetz family from new york city charles deetz is a former real estate developer his wife delia a sculptor and his teenage goth daughter lydia from his first marriage is an aspiring photographer under guidance of interior designer otho delia begins to transform house into a posh modern art piece consulting handbook maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls where they discover that afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and usual overworked maitlands own caseworker juno informs them that they must remain in house for 125 years if they want deetzes out of house it is up to them to scare them away barbara s and adam s attempts at scaring family prove counterproductive despite their ability to shape shift into monsters as nobody can see or hear them while maitlands are away seeing juno lydia discovers handbook and reads it although adam and barbara remain invisible to charles and delia lydia can see ghost couple and befriends them against juno s advice maitlands contact miscreant betelgeuse pronounced beetlejuice juno s former assistant and now freelance bio exorcist ghost to scare away deetzes however betelgeuse quickly offends maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor and they reconsider hiring him and instead attempt themselves to wreak havoc during a small dinner party when deetzes have invited delia s agent bernard along with otho and other friends however living are only intrigued by turn of events small town s charm and supernatural events inspire charles to pitch his boss maxie dean on transforming town into a tourist hot spot but maxie wants proof of ghosts using handbook for recently deceased otho conducts what he thinks is a seance and summons adam and barbara but they begin to decay as otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead horrified lydia begrudgingly summons betelgeuse for help but he agrees to help her only on condition that she marry him enabling him to freely cause chaos in mortal world betelgeuse saves maitlands and disposes of maxie his wife and otho then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister maitlands intervene before ceremony is completed with barbara riding a sandworm through house to devour betelgeuse finally deetzes and maitlands agree to live in harmony within house adam barbara and lydia are seen in a remodeled part of house dancing to harry belafonte s jump in line with lydia floating in air to celebrate lydia getting an a on her math test charles is in den reading a book called living and dead by authors of handbook for recently deceased a manual on how living and dead can co exist meanwhile betelgeuse is stuck in afterlife waiting room there he attempts to cut in front of a witch doctor who shrinks his head in retaliation however being betelgeuse he remains upbeat this could be a good look for me cast production development financial success of pee wee s big adventure 1985 meant that burton was considered a bankable director and he began working on a script for batman with sam hamm while warner bros was willing to pay for script s development they were less willing to green light batman meanwhile burton had begun reading scripts that had been sent his way and was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality one of them being hot to trot david geffen handed burton script for beetlejuice written by mcdowell who wrote script for jar an episode of alfred hitchcock presents directed by burton wilson was brought on board to continue rewriting work with mcdowell though burton replaced mcdowell and wilson with skaaren due to creative differences burton s original choice for betelgeuse was sammy davis jr but geffen suggested keaton burton was unfamiliar with keaton s work but was quickly convinced burton cast ryder upon seeing her in lucas o hara quickly signed on while burton claimed it took a lot of time to convince other cast members to sign as they didn t know what to think of weird script budget was us 15 million with just us 1 million given over to visual effects work considering scale and scope of effects which included stop motion replacement animation prosthetic makeup puppetry and blue screen it was always burton s intention to make style similar to b movies he grew up with as a child i wanted to make them look cheap and purposely fake looking burton remarked burton had wanted to hire anton furst as production designer after being impressed with his work on company of wolves 1984 and full metal jacket 1987 though furst was committed on high spirits a choice he later regretted he hired bo welch his future collaborator on edward scissorhands 1990 and batman returns 1992 test screenings were met with positive feedback and prompted burton to film an epilogue featuring betelgeuse foolishly angering a witch doctor warner bros disliked title beetlejuice and wanted to call film house ghosts as a joke burton suggested name scared and was horrified when studio actually considered using it exterior shots were filmed in east corinth vermont writing mcdowell s original script is far less comedic and much darker maitlands car crash is depicted graphically with barbara s arm being crushed and couple screaming for help as they slowly drown in river a reference to this remained as barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost burton tim 1988 beetlejuice warner bros studios instead of possessing deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner maitlands cause a vine patterned carpet to come to life and attack deetzes by tangling them to their chairs character of betelgeuse envisioned by mcdowell as a winged demon who takes on form of a short middle eastern man is also intent on killing deetzes rather than scaring them and wanted out and out sex from lydia instead of wanting to marry her in this version of script betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned after which he is free to wreak havoc he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times and wanders world freely appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations mcdowell s script also featured a second deetz child nine year old cathy only person able to see maitlands and subject of betelgeuse s homicidal wrath in film s climax during which he mutilates her while in form of a rabid squirrel before revealing his true form in another version of script film was to have concluded with maitlands deetzes and otho conducting an exorcism ritual that destroys betelgeuse and maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into adam s model of their home which they refurbish to look like their house before deetzes moved in co author and producer larry wilson has talked about negative reaction to mcdowell s original script at universal where he was employed at time skaaren s rewrite drastically shifted film s tone eliminating graphic nature of maitlands deaths while depicting afterlife as a complex bureaucracy skaaren s rewrite also altered mcdowell s depiction of limbo that keeps barbara and adam trapped inside of their home in mcdowell s script it takes form of a massive empty void filled with giant clock gears that shred fabric of time and space as they move skaaren had barbara and adam encounter different every time they leave their home including clock world and sandworm s world identified as saturn s moon titan skaaren also introduced leitmotif of music accompanying barbara and adam s ghostly hijinks although his script specified r b tunes instead of harry belafonte and was to have concluded with lydia dancing to when a man loves a woman skaaren s first draft retained some of more sinister characteristics of mcdowell s betelgeuse but toned down character to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous betelgeuse s true form was that of middle eastern man and much of his dialogue was written in african american vernacular english this version concluded with deetzes returning to new york and leaving lydia in care of maitlands who with lydia s help transform exterior of their home into a stereotypical haunted house while returning interior to its previous state it also would have featured deleted scenes such as real estate agent jane trying to convince deetzes to allow her to sell house for them having sold it to them in first place charles and delia decline and a reveal on how beetlejuice had died centuries earlier that he had attempted to hang himself while drunk only to mess it up and died slowly choking to death rather than quickly by snapping his neck and wound up working for juno before striking it out on his own as a free lance bio exorcist retrospectively mcdowell was impressed at how many people made connection between film s title and star betelgeuse he added that writers and producers had received a suggestion sequel be named 69 202 after former star of sn

titled beetlejuice goes hawaiian tim thought it would be funny to match surfing backdrop of a beach movie with some sort of german expressionism because they re totally wrong together gems said story followed deetz family moving to hawaii where charles is developing a resort they soon discover that his company is building on burial ground of an ancient hawaiian kahuna spirit comes back from afterlife to cause trouble and beetlejuice becomes a hero by winning a surf contest with magic keaton and ryder agreed to do film on condition that burton directed but both he and keaton became distracted with batman returns burton was still interested in beetlejuice goes hawaiian in early 1991 impressed with daniel waters work on heathers burton approached him for a rewrite however he eventually signed waters to write script for batman returns by august 1993 producer david geffen hired pamela norris troop beverly hills saturday night live to rewrite warner bros approached kevin smith in 1996 to rewrite script though smith turned down offer in favor of superman lives smith later joked that his response was didn t we say all we needed to say in first beetlejuice must we go tropical in march 1997 gems released a statement saying beetlejuice goes hawaiian script is still owned by geffen company and it will likely never get made you really couldn t do it now anyway winona is too old for role and only way they could make it would be to totally recast it i don t wanna be guy that destroys legacy and memory of first film i would rather die i would rather just not make it i d rather just throw whole thing away than make something that pays no respect and doesn t live up even close to legacy of first film writer seth grahame smith in september 2011 warner bros hired seth grahame smith who collaborated with burton on dark shadows and abraham lincoln vampire hunter to write and produce a sequel to beetlejuice grahame smith signed on with intention of doing a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real something that is not just about cashing in is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone s throat he was also adamant that keaton would return and that warner bros would not recast role burton and keaton have not officially signed on but will return if script is good enough grahame smith met with keaton in february 2012 we talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff it s a priority for warner bros it s a priority for tim michael s been wanting to do it for 20 years and he ll talk to anybody about it who will listen story will be set in a real time frame from 1988 this will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel what s great is that for beetlejuice time means nothing in afterlife but world outside is a different story in november 2013 ryder hinted at a possible return for sequel as well by saying i m kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening it s 27 years later and i have to say i love lydia deetz so much she was such a huge part of me i would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if burton and keaton were involved in december 2014 burton stated it s a character that i love and i miss actually working with michael there s only one betelgeuse we re working on a script and i think it s probably closer than ever and i d love to work with him again in january 2015 writer grahame smith told entertainment weekly that script was finished and that he and burton intended to start filming beetlejuice 2 by end of year and that both keaton and ryder would return in their respective roles in august 2015 on late night with seth meyers ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in sequel in may 2016 burton stated it s something that i really would like to do in right circumstances but it s one of those films where it has to be right it s not a kind of a movie that cries out for a sequel it s not beetlejuice trilogy so it s something that if elements are right because i do love character and michael s amazing as that character so yeah we ll see but there s nothing concrete yet in october 2017 mike was hired to re write script in april 2019 warner bros stated sequel had been shelved in other media animated series due to film s financial success a beetlejuice animated
