everglades is a natural region of tropical wetlands in southern portion of u s state of florida comprising southern half of a large drainage basin within neotropic ecozone ecosystem it forms is not presently found anywhere else on earth system begins near orlando with kissimmee river which discharges into vast but shallow lake okeechobee water leaving lake in wet season forms a slow moving river wide and over long flowing southward across a limestone shelf to florida bay at southern end of state everglades experience a wide range of weather patterns from frequent flooding in wet season to drought in dry season seminole tribe gave large body of water name okeechobee meaning river of grass to describe sawgrass marshes part of a complex system of interdependent ecosystems that include cypress swamps estuarine mangrove forests of ten thousand islands tropical hardwood hammocks pine rockland and marine environment of florida bay throughout 20th century everglades suffered significant loss of habitat and environmental degradation human habitation in southern portion of florida peninsula dates to 15 000 years ago before european colonization region was dominated by native calusa and tequesta tribes with spanish colonization both tribes declined gradually during following two centuries seminole formed from mostly creek people who had been warring to north assimilated other peoples and created a new culture after being forced from northern florida into everglades during seminole wars of early 19th century after adapting to region they were able to resist removal by united states army migrants to region who wanted to develop plantations first proposed draining everglades in 1848 but no work of this type was attempted until 1882 canals were constructed throughout first half of 20th century and spurred south florida economy prompting land development in 1947 congress formed central and southern florida flood control project which built of canals levees and water control devices miami metropolitan area grew substantially at this time and everglades water was diverted to cities portions of everglades were transformed into farmland where primary crop was sugarcane approximately 50 percent of original everglades has been developed as agricultural or urban areas following this period of rapid development and environmental degradation ecosystem began to receive notable attention from conservation groups in 1970s internationally unesco and ramsar convention designated everglades a wetland area of global importance construction of a large airport north of everglades national park was blocked when an environmental study found that it would severely damage south florida ecosystem with heightened awareness and appreciation of region restoration began in 1980s with removal of a canal that had straightened kissimmee river however development and sustainability concerns have remained pertinent in region deterioration of everglades including poor water quality in lake okeechobee was linked to diminishing quality of life in south florida s urban areas in 2000 comprehensive everglades restoration plan was approved by congress to combat these problems to date it is most expensive and comprehensive environmental restoration attempt in history but its implementation has faced political complications names thumb this map made by u s military shows term everglades was in use by 1857 first written record of everglades was on spanish maps made by cartographers who had not seen land they named unknown area between gulf and atlantic coasts of florida laguna del espiritu santo lake of holy spirit area was featured on maps for decades without having been explored writer john grant forbes stated in 1811 indians represent southern points as impenetrable and british surveyors wreckers and coasters had not means of exploring beyond borders of sea coast and mouths of rivers british surveyor john gerard de brahm who mapped coast of florida in 1773 called area river glades both marjory stoneman douglas and linguist wallace mcmullen suggest that cartographers substituted ever for river name everglades first appeared on a map in 1823 although it was also spelled as ever glades as late as 1851 seminole call it pahokee meaning grassy water douglas pp 7 8 region was labeled pa hai on a u s military map from 1839 although it had earlier been called ever glades throughout second seminole war a 2007 survey by geographers ary j lamme and raymond k found that glades has emerged as a distinct vernacular region of florida it comprises interior areas and southernmost gulf coast of south florida largely corresponding to everglades itself it is one of most sparsely populated areas of state geology geology of south florida together with a warm wet subtropical climate provides conditions well suited for a large marshland ecosystem layers of porous and permeable limestone create water bearing rock and soil that affect climate weather and hydrology of south florida properties of rock underneath everglades can be explained by geologic history of state crust underneath florida was at one point part of african region of supercontinent gondwana about 300 million years ago north america merged with africa connecting florida with north america volcanic activity centered on eastern side of florida covered prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock continental rifting began to separate north america from gondwana about 180 million years ago lodge p 3 when florida was part of africa it was initially above water

formations that have most influence on everglades are miami limestone and fort thompson formation miami limestone has two facies miami oolite facies which underlies atlantic coastal ridge from southern palm beach county to southern miami dade county is made up of ooids tiny formations of egg shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate formed around a single grain of sand or shell fragment other facies which underlies eastern lower everglades in miami dade county and part of monroe county consists of fossilized bryozoan organisms unique structure was some of first material used in housing in early 20th century south florida composition of this sedimentary formation affects hydrology plant life and wildlife above it rock is especially porous and stores water during dry season in everglades and its chemical composition determines vegetation prevalent in region miami oolite facies also acts to impede flow of water from everglades to ocean between fort lauderdale and coot bay near cape sable metropolitan areas of miami fort lauderdale and west palm beach are located on a rise in elevation along eastern coast of florida called eastern coastal ridge that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation along western border of big cypress swamp is immokolee ridge or immokolee rise a slight rise of compressed sand that divides runoff between caloosahatchee river and big cypress this slight rise in elevation on both sides of everglades creates a basin and forces water that overflows lake okeechobee to creep toward southwest under both miami limestone formation and fort thompson limestone lies biscayne aquifer a surface aquifer that serves as miami metropolitan area s fresh water source rainfall and stored water in everglades replenish biscayne aquifer directly with rise of sea levels that occurred during pleistocene approximately 17 000 years ago runoff of water from lake okeechobee slowed and created vast marshland that is now known as everglades slower runoff also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet 5 5 m of peat in area presence of such peat deposits dated to about 5 000 years ago is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then hydrology thumb flow direction of water from lake okeechobee to florida bay source u s geological survey consistent everglades flooding is fed by extensive kissimmee caloosahatchee miami myakka and peace rivers in central florida kissimmee river is a broad floodplain that empties directly into lake okeechobee which at with an average depth of is a vast but shallow lake soil deposits in everglades basin indicate that peat is deposited where land is flooded consistently throughout year calcium deposits are left behind when flooding is shorter deposits occur in areas where water rises and falls depending on rainfall as opposed to water being stored in rock from one year to next calcium deposits are present where more limestone is exposed area from orlando to tip of florida peninsula was at one point a single drainage unit when rainfall exceeded capacity of lake okeechobee and kissimmee river floodplain it spilled over and flowed in a southwestern direction to empty into florida bay prior to urban and agricultural development in florida everglades began at southern edge of lake okeechobee and flowed for approximately emptying into gulf of mexico limestone shelf is wide and slightly angled instead of having a narrow deep channel characteristic of most rivers vertical gradient from lake okeechobee to florida bay is about per mile creating an almost wide expanse of river that travels about half a mile 0 8 km a day this slow movement of a broad shallow river is known as sheetflow and gives everglades its nickname river of grass water leaving lake okeechobee may require months or years to reach its final destination florida bay sheetflow travels so slowly that water is typically stored from one wet season to next in porous limestone substrate

their habitats and food sources climate upright thumb hurricane charley in 2004 moving ashore on south florida s gulf of mexico coast climate of south florida is located across broad transition zone between subtropical and tropical climates koppen aw am and cfa like most regions with this climate type there are two basic seasons a dry season winter which runs from november through april and a wet season summer which runs from may through october about 70 of annual rainfall in south florida occurs in wet season often as brief but intense tropical downpours dry season sees little rainfall and dew points and humidity are often quite low dry season can be severe at times as wildfires and water restrictions are often in place annual range of temperatures in south florida and everglades is rather small less than 20 degf 11 degc ranging from a monthly mean temperature of around in january to in july high temperatures in hot and wet season summer typically exceed across inland south florida although coastal locations are cooled by winds from gulf of mexico and atlantic ocean while high temperatures in dry winter season average from frost and freeze is rare across south florida and everglades annually coastal cities like miami and naples report zero days with frost although a few times each decade low temperatures may fall between across south florida plant hardiness zones are 10a north with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 30 to 35 degf 1 to 2 degc and 10b south with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 35 to 40 degf 2 to 4 degc annual rainfall averages approximately with eastern coastal ridge receiving majority of precipitation and area surrounding lake okeechobee receiving about unlike any other wetland system on earth everglades are sustained primarily by atmosphere lodge p 14 evapotranspiration sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from earth s land surface to atmosphere associated with thunderstorms is key mechanism by which water leaves region during a year unaffected by drought rate may reach a year when droughts take place rate may peak at over and exceed amount of rainfall as water leaves an area through evaporation from groundwater or from plant matter activated primarily by solar energy it is then moved by wind patterns to other areas that border or flow into everglades watershed system evapotranspiration is responsible for approximately 70 90 percent of water entering undeveloped wetland regions in everglades precipitation during wet season is primarily caused by air mass thunderstorms and easterly flow out of subtropical high bermuda high intense daytime heating of ground causes warm moist tropical air to rise creating afternoon thundershowers typical of tropical climates 2 00 pm is mean time of daily thundershowers across south florida and everglades late in wet season august and september precipitation levels reach their highest levels as tropical depressions and lows add to daily rainfall occasionally tropical lows can become severe tropical cyclones and cause significant damage when make landfall across south florida tropical storms average

grass in 1947 though that metaphor represents only a portion of system area recognized as everglades prior to drainage was a web of marshes and prairies in size lodge p 14 borders between ecosystems are subtle or imperceptible these systems shift grow and shrink die or reappear within years or decades geologic factors climate and frequency of fire help to create maintain or replace ecosystems in everglades water thumb a storm over shark river in everglades charles barron state library and archives of florida water is dominant force in everglades shaping land vegetation and animal life in south florida starting at last glacial maximum 21 000 years ago continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose this submerged portions of florida peninsula and caused water table to rise fresh water saturated limestone that underlies everglades eroding some of it away and created springs and sinkholes abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root and formed convective thunderstorms over land through evaporation uf usda 1948 p 35 as rain continued to fall slightly acidic rainwater dissolved limestone as limestone wore away groundwater came into contact with land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem mccally pp 9 10 although region appears flat weathering of limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas these plateaus rise and fall only a few inches but on subtle south florida topography these small variations affect both flow of water and types of vegetation that can take hold lodge p 38 39 rock thumb upright uneven limestone formations in an everglades sawgrass prairie underlying bedrock or limestone of everglades basin affects hydroperiod or how long an area within region stays flooded throughout year longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater for longer periods of time while geology of florida was forming more water is held within porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level mccally pp 12 14 a hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of periphyton a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms there are only two types of soil in everglades peat and marl where there are longer hydroperiods peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter mccally pp 15 17 where periphyton grows soil develops into marl which is more calcitic in composition initial attempts at developing agriculture near lake okeechobee were successful but nutrients in peat were rapidly removed in a process called soil subsidence oxidation of peat causes loss of volume uf usda 1948 p 79 bacteria decompose dead sawgrass slowly underwater without oxygen when water was drained in 1920s and bacteria interacted with oxygen an aerobic reaction occurred microorganisms degraded peat into carbon dioxide and water some of peat was burned by settlers to clear land some homes built in areas of early farms had to have their foundations moved to stilts as peat deteriorated other areas lost approximately of soil depth lodge p 38 fire fire is an important element in natural maintenance of everglades majority of fires are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during wet season their effects are largely superficial and serve to foster specific plant growth sawgrass will burn above water but roots are preserved underneath fire in sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition lodge pp 39 41 whereas in wet season dead plant matter and tips of grasses and trees are burned in dry season fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply destroying root systems fires are confined by existing water and rainfall it takes approximately 225 years for one foot 30 m of peat to develop but in some locations peat is less dense than it should be for 5 000 years of everglades existence mccally pp 18 21 scientists indicate fire as cause it is also cited as reason for black color of everglades muck layers of charcoal have been detected in peat in portions of everglades that indicate region endured severe fires for years at a time although this trend seems to have abated since last occurrence in 940 bce ecosystems thumb major landscape types in everglades before human action source u s geological survey sawgrass marshes and sloughs several ecosystems are present in everglades and boundaries between them are subtle or absent primary feature of everglades is sawgrass marsh iconic water and sawgrass combination in shallow river long and wide that spans from lake okeechobee to florida bay is often referred to as true everglades or just glades george p 13 douglas p 11 prior to first drainage attempts in 1905 sheetflow occupied nearly a third of lower florida peninsula sawgrass thrives in slowly moving water but may die in unusually deep floods if oxygen is unable to reach its roots it is particularly vulnerable immediately after a fire whitney p 168 hydroperiod for marsh is at least nine months and can last longer jewell p 46 where sawgrass grows densely few animals or other plants live although alligators choose these locations for nesting where there is more room periphyton grows whitney p 168 periphyton supports larval insects and amphibians which in turn are consumed as food by birds fish and reptiles it also absorbs calcium from water which adds to calcitic composition of marl george p 42 sloughs or free flowing channels of water develop in between sawgrass prairies sloughs are about deeper than sawgrass marshes and may stay flooded for at least 11 months out of year and sometimes multiple years in a row lodge p 31 aquatic animals such as turtles alligators snakes and fish thrive in sloughs they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates george p 14 submerged and floating plants grow here such as utricularia waterlily and lutea major sloughs in everglades system include shark river slough flowing out to florida bay river slough bordering big cypress and taylor slough in eastern everglades wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes but with greater plant diversity surface is covered in water only three to seven months of year and water is on average shallow at only deep lodge p 29 when flooded marl can support a variety of water plants whitney p 164 solution holes or deep pits where limestone has worn away may remain flooded even when prairies are dry and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails and larval amphibians which feed young wading birds whitney p 163 these regions tend to border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes alligators have created a niche in wet prairies with their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout dry season alligator holes are integral to survival of aquatic invertebrates turtles fish small mammals and birds during extended drought periods alligators then feed upon some of animals that come to hole george pp 45 46 lodge p 35 tropical hardwood hammock thumb in a tropical hardwood hammock trees are very dense and diverse small islands of trees growing on land raised between and above sloughs and prairies are called tropical hardwood hammocks george p 30 they may range from one 4 000 m2 to ten acres 40 000 m2 in area and appear in freshwater sloughs sawgrass prairies or pineland hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several inches above surrounding peat or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees such as southern live oak quercus virginiana gumbo limbo simaruba royal palm roystonea and salicifolia that grow in very dense clumps douglas pp 48 49 near base sharp saw serenoa repens flourish making hammocks very difficult for people to penetrate though small mammals reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat water in sloughs flows around islands creating moats although some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover moats around hammocks protect trees george p 31 trees are limited in height by weather factors such as frost lightning and wind majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than pineland some of driest land in everglades is pineland also called pine rockland ecosystem located in highest part of everglades with little to no hydroperiod some floors however may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time most significant feature of pineland is single species of south florida slash pine pinus elliottii pineland communities require fire to maintain them and trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire u s fish wildlife service south florida multi species recovery plan pine rockland retrieved may 3 2008 sandy floor of pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable south florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat fire eliminates competing vegetation on forest floor and opens pine cones to germinate seeds george pp 7 8 a period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake slash pines understory shrubs in pine rocklands are fire resistant saw palmetto serenoa repens cabbage palm sabal palmetto and west indian lilac bicolor most diverse group of plants in pine community are herbs of which there are two dozen species these plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred lodge p 66 prior to urban development of south florida region pine rocklands covered approximately in miami dade county within everglades national park of pine forests are protected but outside park of pine communities remained as of 1990 averaging in area misunderstanding of role of fire also played a part in disappearance of pine forests in area as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks prescribed fires occur in everglades national park in pine rocklands every three to seven years lodge p 63 cypress thumb a pond in big cypress cypress swamps can be found throughout everglades but largest covers most of collier county big cypress swamp is located to west of sawgrass prairies and sloughs and it is commonly called big cypress george p 26 name refers to its area rather than height or diameter of trees at its most conservative estimate swamp measures but hydrologic boundary of big cypress can be calculated at over lodge p 67 most of big cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thinner layer of limestone limestone underneath big cypress contains quartz which creates sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation different from what is found in other areas of everglades basin for big cypress receives on average of water in wet season ripple p 16 although big cypress is largest growth of cypress swamps in south florida cypress swamps can be found near atlantic coastal ridge and between lake okeechobee and eastern as well as in sawgrass marshes cypresses are deciduous conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of water called knees jewell p 43 bald cypress trees grow in formations with tallest and thickest trunks in center rooted in deepest peat as peat thins out cypresses grow smaller and thinner giving small forest appearance of a dome from outside ripple p 26 they also grow in strands slightly elevated on a ridge of limestone bordered on either side by sloughs ripple pp 31 32 other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes such as red maple swamp bay and pop ash if cypresses are removed hardwoods take over and ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest mangrove and coastal prairie thumb red mangrove trees bordering a tidal estuary in everglades eventually water from lake okeechobee and big cypress

biology alan j southward ed 40 pp 18 251 estuarine ecosystem of ten thousand islands which is comprised almost completely of mangrove forests covers almost in wet season fresh water pours out into florida bay and sawgrass begins to grow closer to coastline in dry season and particularly in extended periods of drought salt water creeps inland into coastal prairie an ecosystem that buffers freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water mangrove trees begin to grow in fresh water ecosystems when salt water goes far enough inland george p 19 there are three species of trees that are considered mangroves red rhizophora mangle black avicennia germinans and white laguncularia racemosa although all are from different families jewell p 41 all grow in oxygen poor soil can survive drastic water level changes and are tolerant of salt brackish and fresh water whitney p 286 all three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms red mangroves have farthest reaching roots trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms all three types of trees absorb energy of waves and storm surges everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish and rookeries for birds region supports tortugas pink shrimp and stone crab menippe mercenaria industries between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in florida s salt waters are born or spend time near everglades ripple p 80 florida bay thumb a clump of mangroves in distance florida bay at flamingo much of coast and inner estuaries are built of mangroves there is no border between coastal marshes and bay thus marine ecosystems in florida bay are considered to be a part of everglades watershed and one of ecosystems connected to and affected by everglades as a whole more than of florida bay is protected by everglades national park representing largest body of water in park boundaries there are approximately 100 keys in florida bay many of which are mangrove forests george p 21 fresh water coming into florida bay from everglades creates perfect conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that are foundation for animal life in bay sea turtles and manatees eat grass while invertebrate animals such as worms clams and other mollusks eat algae formations and microscopic plankton whitney pp 313 316 female sea turtles return annually to nest on shore and manatees spend winter months in warmer water of bay sea grasses also serve to stabilize sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves history native americans humans arrived in florida peninsula approximately 15 000 years ago paleo indians came to florida probably following large game that included giant sloths saber toothed cats and spectacled bears they found an arid landscape that supported plants and animals adapted for desert conditions mccally p 34 however 6 500 years ago climate changes brought a wetter landscape large animals became extinct in florida and paleo indians slowly adapted and became archaic peoples they conformed to environmental changes and created many tools with various resources available mccally p 35 during late archaic period climate became wetter again and approximately 3000 bce rise of water tables allowed an increase in population and cultural activity florida indians developed into three distinct but similar cultures that were named for bodies of water near where they were located okeechobee caloosahatchee and glades mccally pp 37 39 calusa and tequesta from glades peoples two major nations emerged in area calusa and tequesta calusa was largest and most powerful nation in south florida it controlled fifty villages located on florida s west coast around lake okeechobee and on florida keys most calusa villages were located at mouths of rivers or on key islands calusa were hunter gatherers who lived on small game fish turtles alligators shellfish and various plants tebeau 1968 pp 38 41 most of their tools were made of bone or teeth although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows atlatls and spears canoes were used for transportation and south florida tribes often through everglades but rarely lived in them mccally p 39 canoe trips to cuba were also common griffin p 171 estimated numbers of calusa at beginning of spanish occupation ranged from 4 000 to 7 000 griffin p 170 society declined in power and population by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1 000 in early 18th century calusa came under attack from yamasee to north they asked spanish for refuge in cuba where almost 200 died of illness soon they were relocated again to florida keys griffin p 173 second in power and number to calusa in south florida were tequesta they occupied southeastern portion of lower peninsula in modern day dade and broward counties like calusa tequesta societies centered on mouths of rivers their main village was probably on miami river or little river spanish depictions of tequesta state that they were greatly feared by sailors who suspected them of torturing and killing survivors of shipwrecks with an increasing european presence in south florida native americans from keys and other areas began increasing their trips to cuba official permission for immigration of native americans from florida keys was granted by cuban officials in 1704 worth john e a history of southeastern indians in cuba 1513 1823 florida museum of natural history 2004 pages 5 6 spanish priests attempted to set up missions in 1743 but noted that tequesta were under assault from a neighboring tribe when only 30 members were left they were removed to havana a british surveyor in 1770 described multiple deserted villages in region where tequesta lived tebeau p 43 common descriptions of native americans in florida by 1820 used only term seminoles tebeau p 45 seminole thumb upright seminoles made their home in everglades following demise of calusa and tequesta native americans in southern florida were referred to as spanish indians in 1740s probably due to their friendlier relations with spain creek invaded florida peninsula they conquered and assimilated what was left of pre columbian societies into creek confederacy they were joined by remnant indian groups and formed seminole a new tribe by ethnogenesis seminole originally settled in northern portion of territory in addition free blacks and fugitive slaves made their way to florida where spain had promised slaves freedom and arms if they converted to catholicism and pledged loyalty to spain these african americans gradually created communities near those of seminole and became known as black seminoles groups acted as allies in 1817 andrew jackson invaded florida to hasten its annexation to united states in what became known as first seminole war after florida became a u s territory in 1821 conflicts between settlers and seminole increased as former tried to acquire lands second seminole war lasted from 1835 to 1842 and afterward us forcibly removed about 3 000 seminole and 800 black seminole to indian territory now oklahoma west of mississippi river many others died in war griffin p 180 conflict broke out again in third seminole war from 1855 to 1859 when a few hundred seminole fought off us forces from swamps of everglades us finally decided to leave them alone as they could not dislodge them even after this protracted and expensive warfare by 1913 seminole in everglades numbered no more than 325 they made a living by hunting and trading with white settlers and raised domesticated animals tebeau pp 50 51 seminole made their villages in hardwood hammocks or pinelands had diets of hominy and coontie roots fish turtles venison and small game their villages were not large due to limited size of hammocks between end of last seminole war and 1930 people lived in relative isolation from majority culture construction of tamiami trail beginning in 1928 and spanning region from tampa to miami altered their ways of life some began to work in local farms ranches and souvenir stands tebeau pp 55 56 some of people who interacted more with european americans began to move to reservations in 1940s these were their bases for reorganizing their government and they became federally recognized in 1957 as seminole tribe of florida people who kept more traditional ways had settlements along tamiami trail and tended to speak language they later were federally recognized in 1962 as miccosukee tribe of indians of florida as metropolitan areas in south florida began to grow two groups were closely associated with everglades they struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions they earned money by wrestling alligators and selling seminole tribe of florida had five reservations and lands of miccosukee tribe of indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support services and economic development exploration thumb upright map of everglades in 1856 military action during seminole wars improved understanding of features of everglades military penetration of southern florida offered opportunity to map a poorly understood and largely unknown part of country an 1840 expedition into everglades offered first printed account for general public to read about everglades anonymous writer described terrain party was crossing no country that i have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees and expressly intended as a retreat for rascally indian from which white man would never seek to drive them

for this part of florida writing w e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to white man as heart of africa drainage a national push for expansion and progress in united states occurred in later part of 19th century which stimulated interest in draining everglades for agricultural use according to historians from middle of nineteenth century to middle of twentieth century united states went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned indeed it was considered proper thing to do draining everglades was suggested as early as 1837 and a resolution in congress was passed in 1842 that prompted secretary of treasury robert j walker to request those with experience in everglades to give their opinion on possibility of drainage many officers who had served in seminole wars favored idea in 1850 congress passed a law that gave several states wetlands within their state boundaries swamp and overflowed lands act ensured that state would be responsible for funding attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for any attempts though civil war and reconstruction halted progress until after 1877 thumb upright hamilton disston s land sale notice after civil war a state agency called internal improvement fund iif whose purpose was to improve florida s roads canals and rail lines was discovered to be deeply in debt iif found a pennsylvania real estate developer named hamilton disston interested in implementing plans to drain land for agriculture disston purchased of land for 1 million in 1881 and he began constructing canals near st cloud at first canals seemed to work in lowering water levels in wetlands surrounding rivers grunwald pp 92 93 they were effective in lowering groundwater but it became apparent that their capacity was insufficient for wet season douglas p 286 although disston s canals did not drain well his purchase primed economy of florida it made news and attracted tourists and land buyers within four years property values doubled and population increased significantly iif was able to invest in development projects due to disston s purchase and an opportunity to improve transportation arose when oil tycoon henry flagler began purchasing land and building rail lines along east coast of florida as far south as palm beach in 1893 henry flagler encyclopedia of world biography supplement vol 21 gale group 2001 along way he built resort hotels transforming territorial outposts into

napoleon bonaparte broward promoted draining everglades he called future of south florida empire of everglades soon after his successful election he began work to drain that abominable pestilence ridden swamp carter p 78 and pushed florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands in 1907 they established everglades drainage district and began to study how to build most effective canals and how to fund them governor broward ran for u s senate in 1908 but lost broward was paid by land developer richard j bolles to tour state to promote drainage elected to senate in 1910 broward died before he could take office land in everglades was being sold for 15 an acre a month after broward died grunwald pp 148 149 meanwhile henry flagler continued to

soil samples before draining did not take into account that organic composition of peat and muck in everglades make it prone to soil subsidence when it becomes dry naturally occurring bacteria in everglades peat and muck assist with process of decomposition under water which is generally very slow partially due to low levels of dissolved oxygen when water levels became so low that peat and muck were at surface bacteria interacted with much higher levels of oxygen in air rapidly breaking down soil in some places homes had to be moved to stilts and of soil was lost everglades national park thumb president harry truman dedicating everglades national park on december 6 1947 idea of a national park for everglades was pitched in 1928 when a miami land developer named ernest f coe established everglades tropical national park association it had enough support to be declared a national park by congress in 1934 it took another 13 years to be dedicated on december 6 1947 one month before dedication of park a former editor from miami herald and freelance writer named marjory stoneman douglas released her first book titled everglades river of grass after researching region for five years she described history and ecology of south florida in great detail she characterized everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp last chapter was titled eleventh hour and warned that everglades were dying although it could be reversed douglas p 349 central and southern florida flood control project same year park was dedicated two hurricanes and wet season caused to fall on south florida although there were no human casualties agricultural interests lost approximately 59 million grunwald p 219 in 1948 congress approved central and southern florida project for flood control and

is sugarcane though sod beans lettuce celery and rice are also grown fields in eaa are typically bordered by canals on two sides that are connected to larger canals where water is pumped in or out depending on needs of crops lodge pp 225 226 fertilizers used on vegetables along with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus that are byproduct of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production were pumped into wcas south of eaa introduction of large amounts of these chemicals provided opportunities for exotic plants to take hold in everglades mccally pp 172 173 one of defining characteristics of natural everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient poor environment and introduction of fertilizers began to alter plant life in region grunwald pp 283 284

algal bloom appeared in one fifth of lake okeechobee in 1986 same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in national wildlife refuge scientists discovered that phosphorus used as a fertilizer in eaa was flushed into canals and pumped back into lake lodge p 230 when lake drained phosphorus entered water in marshes changing nutrient levels it kept periphyton from forming marl one

levels of mercury high enough to kill a human lodge pp 231 233 scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into atmosphere and it fell as rain or dust during droughts naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in everglades ecosystem were transforming mercury into and it was bioaccumulating through food chain stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals though they continue to be a concern everglades forever act introduced by governor lawton
