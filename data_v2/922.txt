uefa champions league liverpool midfielder vladimir smicer was looking forward to playing a part in final everyone wants to play in final i m no different i was just happy to be on pitch against auxerre because i didn t know even day before whether i d be fit enough after my injury problem i m still not 100 fit i just wanted to train well this week and be fit for final smicer was hopeful that victory in final would rescue liverpool s season i hope that this re ignites our season our season is not good we know but there is still plenty to play for we have not said this is a bad season let s forget about it and concentrate on next one we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on pitch liverpool midfielder danny murphy was eager to win match winning in cardiff would be a massive result for us we have to be honest we haven t been as good as manchester united over last 10 years and winning would bring european football next year which isn t guaranteed at moment manchester united manager sir alex ferguson revealed that captain roy keane would return to his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over juventus it took roy about 15 minutes to settle into tuesday s game but once he started to make sure he could see his opponent he grasped role very quickly in end he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him he is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but mikael silvestre and john o shea should be fit and i have a back four in my mind final was united s first since 1999 uefa champions league final and ferguson was determined to win that is too long for us and we are delighted we have always looked at league cup as an extra to blood young players but format now has encouraged teams to have a go we ve played liverpool once in cardiff in charity shield and lost so i hope this time it will be a different result both sides had injury concerns heading into final liverpool defender stephane henchoz was a doubt after he suffered a thigh injury in liverpool s win over auxerre however liverpool midfielder smicer had recovered from an ankle problem and would be available for selection united had a number of injury concerns wes brown scholes and ryan giggs were all doubts for final after they had picked up knocks in week before final they would also be

maximum of three substitutions post match thumb performance of liverpool goalkeeper jerzy dudek was highlighted by both managers following match liverpool manager gerard houllier claimed he had a premonition that goalkeeper dudek would be hero of final i told jerzy three days ago i can feel you will be hero you were too unlucky when we played them today he was man of match but football can be like that sometimes you can be at bottom and then be a hero again i just had a feeling i m a great believer that when you have right attitude everything else follows he had a good run after world cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him squad get on very well there was no finger pointing after that game he has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him houllier also praised manchester united manager sir alex ferguson i wished him best in champions league because he represents best in english football he congratulated every liverpool player after final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man united manager ferguson also praised dudek s performance in match their goalkeeper has won them game sometimes you just have to put your hands up on these occasions dudek has won them cup he deserved to be man of match we didn t get a break dudek s performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box in tough games like that first goal is very important it s a test for us we can either accept defeat or we can fight back captain keane was disappointed with defeat players managers staff are all upset but i suppose nowhere near as bad as fans if you don t win a match in football you feel as though you have let fans down his focus turned to united s participation in uefa champions league as they looked to end season with a trophy it would have been nice to get a piece of silverware in cabinet especially with opposition being liverpool we ve just got to lick our wounds we ve got a game against leeds on wednesday and we ll get on with training for wednesday players know we ll have to get together get ready and try to keep pressure on arsenal but we are eight points behind them which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on european cup which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season notes external links lfc history match report cup final league cup final
