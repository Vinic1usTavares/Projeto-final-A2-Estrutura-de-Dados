brownimecia is an extinct genus of ants only genus in tribe and subfamily brownimeciinae of formicidae fossils of single identified species brownimecia clavata are known from middle cretaceous of north america genus is one of several ants described from middle cretaceous of new jersey brownimecia was initially placed in subfamily ponerinae until it was transferred to its own subfamily in 2003 it can be distinguished from other ants due to its unusual sickle like mandibles and other morphological features that makes this ant unique among formicidae ant is also small measuring and a stinger is present in almost all of specimens collected morphology of mandibles suggest a high level of feeding specialization history and classification brownimecia is known from three adult fossils holotype specimen number amnh nj 667 collected by yale goldman paratype and a third described in 2005 at time of genus description type specimens were residing in american museum of natural history in new york city all described specimens are worker caste adult females which have been preserved as inclusions in transparent chunks of new jersey amber amber specimens were recovered from deposits of south amboy fire clay part of raritan formation new jersey amber has been dated to approximately 90 to 94 mya placing it in turonian of late cretaceous analysis of amber composition indicates it originated as resins which were deposited in lagoons and salt water marshes along cretaceous eastern seaboard brownimecia clavata is one of several ant species described from new jersey amber others being sphecomyrma freyi sphecomyrma casei and type fossils were first studied by david grimaldi donat agusti and james carpenter of american museum team s 1997 type description of new genus and species was published in journal american museum novitates genus name was coined by them as a patronym honoring ant william l brown jr who co described first cretaceous ant genus and species sphecomyrma freyi specific epithet clavata was chosen as a reference to distinctive clubbed antennae seen in workers grimaldi agusti and carpenter placed new genus into extant ant subfamily ponerinae without tribal assignment based on a slight constriction of gaster they also noted several features that are shared with ants of amblyoponine group then a part of ponerinae workers have spurs on lower edge area under small compound eyes workers also have narrow long mandibles as do some amblyoponine genera placement in ponerinae was unchanged until a revision of subfamily was published in 2003 by myrmecologist barry bolton in that paper subfamily was shown to be a grouping and many of included genera were moved to separate subfamilies including and brownimecia due to unique combination of morphological features found in brownimecia bolton erected new subfamily brownimeciinae for genus bolton notes that its sickle like mandibles which lack teeth are not usual for ants and are often associated with or slave making behavior in extant genera in contrast to stem group ants such as scapes of brownimecia workers are more elongated like those of crown group ants in his 2007 phylogenetic examination of formicidae entomologist philip ward notes possibility that brownimecia is a crown group genus and placed subfamily into informal grouping in his description thumb b clavata holotype dorsal view both brownimecia holotype worker and 2005 worker are complete and fully preserved in curled positions and have their stings extended paratype worker is very incomplete amber in which it is encased is highly likely to have been at least partly tumble polished in a rock causing ant to be exposed and portions of head left antenna mid legs hind legs and all of right antennae and forelegs are gone exposure allowed interior cavity of fossil to be examined under scanning electron microscope after being coated in a layer of gold holotype has an overall body length of approximately with finely scattered setae on all parts except notum and propodeum head is large with small rounded compound eyes composed of about one hundred ommatidia holotype does not clearly show whether ocelli are present or absent but they are clearly absent in 2005 specimen mandibles are scimitar shaped with no teeth present on interior sides and almost length of head mandibles cross each other near their mid length and oral surfaces bear approximately thirty short needle like setae clypeus is short but wide crossing almost whole width of head perpendicular crenelations run along upper margin of clypeus on 2005 specimen gena have a distinct tooth like structure on lower sides eleven segmented antennae are distinct in having a definite clubbed tip a feature not seen in any other described cretaceous ants apical flagellomere segment is nearly twice width of other segments while third to sixth segments are shortest and second flagellomere is slightly swollen metathoracic spiracles are raised on small cones projecting from alitrunk while gland orifices are not notably raised having a ridge leading to them all of alitrunk gland and spiracle are to some degree obscured on holotype by of bubbles that escaped them soon after worker was entombed in sap petiole top forms a pointed apex instead of a more rounded dome there is a covering of fine hairs on petiole and a pair of small setae are situated near apex at front of petiole there is a narrow attachment area to propodeum while rear is flared into a large attachment to gaster a small exoskeleton plate between petiole and gaster is developed and shows crenelations on rear edge there is a small but distinct constriction between first and second segments of gaster both holotype and 2005 specimens have a fully preserved gaster tip showing extended sting while paratype is missing tip area due to unusual morphology of mandibles scientists have suggested that brownimecia may have had a high level of feeding
