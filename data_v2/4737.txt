augustan history latin historia augusta is a late roman collection of biographies written in latin of roman emperors their junior colleagues designated heirs and usurpers of period 117 to 284 supposedly modeled on similar work of suetonius twelve caesars it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors collectively known as scriptores historiae augustae written during reigns of diocletian and constantine i and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in rome collection as extant comprises thirty biographies most of which contain life of a single emperor while some include a group of two or more grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous true authorship of work its actual date its reliability and its purpose have long been matters for controversy amongst historians and scholars ever since hermann dessau in 1889 rejected both date and authorship as stated within manuscript major problems include nature of sources it used and how much of content is pure fiction for instance collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents including 68 letters 60 speeches and proposals to people or senate and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent by second decade of 21st century overall consensus supported position that there was only a single author who was writing either at end of 4th century or beginning of 5th century and who was interested in blending contemporary issues political religious and social into lives of 3rd century emperors there is further consensus that author used fictitious elements in work to highlight references to other published works such as to cicero and ammianus marcellinus in a complex allegorical game despite these conundrums it is only continuous account in latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re evaluated since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels title and scope name historia augusta originated with isaac casaubon who produced a critical edition in 1603 working from a complex manuscript tradition with a number of variant versions title as recorded on codex palatinus manuscript written in 9th century is vitae principum et tyrannorum a divo usque ad lives of various emperors and tyrants from divine hadrian to numerian by various authors and it is assumed that work may have been originally called de vita caesarum or vitae caesarum how widely work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown but its earliest use was in a roman history composed by quintus aurelius symmachus in 485 lengthy citations from it are found in authors of 6th and 9th centuries including sedulius scottus who quoted parts of marcus aurelius maximini and aurelian within his liber de and chief manuscripts also date from 9th or 10th centuries six scriptores aelius spartianus julius capitolinus vulcacius gallicanus aelius lampridius trebellius pollio and flavius vopiscus of syracuse dedicate their biographies to diocletian constantine and various private persons and so ostensibly were all writing around late 3rd and early 4th century first four scriptores are attached to lives from hadrian to gordian iii while final two are attached to lives from valerian to numerian biographies cover emperors from hadrian to carinus and numerian a section covering reigns of philip arab decius trebonianus gallus and all but end of reign of valerian is missing in all manuscripts and it has been argued that biographies of nerva and trajan have also been lost at beginning of work which may suggest compilation might have been a direct continuation of suetonius twelve caesars it has been theorized that mid 3rd century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of author or authors saving labour of covering emperors for whom little source material may have been available despite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non existent usurpers there are no independent biographies of emperors and florian whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards end of biographies of their respective predecessors claudius gothicus and tacitus for nearly 300 years after casaubon s edition though much of augustan history was treated with some scepticism it was used by historians as an authentic source edward gibbon used it extensively in first volume of decline and fall of roman empire however in modern times most scholars read work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date however fundamentalist view still has distinguished support historia augusta is also unfortunately principal latin source for a century of roman history historian must make use of it but only with extreme circumspection and caution textual transmission existing manuscripts and witnesses of augustan history fall into three groups a manuscript of first quarter of ninth century vatican pal lat 899 codex palatinus known as p and its direct and indirect copies p was written at in caroline minuscule text in this manuscript has several lacunae marked with dots indicating missing letters a confusion in order of biographies between verus and alexander and transposition of several passages two long ones which correspond to a quire of original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place and a similar transposition in carus p is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections beginning with original scribe and includes such worthies as petrarch and poggio bracciolini none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness a group of 15th century manuscripts designated as s not only are lives rearranged in chronological order but corruptions present in p have been subjected to drastic emendations or omitted altogether beginning with dr ernst hohl some have asserted that improvements in text come from a source independent of p although admitting that this question still remains to be answered definitively author peter marshall noted that research undertaken through to 1980s had improved scholarly knowledge concerning methods and abilities of early italian humanists and concludes by saying that s manuscripts nowhere provide readings which are beyond powers of humanists active at time three different sets of excerpts one of which theodor mommsen suggested was possibly work of sedulius scottus how any are related to p is unclear in marshall s opinion best scholarly editions are those by h peter teubner 2nd ed 1884 e hohl teubner 1971 reissue of 1965 revised by ch w a later version of codex palatinus possibly a version that was made for petrarch in 1356 was basis of editio princeps of history published in milan in 1475 a subsequent printed version aldine edition was published at venice in 1516 and this was followed closely by an edition edited by desiderius erasmus and published by johann froben in basel in 1518 dating problem thumb hermann dessau whose groundbreaking work on historia augusta led to its critical re evaluation in 20th century in 1776 gibbon had observed that there was something wrong with numbers and names of imperial biographers and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject gerardus who published de in 1627 discussed problem of distribution of various vitae among scriptores but also problems about authors cited by them louis sebastien le nain de who published histoire des empereurs et des autres princes qui ont regne durant les six premiers siecles de l eglise in 1690 provided a wholesale denunciation of biographies as being worthless full of contradictions and chronological errors a clear example was referencing of biographer lampridius who was apparently writing his biographies after 324 by vopiscus who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305 6 then in 1889 hermann dessau who had become increasingly concerned by large number of anachronistic terms vulgar latin vocabulary and especially host of obviously false proper names in work proposed that six authors were all fictitious personae and that work was in fact composed by a single author in late 4th century probably in reign of theodosius i among his supporting evidence was that life of septimius severus appeared to have made use of a passage from mid 4th century historian aurelius victor sev 17 5 19 4 was copied from victor caes 20 1 and 10 30 in both passages there is a major error which mixes up emperor didius julianus with legal scholar salvius julianus and that life of marcus aurelius likewise uses material from eutropius ma 16 3 18 2 was lifted from eutropius 8 11 in decades following dessau many scholars argued to preserve at least some of six scriptores as distinct persons and in favour of first hand authenticity for content as early as 1890 theodor mommsen postulated a theodosian editor of scriptores work an idea that has resurfaced many times since hermann peter editor of augustan history and of romanorum reliquiae proposed a date of 330 for when work was written based upon an analysis of style and language others such as norman h baynes abandoned early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as reign of julian apostate useful for arguing work was intended as pagan propaganda in 1960s and 1970s however dessau s original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from sir ronald syme who devoted three books to subject and was prepared to date writing of work closely in region of ad 395 other recent studies also show much consistency of style and most scholars now accept theory of a single author of unknown identity writing after 395 although it was believed that historia augusta did not reference any material from ammianus marcellinus history which was finished before 391 and which covered same period this has now been shown not to be case and that historia augusta does in fact make reference to ammianus history not all scholars have accepted theory of a forger working around last decades of 4th century or beginning of 5th arnaldo momigliano and a h m jones were most prominent 20th century critics of dessau syme theory amongst english speaking scholars momigliano summarizing literature from dessau down to 1954 defined question as res i e a matter to be decided and not as res a matter that has been decided momigliano reviewed every book published on topic by sir ronald syme and provided counter arguments to most if not all of syme s arguments for instance reference in life of probus about emperor s descendants which has been taken to refer to sextus claudius petronius probus consul in 371 and his family may in opinion of momigliano equally refer to earlier members of family which was prominent throughout 4th century such as petronius probinus consul in 341 and petronius consul in 322 momigliano s opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of early 4th century and that any post constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on material at a later date perhaps during reigns of constantius ii or julian other opinions included dr h stern s who postulated that history was composed by a team of writers during reign of constantius ii after defeat of magnentius on behalf of senatorial aristocracy who had supported usurper in 21st century alan cameron rebutted a number of syme s and barnes arguments for a composition date c 395 400 suggesting a composition date between 361 and six scriptores or a single author linked to problem of dating composition of history is question about authorship of work taking history at face value there is clearly a division between authors named prior and after presence of interrupting lacuna for first half of history four scriptores are present and biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion aelius spartianus 7 lives hadrian aelius didius julianus severus niger caracalla and geta julius capitolinus 9 lives antoninus marcus lucius verus pertinax albinus macrinus maximini gordiani and maximus and vulcacius gallicanus 1 life avidius cassius aelius lampridius 4 lives commodus diadumenus and severus alexander of these four spartianus and gallicanus claim to be undertaking a complete set of imperial biographies from julius caesar onwards while lampridius stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with claudius ii aurelian diocletian maximian and four rivals of constantine capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in history second half of history is divided between two scriptores unlike first half emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically and are divided roughly in half between two scriptores in chronological sequence trebellius pollio 4 lives valerian gallienus tyranni triginta and claudius flavius vopiscus 5 lives aurelian tacitus probus quadrigae tyrannorum and carus carinus and numerian in terms of any acknowledgement of mutual existence between scriptores only flavius vopiscus ostensibly writing in 305 or 306 in aurelian vopiscus refers to chlorus as emperor and diocletian as a private citizen dating this composition between diocletian s abdication on 1 may 305 and constantius death on 25 july 306 refers to any of other authors specifically trebellius pollio julius capitolinus and aelius lampridius none of other five demonstrate any awareness of existence of any of their colleagues however these references cause difficulties when these authors also address constantine in their dedications as vopiscus was also doing for instance capitolinus mostly addresses diocletian but in albinus maximini and gordiani he addresses constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306 theory that there was a single author as initially postulated by hermann dessau is based on difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought material together this is especially evident in that text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of emperors only for that life to be completed by another of scriptores for example spartianus declares that he is going to write a life of verus but that life is attributed to capitolinus if those statements are true and those additional lives were completed then an editor must have been involved in project in order to select one s life over another s however presence of a post constantinian editor as originally postulated by theodore mommsen still has notable support most recently articulated by daniel den hengst who suggests that editor was author of second half of history operating under pseudonyms of pollio and vopiscus further that this editor not only wrote secondary lives in first half but he was also responsible for insertions into primary lives in that series he takes view that vast stylistic differences between two halves of history means they cannot have been written by same author nevertheless if validity of six independent authors is accepted there are still issues as way they approached their work does show similar themes and details all six not only provide biographies for emperors but also for caesars and usurpers they describe their work and approach in very similar language and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers such as junius cordus they collectively share many errors such as calling diadumenianus diadumenus they also share much idiosyncratic content and similar language with particular focus on women wine and military discipline and were fixated on poor plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors for instance verus was truthful while severus was a severe individual additionally authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately for instance authors all happen to use word with respect to killing a total of 42 occurrences but only once do any of them use alternative word of this ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre finally each of six scriptores authored fictional lives for some of their biographies all of them using fake sources documents and acclamations it has been postulated that names of scriptores themselves are also a form of literary playfulness not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians but also narrative itself names trebellius pollio and flavius vopiscus are sourced in various ways from cicero s writings as is name capitolinus further word vopiscus is a rare latin term referring to a twin who survives while its sibling died in utero this has been interpreted to refer to flavius vopiscus as being final one to survive from six authors of history vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor meanings behind other two scriptores spartianus and lampridius have eluded interpretation finally it should also be noted that results of recent computer assisted stylistic analysis concerning single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive computer aided stylistic analysis of work has however returned ambiguous results some elements of style are quite uniform throughout work while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship to what extent this is due to fact that portions of work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear several computer analyses of text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors many of them conclude that there was but a single author but disagree on methodology however several studies done by same team concluded there were several authors though they were not sure how many primary and secondary vitae a unique feature of augustan history is that it purports to supply biographies not only of reigning emperors called primary lives by modern scholars but also secondary lives of their designated heirs junior colleagues and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed supreme power thus among biographies of 2nd century and early 3rd century figures are included hadrian s heir aelius caesar and usurpers avidius cassius pescennius niger and clodius albinus caracalla s brother geta and macrinus son diadumenianus none of these pieces contain much in way of solid information all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction biography of marcus aurelius colleague lucius verus which mommsen thought secondary is however rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by syme as belonging to primary series secondary lives allowed author to exercise freedom in invention of events places and people without need to conform to authentic historical facts as work proceeds author s inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as biographies of thirty tyrants whom author claimed had risen as usurpers under gallienus moreover after biography of caracalla primary biographies of emperors themselves begin to assume rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to secondary ones probably because secondary lives were written after life of caracalla biography of macrinus is notoriously unreliable and after a partial reversion to reliability in life of elagabalus alexander severus one of longest biographies in entire work develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on theme of wise philosopher king clearly author s previous sources had given out but also his inventive talents were developing he still makes use of some recognized sources herodian up to 238 and probably dexippus in later books for entire imperial period enmannsche kaisergeschichte as well as aurelius victor eutropius ammianus marcellinus and jerome but biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded however even where recognisable facts are present their use in history cannot be taken at face value in life of alexander severus history makes claim at 24 4 that alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal although author added that emperor philip did later ban practice although claim about alexander is false note about philip is true source of this is aurelius victor 28 6 7 and who in turn sourced it from kaisergeschichte and history even copies victor s style of moralising asides which were not in kaisergeschichte normally this anecdote would have been included in a life of philip but its absence saw author include it in another life this is taken as evidence that mid work lacuna is deliberate as author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from kaisergeschichte estimated amount of reliable historical details in some of historia augusta s secondary and later primary vitae vita type of vita estimate containing reliable historical details aelius secondary 25 avidius cassius secondary 5 pescennius niger secondary 29 clodius albinus secondary 32 geta secondary 5 macrinus primary 33 diadumenianus secondary 5 elagabalus primary 24 alexander severus primary 4 claudius primary 10 aurelian primary 27 tacitus primary 15 probus primary 17 quadrigae tyrannorum secondary 0 carus primary 17 genre and purpose interpretations of purpose of history also vary considerably some considering it a work of fiction or satire intended to entertain perhaps in vein of 1066 and all that others viewing it as a pagan attack on christianity writer having concealed his identity for personal safety under this anti christianity theory lacuna covering period from philip arab through to end of valerian s reign is seen as deliberate as it freed author from addressing philip s reign as by late 4th century philip was being claimed as a christian emperor as well as not discussing decius and valerian s reigns as they were well known persecutors of church it also avoided dealing with their fates as christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions in fact where mentioned both decius and valerian are viewed very positively by author of history further it is noted that history also parodies christian scripture for instance in life of alexander severus there is it is said that on day after his birth a star of first magnitude was visible for entire day at arca caesarea while where save at rome is there an imperial power that rules an empire is considered to be a response to 2 thessalonians 2 6 7 syme argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined he theorized that history is primarily a literary product an exercise in satire produced by a rogue scholiast catering to and making fun of or parodying antiquarian tendencies of theodosian age in which suetonius and marius maximus were fashionable reading and ammianus marcellinus was producing sober history in manner of tacitus history implausibly makes emperor tacitus 275 276 a descendant and connoisseur of historian in fact in a passage on quadriga tyrannorum four horse chariot of usurpers said to have aspired to purple in reign of probus history itself accuses marius maximus of being a producer of mythical history homo omnium qui et mythistoricis se most long winded of men who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in latin of considerable significance in this regard is opening section of life of aurelian in which flavius vopiscus records a supposed conversation he had with city prefect of rome during festival of hilaria in which prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know thumb left cicero one of authors whose works historia augusta references obliquely other examples of work as a parody can be taken from names of scriptores themselves it has been suggested that trebellius pollio and flavius vopiscus syracusius were invented with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in cicero s letters and speeches in 1st century bc with respect to trebellius pollio this is a reference to lucius trebellius a supporter of mark antony who was mentioned in philippics phil 11 14 and another reference to him in epistulae ad familiares along with term reminded history s author of asinius pollio who was a fellow plebeian tribune alongside lucius trebellius and a historian as well this is reinforced by noted similarities between fictitious criticism of trebellius pollio by flavius vopiscus at start of life of aurelian with similar comments made by asinius pollio about julius caesar s published commentaries significantly lucius trebellius adopted cognomen fides for his actions as plebeian tribune in 47 bc to resist laws that would abolish debts later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule according to this theory it is no coincidence that in selecting name trebellius pollio author is playing with concepts of fides and historica at precise point in lives that are assigned to trebellius pollio and flavius vopiscus syracusius in case of flavius vopiscus syracusius it was argued that it too was inspired by philippics reference to caesar vopiscus phil 11 11 with cicero s reference to vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to lucius trebellius cognomen syracusius was selected because cicero s in is filled with references to and further in cicero s de cicero refers to strabo vopiscus as an authority on humour during which he refers to reputation of sicilians when it came to humour and syracuse was one of principal cities of sicily such references were intended as a knowing wink to readers of history who would recognise mockery of historical material by author this corresponds with david rohrbacher s view of history who maintains that author has no political or theological agenda rather that history is equivalent of a literary puzzle or game with reader s understanding and enjoyment of numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being only purpose behind its existence in support of this theory rohrbacher provides an example with respect to ammianus marcellinus work in one passage amm 19 12 14 ammianus describes christian emperor constantius ii s attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws in particular death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases si qui remedia vel doloris alterius collo for if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against quartan ague or any other complaint there is a very similar imperial ruling described in life of caracalla 5 7 which makes no sense in caracalla s time and is worded in almost exactly same way qui remedia collo wearing them around their necks as of quartan or tertian fever other theories include andre chastagnol s minimalist opinion that author was a pagan who supported senate and roman aristocracy and scorned lower classes and barbarian races while francois paschoud proposed that last books of history are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative with events and personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors according to paschoud representation of emperor probus is in fact a version of julian with carus substituting for valentinian i and carinus for gratian historical value from sixth century to end of 19th century historians had recognized that historia augusta was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source and since 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution older historians such as edward gibbon not fully aware of its problems with respect to fictitious elements contained within it generally treated information preserved within it as authentic for instance in gibbon s account of reign of gallienus he uncritically reproduces historia augusta s biased and largely fictional account of that reign so when gibbon states repeated intelligence of invasions defeats and rebellions he received with a careless smile and singling out with affected contempt some particular production of lost province he carelessly asked whether rome must be ruined unless it was supplied with linen from egypt and arras cloth from gaul he is reworking passage in two gallieni i am ashamed to relate what gallienus used often to say at this time when such things were happening as though jesting amid ills of mankind for when he was told of revolt of egypt he is said to have exclaimed what we cannot do without egyptian linen and when informed that asia had been devastated both by violence of nature and by inroads of scythians he said what we cannot do without saltpetre and when gaul was lost he is reported to have laughed and remarked can commonwealth be safe without cloaks thus in short with regard to all parts of world as he lost them he would jest as though seeming to have suffered loss of some article of trifling service gibbon then noted after this passage this singular character has i believe been fairly transmitted to us reign of his immediate successor was short and busy and historians who wrote before elevation of family of constantine could not have most remote interest to misrepresent character of gallienus modern scholars now believe that gallienus reputation was posthumously maligned that he was one of main architects of later roman imperial structure and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors nevertheless it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also principal latin source regarding a century of roman history for example scholars had assumed that macrinus mentioned in life of didius julianus was an invention of author like so many other names however an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as praetorian prefect in 193 likewise information that hadrian s wall was constructed during hadrian s reign and that antonine wall was built during reign of antoninus pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from historia augusta where other ancient writers such as eutropius speak of a defensive wall in britain they have associated it with activities of septimius severus see david shorter s roman britain a sourcebook 2008 pp 113 114 veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions false documents and authorities a peculiarity of work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages in all it contains around 150 alleged documents including 68 letters 60 speeches and proposals to people or senate and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations records like these are quite distinct from rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians it was accepted practice for writer to invent these himself and on few occasions when historians such as sallust in his work on catiline or suetonius in his twelve caesars include such documents they have generally been regarded as genuine but almost all those found in historia augusta have been rejected as fabrications partly on stylistic grounds partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after purported date or for other suspicious content history moreover cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians biographers letter writers knowledgeable friends of writers and so on most of whom must be regarded as expressions of author s creative imagination for example biographer cordus is cited twenty seven times in history long considered to be a real but lost biographer until midway into 20th century with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from cordus is in reality from suetonius or cicero every other citation is fake providing details which have been invented and ascribed to cordus cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those vitae where history used herodian as primary source and his appearances vanish once herodian s history comes to an end author would also material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author for instance herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in history in addition to ten times he is correctly cited three times his material is cited as probably to multiply author s sources further not only does author copy from herodian without citation either direct lifts abbreviations or he often distorts herodian to suit his literary objective then there is deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors for instance at a minimum five of history s sixteen citations of dexippus are considered to be fake and dexippus appears to be mentioned not as a principal source of information but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from herodian or enmannsche kaisergeschichte in addition quintus who produced works on horticulture and medicine is cited twice as a biographer which is considered to be another false attribution examples of false historical events and personages untrustworthiness of history stems from multifarious kinds of fraudulent as opposed to simply inaccurate information that run through work becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds various biographies are ascribed to different invented authors and continue with dedicatory epistles to diocletian and constantine quotation of fabricated documents citation of non historical authorities invention of persons extending even to subjects of some of minor biographies presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity deliberately false statements and inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of late 4th century rather than period supposedly being written about for example biography of geta states he was born at mediolanum on 27 may year is not specified but it was in suffect consulships of severus and vitellius he was actually born at rome on 7 march 189 there was no such pair of suffect consuls in this or any other year however it has been suggested that names for these persons be amended to be severus and vettulenus and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192 in vita biography on emperor commodus there is much doubt about authenticity of sources used and cited lampridius pseudonym author works with here claims to have used marius maximus on multiple occasions for his work one instance forms a case in point lampridius supposedly quotes senatorial speeches in maximus work which were held after commodus death however it is unclear whether references to maximus are genuine or made up by author to give himself a sense of authority and expertise baldwin thinks that senatorial speeches are probably a figment of lampridius imagination arbo however believes in their authenticity she suggests that full report of acta senatus lit acts of senate was handed down in acta urbis a kind of city gazette marius maximus could have used this report for his work and lampridius could have used it later on a letter of hadrian written from egypt to his brother in law servianus is quoted at length and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into 20th century servianus is saluted as consul and hadrian mentions his adopted son lucius aelius caesar but hadrian was in egypt in 130 servianus consulship fell in 134 and hadrian adopted aelius in 136 letter is said to have been published by hadrian s freedman phlegon with letter s existence not mentioned anywhere except in history in another suspect passage a passage in letter dealing with of egyptian religious beliefs refers to patriarch head of jewish community in empire this office only came into being after hadrian put down jewish revolt of 132 and passage is probably meant in mockery of powerful late 4th century patriarch gamaliel decius revives office of censor senate valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 october 251 decree is brought to decius on campaign against goths and he summons valerian to bestow honour revival of censorship is fictitious and decius had been dead for several months by date stated valerian holds an imperial council in byzantium attended by several named dignitaries none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until following century at which general ulpius crinitus a name apparently chosen to evoke military glories of emperor trajan takes young aurelian destined to be another military emperor as his adopted son there are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention 200px thumb trebellianus one of fictitious tyrants included in historia augusta drawn by guillaume in insigniorum 1553 in tyranni triginta author trebellius pollio sets out to chronicle 30 usurpers who arose in years when empire was ruled by gallienus and valerian number 30 is evidently modelled on notorious thirty tyrants who ruled athens after end of peloponnesian war chapter contains 32 mini biographies they include two women six youths and seven men who never claimed imperial power one usurper of reign of maximinus thrax one of time of decius and two of time of aurelian and a number who are not historical personages postumus younger saturninus trebellianus celsus titus and victorinus junior in life of tacitus emperor is acclaimed by senate meeting in curia which never existed history then lists a number of individuals all of whom are invented by author consul gordianus nicomachus prefect of city aelius and praetorian prefect gallicanus private letters commending tacitus are quoted from senators autronius and claudius both of whom are assumed to be non historical personages most of and in history are believed to be inventions of author in quadrigae tyrannorum four tyrants lives of firmus saturninus proculus and lives of firmus saturninus proculus and at lacuscurtius author includes firmus said to have been a usurper in egypt under aurelian there is no certainty that this person ever existed however there was a corrector named claudius firmus stationed in egypt in 274 about time zosimus states that aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province nevertheless history s wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented for example he would eat an ostrich a day he had a carriage drawn by ostriches he would swim among crocodiles he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass in life of probus author flavius vopiscus of syracuse states that emperor s descendants fled from rome and settled near verona there a statue of probus was struck by lightning a portent according to soothsayers that future generations of family would rise to such distinction in senate they all would hold highest posts though vopiscus supposedly writing under constantine says this prophecy has not yet come to pass this is one of strongest indications of history s late 4th century date as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to rich and powerful senator sextus claudius petronius probus consul in 371 whose two sons held consulship together in 395 petronius probus was born in verona marius maximus or ignotus certain scholars have always defended value of specific parts of work anthony birley for instance has argued that lives up to septimius severus are based on now lost biographies of marius maximus which were written as a sequel to suetonius lives of twelve caesars as a result his translation of history for penguin books covers only first half and was published as lives of later caesars birley himself supplying biographies of nerva and trajan these are not part of original texts which begin with hadrian his view part of a tradition that goes back to j j muller who advanced marius claims as early as 1870 and supported by modern scholars such as andre chastagnol was vigorously contested by ronald syme who theorized that virtually all identifiable citations from marius maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into main narrative source which he postulated was a different latin author whom he styled ignotus unknown one good biographer his theory argued firstly that as marius wrote a sequel to lives of twelve caesars his work covered reigns from nerva to elagabalus consequently this would not have included a biography of lucius verus even though biography of that princeps in history is mainly of good quality secondly that ignotus only went up to caracalla as is revealed by inferior and mostly fictitious biography of macrinus finally that composer of historia augusta wrote lives of emperors through to life of caracalla including lucius verus using ignotus as his main source and supplementing with marius maximus on occasion it was only when source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources such as herodian and maximus as well as his own fertile imagination and it was at this juncture that he composed first five minor lives through to life of geta a similar theory to syme s has been put forward by francois paschoud who claimed that maximus was probably a satirical poet in same vein as juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all his argument rests on point that outside of mentions in history only extant referencing of marius work is always in context of juvenal and that history s description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value given how it invents or distorts so many other citations this theory is rejected by historians such as anthony birley and david rohrbacher literary value historia augusta has been described by ronald syme as most enigmatic work that antiquity has transmitted although much of focus of study throughout centuries has been on historical content since 20th century there has also been an assessment of literary value of work for much of that time assessment has been critical as demonstrated by analysis put forward by david magie literary as well as historical value of historia augusta has suffered greatly as a result of method of its composition in arrangement in categories of historical material authors did but follow accepted principles of art of biography as practised in antiquity but their narratives consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition lack grace and even cohesion over emphasis of personal details and introduction of anecdotal material destroy proportion of many sections and insertion of forged documents interrupts course of narrative without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest finally later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes frequently in paragraphs with general content of which they have no connexion has put crowning touch to awkwardness and incoherence of whole with result that oft repeated charge seems almost justified that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities m l w was of opinion that even if historia augusta was propaganda disguised as biography it is still a wretched piece of literature while ronald syme noted that with respect to author s latin prose he was not an elegant exponent his normal language is flat and monotonous but uneven and significantly so for this author is erudite a fancier of words and a collector hence many rarities or even inventions first when depicting measures of a military disciplinarian he brings in technical terms redolent of camp second archaism and flowery words further work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion with little to no subsequent editing of material to form a cohesive narrative birley sees an example of carelessness with which author approached work in construction of marcus aurelius biography where midway through life of marcus aurelius author found himself in a muddle probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of lucius verus and avidius cassius whose lives intersected with marcus answer he came up with was to use eutropius as his source for a brief overview of marcus principate following death of lucius verus however he found that in doing so narrative s ending was too abrupt and so after including some gossip about commodus not being his son he once again began an account of marcus reign after death of verus although these criticisms still form prevailing view on history s literary worth modern scholars such as rohrbacher have begun to argue that while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that very features which were once a cause for intense criticism such as inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material are actually an intentional and integral part of work making it one of most unique pieces of literature to emerge from ancient world see also thirty tyrants
