kinzua bridge or kinzua viaduct was a railroad trestle that spanned kinzua creek in mckean county in u s state of pennsylvania bridge was tall and long most of its structure collapsed during a tornado in 2003 bridge was originally built from wrought iron in 1882 and was billed as eighth wonder of world holding record as tallest railroad bridge in world for two years in 1900 bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains it stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to government of pennsylvania in 1963 becoming centerpiece of a state park restoration of bridge began in 2002 but before it was finished a tornado struck bridge in 2003 causing a large portion of bridge to collapse corroded anchor bolts holding bridge to its foundations failed contributing to collapse before its collapse kinzua bridge was ranked as fourth tallest railway bridge in united states it was listed on national register of historic places in 1977 and as a national historic civil engineering landmark by american society of civil engineers in 1982 ruins of kinzua bridge are in kinzua bridge state park off u s route 6 near borough of mount jewett pennsylvania first construction and service thumb original kinzua bridge before its reconstruction in 1900 alt a black and white photo of a bridge crossing a valley in 1882 thomas l kane president of new york lake erie and western railway nyle w was faced with challenge of building a branch line off main line in pennsylvania from bradford south to coal fields in elk county fastest way to do so was to build a bridge to cross kinzua valley only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional of track over rough terrain when built bridge was larger than any that had been attempted and over twice as large as largest similar structure at time portage bridge over genesee river in western new york first kinzua bridge was built by a crew of 40 from of wrought iron in just 94 working days between may 10 and august 29 1882 reason for short construction time was that scaffolding was not used in bridge s construction instead a gin pole was used to build first tower then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building second tower process was then repeated across all 20 towers bridge was designed by engineer octave chanute and was built by phoenix iron works which specialized in producing patented hollow iron tubes called phoenix columns because of design of these columns it was often mistakenly believed that bridge had been built out of wooden poles bridge s 110 sandstone masonry piers were quarried from hillside used for foundation of bridge tallest tower had a base that was wide bridge was designed to support a load of and was estimated to cost between 167 000 and 275 000 on completion bridge was tallest and longest railroad bridge in world and was advertised as eighth wonder of world six of bridge s 20 towers were taller than brooklyn bridge excursion trains from as far away as buffalo new york and pittsburgh would come just to cross kinzua bridge which held height record until viaduct tall was completed in france in 1884 trains crossing bridge were restricted to a speed of because locomotive and sometimes wind caused bridge to vibrate people sometimes visited bridge in hopes of finding loot of a bank robber who supposedly hid 40 000 in gold and currency under or near it second construction and service by 1893 nyle w had gone bankrupt and was merged with erie railroad which became owner of bridge by start of 20th century locomotives were almost 85 percent heavier and iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains last traffic crossed old bridge on may 14 1900 and removal of old iron began on may 24 new bridge was designed by c r grimm and was built by elmira bridge company out of of steel at a cost of 275 000 construction began on may 26 starting from both ends of old bridge a crew of between 100 and 150 worked 10 hour days for almost four months to complete new steel frame two howe truss timber travelers each long and deep were used to build towers each traveler was supported by a pair of original wrought iron towers separated by one that was to be replaced after middle tower was demolished and a new steel one built in its place traveler was moved down line by one tower and process was repeated construction of each new tower and spans adjoining it took one week to complete bolts used to hold towers to anchor blocks were reused from first bridge which would eventually play a major role in bridge s demise grimm designer of bridge later admitted that bolts should have been replaced kinzua viaduct reopened to traffic on september 25 1900 new bridge was able to safely accommodate one of largest steam locomotives in world big boy erie railroad maintained a station at kinzua viaduct constructed between 1911 and 1916 station was not manned by an agent station was closed sometime between 1923 and 1927 thumb historic american engineering record haer photo of bridge in july 1971 alt a black and white aerial photo of a bridge crossing a valley train crews would sometimes play a

rookie suddenly found himself terrified staring down three hundred feet 91 m from roof of a rocking boxcar even after being reconstructed bridge still had a speed limit of as bridge aged heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so engines could cross bridge one at a time diesel locomotives were lighter and did not face this limit bridge was last used by a steam locomotive on october 5 1950 erie railroad obtained trackage rights on nearby baltimore and ohio railroad b o line in late 1950s which allowed it to bypass aging kinzua bridge regular commercial service ended on june 21 1959 and erie sold bridge to kovalchick salvage company of indiana pennsylvania for 76 000 bridge was reopened for one day in october 1959 when a wreck on b o line forced trains to be rerouted across bridge according to american society of civil engineers kinzua bridge was a critical structure in facilitating transport of coal from northwestern pennsylvania to eastern great lakes region and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth state park thumb left kinzua bridge in 2001 before its collapse alt view across bridge from bridge deck a

dismantle it on seeing it for first time he is supposed to have said there will never be another bridge like this kovalchick worked with local groups who wanted to save structure and pennsylvania governor william scranton signed a bill into law on august 12 1963 to purchase bridge and nearby land for 50 000 and create kinzua bridge state park deed for park s was recorded on january 20 1965 and park was opened to public in 1970 thumb right photograph of asce historic civil engineering landmark plaque on kinzua bridge abutment in 2019 an access road to park was built in 1974 and new facilities there included a parking lot drinking water and toilets and installation of a fence on bridge deck there was an official ribbon cutting ceremony on july 5 1975 for park which was and is unique in park system since its centerpiece is a man made structure bridge was listed on national register of historic places on august 29 1977 and was named to national register of historic civil engineering landmarks by american society of civil engineers on june 26 1982 knox and kane railroad operated sightseeing trips from kane through allegheny national forest and over kinzua bridge from 1987 until bridge was closed in 2002 in 1988 it operated longest steam train excursion in united states a round trip to bridge from village of in forest county with a stop in kane new york times described being on bridge as more akin to ballooning than railroading and noted you stare straight out with nothing between you and an immense sea of verdure a hundred yards 91 m below railroad still operated excursions through forest and stopped at bridge s western approach until october 2004 as of 2009 kinzua bridge state park is a pennsylvania state park surrounding bridge and kinzua valley park is located off of u s route 6 north of mount jewett in hamlin and keating townships a scenic overlook within park allows views of fallen bridge and of valley and is also a prime location to view fall foliage during in mid october park has a shaded picnic area with a centrally located modern restroom before bridge s collapse visitors were allowed on or under bridge and hiking was allowed in

radar loop of storm over northern pennsylvania alt animation showing doppler radar image of a storm moving across region since 2002 kinzua bridge had been closed to all recreational pedestrian and railroad usage after it was determined that structure was at risk to high winds engineers had determined that during high winds bridge s center of gravity could shift putting weight onto only one side of bridge and causing it to fail an ohio based bridge construction and repair company had already started work on restoring kinzua bridge in february 2003 on july 21 2003 construction workers had already packed up and were starting to leave for day when a storm arrived a tornado within storm struck kinzua bridge snapping and uprooting nearby trees as well as causing 11 of 20 bridge towers to collapse there were no human deaths or injuries tornado was produced by a mesoscale convective system mcs a complex of strong thunderstorms that had formed over an area that included eastern ohio western pennsylvania western new york and southern ontario mcs traveled east at around as mcs crossed northwestern pennsylvania it formed into a distinctive comma shape northern portion of mcs contained a long lived mesocyclone a thunderstorm with a rotating updraft that is often conducive to tornados at approximately 15 20 edt 19 20 utc tornado touched down in kinzua bridge state park from kinzua bridge tornado classified as f1 on fujita scale passed by bridge and continued another before it lifted it touched down again from and traveled another before finally dissipating it was estimated to have been wide and it left a path long same storm also spawned an f3 tornado in nearby potter county when tornado touched down winds had increased to at least and were coming from east perpendicular to bridge which ran north south an investigation determined that towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first in a westerly direction meanwhile towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations moved slightly to northwest and set back down intact and upright held together by only railroad tracks on bridge next towers four through nine collapsed to west twisting clockwise as tornado started to move northward as it moved north inflow winds came in from south and caused towers 12 13 and 14 to finally collapse towards north twisting counterclockwise failures were caused by badly rusted base bolts holding bases of towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into ground an investigation determined that tornado had a wind speed of at least which applied an estimated of lateral force against bridge investigation also hypothesized that whole structure oscillated laterally four to five times before fatigue started to cause base bolts to fail towers fell intact in sections and suffered damage upon impact with ground century old bridge was destroyed in less than 30 seconds aftermath state decided not to rebuild kinzua bridge which would have cost an estimated 45 million instead it was proposed that ruins be used as a visitor attraction to show forces of nature at work kinzua bridge state park had attracted 215 000 visitors annually before bridge collapsed and was chosen by pennsylvania bureau of parks for its list of twenty must see pennsylvania state parks note despite title there are twenty one parks in list with colton point and leonard harrison state parks treated as one viaduct and its collapse were featured in history channel s life after people as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to collapse of any steel structure bridge was removed from national register of historic places on july 21 2004 knox and kane railroad was forced to suspend operations in october 2004 after a 75 percent decline in number of passengers possibly brought about by collapse of kinzua bridge kovalchick corporation bought knox and kane s tracks and all other property owned by railroad including locomotives and rolling stock kovalchick corporation also owns east broad top railroad and was company that owned kinzua bridge before selling it to state in 1963 company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove tracks and sell them for scrap right of way would then be used to establish a rail trail pennsylvania released 700 000 to design repairs on remaining towers and plan development of new park facilities in june 2005 in late 2005 pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources dcnr put forward an 8 million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors center with plans to allow access to bridge and a hiking trail giving views of fallen towers kinzua sky walk was opened on september 15 2011 in a ribbon cutting ceremony sky walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor at end of bridge that allows views of bridge and valley directly below walkway cost 4 3 million to construct but is estimated to bring in 11 5 million in tourism revenue for region see also list
