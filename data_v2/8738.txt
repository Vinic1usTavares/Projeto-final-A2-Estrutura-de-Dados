solo album and harrison s on dark horse their only official songwriting collaboration far east man is an affirmation of friendship in face of life s obstacles and musically reflects two guitarists adoption of soul genre written mostly by harrison composition has been interpreted as a restatement of humanitarian message expressed in his 1971 single bangla desh and a tribute to indian musician ravi shankar song originated during a period of romantic intrigue surrounding harrison s marriage to pattie boyd and wood s to his wife krissie which culminated in boyd leaving harrison for his and

confusion harrison s answer is to follow his instinct his heart leng sums up conclusion that harrison provides in middle eight s final line can only do what it tells me he surveys problems of love social strife and disconnection from spiritual values but decides that taking his own advice is a good enough start while echoing this interpretation theologian dale allison also highlights harrison s humanitarian impulse his regrets about world s current state and his faint utopian hope for something better as being evident in lyrics to far east man allison pp 15 141 allison likens song to harrison s 1971 compositions bangla desh and day world gets round and suggests that in choruses to far east man harrison is stating his determination to help impoverished and oppressed peoples half a world away allison pp 69 70 as reproduced in his autobiography harrison s original lyrics for final verse included lines that he would change before recording his version of song harrison pp 293 94 rewritten verse allows for an outlook that allison describes as a hope that people might be able to make world a truly better place allison p 73 according to his recollection in i me mine harrison
