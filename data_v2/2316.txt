1999 pacific hurricane season was one of least active pacific hurricane seasons on record season officially began on may 15 in eastern pacific and on june 1 in central pacific in both basins it ended on november 30 these dates conventionally delimit period during which most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean first tropical cyclone of season hurricane adrian developed on june 18 while final storm of season tropical storm irwin dissipated on october 11 no storms developed in central pacific during season however two storms from eastern pacific dora and eugene entered basin with former entering as a hurricane season produced fourteen tropical cyclones and nine named storms which was well below average of sixteen named storms per season this was largely due to a strong la nina taking over much of pacific however total of six hurricanes and two major hurricanes during season was near averages of eight and three respectively although it remained offshore hurricane adrian caused 6 deaths from flooding and rough surf in mexico hurricane dora was a long lived and intense cyclone which had second longest track of a pacific hurricane on record storm brought minor impacts to island of hawaii however no deaths or damage was reported deadliest tropical cyclone hurricane greg killed 10 people from flooding in mexico seasonal summary 1999 pacific hurricane season officially started on may 15 1999 in eastern pacific and on june 1 1999 in central pacific and lasted until november 30 1999 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in northeastern pacific ocean 1999 pacific hurricane season was well below average due to strong la nina that was occurring at time which causes wind shear to be increased and water temperatures to decrease resulting in conditions less conductive for tropical cyclones in east pacific there were 14 cyclones in total including 5 unnamed tropical depressions of these 9 became a tropical storm while 6 reached hurricane status further 2 of these became major hurricanes which is category 3 intensity or higher on saffir simpson hurricane scale tropical cyclogenesis began with hurricane adrian which developed on june 18 although it remained offshore adrian brought rough surf and flooding to mexico which resulted in 6 fatalities storm peaked as a category 2 before dissipating on june 22 no other tropical cyclones formed in june activity halted until july 9 when hurricane beatriz developed though it peaked as a category 3 hurricane before dissipating on july 17 storm caused no damage on land because it remained well offshore next system a short lived tropical depression three e did not result in impact as a tropical cyclone though precursor brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to central america tropical depression four e was first of three cyclones to cross into central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility which is between 140degw and international date line two other short lived system in july tropical storm calvin and tropical depression six e caused no damage in august hurricane dora strongest storm of 1999 pacific hurricane season produced gusty winds and large waves on johnston atoll and island of hawaii though minimal damage was left in its wake after crossing international date line on august 20 dora became first tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of north pacific eastern central and western since hurricane john in 1994 hurricane eugene also existed in eastern and central pacific but dissipated on august 15 while south of main hawaiian islands well before reaching international date line nonetheless it produced up to of rainfall on big island of hawaii in remainder of august there was a series of short lived tropical cyclones that did not effect land including tropical depression nine e tropical storm fernanda and tropical depression eleven e during month of september deadliest tropical cyclone of season hurricane greg was spawned near pacific coast of mexico greg which killed 10 people when it made landfall on southern baja california hurricane and its precursor produced heavy rainfall across much of mexico with highest total reaching 22 23 in 566 9 mm heavy rains damaged or destroyed more than 2 000 homes remnant moisture from system combined with an area of low pressure resulted in strong thunderstorms across california which led to numerous power outages damage to homes and vehicles and started many wildfires other in month of september was hurricane hilary a storm that approached baja california but dissipated offshore on september 21 resulting in no impact final system tropical storm irwin produced scattered areas of heavy rainfall over mexico in october but caused no significant flooding it dissipated on october 11 over a month and a half before official end of season on november 30 in addition to systems observed by cphc and nhc a tropical depression formed east of international dateline on august 19 and quickly exited cphc s area of responsibility however this storm was not included into cphc database systems hurricane adrian a broad area of low pressure developed into tropical depression one at 0600 utc on june 18 while situated 290 miles 465 km southeast of acapulco guerrero moving towards west northwestward depression intensified into tropical storm adrian about 12 hours later favorable levels of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures sst s caused storm to strengthen further early on june 20 adrian intensified into a hurricane while located about 420 miles 680 km south southeast of southern tip of baja california about 24 hours later adrian reached its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph 155 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 973 mbar 28 73 inhg after reaching peak intensity on june 21 adrian began weakening due to colder sst s and higher wind shear adrian fell to tropical storm status late on june 21 and further weakened to a tropical depression on june 22 six hours later at 1800 utc adrian degenerated into a swirl of low clouds while situated 300 mi 480 km southwest of southern tip of baja california heavy rainfall produced from storm caused minor flooding throughout mexico two fatalities were directly attributed to floods while another person was listed as missing four other people were killed when they drowned in rough seas produced offshore mexican coastline there is no damage estimate from heavy rainfall or rough seas associated with hurricane hurricane beatriz a tropical wave developed into by 0600 utc on july 9 while situated roughly 300 mi 480 km south of lazaro cardenas mexico at this time depression was in an environment of strong upper tropospheric outflow resulting in gradual intensification depression was upgraded to tropical storm beatriz at 1200 utc on july 9 steady strengthened continued and about 48 hours later beatriz became a category 1 while situated roughly 560 miles 900 km south southwest of cabo san lucas moving westward around southern periphery of a ridge to north it continued to intensify a well defined eye became visible on satellite imagery early on july 12 microwave imagery a few hours later revealed that beatriz was likely undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and was complete by 1700 utc further intensification occurred and beatriz became first major hurricane of season at 1800 utc on july 12 at 0600 utc following day hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph 195 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 955 mbar 28 20 inhg while situated roughly 800 miles 1300 km southwest of cabo san lucas curving towards west northwest beatriz began to encounter an area of cooler sea surface temperatures which led to gradual weakening hurricane weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 utc on july 16 and further to a tropical depression by 1800 utc that day at 0600 utc on july 17 beatriz degenerated into a swirl of clouds tropical depression three e a tropical wave moved across atlantic and caribbean in early july while crossing central america on july 11 and july 12 system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall especially in honduras nicaragua and mexico where precipitation reached in veracruz by july 13 wave and associated low pressure area emerged into pacific ocean system organized further and developed into tropical depression three e at 1200 utc on july 14 while located about west southwest of manzanillo mexico it initially headed west northwestward until july 15 when it curved west southwestward depression failed to strengthen further and dissipated at 1800 utc on july 15 while located about southwest of cabo san lucas mexico tropical depression four e on july 15 a tropical wave entered eastern pacific ocean over following days slow organization occurred and it is estimated that system became developed into tropical depression four e at 0000 utc on july 23 later that day depression reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph 55 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 1007 mbar 29 74 inhg having failed to reach tropical storm status while moving westward depression entered central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility on july 24 by this time however depression was already becoming disorganized and dissipated early on following day tropical storm calvin a tropical wave crossed atlantic ocean and caribbean sea between early and mid july later in month wave acquired a low level circulation thus tropical depression five e developed at 0600 utc on july 25 while situated about south southwest of cabo san lucas due to further organization on satellite imagery depression was upgraded to tropical storm calvin six hours later however wind shear exposed low level circulation and halted intensification calvin continued west northwestward as a sheared cyclone according to satellite classifications it is estimated that calvin weakened back to a tropical depression at 0600 utc on july 26 there was a convective burst late on july 26 though storm did not re strengthen around that time calvin turned northwestward in response to a mid tropospheric trough burst in convection did not persist and depression dissipated by 1200 utc on july 27 while located well west southwest of baja california a low cloud swirl remained and subsequently continued on a west northwesterly course for a few days tropical depression six e a tropical wave that previously crossed atlantic ocean and caribbean sea reached eastern pacific basin until late july system developed a surface circulation on july 26 while microwave imagery data indicated wind speeds of as a result it is estimated that tropical depression six e developed at 1800 utc while located nearly west southwest of southern tip of baja california and about southwest of tropical depression calvin depression moved toward west northwest and encountered strong vertical wind shear despite a few convective bursts depression remained weak and degenerated into a swirl of low clouds at 0000 utc on july 28 hurricane dora a tropical wave moved off africa on july 23 and crossed atlantic ocean without development however wave quickly increased in organization after entering eastern pacific ocean on august 4 and was designated tropical depression seven e on august 6 depression strengthened into tropical storm dora later that day dora continued to intensify despite upper level wind shear and became a hurricane on august 8 shortly after hurricane moved westward into a more favorable environment and began to intensify more quickly reaching category 4 strength on august 10 it maintained that intensity for three days as it moved almost due west dora weakened to category 1 strength as it entered central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility on august 14 however it briefly restrengthened into a category 3 as it passed south of hawaii on august 16 dora then began weakening for final time as it passed south of johnston atoll on august 18 at atoll dora produced large waves and wind gusts between 40 and 45 mph 75 and 85 km h in hawaii heavy surf on big island forced closure of beaches campsites and hiking trails in districts of kau and puna on august 20 dora crossed international date line shortly before weakening to a tropical storm due to vertical wind shear it did not re strengthen in western pacific basin storm weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity early on august 22 dora dissipated late on following day while situated several hundred miles east of wake island hurricane eugene a tropical wave crossed central america between july 28 and july 29 before entering pacific ocean and slowly organizing after cloud pattern consolidated it is estimated that tropical depression eight e developed at 0600 utc on august 6 while located about southwest of cabo san lucas mexico twelve hours later depression was upgraded to tropical storm eugene it continued to deepen reaching hurricane status late on august 8 about 24 hours later eugene peaked as a strong category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph 175 km h storm began to weaken and was downgraded to a category 1 hurricane early on august 11 eugene continued westward and on august 11 it entered central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility it continued to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on august 13 eugene passed south of hawaiian islands on august 14 with minimal impact noted minor surf occurred along east and southeast shores of big island additionally 24 hour rainfall totals over windward sections of maui and big island were near storm weakened to a tropical depression by late on august 14 at 0000 utc on august 16 eugene dissipated while located about southeast of johnston atoll tropical depression nine e a tropical wave moved off african coast on july 27 and entered pacific ocean on august 6 system continued westward without development until august 11 when convection began to increase by 1200 utc on august 13 national hurricane center began classifying system as tropical depression nine e due easterly wind shear depression did not further intensify as it moved on a generally west northwesterly track depression had dissipated by august 15 tropical storm fernanda a tropical wave developed into tropical depression ten e at 0600 utc on august 17 while located about in south southwest of socorro island mexico depression intensified gradually due to favorable conditions at 0000 utc on august 18 cyclone was upgraded to tropical storm fernanda while centered about southwest of socorro island storm continued to slowly strengthened and 1200 utc on august 19 fernanda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph 100 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of around time of peak intensity on august 19 fernanda curved west southwest track a motion which persisted for remainder of its duration while this track carried storm over warmer sst s increasing easterly wind shear caused fernanda to weaken by early on august 21 fernanda weakened to a tropical depression after weakening slightly further storm degenerated into a remnant low cloud swirl at 0000 utc on august 23 remnants of fernanda persisted until finally losing its identity about west southwest of socorro island on august 28 tropical depression eleven e a tropical wave entered eastern pacific on august 15 and formed a surface low pressure area south of mexico on august 19 after consolidating and organizing somewhat system became tropical depression eleven e late on august 23 however colder sst s caused convection to diminish almost immediately while moving parallel to southern coast of baja california as thunderstorm activity slowly decreased due to cool sst s by 1200 utc on august 24 depression dissipated just west of tip of baja california having lasted for less than 24 hours highest rainfall total reported in mexico was at los cabos baja california sur hurricane greg northern portion of a tropical wave in atlantic spawned tropical storm emily while southern portion headed westward and crossed central america between august 31 and september 1 thereafter system emerged into pacific ocean and began to organize by 1200 utc on september 5 tropical depression twelve e developed near manzanillo mexico six hours later depression strengthened into tropical storm greg further intensification occurred and late on september 6 greg was upgraded to a hurricane as winds reached 75 mph 120 km h however greg weakened to a tropical storm on september 7 while approaching baja california at 2100 utc that day it made landfall near cabo san lucas storm then curved westward and weakened over colder sst s until dissipating on late september 9 both and its predecessor disturbance brought heavy rain to much of mexico highest report was of 22 23 inches 566 9 mm in tecoman colima precipitation from greg caused flooding in states of colima michoacan sinaloa nayarit and jalisco it was most severe along los river flooding killed ten people in addition 2 000 people were rendered homeless and 2 000 others were affected in some way remnants of greg produced thunderstorms in california particularly san francisco bay area as a result there was widespread power outages and isolated damage to houses and vehicles as well as causing several small wildfires overall damage was relatively limited however hurricane hilary a tropical wave moved off coast of western africa into atlantic ocean on august 29 it continued to move westward through tropical waters of atlantic into caribbean it still remained a tropical wave as it moved over central america and began to acquire more convection and organization from september 10 through september 11 visible satellite imagery showed low level circulation and more organized deep convection as it became a tropical depression on september 17 while located about south southeast of southern tip of baja california peninsula system strengthened and was upgraded to tropical storm hilary at 1200 utc on september 18 due to development of an eye feature and large increase in deep convection hilary was upgraded to hurricane on september 20 while located about southwest of baja california peninsula however later that day hilary weakened back to a tropical storm storm fell further to tropical depression status on september 21 hours later storm degenerated into a swirl of low level clouds as it bypassed baja california on september 21 tropical storm irwin southern portion of tropical wave that previously spawned tropical depression eleven in gulf of mexico entered pacific ocean in early october after becoming better organized system developed into tropical depression fourteen e at 1200 utc on october 8 while situated about south southwest of manzanillo mexico depression initially moved slowly north northwestward and strengthened into tropical storm irwin about six hours later after a strong mid tropospheric ridge developed over northern mexico irwin moved northwestward and remained offshore mexico early on october 9 center of storm passed within about of coastline between manzanillo and cabo corrientes storm then curved west northwestward and at 1800 utc on october 9 irwin attained peaked with winds of 60 mph 95 km h stable air and increasing wind shear caused irwin to weaken and fall to tropical depression intensity early on october 11 about 12 hours later storm dissipated while located about southwest of cabo san lucas while passing offshore irwin brought patches of heavy rainfall to some areas of mexico peaking at in de guerrero guerrero storm names following names were used for named storms in pacific in 1999 this is same list used in 1993 season no new names were used for first time in pacific basin no storms were retired during season thus this same list was used again in 2005 season adrian beatriz calvin dora eugene fernanda greg hilary irwin for storms that form in central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility encompassing area between 140degw and international date line all names are used in a series of four rotating lists next four names that were slated for use in 1999 are shown below however none of them were used season effects this is a table of all storms that have formed in 1999 pacific hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while storm was extratropical
