january 10 1956 presley arrived at studio with song ready to record without seeking rca s approval and although producer steve sholes was not sure that it would be a success he recorded heartbreak hotel believing that presley knew what he was doing recording at rca victor was a different experience for presley and his band who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at sun studio guitar player scotty moore later commented it was a larger studio than sun s and more regimented they called everything by a tape number we would sit around at sun eat hamburgers and then somebody would say let s try something almost immediately sholes discovered a problem while recording presley rca victor had always insisted their performers stay still as they sang so microphone would pick up vocals even slightest tilt of head would result in missing sound sholes had told presley to stand on a painted x on floor telling him whatever you do don t move during recording of i got a woman sholes noticed that presley s voice and guitar were not always being picked up by microphone presley explained to sholes that he had to jump around to sing it right it s something that just happens just a part of way i sing sholes arranged for whole studio to be re miked so that presley s voice and guitar could be picked up from anywhere in studio and recording continued as well as blue moon boys his regular backing band of moore bassist bill black and drummer d j fontana presley was joined by established rca victor musicians chet atkins who also helped sholes produce session on guitar and floyd cramer on piano following a suggestion from presley sholes used a hallway at studio to get an unusual echo for single sholes was attempting to recapture sun records sound but he was unaware that sun founder sam phillips had used two tape recorders and a slight time delay to create it on previous presley recordings raymond susan director 1987 re released 2000 elvis 56 in beginning dvd warner vision when phillips first heard heartbreak hotel he remarked that it was a morbid mess most others at rca agreed declaring heartbreak hotel a terrible choice of song especially after hearing that finished recording sounded nothing like presley s sun recordings internal memos from time show that every one of rca s executive corps disliked it so much that one of them insisted we certainly can t release that one p 64 in an interview durden conceded that he did not recognize his song after presley had made changes to it in studio including tempo phrasing lyrics and overall sound in subsequent recordings these major modifications to existing material became a normal procedure for presley who took over role of producer although sholes was still credited speaking of sholes producing credits
