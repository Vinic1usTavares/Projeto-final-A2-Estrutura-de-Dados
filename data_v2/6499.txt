groups of early 1990s incineration was recorded on a hi 8 video camera by k foundation collaborator gimpo in august 1995 film watch k foundation burn a million quid quid is a widely used british slang word meaning pounds sterling singular or plural a quid a million quid was toured around uk with drummond and cauty engaging each audience in debate about burning and its meaning in november 1995 duo pledged to dissolve k foundation and to refrain from public discussion of burning for a period of 23 years but drummond spoke about burning in 2000 and 2004 initially he was unrepentant but in 2004 he admitted to bbc that he regretted burning money collaborator chris brook edited and compiled a book k foundation burn a million quid which was published by ellipsis books in 1997 it compiles stills from film accounts of events and viewer reactions one image in book shows a house brick that was manufactured from fire s ashes background as klf bill drummond and jimmy cauty were biggest selling singles act in world for 1991 they had also enjoyed considerable success with their album white room and a number one hit single tardis as in february 1992 klf staged an incendiary performance at brit awards and retired from music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion by their own account neither drummond nor cauty kept any of money they made as klf it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions cauty told an australian big issue writer in 2003 that all money they made as klf was spent and that royalties they accrued post retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds initially klf s earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by k foundation drummond and cauty s new post klf art project but said drummond we realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle that s whole point based on an interview with drummond and cauty on radio glasgow 3 november 1995 instead duo decided to create art with money nailed to wall was first piece of art produced by foundation and major piece in their planned art exhibition money a major body of cash consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame piece was presented to press on 23 november 1993 during buildup to foundation s announcement of winner of their worst artist of year award k foundation art award decision and burning during first half of 1994 k foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging money a major body of cash but even old friend jayne casey director of liverpool festival trust was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate tate in liverpool wanted to be part of 21st century festival i m involved with says casey i suggested they put on k foundation exhibition at first they were encouraging but they seemed nervous about personalities involved a curt fax from gallery curator informed casey that k foundation s exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly leaving drummond and cauty obliged to pursue other options duo considered taking exhibition across former soviet union by train and on to united states but no insurer would touch project an exhibition at kilmainham jail in dublin was then considered but no sooner had a provisional august date been set for it than duo changed their minds yet again jimmy said why don t we just burn it remembers drummond he said it in a light hearted way i suppose hoping i d say no we can t do that let s do this but it seemed most powerful thing to do cauty we were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it that was about six weeks before we did it it was too long it was a bit of a nightmare journey from deciding to burn money to deciding how to burn money to actually burning money was a long one jim reid a freelance journalist and only independent witness to burning reported various schemes k foundation considered first was offering nailed to wall to tate gallery as 1995 k foundation bequest to nation condition was that gallery must agree to display piece for at least 10 years if they refused money would be burnt a second idea was to hire bankside power station future site of tate gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from south bank as a bonfire venue in typical klf guerrilla communication style posters were to appear on 15 august bearing legend 1995 k foundation bequest to nation under which would have been an image of nailed to wall on an easel and two flame throwers lying on floor on 24 august a new poster would go up exactly same as first except that this time work would be burnt k foundation s final solution for their one million pound problem was rather less showbiz but dramatic nonetheless foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of event would lessen its impact on 22 august reid drummond cauty and gimpo touched down at islay airport in inner hebrides and took a ferry to island of jura previously scene of a wicker man burning ceremony by klf early in morning of 23 august 1994 in an abandoned boathouse on jura drummond and cauty incinerated money burning was witnessed by reid who subsequently wrote an article about act for observer and it was filmed on a hi 8 video camera by collaborator gimpo as burning began reid said he felt guilt and shock these feelings he reported quickly turned to boredom money took well over an hour to burn as drummond and cauty fed ps50 notes into fire according to drummond only about ps900 000 of money was actually burnt with remainder flying straight up chimney two days later according to reid jimmy cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of burning ten months later gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy film watch k foundation burn a million quid starts with a short description of event and then consists of drummond and cauty throwing ps50 notes onto fire burning

public screening on glasgow green on 5 november was announced by various newspapers but there is no record of showing having ever occurred k foundation disappeared from glasgow they later issued a statement that on 5 november 1995 they had signed a contract at cape wrath in northern scotland agreeing to wind up k foundation and not to speak about money burning for a period of 23 years despite k foundation s reported moratorium further national screenings of film organised by chris brook took place as planned at each screening drummond and cauty announced they would not answer questions after

brick lane screening on 8 december 1995 had been previewed in nme and was chaotically busy it was originally planned for a car park but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and screening was

that after screening film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to public gimpo owner of film had no intention of doing so but after screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of film burning as a theme thumb ellipsis k foundation style advert promoting book k foundation burn a million quid ritualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of drummond and cauty s work in 1987 duo disposed of copies of their copyright breaching debut album justified ancients of mu mu s 1987 what fuck is going on by burning them in a swedish field this event was pictured on back sleeve of their second album who killed jams and celebrated in song burn bastards during 1991 summer solstice they burnt a wicker man this was chronicled in klf movie rites of mu as k foundation drummond and cauty threatened to burn k foundation art award prize money gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when at last moment rachel accepted prize in seventh k foundation press advert they asked what would you do with a million pounds burn it reaction and analysis jim reid s piece appeared in observer on 25 september 1994 this is one of most peculiar stories of year he cautioned readers peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is truth it took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames he added i looked at it closely it was real it came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey more importantly perhaps after working with k foundation i know they are capable of this daily express ran story on 1 october 1994 they reported that charred ps50 notes were being found by islanders who did not doubt burning had really taken place drummond and cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on jura before leaving with two suitcases newspaper reported times followed with essentially same story on 4 october 1994 adding that burning had left many on island bewildered incredulous and angry ps1 500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to islay police sergeant lachlan maclean checked money with both banks on islay and with customs and excise who pronounced it genuine i telephoned mr drummond in london and told him money had been found i asked him if it was his he said he would get in touch with his partner mr cauty so far he has not telephoned back media returned to story in earnest in october and november 1995 previewing and then reviewing foundation course in art and reporting on k foundation s tour screening watch k foundation burn a million quid an october 1995 feature quoted kevin hull bbc documentary maker responsible for omnibus item saying he had found boys rather depressed and almost in a state of shock every day i wake up and i think oh god i ve burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it s wrong cauty told him a piece in times on 5 november 1995 coinciding with glasgow screenings reported that k foundation had no solid reason for burning money or view of what if anything act represented but concluded k foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse power of money and responsibilities of those who possess it and what could be more artistic than that in same issue newspaper s k foundation art award witness robert wrote that foundation s award million pound artwork and burning were all entertaining and satirically quite sharp but art world has chosen not to think of it as art general view remains that k foundation s preoccupation with money though undoubtedly sincere simply isn t very original although they didn t blow their entire life s savings along way other artists notably yves klein and chris burden have been here before guardian tv reviewer was sceptical snag is k men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion so nobody quite believes they really burned money and if they did they must be nuts later reaction in following years burning was mentioned regularly in press with drummond and cauty often relegated to a cultural status of men who burnt a million quid a february 2000 article in observer newspaper again insisted that duo really had burnt one million pounds it wasn t a stunt they really did it if you want to rile bill drummond you call him a i knew it was real a long time friend and associate of his group klf tells me because afterwards jimmy and bill looked so and haunted and to be honest they ve never really been same since a 2004 listener poll by bbc radio 6 music saw klf k foundation placed second after who in a list of rock excesses drummond s former protege julian cope was unimpressed claiming that drummond still owed him money he burned a million pounds which was not all his and some of it was mine people should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry wank stunts like that legacy on 17 september 1997 a new film this brick was premiered film consisted of one three minute shot of a brick made from ashes of money burnt at jura it was shown at barbican centre prior to drummond and cauty s performance as 2k on 27 september 1997 k foundation burn a million quid paperback was published book by chris brook and gimpo contains stills from film and transcriptions of various q a sessions from tour it also includes a timeline of k foundation activity and sundry essays including one from alan moore publisher ellipsis promoted book with an advert modelled on those of k foundation why did ellipsis publish k foundation burn a million quid they asked initially drummond was unrepentant telling observer in 2000 that he couldn t imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only an expensive clinic could cure him by 2004 however he had admitted to bbc difficulty of explaining his decision it s a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn t get any easier i wish i could explain why i did it so people would understand a foundation course in art a self produced documentary about k foundation s various activities originally aired on bbc1 on 8 november 1995 as an episode of omnibus has been regularly online as k foundation burn a million quid mainly due to inclusion of footage from burning which were shown during tour references external
