concepting ikuhara has stated that his chief inspiration behind sarazanmai was a desire to create a series about kappas as majority of stories about yokai supernatural monsters are fables for children he wished to create a story about yokai for an adult audience more sensationalistic elements of sarazanmai s plot such as centrality of shirikodama extraction were intentionally omitted from series pitch to improve series chances of being greenlit with ikuhara stating that when you make an original anime you may come up with some really out there ideas but pitch may not get through that s why you put in really wacky stuff after it s already been approved ikuhara has additionally stated that he wished to create a series where primary protagonists were male in contrast to female centric

which will be directed and written by ise and supervised by ikuhara will be staged at theater 1010 in tokyo from november 28 to december 1 2019 and at cool japan park osaka in osaka on december 7 and 8 2019 who voiced sara azuma in anime series will reprise her role for stage play themes and references primary theme of sarazanmai is connections quoting ikuhara in an interview with pash plus similarly to ikuhara s previous works thematic content of sarazanmai is in direct reference to major world events and systems sarazanmai was inspired in part by 2011 tohoku earthquake and tsunami which informed series focus on materialism in an interview with japan post ikuhara stated that disaster was a lesson in how material things can be damaged and are not eternal i have a feeling that young people have a desire to connect with each other instead of a desire for material things series anti consumerism stance is most overly expressed through kappa zombies which revolve around specific objects delivered by kappazon an amazon analogue consequently sarazanmai makes explicit theme of anti capitalism which critic gabriella ekens described as having operated below surface of ikuhara s earlier shows but never quite risen to level of explicit text ekens argues that series anti capitalist message manifests along three major plot elements reo and mabu s subservience to otter empire as an expression of capitalism s selective elevation of people from marginalized groups to positions of authority chikai s faustian bargain with capital to save his family leading to his demise and kappazon and otter empire representing capitalism s tendency towards monopolization and exploitation word sarazanmai is derived from word sara sara plate referring to plates located on heads of kappas from which they supposedly draw their power and suffix zanmai zanmai referring to indulgence it is also a close variation of three plates a reference to three primary characters who are turned into kappas series setting of asakusa and ueno is location of kappabashi dori kitchen town its name a pun for area s proliferation of kappa imagery and wholesalers was positively received by critics and was listed as one of best series of spring 2019 anime season by james beckett and christopher farris in anime news network s quarterly anime season ratings in his review of series for kotaku critic christopher lee inoa praised sarazanmai as ikuhara s most optimistic streamlined and realistic yes really series to date inoa characterizes series as a positive step forward for ikuhara s career after messy yurikuma arashi noting that despite sarazanmai being a shorter series production issues and compressed storytelling of yurikuma arashi are not present in their review of series for comic book resources critic reuben baron praised series animation calling it by far most impressive ikuhara made anime from a strictly animation based perspective outside of his 1999 film adolescence of utena and specifically noted its positive portrayal of gay characters reviewing series for anime news network critic gabriella ekens described sarazanmai as a fantastic show but qualified series as my least favorite within ikuhara s oeuvre calling it his least complex and most technically flawed work while ekens praises series thematic material she charges that sarazanmai retreads subjects explored in ikuhara s previous works characterizing series as repetitious even more so than ikuhara s previous output on highest level of overt text it s kind of just a pared down version of what s become s archetypal narrative notes references external links category anime with original screenplays category aniplex franchises category coming of age anime and manga category cross dressing in
