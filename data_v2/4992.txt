it fifth largest town in angus presence of a number of class ii and iii pictish stones points to monifieth having had some importance as an ecclesiastical centre in early medieval period lands were a possession of celi de monastic order until they were granted to tironensian monks of arbroath abbey in early 13th century until early 19th century monifieth remained a small village but grew rapidly due to expansion of local textile industry monifieth is considered a commuter town and suburb of its closest city dundee which it is physically attached to politically monifieth can be seen to be a stronghold of scottish national party being represented at local national and european levels by snp politicians town falls within boundaries of angus council but was part of dundee city council from 1975 to 1996 local constituency boundary and whether monifieth should fall within angus or dundee council areas continues to be a source of debate public transport consists mainly of bus services operated by stagecoach buses town is served by monifieth railway station with hourly trains to dundee edinburgh and north to arbroath its nearest major road is a92 and town is connected to dundee by a930 history toponomy name monifieth is generally taken to derive from gaelic feith hill of deer an alternative etymology fother monks land has been suggested which holds some appeal due to monifieth s early status as a possession of celi de monastic order monifieth has been given various spellings over years including monifod monifod and before becoming standardised as monifieth on publication of first edition of ordnance survey maps early history thumb left pictish stone formerly incorporated within structure of st rule s church now on display at museum of earliest evidence for occupation of area surrounding monifieth dates to mesolithic period midden pits of that age have been found nearby at and worked flints apparently of that age have been found at balmossie more tangible evidence for settlement can be found from neolithic period for example with cursus monument identified from cropmarks near woodhill between monifieth and carnoustie this cursus is of a similar scale to well characterised mid 4th century bc enclosure found nearby at near numerous stones incised with cup and ring marks have also been found in surrounding area approximately to north of monifieth lies laws hill on which lies iron age ruins of a broch and vitrified fort these ruins are much reduced as stone from their walls has been used on estate for construction of dykes and drains well into 19th century and while very little remains of structure today tradition recorded in 1842 attests to walls being tall at beginning of 19th century artefacts found at and around site include a quantity of gold coins iron spear heads and a stone lamp one artefact found near laws hill but now lost and only known from an illustration is that of a pictish crescent plate found in a cist grave which incorporated a later norse younger runic inscription tha this find is particularly intriguing in light of paucity of viking archaeology in this part of scotland domestic remains from late prehistoric period can also be found in abundance in area perhaps most well known are souterrains at and ardestie but cropmarks point to other settlements of that age for instance at woodhill medieval history prior to thirteenth century church and lands of monifieth were possessions of celi de monastic order church was endowed to recently founded tironensian abbey of arbroath by gille crist mormaer of angus around 1201 1207 and lands to south of church now much reduced in size due to erosion in 1242 1243 by matilda countess of angus a hoard of 700 coins dating to reigns of edward i and edward ii were found in this area in 1854 present building of st rule s church built 1812 originally incorporated three class ii and class iii pictish early medieval sculpted stones recycled as building stones including one that had previously been used in pre reformation building it replaced these stones were removed in mid 19th century and along with a fourth stone found in an adjoining garden were donated to national museums of scotland in 1871 they represent some of latest pictish era monuments and can be confidently dated to late 9th early 10th centuries modern history monifieth remained a small village comprising a number of turf huts until early 19th century in eighteenth century economy of parish was mainly dependent on agriculture other industries included quarrying weaving within home and start of manufacturing of linseed oil at a water powered mill by dighty burn supporting a small community milltown later named as milton of monifieth although monifieth had no harbour cargo
