bajadasaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from early cretaceous epoch late berriasian to valanginian stages of northern patagonia argentina it was first described in 2019 based on a single specimen found in 2010 that includes a largely complete skull and parts of neck only species is bajadasaurus pronuspinax genus is classified as a member of dicraeosauridae a group of comparatively small and short necked sauropods that lived from early or middle jurassic to end of early cretaceous bajadasaurus sported bifurcated extremely elongated extending from neck vertebrae similar elongated spines are known from closely related and more completely known amargasaurus various possible functions have been proposed for these spines in amargasaurus with 2019 description of bajadasaurus suggesting that they could have served as passive defense against predators in both genera skull was gracile and equipped with around 44 teeth that were pencil shaped and restricted to front of jaws eye openings of bajadasaurus were exposed in top view of skull possibly allowing animal to look forwards while feeding bajadasaurus was discovered in sedimentary rocks of bajada colorada formation and its environment resembled a braided river system it shared its environment with other dinosaurs including sauropod leinkupal and different theropods discovery and naming thumb left location and quarry map of holotype only specimen was excavated in 2010 by palaeontologists of conicet science agency of argentinian government site of discovery bajada colorada locality is located south town of picun leufu near western banks of limay river in patagonia specimen of which only some teeth were initially exposed was found by argentinian palaeontologist pablo gallina as fossils in this area are often fragile specimen was not excavated bone by bone in field but extracted as a single large block of rock and bone wrapped in plaster preparation of block in laboratory then revealed most of skull as well as first two and probably fifth neck vertebrae of a new genus of dinosaur site of discovery is part of bajada colorada formation a succession of sedimentary rocks in neuquen basin that is dated to late berriasian to valanginian stages of early cretaceous specimen is now curated by museo municipal ernesto bachmann in villa el chocon neuquen province under specimen number pv 75 specimen was formally described as holotype of a new genus and species bajadasaurus pronuspinax by gallina and colleagues in 2019 generic name is derived from spanish word bajada downhill in reference to bajada colorada locality and greek saurus lizard specific name is derived from latin bent over forward and greek spinax spine referring to long and anteriorly curved spinous processes of neck description thumb upright 1 2 left speculative life restoration based on amargasaurus bajadasaurus is classified as a member of sauropod family dicraeosauridae as all sauropods dicraeosaurids were large four legged herbivores with a long neck and tail and proportionally very small head they were however small in comparison with most other sauropods roughly reaching sizes of present day asian elephants and their neck was comparatively short long bifurcated neural spines were a common feature of group although only extremely elongated in bajadasaurus and closely related amargasaurus skull thumb upright skull in side view top with interpretive diagram bottom skull includes most of and bones of as well as lower jaws and parts of upper jaws and is therefore most complete skull of a dicraeosaurid known to date middle section of skull is not preserved its overall built was gracile all bones that surround eye opening are preserved except for which would have formed lower margin of opening which formed front margin of orbit had a straight ridge on its upper half that was similar to that of dicraeosaurus it was pierced by a small opening unlike larger foramen seen in dicraeosaurus upper front corner of orbit was formed by contribution of prefrontal to orbit was however smaller than in dicraeosaurus and amargasaurus bone was also smaller and less robust than in latter genera upper rim of orbit was formed by which was fused to behind together these bones formed most of rear part of skull roof in top view side margin of frontal was s shaped and narrowed from back to front as a result eye openings were visible in top view unlike in related genera except lingwulong at back frontal also formed a small part of a major opening on rear part of skull roof rear margin of orbit was formed by typically in dinosaurs this bone featured a rearwards extending process posterior process in bajadasaurus dicraeosaurus and amargasaurus this process was reduced and indistinct downward projecting process of a bone forming upper rear corner of skull was well developed this suggests that it was connected to at lower rear edge of skull although articulation itself is not preserved this probable articulation is absent in diplodocids and has not previously been documented in dicraeosaurids behind orbit and framed by squamosal postorbital quadratojugal and jugal was another major skull opening in bajadasaurus this opening was narrow and obliquely oriented quadratojugal formed an obtuse angle that framed lower rear part of lateral temporal fenestra different from condition seen in diplodocids thumb left and in top left and rear views right braincase is mostly hidden from view by overlaying bones with only rear part being exposed uppermost bone of occipital region is which in bajadasaurus was completely fused to bone below and featured a distinct and narrow longitudinal ridge a pair of openings between parietal and occipital region were extended medially towards mid plane of skull which is an autapomorphy of bajadasaurus a unique feature not found in closely related genera which articulated with first vertebra of neck was wider than high its rear surface was not wider than its neck different from amargasaurus and dicraeosaurus which formed part of underside of braincase had a pair of gracile bony extensions which extended forwards and downwards to articulate with pterygoid of palate bracing braincase against latter an autapomorphy of genus these processes were longer and slenderer than in dicraeosaurus and amargasaurus being more than six times longer than wide left and right pterygoids only elements preserved of palate featured a smooth crest that received basipterygoid processes thumb upright lower jaw in side a top b inner c and front d views teeth were restricted to front parts of jaws and were pencil shaped with their narrow crowns nearly straight or slightly curved inwards of upper jaw only front section of left largest bone of upper jaw is preserved it preserves eight tooth sockets a count similar to suuwassea but less than in dicraeosaurus which had 12 teeth in each maxilla a seemingly complete tooth row of 24 teeth was found close to but separated from left maxilla this count corresponds to tooth count of where teeth are still anchored within left and right only tooth bearing bones of lower jaw bajadasaurus thus likely had 44 teeth in total dentary was slender similar to suuwassea but unlike deep dentary of dicraeosaurus in top view dentaries do not form box shaped snout seen in diplodocids but are more rounded with a j shaped curvature as typical for dicraeosaurids front of dentary had a hook like chin projecting downwards as seen in other angular bone of hind part of lower jaw was very elongated and longer than surangular bone unlike in diplodocids neck vertebrae thumb left neck vertebra thought to be fifth with long neural spines both small triangular bones located between first neck vertebra and skull were found in articulation with skull of first neck vertebra only upper elements are preserved these were triangular and wing like in bajadasaurus second neck vertebra is nearly complete as in dicraeosaurus it was twice as high as long while its or vertebral body was twice as long as high sidewards projecting processes were small and directed backwards as in suuwassea rather than downwards as in dicraeosaurus and amargasaurus neural spine of axis was narrow and not bifurcated it differed from other sauropods in being vertically oriented an autapomorphy of genus triangular in cross section and tapering towards its apex only a single vertebra is known from remainder of neck this vertebra sported most prominent feature of genus an extremely elongated neural spine that was deeply bifurcated into a left and right rod like element this pair of rod like elements measures in length and made vertebra four times taller than long among sauropods it was only comparable to those of related amargasaurus but unlike in latter spine was not directed backwards but curved toward front their base was triangular and compressed sideways their cross section along most of their length was egg shaped their tips broadened slightly unlike acute tips in amargasaurus in amargasaurus spines show striations on their surface that indicate that a horn sheath was present in life although similar striations cannot be observed on spines of bajadasaurus due to poor preservation gallina and colleagues found it likely that they were covered by a horny sheath as well exact position of vertebra in neck is unclear however its morphology is comparable to fifth neck vertebra of dicraeosaurus probably sixth of brachytrachelopan and seventh of amargasaurus based on these comparisons it was tentatively described as fifth neck vertebra centrum of this vertebra was twice as long as tall and narrowed into a longitudinal keel on underside this keel was broader and concave in other dicraeosaurids classification thumb right related genus amargasaurus whose similarly elongate neural spines were compared to those of bajadasaurus dicraeosaurids are one of three principal families comprising diplodocoidea a major subdivision of sauropod dinosaurs within diplodocoidea dicraeosaurids form sister group of diplodocidae while third family rebbachisauridae is more distantly related dicraeosaurids and diplodocids are united within group which is named after whip like tail characteristic for group in their 2019 description of bajadasaurus gallina and colleagues recognised seven additional dicraeosaurid genera earliest is lingwulong from late early to early middle jurassic of china while three genera are known from late jurassic brachytrachelopan from argentina suuwassea from us and eponymous dicraeosaurus from tanzania early cretaceous dicraeosaurids include bajadasaurus as well as amargatitanis pilmatueia and amargasaurus all from argentina an unnamed specimen from itapecuru formation of brazil indicates that group persisted at least until end of early cretaceous thumb isolated tooth row showing premaxillary pm1 4 and maxillary teeth m1 8 in their phylogenetic analysis gallina and colleagues recovered bajadasaurus as an intermediate member of dicraeosauridae more derived advanced than suuwassea and lingwulong but less so than pilmatueia amargasaurus dicraeosaurus and brachytrachelopan amargatitanis was removed from analysis due to its unstable position referral of bajadasaurus to dicraeosauridae was supported by six synapomorphies anatomical features shared with other members of group bajadasaurus itself can be differentiated from other dicraeosaurids by a unique combination of features which includes four autapomorphies a medially extended fenestra slender and long basipterygoid processes vertically oriented neural spine of second neck vertebra and elongated forward curved neural spines in neck following cladogram by gallina and colleagues 2019 shows possible relationships between members of dicraeosauridae palaeobiology function of neural spines thumb upright left interpretation of soft part anatomy of a neck vertebra of related amargasaurus showing bifurcated neural spines supravertebral diverticulum and horn sheaths in cross section a similar anatomy has been suggested for bajadasaurus elongated and deeply bifurcated neural spines were common in dicraeosaurids in dicraeosaurus and brachytrachelopan they were inclined toward front but remained much shorter than in bajadasaurus only spines of amargasaurus were similarly elongated spines of amargasaurus led to much speculation about their possible life appearance and function as hypothesised by separate authors they could have supported a sail or horny sheaths and could have been used for display defense or thermoregulation daniela schwarz and colleagues in 2007 found that double row formed by bifurcated neural spines along spine of dicraeosaurids would have enclosed an air sac so called supravertebral diverticulum that would have been connected to lungs as part of respiratory system in dicraeosaurus this air sac would have occupied entire space between left and right parts of spines while it would have been restricted to lower third of spines in amargasaurus upper two thirds would likely have been covered by a horny sheath as is indicated by longitudinal striations on their surface gallina and colleagues in 2019 considered this most reasonable interpretation that may likewise be applied to bajadasaurus these researchers further argued that horn is more resistant to impact related fractures than bone and that a horny sheath would therefore have protected delicate spines from damage fracturing of spines might have been a critical threat as bases of spines roofed spinal chord protection of sheath would have been further enhanced if it would have extended past its bony core schwarz and colleagues reconstructed amargasaurus with horny sheaths that did not reach far beyond their bony core same is true for most modern reptiles in some modern even toed ungulates however horny sheath can be double length of horn core and exquisitely preserved ankylosaur was found with horny sheaths that extended length of its spines by 25 demonstrating that substantial horny extensions may occur in dinosaurs as well gallina and colleagues suggested that spines of amargasaurus and bajadasaurus might have been 50 longer than indicated by their bony core their bending would have further increased their resistance as is case in modern bighorn sheep thumb speculative skeletal reconstruction by gallina and colleagues 2019 showing known elements in white total number of neck vertebrae and length of spines is based on amargasaurus gallina and colleagues further speculated that spines in both amargasaurus and bajadasaurus might have been used for defense due to its forward bent bifurcated neural spine of supposed fifth neck vertebra would have reached past head acting as what was compared to a fence to deter predators similar even larger spikes were postulated for following neck vertebrae moderate damages would result in break off of horny tips leaving bony spine intact amargasaurus lived around 15 million years later than bajadasaurus indicating that elongated neural spines were a long lasting defense strategy senses orientation of semicircular canals ring like structures in inner ear that house sense of balance have been used to reconstruct habitual head postures in some dinosaurs palaeontologist paulina inferred that amargasaurus would have had its snout facing downwards assuming a similar head orientation in bajadasaurus gallina and colleagues hypothesised that exposure of eye openings in top view might have allowed animal to look forward while feeding while sight of most other sauropods was limited to sides these researchers furthermore speculated that this feature could have allowed for stereoscopic vision paleoenvironment bajadasaurus was recovered from bajada colorada formation a geological formation of mendoza group that is exposed in northern patagonia formation is composed of red and green brown sandstones and conglomerates of fine to coarse grain size together with bands of reddish claystones and light brown siltstones these sediments were mostly deposited by braided rivers as is evident by well preserved river channels with cross bedding paleosols are present in formation bajada colorada formation overlies and picun leufu formations at its top it is separated by overlying formation by an unconformity sedimentation hiatus that has been dated at 134 mya bajadasaurus stems from bajada colorada locality type locality of formation locality yielded remains of another sauropod diplodocid leinkupal laticauda as well as of several species of theropod that can be ascribed to basal tetanurans and possibly to abelisauroids and references category dicraeosaurids category
