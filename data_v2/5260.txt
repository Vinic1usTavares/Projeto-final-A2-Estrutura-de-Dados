circinus is a small faint constellation in southern sky first defined in 1756 by french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille its name is latin for compass referring to drafting tool used for drawing circles it should not be confused with pyxis a constellation that represents a mariner s compass which points north its brightest star is alpha circini with an apparent magnitude of 3 19 slightly variable it is brightest rapidly oscillating ap star in night sky ax circini is a cepheid variable visible with unaided eye and bx circini is a faint star thought to have been formed from merger of two white dwarfs two sun like stars have planetary systems hd 134060 has two small planets and hd 129445 has a jupiter like planet supernova sn 185 appeared in circinus in 185 ad and was recorded by chinese observers two novae have been observed more recently in 20th century milky way runs through constellation featuring prominent objects such as open cluster ngc 5823 and planetary nebula ngc 5315 circinus hosts a spiral galaxy circinus galaxy which was discovered in 1977 and is closest seyfert galaxy to milky way alpha circinids aci a meteor shower also discovered in 1977 radiate from this constellation history in 1756 french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille introduced constellation of circinus with french name le compas representing a pair of dividing compasses on a chart of southern sky on that chart lacaille portrayed constellations of norma circinus and triangulum australe respectively as a set square and ruler a compass and a surveyor s level in a set of draughtsman s instruments circinus was given its current name in 1763 when lacaille published an updated sky map with latin names for constellations he introduced characteristics bordered by centaurus musca apus triangulum australe norma and lupus circinus lies adjacent to alpha and beta centauri stars as it is at declination 50deg to 70deg whole constellation is only visible south of latitude 30deg n official constellation boundaries as set by eugene delporte in 1930 are defined by a polygon of 14 segments in equatorial coordinate system right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and and declination coordinates are between 55 and 70 62deg circinus culminates each year at 9 p m on 30 july recommended three letter abbreviation for constellation as adopted by international astronomical union in 1922 is cir features thumb left constellation circinus as it can be seen by naked eye stars circinus is a faint constellation with only one star brighter than fourth magnitude alpha circini a white main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 3 19 is 54 light years away and 4deg south of alpha centauri not only brightest star in constellation it is also brightest example of a rapidly oscillating ap star in night sky it has unusual spectral type a7 vp showing increased emissions of strontium chromium and europium stars of this type have oddly localised magnetic fields and are slightly variable alpha circini forms a binary star system with an orange dwarf companion of spectral type k5 and magnitude 8 5 which with a separation of 5 7 arcseconds is only discernible with a telescope distance between two stars is 260 au and they take 2600 years to rotate around a common centre of gravity second brightest star is beta circini a white main sequence star of spectral type and a magnitude of 4 07 about 100 light years away it has around 1 8 times diameter of sun gamma circini is a binary star 450 light years away whose components need a telescope of 150 mm to be seen as they are only 0 8 arcseconds apart brighter component is a bluish be star of spectral type and magnitude 4 51 while dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5 5 they orbit each other every 180 years delta circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5 1 and 13 4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3 9 days brighter component is a close eclipsing binary specifically a rotating ellipsoidal variable with a minor dip of magnitude 0 1 both are hot blue stars of spectral types v and o9 5v respectively and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times sun s mass over 3600 light years away this system would outshine venus at magnitude 4 8 if it were 32 light years 10 parsecs distant two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds resolvable to naked eye for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope eta circini is a yellow giant of spectral type and magnitude 5 17 located around 276 light years distant and zeta circini is a blue white main sequence star of spectral type and magnitude 6 09 located around 1273 light years away 493 variable stars have been recorded in circinus but most have a very small range or are quite dim three prominent examples are theta circini t circini and ax circini theta circini is a b class irregular variable ranging in magnitude from 5 0 to 5 4 t circini has a b type spectrum ranging in magnitude from 10 6 to 9 3 over a period of 3 298 days although it is actually an eclipsing binary system rather than a pulsating star ax is a cepheid variable that varies between magnitudes 5 6 and 6 19 over 5 3 days it is a yellow white supergiant of spectral type 1600 light years away bp circini is another cepheid variable with an apparent magnitude ranging from 7 37 to 7 71 over 2 4 days both are spectroscopic binaries with companions that are blue white stars of spectral type b6 and 5 and 4 7 solar masses respectively bx circini is a faint star that fluctuates between magnitudes 12 57 and 12 62 over a period of 2 hours 33 minutes over 99 of its composition appears to be helium its origin is unclear but thought to be result of merger of a helium and a carbon oxygen white dwarf several stars with planetary systems lie within borders of circinus although none of host stars are particularly prominent hd 134060 is a sun like yellow dwarf star of spectral type 0 4 and magnitude 6 29 around 79 light years away its two planets were discovered in 2011 through radial velocity method smaller hd 134060 b has a mass of 0 mj jupiter masses and orbits its star every 3 27 days at 0 au larger hd 134060 c 0 15 mj orbits farther out at 2 226 au with a period of approximately 1161 days even fainter at magnitude 8 8 hd 129445 is 220 light years away and has 99 of sun s mass and a similar spectral type of hd 129445 b a jupiter like planet 1 6 mj discovered in 2010 via radial velocity method orbits this star at a distance of 2 9 au approximately every 1840 days deep sky objects thumb an of ngc 5823 showing its backwards s shape three open clusters and a planetary nebula are found within borders of circinus all visible with amateur telescopes of varying sizes ngc 5823 also called caldwell 88 is an 800 million year old open cluster located 3500 light years away and spanning a 12 light year region along constellation s northern border despite having an integrated magnitude of 7 9 cluster can be seen by star hopping from beta circini or from alpha centauri it contains 80 100 stars of 10th magnitude and fainter which are spread out over a diameter of 10 arcseconds brighter stars however are not true members of cluster as they are closer to earth than dimmer ones ngc 5823 appears distinct to observer sometimes seen as a reversed s as described by john herschel although it has also been described as tulip shaped and boxy that cluster can be easily mistaken with a similar cluster ngc nearby in lupus comparatively open cluster ngc is fainter integrated magnitude of 9 8 its brightest star is only 11th magnitude and smaller 7 0 arcminutes comprising only 30 stars third open cluster pismis 20 contains 12 stars in a diameter of 4 5 arcseconds but exhibits a magnitude similar to ngc 5823 7 8 at light years it requires an amateur telescope with an aperture over 300 mm to be easily discerned left thumb hubble space telescope s view of ngc 5315 showing its intricate structure and central star planetary nebula ngc 5315 has a magnitude of 9 8 around a central star of magnitude 14 2 located 5 2 degrees west southwest of alpha circini it is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200 fold bernes 145 is a dark and reflection nebula first listed in 1971 bernes catalog dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope and it measures 12 by 5 arcminutes smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen circinus also houses eso 97 g13 commonly known as circinus galaxy discovered in 1977 it is a relatively unobscured galaxy magnitude 10 6 which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near milky way since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust this oblong spiral galaxy with 6 9 by 3 0 arcminutes and 26 000 light years in diameter is located 13 million light years away from earth and lies 4 degrees off galactic plane it is closest seyfert galaxy to milky way and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus thumb chandra x ray observatory s false color image of circinus x 1 showing its jets circinus x 1 is an x ray binary star system that includes a neutron star observations of circinus x 1 in july 2007 revealed presence of x ray jets normally found in black hole systems located at 19 000 light years pulsar psr 58 also called circinus pulsar has expelled a 20 light year long jet of material from its southern pole clearly visible in x ray spectrum another supernova remnant in circinus is that of sn 185 recorded by chinese observers in 185 ad sn 185 was visible in night sky for around eight months its remnants known as rcw 86 cover an area larger than typical full moon a white dwarf star in a close binary system can accumulate material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion known as a nova these stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes nova circini 1926 also known as x circini was observed at magnitude 6 5 on 3 september 1926 before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11 7 and 12 5 during 1928 and magnitude 13 in 1929 nova circini 1995 by circini reached a maximum apparent magnitude of 7 2 in january 1995 bw circini is a low mass x ray binary system comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow subgiant star x ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997 and possibly 1971 72 meteor showers circinus is radiant of an annual meteor shower alpha circinids aci first observed in queensland in 1977 meteors have an average velocity of 27 1 km s and are thought to be associated with a long period comet in 2011 peter jenniskens proposed that debris trail of comet c 1969 t1 could intersect with earth s orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to beta circini aci shower peaks on 4 june day it was first observed references external links deep photographic guide to constellations circinus category southern constellations
