cost saving measure coached by aforementioned mauricio pipo rodriguez to spain team s experience was an unhappy one in their first match on june 15 in elche they were defeated 10 1 by hungary a scoreline that stands as a world cup record to this day a silver lining was that luis ramirez zapata scored country s first world cup goal during game albeit at a point when salvadorans were already down 5 0 it was cold comfort however when zapata scored against hungary some salvadorans cried out to zapata not to celebrate goal effusively because it might make hungarians angry and encourage them to score more el salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games displaying much improved levels of organisation and commitment they lost 1 0 to belgium on june 19 in elche and 2 0 to then reigning world champions argentina in alicante on june 23 there were several reasons tournament went so badly for el salvador first of all el salvador took 20 players to world cup leaving behind gilberto quinteros and miguel gonzalez according to luis guevara mora goalkeeper of team by that time salvadoran football federation decided to take members of federation as well as friends and family of many members of federation and spent so much money they couldn t afford to bring a full 22 man squad some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their teammates but couldn t get enough further heightening controversy team took many detours and stops throughout europe under direction of federation taking 3 days to arrive in spain and were last team to do so once arrived there was more trouble adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by association they decided to play with white uniform and keep blue as a keepsake next someone stole balls that team would train with day prior to match against hungary hungarians had 25 balls organization had given them and trained with them while el salvador had none and was unable to train to make things even worse el salvador had never seen hungary play only knowledge that they had about team was a lone outdated video that they had bought on field there were more problems hungary s fourth goal was caused by francisco jovel s sudden deafness jovel had received a heavy blow on cheek and almost could not hear so when guevara mora cried off to stop a ball defender did not hear him mora attempted to pass to jovel but jovel wasn t looking and ball went past him and went straight in front of net hungarian player only had to tap it in after match salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with coaching staff and federation coach was dismissed immediately and following matches against belgium and argentina were managed by players jovel huezo and fagoaga although tournament overall was a big disappointment there were also several bright spots jorge magico gonzalez
