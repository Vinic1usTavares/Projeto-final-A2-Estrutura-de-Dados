battle of hongorai river took place during second world war and involved australian new zealand and japanese forces part of wider bougainville campaign of pacific theatre battle was fought in southern sector of bougainville island coming after battle of slater s knoll in which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 april and 22 may 1945 as elements of australian 15th brigade advanced south along buin road initial phase saw australians advance towards hongorai river following end of early fighting australian advance towards main japanese concentration at buin continued as they struck out towards hari and mivo rivers this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought advance to a halt short of objective washing away many bridges and roads upon which australians relied for supplies as australian advance stalled japanese began harassing australian line of communications and as rain stopped and flooding subsided in late july and into august australians began making preparations to resume advance towards buin again ultimately though war came to an end before final australian advance began bringing campaign to an end background strategic situation 220px thumb left map of bougainville alt a map depicting an island with numerous trails marked on it moving east and west and north and south japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early 1942 capturing it from small force of australians garrisoning island they had subsequently developed several airbases on island using it to conduct operations in northern solomon islands and to attack allied lines of communication between united states australia and southwest pacific area these bases also helped protect rabaul major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea and throughout 1943 allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising japanese base around rabaul us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina on western coast of island north of empress augusta bay in november 1943 after an initial counter attack us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina establishing a strong perimeter in march 1944 japanese launched a heavy counter attack which was turned back with heavy casualties after this situation on bougainville became largely static as japanese focused primarily on subsistence and us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining perimeter around torokina in late 1944 as part of plans to free us troops up for philippines campaign australian ii corps consisting of mainly militia troops under command of lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from american xiv corps australian forces began arriving on island between november and december 1944 initially establishing themselves around us base at torokina due to inaccurate intelligence savige mistakenly believed that japanese forces on island numbered just 17 500 men and he consequently decided that australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear japanese from bougainville in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere rather than maintaining defensive posture us forces had adopted however allied estimates of japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after war it was found that number of japanese on island at this time was closer to 40 000 campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives in north it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into narrow bonis peninsula and contained in centre seizure of pearl ridge would give australians control of east west avenues of approach as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks while also opening way for a drive to east coast and main campaign in south where bulk of japanese forces were concentrated around buin preliminary moves following capture of pearl ridge in december 1944 australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to drive towards buin in late march and early april 1945 they had fought battle of slater s knoll after which a brief lull followed as australians paused to shorten their supply lines meanwhile survivors of japanese force heavily demoralised by their defeat withdrew towards hongorai river australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south being tasked with capturing hari river while hongorai was also included as an intermediate objective japanese strength in southern sector was estimated by australians at about 10 500 men of which 2 300 were believed to be directly opposing 3rd division 15th brigade was considered to be most experienced of australian units on bougainville at time and was moved up to relieve 7th brigade which was in need of rest under command of brigadier heathcote hammer 15th brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from 2 4th armoured regiment engineers from 15th field company a battery of 155 mm guns from u heavy battery field artillery from 2nd field regiment and a number of smaller support units 58th 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility for slater s knoll replacing 25th infantry battalion while 24th infantry battalion took up a position across buin road brigade s third battalion 57th 60th infantry battalion did not join them until beginning of may and so 7th brigade s 9th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north of river in rumiki area until 57th 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them further inland 2 8th commando squadron advanced in a wide arc to south east defending brigade s left or eastern flank japanese forces opposing australians belonged to 6th division under command of lieutenant general tsutomu akinaga akinaga had been ordered to delay australian advance between hongorai and hari for as long as possible and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along australian s expected line of advance division s infantry had suffered heavily in previous battle around slater s knoll and as a consequence several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated front line positions were assigned to 6th field artillery regiment while 13th infantry regiment was to hold five strongpoints to their rear along and astride buin road designated a through to e 6th field and 4th field heavy artillery regiments both held strongpoints further back designated f and g 23rd infantry

road around creek with 58th 59th around north east of slater s knoll and 57th 60th when it arrived to relieve 9th would be positioned further east astride a secondary parallel track known to australians as commando road two days later hammer received order to commence advance towards hongorai from savige who offered him support of 29th brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter attack in a change to tactics that australians had previously employed prior to fighting around slater s knoll from early may they advanced on a two battalion front instead of one 24th infantry battalion was in van moving along buin road with 58th 59th protecting its flank and rear while further inland 57th 60th infantry battalion commencing on 3 may advanced along commando road from rumiki after taking over from 9th infantry battalion moving forward under a creeping barrage as they moved beyond 24th infantry battalion was first to contact japanese carrying out an attack against japanese positions around dawe s creek on 17 april supported by a troop of matilda tanks from 2 4th armoured regiment an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells two infantry companies c and d from 24th attacked position while another a company carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards and hatai left forward company d company reached its objective without trouble however c company on right along with troop of tanks came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down a company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along hatai track in support of a company matildas came forward and raked jungle hacking through undergrowth to reveal several japanese pillboxes which were destroyed by australian armour as night fell c company dug in before resuming attack next morning engineers were brought forward as was a bulldozer and gap was bridged amidst heavy fighting australians forced their way across creek by time that position had been taken in afternoon and infantry had advanced to line of exploitation beyond creek 37 japanese had been killed for loss of seven australians killed and 19 wounded after this australians continued their advance towards creek which was a further to southeast in response japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over course of following week although these were turned back during this time australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements one of which managed to slip through japanese defensive positions either side of buin road and carried out a reconnaissance of hongorai river about south of main crossing further patrols were carried out as well as a number of ambushes before advance was resumed on 26 april resuming their advance australians were supported by three squadrons of corsairs from royal new zealand air force nos 14 22 and 26 squadrons which bombed and strafed ground in front of advancing infantry as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire with such strong support japanese offered little resistance and over course of two days 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third of distance to hongorai for just one man wounded further progress was made over next week but on 4 may advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun mines and other improvised explosive devices after this 15th brigade s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy australian armour to extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also to negate effectiveness of australian tanks japanese began to position themselves off roads forcing infantry to fight without their armoured support additionally japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon advancing infantry which they kept under constant observation and fire left thumb a bulldozer clears a path through jungle so that

begun operating along parallel commando road to north here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling which resulted in them being ambushed they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat main force in reaching and crossing river arriving there on 6 may on 5 may along buin road 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again advancing with a tank troop in support they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 japanese after lead matilda s machine gun jammed field gun opened fire on it damaging it and wounding its crew moving around stricken tank second matilda armed with a howitzer opened fire and destroyed field gun before sweeping japanese defenders from position that night japanese artillery opened up on australian position with a heavy barrage and following morning put in a company sized counter attack fighting lasted for over two and a half hours but when it was over australians remained in possession of position having repulsed attack in doing so they suffered one killed and nine wounded while attacking japanese had suffered heavily losing 58 men killed it was biggest loss since action at slater s knoll and it spelt end of their attempt to defend hongorai after this australians were able to resume their advance to river on 7 may without further opposition previous three weeks in which they had advanced to hongorai had been costly for them however with australian 24th infantry battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded against this japanese had lost at least 169 killed crossing hongorai following advance to hongorai there was a pause of about a week as australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up before attempting to cross hongorai en masse this allowed savige to re evaluate situation and to issue new orders for advance towards hari and mivo rivers as they waited for advance to resume australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time as a part of these 24th infantry battalion sent a company across hongorai and subsequently located a strong japanese position on a feature that became known as egan s ridge which due to its location commanded main australian axis of advance thumb right soldiers from 57th 60th infantry

left 57th 60th infantry battalion would divert attention of japanese off 24th infantry battalion which would make main frontal assault from centre of australian line crossing at pororei ford advancing straight up buin road preliminary moves began before this and on 15 may a platoon from 24th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on egan s ridge after one of tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun they were forced to withdraw meanwhile rnzaf corsair squadrons now reinforced by no 16 squadron began an eight day aerial campaign attacking along length of buin and commando roads during this period new zealanders flew 381 sorties while artillery and mortars fired thousands of rounds two days later on 17 may 57th 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move on left flank crossing hongorai inland and advancing along commando road with 32 corsairs and two batteries of artillery in support crossing north of ford centre company carried out an attack along far bank of river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate crossing nevertheless shortly before noon they had secured crossing and began to fan out carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 may left thumb matilda tanks from 2 4th armoured regiment cross

after 20 minutes of strafing by new zealand corsairs had prepared ground advancing under a creeping barrage and with mortar and machine gun support 24th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve along with two troops of matilda tanks mostly forward companies reached their objectives but one of companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded attack was resumed following day and australians were able to advance to pororei ford however they were prevented from moving any further as japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to west where an australian patrol encountered 70 japanese and were forced to go to ground finally a company from 24th infantry battalion was able to move on to high ground on egan s ridge which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear feature on right flank 58th 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of west bank of hongorai by bulldozer beginning their move two days earlier a number of patrols had had contacts with japanese meanwhile using tractors to drag tanks through mud australian armour had crossed river also and by 16 00 on 20 may battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to east of river unbeknown to japanese following day battalion left line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective which it reached in early afternoon despite being held up while tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing and further delayed by stiff resistance later after one of battalion s patrols came under heavy fire tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which defenders quickly abandoned leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition by 22 may although there were still a number of japanese in area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications most of australian objectives had been secured and mopping up operations began last remaining defensive location before hongorai was egan s ridge where japanese were sheltering in tunnels a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated position and forced them to abandon ridge it was subsequently occupied by a company of australian infantry within a short period of time buin road was subsequently opened providing australians with means with which to bring up supplies for next stage of campaign being advance to hari mobiai and mivo rivers final phase of battle cost japanese 106 killed while australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded aftermath during course of fighting around hongorai australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded while japanese lost at least 275 men killed following battle australians continued their advance towards buin at southern end of island throughout remainder of month and into june 15th brigade advanced along buin road crossing hari on 10 june beyond river japanese resolved to hold food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply and they consequently occupied a series of deep entrenchments these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery and 15th brigade subsequently crossed mobiai river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson s 29th brigade in early july as 29th brigade advanced toward mivo river torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought advance to a halt height of river rose buin road was reduced in words of gavin long to a sea of mud and many of bridges upon which australian supply system was dependent were washed away this rendered large scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as situation worsened for a period of time australians even ceased patrolling operations across mivo meanwhile japanese continued to harass australians probing their positions and setting mines and traps targeting australian line of communications on 9 july 15th infantry battalion fought off a series of attacks around at junction of mivo river and buin road which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment australian patrols were resumed in late july and continued into august these attacks proved very costly particularly amongst australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding bridges and roads that had been destroyed in flooding thumb right a mortar crew from 15th infantry battalion around mivo river july 1945 alt soldiers in a gun pit with a mortar tube fighting in northern sector continued during this time also and although preparations in south for final advance towards buin continued into august combat operations on island ceased as war came to an end before these were completed as a result final australian operations on bougainville took place on ratsua front in northern sector where australians had been conducting a holding action since failed landing at porton plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into bonis peninsula by mid august however following dropping of two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki and japan s subsequent unconditional surrender a cease fire was ordered on island and although there were minor clashes following this it spelt an end to major combat operations following end of war australian army awarded three battle honours for fighting around hongorai river 2 4th armoured regiment and 9th 24th 57th 60th and 58th 59th infantry battalions received battle honour hongorai river a second battle honour egan s ridge hongorai ford was also awarded to 2 4th armoured regiment and 24th and 58th 59th infantry battalions for second stage of fighting while 57th 60th infantry battalion received separate
