macedonia also called macedon was an ancient kingdom on periphery of archaic and classical greece and later dominant state of hellenistic greece kingdom was founded and initially ruled by royal argead dynasty which was followed by antipatrid and antigonid dynasties home to ancient macedonians earliest kingdom was centered on northeastern part of greek peninsula and bordered by epirus to west paeonia to north thrace to east and thessaly to south before 4th century bc macedonia was a small kingdom outside of area dominated by great city states of athens sparta and thebes and briefly subordinate to achaemenid persia during reign of argead king philipii 359 336 bc macedonia subdued mainland greece and thrace through conquest and diplomacy with a reformed army containing wielding sarissa pike philipii defeated old powers of athens and thebes in battle of chaeronea in 338bc philipii s son alexander great leading a federation of greek states accomplished his father s objective of commanding whole of greece when he destroyed thebes after city revolted during alexander s subsequent campaign of conquest he overthrew achaemenid empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as indus river for a brief period his empire was most powerful in definitive hellenistic state inaugurating transition to a new period of ancient greek civilization greek arts and literature flourished in new conquered lands and advances in philosophy engineering and science spread throughout much of ancient world of particular importance were contributions of aristotle tutor to alexander whose writings became a keystone of western philosophy after alexander s death in 323bc ensuing wars of diadochi and partitioning of alexander s short lived empire macedonia remained a greek cultural and political center in mediterranean region along with ptolemaic egypt seleucid empire and kingdom of pergamon important cities such as pella pydna and amphipolis were involved in power struggles for control of territory new cities were founded such as thessalonica by usurper cassander named after his wife thessalonike of macedon macedonia s decline began with macedonian wars and rise of rome as leading mediterranean power at end of third macedonian war in 168bc macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by roman client states a short lived revival of monarchy during fourth macedonian war in 150 148bc ended with establishment of roman province of macedonia macedonian kings who wielded absolute power and commanded state resources such as gold and silver facilitated mining operations to mint currency finance their armies and by reign of philipii a macedonian navy unlike other diadochi successor states imperial cult fostered by alexander was never adopted in macedonia yet macedonian rulers nevertheless assumed roles as high priests of kingdom and leading patrons of domestic and international cults of hellenistic religion authority of macedonian kings was theoretically limited by institution of army while a few municipalities within macedonian commonwealth enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and even had democratic governments with popular assemblies etymology name macedonia comes from ethnonym makedones makedones which itself is derived from ancient greek adjective makednos makednos meaning tall possibly descriptive of people liddell and scott 1940 it has same root as adjective makros makros meaning long or tall in ancient greek name is believed to have originally meant either highlanders tall ones or high grown men eugene n borza writes that highlanders or makedones of mountainous regions of western macedonia are derived from northwest greek stock they were akin to those who at an earlier time may have migrated south to become historical dorians linguist robert s p claims that both terms are of pre greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of indo european morphology however de decker argues arguments are insufficient history early history and legend thumb upright 1 2 entrance to one of royal tombs at vergina a unesco world heritage site classical greek historians herodotus and thucydides reported legend that macedonian kings of argead dynasty were descendants of temenus king of argos and could therefore claim mythical heracles as one of their ancestors as well as a direct lineage from zeus chief god of greek pantheon contradictory legends state that either perdiccas i of macedon or caranus of macedon were founders of argead dynasty with either five or eight kings before amyntasi assertion that descended from temenus was accepted by hellanodikai authorities of ancient olympic games permitting alexander i of macedon to enter competitions owing to his perceived greek heritage little is known about kingdom before reign of alexanderi s father amyntas i of macedon during archaic period kingdom of macedonia was situated along haliacmon and rivers in lower macedonia north of mount olympus historian robert malcolm errington suggests that one of earliest argead kings established aigai modern vergina as their capital in mid 7th centurybc before 4th centurybc kingdom covered a region corresponding roughly to western and central parts of region of macedonia in modern greece it gradually expanded into region of upper macedonia inhabited by greek and tribes and into regions of and which were inhabited by various peoples such as thracians and phrygians see also for macedonian expulsion of original inhabitants such as phrygians macedonia s non greek neighbors included thracians inhabiting territories to northeast illyrians to northwest and paeonians to north while lands of thessaly to south and epirus to west were inhabited by greeks with similar cultures to that of macedonians thumb

persia launched an invasion into europe against scythians paeonians thracians and several greek city states of balkans persian general used diplomacy to convince amyntasi to submit as a vassal of achaemenid empire ushering in period of achaemenid macedonia errington is skeptical that at this point amyntas i of macedon offered any submission as a vassal at all at most a token one he also mentions how macedonian king pursued his own course of action such as inviting exiled athenian tyrant hippias to take refuge at in achaemenid persian hegemony over macedonia was briefly interrupted by ionian revolt 499 yet persian general mardonius brought it back under achaemenid suzerainty although macedonia enjoyed a large degree of autonomy and was never made a satrapy i e province of achaemenid empire it was expected to provide troops for achaemenid army alexanderi provided macedonian military support to xerxes i during second persian invasion of greece in 480 479 bc and macedonian soldiers fought on side of persians at battle of following greek victory at salamis in 480bc alexanderi was employed as an achaemenid diplomat to propose a peace treaty and alliance with athens an offer that was rejected soon afterwards achaemenid forces were forced to withdraw from mainland europe marking end of persian control over macedonia see also for further details involvement

achaemenid empire purple although initially a persian vassal alexanderi of macedon fostered friendly diplomatic relations with his former greek enemies athenian and spartan led coalition of greek city states his successor perdiccasii led macedonians to war in four separate conflicts against athens leader of delian league while incursions by thracian ruler sitalces of odrysian kingdom threatened macedonia s territorial integrity in northeast athenian statesman pericles promoted colonization of strymon river near kingdom of macedonia where colonial city of amphipolis was founded in 437 so that it could provide athens with a steady supply of silver and gold as well as timber and pitch to support athenian navy see also for further details initially perdiccas ii did not take any action and might have even welcomed athenians as thracians were foes to both of them this changed due to an athenian alliance with a brother and cousin of perdiccasii who had rebelled against him thus two separate wars were fought against athens between 433 and 431bc macedonian king retaliated by promoting rebellion of athens allies in chalcidice and subsequently won over strategic city of potidaea see also for further details after capturing macedonian cities therma and beroea athens besieged potidaea but failed to overcome it therma was returned to macedonia and much of chalcidice to athens in a peace treaty brokered by sitalces who provided athens with military aid in exchange for acquiring new thracian allies perdiccasii sided with sparta in peloponnesian war 431 404 bc between athens and sparta and in 429 bc athens retaliated by persuading sitalces to invade macedonia but he was forced to retreat owing to a shortage of provisions in winter in 424 bc arrhabaeus a local ruler of lynkestis in upper macedonia rebelled against his overlord perdiccas and spartans agreed to help in putting down revolt at battle of macedonians panicked and fled before fighting began enraging spartan general brasidas whose soldiers looted unattended macedonian baggage train perdiccas then changed sides and supported athens and he was able to put down arrhabaeus s revolt thumb left 300px a

following battle of mantinea victorious spartans formed an alliance with argos a military pact perdiccasii was keen to join given threat of spartan allies remaining in chalcidice see also for further details when argos suddenly switched sides as a pro athenian democracy athenian navy was able to form a blockade against macedonian seaports and invade chalcidice in see also for further details perdiccasii sued for peace in forming an alliance with athens that was continued by his son and successor archelausi athens then provided naval support to archelausi in macedonian siege of pydna in exchange for timber and naval equipment although archelaus i was faced with some internal revolts and had to fend off an invasion of illyrians led by of lynkestis he was able to project macedonian power into thessaly where he sent military aid to his allies although he retained aigai as a ceremonial and religious center archelausi moved capital of kingdom north to pella which was then positioned by a lake with a river connecting it to aegean sea he improved macedonia s currency by minting coins with a higher silver content as well as issuing separate copper coinage his royal court attracted presence of well known intellectuals such as athenian playwright euripides when archelausi was assassinated perhaps following a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court kingdom was plunged into chaos in an era lasting from 399 to 393bc that included reign of four different monarchs orestes son of archelausi aeropusii uncle regent and murderer of orestes pausanias son of aeropusii and who was married to youngest daughter of archelausi very little is known about this turbulent period it came to an end when amyntasiii son of arrhidaeus and grandson of amyntasi killed pausanias and claimed macedonian throne thumb 300px a silver stater of amyntas iii of macedon amyntas iii was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383bc based on conflicting accounts owing to a massive invasion by illyrian dardani led by bardylis see also for further details greek historian diodorus siculus provided a seemingly conflicting account about illyrian invasions occurring in 393bc and 383bc which may have been representative of a single invasion led by bardylis of dardani pretender to throne argaeus ruled in his absence yet amyntasiii eventually returned to his kingdom with aid of thessalian allies see also for further details amyntasiii was also nearly overthrown by forces of chalcidian city of olynthos but with aid of brother of spartan king ii macedonians forced olynthos to surrender and dissolve their chalcidian league in alexander ii son of and amyntasiii succeeded his father and immediately invaded thessaly to wage war against tagus supreme thessalian military leader alexander of pherae capturing city of larissa thessalians desiring to remove both alexanderii and alexander of pherae as their overlords appealed to of thebes for aid he succeeded in recapturing larissa and in peace agreement arranged with macedonia received aristocratic hostages including alexanderii s brother and future king philipii when alexander was assassinated by his brother in law ptolemy of latter acted as an overbearing regent for perdiccasiii younger brother of alexanderii who eventually had ptolemy executed when reaching age of majority in remainder of perdiccas iii s reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery however an athenian invasion led by timotheus son of conon managed to capture methone and pydna and an illyrian invasion led by bardylis succeeded in killing perdiccasiii and 4 000 macedonian troops in battle rise of macedon thumb 400px map of kingdom of macedon at death of philipii in 336bc light blue with original territory that existed in 431bc red outline and dependent states yellow philip ii was twenty four years old when he acceded to throne in 359bc through use of deft diplomacy he was able to convince thracians under to cease their support of pausanias a pretender to throne and athenians to halt their support of another pretender he achieved these by bribing thracians and their paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with athens that relinquished his claims to amphipolis he was also able to make peace with illyrians who had threatened his borders philip ii spent his initial years radically transforming macedonian army a reform of its organization equipment and training including introduction of macedonian phalanx armed with long pikes i e sarissa proved immediately successful when tested against his illyrian and paeonian enemies confusing accounts in ancient sources have led modern scholars to debate how much philipii s royal predecessors may have contributed to these reforms and extent to which his ideas were influenced by his adolescent years of captivity in thebes as a political hostage during theban hegemony especially after meeting with general epaminondas macedonians like other greeks traditionally practiced monogamy but philipii practiced polygamy and married seven wives with perhaps only one that did not involve loyalty of his aristocratic subjects or new allies muller is skeptical about claims of plutarch and athenaeus that philipii of macedon married cleopatra eurydice of macedon a younger woman purely out of love or due to his own midlife crisis cleopatra was daughter of general attalus who along with his father in law parmenion were given command posts in asia minor modern turkey soon after this wedding muller also suspects that this marriage was one of political convenience meant to ensure loyalty of an influential macedonian noble house his first marriages were to phila of of upper macedonian aristocracy as well as illyrian princess to ensure a marriage alliance to establish an alliance with larissa in thessaly he married thessalian noblewoman in who bore him a son who would later rule as philip iii arrhidaeus in 357bc he married olympias to secure an alliance with arybbas king of epirus and molossians this marriage would bear a son who would later rule as alexanderiii better known as alexander great and claim descent from legendary achilles by way of his dynastic heritage from epirus it is unclear whether or not achaemenid persian kings influenced philipii s practice of polygamy although his predecessor amyntasiii had three sons with a possible second wife archelaus arrhidaeus and menelaus philipii had archelaus put to death in 359bc while philipii s other two half brothers fled to olynthos serving as a casus belli for war 349 348bc against chalcidian league while athens was preoccupied with social war 357 355 bc philipii retook amphipolis from them in 357bc and following year recaptured pydna and potidaea latter of which he handed over to chalcidian league as promised in a treaty in 356bc he took refounding it as philippi while his general parmenion defeated illyrian king of during 355 354bc siege of methone philipii lost his right eye to an arrow wound but managed to capture city and treated inhabitants cordially unlike who had been enslaved contrarily provides date of this siege as 354 353 bc philip ii then involved macedonia in third sacred war 356 346bc it began when phocis captured and plundered temple of apollo at delphi instead of submitting unpaid fines causing amphictyonic league to declare war on phocis and a civil war among members of thessalian league aligned with either phocis or thebes philipii s initial campaign against pherae in thessaly in 353bc at behest of larissa ended in two disastrous defeats by phocian general onomarchus conversely buckler provides date of this initial campaign as 354bc while affirming that second thessalian campaign ending in battle of crocus field occurred in 353bc philipii in turn defeated onomarchus in at battle of crocus field which led to philipii s election as leader archon of thessalian league provided him a seat on amphictyonic council and allowed for a marriage alliance with pherae by wedding niece of tyrant jason of pherae philip ii had some early involvement with achaemenid empire especially by supporting satraps and mercenaries would rebelled against central authority of achaemenid king satrap of hellespontine phrygia artabazos ii who was in rebellion against artaxerxes iii was able to take refuge as an exile at macedonian court from 352 to 342 bc he was accompanied in exile by his family and by his mercenary general memnon of rhodes daughter of artabazos and future wife of alexander great grew up at macedonian court after campaigning against thracian ruler in philipii began his war against chalcidian league which had been reestablished in following a temporary disbandment despite an athenian intervention by olynthos was captured by philipii in 348bc and its inhabitants were sold into slavery including some athenian citizens athenians especially in a series of speeches by demosthenes known as were unsuccessful in persuading their allies to counterattack and in 346bc concluded a treaty with macedonia known as peace of treaty stipulated that athens would relinquish claims to macedonian coastal territories chalcidice and amphipolis in return for release of enslaved athenians as well as guarantees that philipii would not attack athenian settlements in thracian chersonese meanwhile phocis and thermopylae were captured by macedonian forces delphic temple robbers were executed and philipii was awarded two phocian seats on amphictyonic council and position of master of ceremonies over pythian games athens initially opposed his membership on council and refused to attend games in protest but they eventually accepted these conditions perhaps after some persuasion by demosthenes in his oration on peace over next few years philip ii reformed local governments in thessaly campaigned against illyrian ruler i deposed arybbas in epirus in favor of his brother in law alexanderi through philipii s marriage to olympias and defeated in thrace this allowed him to extend macedonian control over hellespont in anticipation of an invasion into achaemenid anatolia in philipii conquered a thracian city in what is now bulgaria and renamed it philippopolis modern plovdiv war broke out with athens in 340bc while philipii was engaged in two ultimately unsuccessful sieges of perinthus and byzantion followed by a successful campaign against scythians along danube and macedonia s involvement in fourth sacred war against amphissa in thebes ejected a macedonian garrison from nicaea near thermopylae leading thebes to join athens megara corinth achaea and euboea in a final confrontation against macedonia at battle of chaeronea in 338bc after macedonian victory at chaeronea philipii installed an oligarchy in thebes yet was lenient toward athens wishing to utilize their navy in a planned invasion of achaemenid empire he was then chiefly responsible for formation of league of corinth that included major greek city states except sparta despite kingdom of macedonia s official exclusion from league in 337bc philipii was elected as leader hegemon of its council and commander in chief strategos autokrator of a forthcoming campaign to invade achaemenid empire see also for further details philip s plan to punish persians for suffering of greeks and to liberate greek cities of asia minor as well as perhaps panhellenic fear of another persian invasion of greece contributed to his decision to invade achaemenid empire persians offered aid to perinthus and byzantion in 341 340bc highlighting macedonia s strategic need to secure thrace and aegean sea against increasing achaemenid encroachment as persian king artaxerxes iii further consolidated his control over satrapies in western anatolia latter region yielding far more wealth and valuable resources than balkans was also coveted by macedonian king for its sheer economic potential when philip ii married cleopatra eurydice niece of general attalus talk of providing new potential heirs at wedding feast infuriated philipii s son alexander a veteran of battle of chaeronea and his mother olympias they fled together to epirus before alexander was recalled to pella by philipii when philipii arranged a marriage between his son arrhidaeus and ada of caria daughter of persian satrap of caria alexander intervened and proposed to marry ada instead philipii then cancelled wedding altogether and exiled alexander s advisors ptolemy nearchus and see also for further details to reconcile with olympias philipii had their

first acts was burial of his father at aigai members of league of corinth revolted at news of philipii s death but were soon quelled by military force alongside persuasive diplomacy electing alexander as hegemon of league to carry out planned invasion of achaemenid persia see also for further details in 335 bc alexander fought against thracian tribe of at haemus mons and along danube forcing their surrender on island shortly thereafter illyrian king cleitus of dardani threatened to attack macedonia but alexander took initiative and besieged dardani at pelion in modern albania when thebes had once again revolted from league of corinth and was besieging macedonian garrison in alexander left illyrian front and marched to thebes which he placed under siege see also and for further details after breaching walls alexander s forces killed 6 000 took 30 000 inhabitants as prisoners of war and burned city to ground as a warning that convinced all other greek states except sparta not to challenge alexander again see also for further details throughout his military career alexander won every battle that he personally commanded his first victory against persians in asia minor at battle of in 334bc used a small cavalry contingent as a distraction to allow his infantry to cross river followed by a cavalry charge from his companion cavalry alexander led cavalry charge at battle of issus in forcing persian king darius iii and his army to flee dariusiii despite having superior numbers was again forced to flee battle of gaugamela in 331bc persian king was later captured and executed by his own satrap of bactria and kinsman bessus in 330bc macedonian king subsequently hunted down and executed bessus in what is now afghanistan securing region of sogdia in process at battle of modern day punjab when war elephants of king porus of threatened alexander s troops he had them form open ranks to surround elephants and dislodge their handlers by using their sarissa pikes when

and son of zeus following his visit to oracle at in libyan desert in modern day egypt in 331bc his attempt in to have his men prostrate before him in in an act of borrowed from persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his macedonian and greek subjects after his court historian callisthenes refused to perform this ritual when alexander had parmenion murdered at ecbatana near modern hamadan iran in 330bc this was symptomatic of growing gulf between king s interests and those of his country and people according to errington his murder of cleitus black in is described as vengeful and reckless by dawn l gilley and ian worthington continuing polygamous habits of his father alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in asia leading by example when he wed roxana a sogdian princess of bactria he then married ii eldest daughter of dariusiii and ii youngest daughter of artaxerxes iii at susa weddings in 324bc meanwhile in greece spartan king agis iii attempted to lead a rebellion of greeks against macedonia he was defeated in 331bc at battle of megalopolis by antipater who was serving as regent of macedonia and deputy hegemon of league of corinth in alexander s stead gilley and worthington discuss ambiguity surrounding exact title of antipater aside from deputy hegemon of league of corinth with some sources calling him a regent others a governor others a simple general n g l hammond and f w walbank state that alexander great left macedonia under command of antipater in case there was a rising in greece before antipater embarked on his campaign in peloponnese memnon governor of thrace was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy antipater deferred punishment of sparta to league of corinth headed by alexander who ultimately pardoned spartans on condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages antipater s hegemony was somewhat unpopular in greece due to his practice perhaps by order of alexander of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with macedonian troops yet in 330bc alexander declared that tyrannies installed in greece were to be abolished and greek freedom was to be restored thumb 400px kingdoms of diadochi c 301bc

a power struggle between diadochi former generals of alexander s army see also for further details a council of army convened in babylon immediately after alexander s death naming philipiii as king and perdiccas as his regent antipater antigonus monophthalmus craterus and ptolemy formed a coalition against perdiccas in a civil war initiated by ptolemy s seizure of hearse of alexander great

to antigonus in 315bc for him to surrender various territories in asia antigonus promptly allied with polyperchon now based in corinth and issued an ultimatum of his own to cassander charging him with murder for executing olympias and demanding that he hand over royal family king alexanderiv and queen mother roxana conflict that followed lasted until winter of 312 when a new peace settlement recognized cassander as general of europe antigonus as first in asia ptolemy as general of egypt and lysimachus as general of thrace cassander had alexanderiv and roxana put to death in winter of 311

aid from pyrrhus of epirus who had fought alongside demetrius at battle of ipsus but was sent to egypt as a hostage as part of an agreement between demetrius and ptolemyi in exchange for defeating forces of antipaterii and forcing him to flee to court of lysimachus in thrace pyrrhus was awarded westernmost portions of macedonian kingdom demetrius had his nephew alexanderv assassinated and was then proclaimed king of macedonia but his subjects protested against his aloof eastern style autocracy war broke out between pyrrhus and demetrius in when wife of pyrrhus daughter of agathocles of syracuse left him for demetrius and offered him her dowry of corcyra war dragged on until when demetrius lost support of macedonians and fled country macedonia was then divided between pyrrhus and

war followed by his invasion of sicily ptolemy keraunos secured his position on macedonian throne by giving pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor pyrrhus returned to epirus in after ultimate failure of both campaigns which contributed to rise of rome because greek cities in southern italy such as tarentum now became roman allies pyrrhus invaded macedonia in

and require few resources roman desire for revenge and private hopes of famous victories were probably decisive reasons for outbreak of war roman senate demanded that philipv cease hostilities against neighboring greek powers and defer to an international arbitration committee for settling grievances when comitia centuriata finally voted in approval of roman senate s declaration of war in 200bc and handed their ultimatum to philipv demanding that a tribunal assess damages owed to rhodes and pergamon macedonian king rejected it this marked beginning of second macedonian war 200 197bc with publius

his men to take refuge in thessaly when achaean league switched their loyalties from macedonia to rome macedonian king sued for peace but terms offered were considered too stringent and so war continued in june 197bc macedonians were defeated at battle of cynoscephalae rome then ratified a treaty that forced macedonia to relinquish control of much of its greek possessions outside of macedonia proper if only to act as a buffer against illyrian and thracian incursions into greece although some greeks suspected roman intentions of supplanting macedonia as new hegemonic power in

member of amphictyonic council eumenes ii came to rome in 172 bc and delivered a speech to senate denouncing alleged crimes and transgressions of perseus this convinced roman senate to declare third macedonian war 171 168bc see also who says that rome as sole remaining superpower would not accept macedonia as a peer competitor or equal klaus bringmann asserts that negotiations with macedonia were completely ignored due to rome s political calculation that macedonian kingdom had to be destroyed to ensure elimination of supposed source of all difficulties which rome was having in greek world although perseus s forces were victorious against romans at battle of callinicus in 171bc macedonian army was defeated at battle of pydna in june 168bc perseus fled to samothrace but surrendered

burial of philip ii of macedon discovered in tomb of vergina formerly ancient aigai at head of macedonia s government was king basileus written evidence about macedonian governmental institutions made before philip ii of macedon s reign is both rare and non macedonian in origin main sources of early macedonian historiography are works of herodotus thucydides diodorus siculus and justin contemporary accounts given by those such as demosthenes were often hostile and unreliable even aristotle who lived in macedonia provides us with terse accounts of its governing institutions polybius was a contemporary historian who wrote about macedonia later historians include livy quintus curtius rufus plutarch and arrian works of these historians affirm macedonia s hereditary monarchy and basic institutions yet it remains unclear if there was an established constitution for macedonian government see however n g l hammond and f w walbank write with apparent certainty and conviction when describing macedonian constitutional government restricting king and involving a popular assembly of army see main textual primary sources for organization of macedonia s military as it existed under alexander great include arrian curtis diodorus and plutarch modern historians rely mostly on polybius and livy for understanding detailed aspects of antigonid period military on this writes to this we can add evidence provided by two magnificent archaeological monuments alexander sarcophagus in particular and alexander mosaic in case of antigonid army valuable additional details are occasionally supplied by diodorus and plutarch and by a series of inscriptions preserving sections of two sets of army regulations issued by philip v from at least reign of philipii king was assisted by royal pages paides bodyguards somatophylakes companions hetairoi friends philoi an assembly that included members of military and during hellenistic period magistrates see also for further details evidence is lacking regarding extent to which each of these groups shared authority with king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework for an argument about absolutism of macedonian monarchy see however n g l hammond and f w walbank write with apparent certainty and conviction when describing macedonian constitutional government restricting king and involving a popular assembly of army before reign of philipii only institution supported by textual evidence is monarchy in 1931 friedrich granier was first to propose that by time of philip ii s reign macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups especially to its citizen soldiers although majority of evidence for army s alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from reign of alexander iii of macedon see and pietro de was first to refute granier s ideas and advance theory that macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by whim of monarch although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia see as well as and for further details kingship and royal court earliest known government of ancient macedonia was that of its monarchy lasting until when it was abolished by romans macedonian hereditary monarchy existed since at least time of archaic greece with homeric aristocratic roots in mycenaean greece thucydides wrote that in previous ages macedonia was divided into small tribal regions each having its own petty king tribes of lower macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over lesser kings of upper macedonia direct line of father to son succession was broken after assassination of orestes of macedon in allegedly by his regent and successor ii of macedon clouding issue of whether primogeniture was established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of army or of people to choose another king it is unclear if male offspring of macedonian queens or consorts were always preferred over others given accession of archelaus i of macedon son of perdiccas ii of macedon and a slave woman although archelaus succeeded throne after murdering his father s designated heir apparent thumb left 400px hades abducting persephone fresco in small macedonian royal tomb at vergina macedonia greece c 340bc it is known that macedonian kings before philipii upheld privileges and carried out responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats determining kingdom s foreign policies and negotiating alliances with foreign powers after greek victory at salamis in 480bc persian commander mardonius had alexander i of macedon sent to athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between achaemenid empire and athens decision to send alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble persian house and his previous formal relationship with city state of athens with their ownership of natural resources including gold silver timber and royal land early macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts little is known about judicial system of ancient macedonia except that king acted as chief judge of kingdom macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of military early evidence for this includes not only alexander i s role as a commander in greco persian wars but also city state of potidaea s acceptance of perdiccas ii of macedon as their commander in chief during their rebellion against delian league of athens in 432 bc philipii was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as high priest of nation he performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals alexander imitated various aspects of his father s reign such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers but lost some core support among them for adopting some of trappings of an eastern persian monarch a lord and master as carol j king suggests instead of a comrade in arms as was traditional relationship of macedonian kings with their companions for further context see alexander s father philipii was perhaps influenced by persian traditions when he adopted institutions similar to those found in achaemenid realm such as having a royal secretary royal archive royal pages and a seated throne royal pages royal pages were adolescent boys and young men conscripted from aristocratic households and serving kings of macedonia perhaps from reign of philipii onward although more solid evidence dates to reign of alexander great according to carol j king there was no certain reference to this institutional group until military campaigns of alexander great in asia however n g l hammond and f w walbank state that royal pages are attested to as far back as reign of archelaus i of macedon royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life after a period of training and service pages were expected to become members of king s companions and personal retinue during their training pages were expected to guard king as he slept supply him with horses aid him in mounting his horse accompany him on royal hunts and serve him during symposia i e formal drinking parties although there is little evidence for royal pages in antigonid period it is known that some of them fled with perseus of macedon to samothrace following his defeat by romans in 168bc bodyguards royal bodyguards served as closest members to king at court and on battlefield they were split into two categories agema of hypaspistai a type of ancient special forces usually numbering in hundreds and a smaller group of men handpicked by king either for their individual merits or to honor noble families to which they belonged therefore bodyguards limited in number and forming king s inner circle were not always responsible for protecting king s life on and off battlefield their title and office was more a mark of distinction perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses companions friends councils and assemblies companions including elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry represented a substantially larger group than king s bodyguards ranks of companions were greatly increased during reign of philip ii when he expanded this institution to include upper macedonian aristocrats as well as greeks see most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to king a small amount of evidence suggests existence of an assembly of army during times of war and a people s assembly during times of peace first recorded instance dates to 359 bc when philip ii called together assemblies to address them with a speech and raise their morale following death of perdiccas iii of macedon in battle against illyrians members of council had right to speak freely and although there is no direct evidence that they voted on affairs of state it is clear that king was at least occasionally pressured to agree to their demands assembly was apparently given right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them such as when alexander great acted as prosecutor in trial and conviction of three alleged conspirators in his father s assassination plot while many others were acquitted however there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld or constitutionally grounded or that their decisions were always heeded by king at death of alexander great companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire but it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends for instance when perdiccas had philip ii s daughter murdered to prevent her own daughter eurydice ii of macedon from marrying philip iii of macedon army revolted and ensured that marriage took place see and for details magistrates commonwealth local government and allied states antigonid macedonian kings relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state this included high ranking municipal officials such as military strategos and i e elected governor archon of a large city polis as well as politico religious office of epistates although these were highly influential members of local and regional government carol j king asserts that they were not collectively powerful enough to formally challenge authority of macedonian king or his right to rule no evidence exists about personal backgrounds of these officials although they may have been chosen among same group of aristocratic philoi and hetairoi who filled vacancies for army officers in ancient athens athenian democracy was restored on three separate occasions following initial conquest of city by antipater in 322bc when it fell repeatedly under macedonian rule it was governed by a macedonian imposed oligarchy composed of wealthiest members of city state under antipater s oligarchy lower value in terms of property for acceptable members of oligarchy was 2 000 drachma athenian democracy was restored briefly after antipater s death in 319 bc yet his son cassander reconquered city which came under regency of demetrius of demetrius lowered property limit for oligarchic members to 1 000 drachma yet by 307 bc he was exiled from city and direct democracy was restored demetrius i of macedon reconquered athens in 295 bc yet democracy was once again restored in 287 bc with aid of ptolemy i of egypt antigonus ii gonatas son of demetrius i reconquered athens in 260 bc followed by a succession of macedonian kings ruling over athens until roman republic conquered both macedonia and then mainland greece by 146 bc other city states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy after philipii conquered amphipolis in 357bc city was allowed to retain its democracy including its constitution popular assembly city council boule and yearly elections for new officials but a macedonian garrison was housed within city walls along with a macedonian royal commissioner epistates to monitor city s political affairs philippi city founded by philipii was only other city in macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies since assembly ecclesia of thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues macedonian king and central government administered revenues generated by temples and priesthoods within macedonian commonwealth some evidence from 3rd centurybc indicates that foreign relations were handled by central government although individual macedonian cities nominally participated in panhellenic events as independent entities in reality granting of inviolability diplomatic immunity and right of asylum at sanctuaries to certain cities was handled directly by king likewise city states within contemporary greek i e federations of city states obeyed federal decrees voted on collectively by members of their league unlike sparse macedonian examples ample textual evidence of this exists for achaean league league and achaean league see in city states belonging to a league or commonwealth granting of proxenia i e hosting of foreign ambassadors was usually a right shared by local and central authorities abundant evidence exists for granting of proxenia as being sole prerogative of central authorities in neighboring epirote league and some evidence suggests same arrangement in macedonian commonwealth city states that were allied with macedonia issued their own decrees regarding proxenia foreign leagues also formed alliances with macedonian kings such as when cretan league signed treaties with demetrius ii aetolicus and antigonus iii doson ensuring enlistment of cretan mercenaries into macedonian army and elected philip v of macedon as honorary protector of league military early macedonian army basic structure of ancient macedonian army was division between companion cavalry hetairoi and foot companions pezhetairoi augmented by various allied troops foreign levied soldiers and mercenaries foot companions existed perhaps since reign of alexander i of macedon macedonian cavalry wearing muscled cuirasses became renowned in greece during and after their involvement in peloponnesian war at times siding with either athens or sparta see also for further details macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers while cavalry was composed of noblemen as evidenced by early 4th century bc artwork there was a pronounced spartan influence on macedonian army before philipii nicholas viktor sekunda states that at beginning of philipii s reign in 359bc macedonian army consisted of 10 000 infantry and 600 cavalry yet malcolm errington cautions that these figures cited by ancient authors should be treated with some skepticism philip ii and alexander great after spending years as a political hostage in thebes philipii sought to imitate greek example of martial exercises and issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery and succeeded in transforming macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well trained professional army philipii adopted some of military tactics of his enemies such as flying wedge cavalry formation of scythians his infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced earlier style shield were equipped with protective helmets greaves and either cuirass breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands and armed with sarissa pikes and a dagger as a secondary weapon according to sekunda philip ii s infantry were eventually equipped with heavier armor such as cuirasses since third philippic of demosthenes in 341 bc described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts see also for further details however errington argues that breastplates were not worn by phalanx pikemen of either philip ii or philip v s reigns during which sufficient evidence exists instead he claims that breastplates were worn only by military officers while pikemen wore kotthybos stomach bands along with their helmets and greaves wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields see elite hypaspistai infantry composed of handpicked men from ranks of pezhetairoi were formed during reign of philipii and saw continued use during reign of alexander great philipii was also responsible for establishment of royal bodyguards somatophylakes for his lighter missile troops philip ii employed mercenary cretan archers as well as thracian paeonian and illyrian javelin throwers slingers and archers he hired engineers such as of thessaly and of pella who were capable of building state of art siege engines and artillery that fired large bolts following acquisition of lucrative mines at renamed philippi royal treasury could afford to field a permanent professional standing army increase in state revenues under philipii allowed macedonians to build a small navy for first time which included triremes only macedonian cavalry units attested under alexander were companion cavalry yet he formed a i e unit of a few hundred horsemen of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic persians while campaigning in asia when marching his forces into asia alexander brought 1 800 cavalrymen from macedonia 1 800 cavalrymen from thessaly 600 cavalrymen from rest of greece and 900 cavalry from thrace antipater was able to quickly raise a force of 600 native macedonian cavalry to fight in lamian war when it began in 323bc most elite members of alexander s hypaspistai were designated as agema and a new term for hypaspistai emerged after battle of gaugamela in 331bc argyraspides silver shields latter continued to serve after reign of alexander great and may have been of asian origin in regards to both argyraspides and chalkaspides these titles were probably not functional perhaps not even official overall his pike wielding phalanx infantry numbered some 12 000 men 3 000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9 000 of which were pezhetairoi however in discussing discrepancies among ancient historians about size of alexander great s army n g l hammond and f w walbank choose diodorus siculus figure of 32 000 infantry as most reliable while disagreeing with his figure for cavalry at 4 500 asserting it was closer to 5 100 horsemen alexander continued use of cretan archers and introduced native macedonian archers into army after battle of gaugamela archers of west asian backgrounds became commonplace antigonid period military thumb upright fresco of an ancient macedonian soldier wearing chainmail armor and bearing a shield 3rd centurybc istanbul archaeology museums macedonian army continued to evolve under antigonid dynasty it is uncertain how many men were appointed as somatophylakes which numbered eight men at end of alexander great s reign while hypaspistai seem to have morphed into assistants of somatophylakes other developments in macedonian army organization are evident after alexander one is evolution of hypaspistai from an elite unit to a form of military police or bodyguard under philip v only thing two functions had in common was particular closeness to king at battle of cynoscephalae in 197bc macedonians commanded some 16 000 phalanx pikemen alexander great s royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men same number of cavalrymen in sacred squadron latin sacra ala greek ile commanded by philip v of macedon during social war of regular macedonian cavalry numbered 3 000 at callinicus which was separate from sacred squadron and royal cavalry while macedonian cavalry of 4th century bc had fought without shields use of shields by cavalry was adopted from celtic invaders of 270s bc who settled in galatia central anatolia thanks to contemporary inscriptions from amphipolis and dated 218 and respectively historians have been able to partially piece together organization of antigonid army under philipv for evolution of macedonian military titles such as its command by officers assisted by i e secretaries or clerks see from at least time of antigonus iii doson most elite antigonid period infantry were peltasts lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins swords and a smaller bronze shield than macedonian phalanx pikemen although they sometimes served in that capacity other development which happened at latest under doson was formation and training of a special unit of separate from phalanx this unit operated as a form of royal guard similar in function to earlier hypaspistai among peltasts roughly 2 000 men were selected to serve in elite agema vanguard with other peltasts numbering roughly 3 000 number of peltasts varied over time perhaps never more than 5 000 men largest figure for elite macedonian peltasts mentioned by ancient historians was 5 000 troops an amount that existed in social war 220 217 bc they fought alongside phalanx pikemen divided now into chalkaspides bronze shield and white shield regiments antigonid macedonian kings continued to expand and equip navy cassander maintained a small fleet at pydna demetrius i of macedon had one at pella and antigonus ii gonatas while serving as a general for demetrius in greece used navy to secure macedonian holdings in demetrias chalkis piraeus and corinth navy was considerably expanded during chremonidean war 267 261bc allowing macedonian navy to defeat ptolemaic egyptian navy at 255bc battle of cos and battle of andros and enabling macedonian influence to spread over cyclades antigonusiii doson used macedonian navy to invade caria while philipv sent 200 ships to fight in battle of chios in 201bc macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in 197bc peace treaty that concluded second macedonian war with roman republic although perseus of macedon quickly assembled some at outbreak of third macedonian war in 171bc society and culture language and dialects following its adoption as court language of philip ii of macedon s regime authors of ancient macedonia wrote their works in koine greek lingua franca of late classical and hellenistic greece see also for further details edward m anson contends that native spoken language of macedonians was a dialect of greek and that in roughly 6 300 macedonian period inscriptions discovered by archaeologists about 99 were written in greek language using greek alphabet rare textual evidence indicates that native macedonian language was either a dialect of greek similar to thessalian greek and northwestern greek states that native language of ancient macedonians as preserved in rare documents written in a language other than koine greek also betray a slight phonetic influence from languages of original inhabitants of region who were assimilated or expelled by invading macedonians hatzopoulos also asserts that little is known about these languages aside from phrygian spoken by who migrated to anatolia affirms that macedonian language was merely a dialect of greek that used loanwords from thracian and illyrian languages which does not surprise modern philologists but ultimately provided macedonia s political enemies with proof they needed to level charge that macedonians were not greek or a language closely related to greek hamp eric adams douglas 2013 expansion of indo european languages sino platonic papers vol 239 accessed 16 january 2017 joseph 2001 ancient greek is generally taken to be only representative though note existence of different dialects of greek or hellenic branch of indo european there is some dispute as to whether ancient macedonian native language of philip and alexander if it has any special affinity to greek at all is a dialect within greek see below or a sibling language to all known ancient greek dialects if latter view is correct then macedonian and greek would be two of a group within indo european which could more properly be called hellenic ancient macedonian is closely related to greek and macedonian and greek are descended from a common greek macedonian idiom that was spoken till about second half of 3rd millennium bc vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient macedonia were written in attic greek and its successor koine attic and later koine greek was preferred language of ancient macedonian army although it is known that alexander great once shouted an emergency order in macedonian to his royal guards during drinking party where he killed cleitus black macedonian became extinct in either hellenistic or roman period and entirely replaced by koine greek for instance cleopatra vii philopator last active ruler of ptolemaic dynasty in egypt spoke koine greek as a first language and by her reign 51 30 bc

macedonians and southern greeks worshiped more or less same deities of greek pantheon see also for ways in which macedonian religious beliefs diverged from mainstream greek polytheism although latter was hardly monolithic throughout classical greek and hellenistic world and macedonians were linguistically and culturally greek according to christesen and murray in macedonia political and religious offices were often intertwined for instance head of state for city of amphipolis also served as priest of asklepios greek god of medicine a similar arrangement existed at cassandreia where a cult priest honoring city s founder cassander was nominal head of city main sanctuary of zeus was maintained at dion while another at veria was dedicated to herakles and was patronized by demetrius ii aetolicus meanwhile foreign cults from egypt were fostered by royal court such as temple of sarapis at thessaloniki macedonians also had relations with international cults for example macedonian kings philip iii of macedon and alexander iv of macedon made votive offerings to internationally esteemed samothrace temple complex of cabeiri mystery cult in three royal tombs at vergina professional painters decorated walls with a mythological scene of hades abducting persephone and royal hunting scenes while lavish grave goods including weapons armor drinking vessels and personal items were housed with dead whose bones were burned before burial in golden coffins see also for further details some grave goods and decorations were common in other macedonian tombs yet some items found at vergina were distinctly tied to royalty including a diadem luxurious goods and arms and armor see also for further details scholars have debated about identity of tomb occupants since discovery of their remains in 1977 1978 and recent research and forensic examination have concluded that at least one of persons buried was philipii rosella 10 october 2014 remains of alexander great s father

dead in 2014 ancient macedonian kasta tomb was discovered outside of amphipolis and is largest ancient tomb found in greece as of 2017 economics and social class young macedonian men were typically expected to engage in hunting and martial combat as a by product of their transhumance lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits some macedonians engaged in farming often with irrigation land reclamation and horticulture activities supported by macedonian state for a specific example of land reclamation near amphipolis during reign of alexander great see macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper iron gold and silver conversion of these raw materials into finished products and sale of those products encouraged growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from traditional rustic macedonian lifestyle during course of 5thcenturybc macedonian king was an autocratic figure at head of both government and society with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy but he was also leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi core of macedonian aristocracy these aristocrats were second only to king in terms of power and privilege filling ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in military it was in more bureaucratic regimes of hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded alexander great s empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join aristocracy could be found especially in ptolemaic egypt although governed by a king and martial aristocracy macedonia seems to have lacked widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous greek states visual arts by reign of archelausi in 5th century bc ancient macedonian elite was importing customs and artistic traditions from other regions of greece while retaining more archaic perhaps homeric funerary rites connected with symposium that were typified by items such as decorative metal that held ashes of deceased macedonian nobility in their tombs among these is large bronze derveni krater from a 4th centurybc tomb of thessaloniki decorated with scenes of greek god dionysus and his entourage and belonging to an aristocrat who had had a military career macedonian metalwork usually followed athenian styles of vase shapes from onward with drinking vessels jewellery containers crowns diadems and coins among many metal objects found in macedonian tombs thumb 300px alexander left wearing a kausia and fighting an asiatic lion with his friend craterus detail late 4th centurybc mosaic pella museum surviving macedonian painted artwork includes frescoes and murals but also decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs for instance trace colors still exist on bas reliefs of late 4th century bc alexander sarcophagus macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by ancient macedonians aside from metalwork and painting mosaics are another significant form of surviving macedonian artwork stag hunt mosaic of pella with its three dimensional qualities and illusionist style show clear influence from painted artwork and wider hellenistic art trends although rustic theme of hunting was tailored to macedonian tastes similar lion hunt mosaic of pella illustrates either a scene of alexander great with his companion craterus or simply a conventional illustration of royal diversion of hunting mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of dionysus riding a panther and helen of troy being abducted by theseus latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to macedonian paintings common themes of macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare hunting and aggressive masculine sexuality i e abduction of women for rape or marriage these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection this metaphorical connection between warfare hunting and aggressive masculine sexuality seems to be affirmed by later byzantine literature particularly in acritic songs about digenes akritas see for details theatre music and performing arts philip ii was assassinated in 336 bc at theatre of aigai macedonia amid games and spectacles celebrating marriage of his daughter cleopatra of macedon alexander great was allegedly a great admirer of both theatre and music he was especially fond of plays by classical athenian tragedians aeschylus sophocles and euripides whose works formed part of a proper greek education for his new eastern subjects alongside studies in greek language including epics of homer while he and his army were stationed at tyre in modern day lebanon alexander had his generals act as judges not only for athletic contests but also for stage performances of greek tragedies contemporaneous famous actors and athenodorus performed at event actor athenodorus performed despite risking a fine for being absent from simultaneous dionysia festival of athens where he was scheduled to perform a fine that his patron alexander agreed to pay see for details music was also appreciated in macedonia in addition to agora gymnasium theatre and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to greek gods and goddesses one of main markers of a true greek city in empire of alexander great was presence of an odeon for musical performances this was case not only for alexandria in egypt but also for cities as distant as ai khanoum in what is now modern day afghanistan literature education philosophy and patronage thumb upright portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman 1st or 2nd copy of a lost bronze sculpture made by perdiccas ii of macedon was able to host well known classical greek intellectual visitors at his royal court such as lyric poet and renowned medical doctor hippocrates and pindar s written for alexander i of macedon may have been composed at his court archelausi received many more greek scholars artists and celebrities at his court than his predecessors see also for further details his honored guests included painter architect callimachus poets choerilus of samos timotheus of miletus and agathon as well as famous athenian playwright euripides although archelaus i of macedon was criticized by philosopher plato supposedly hated by socrates and first known macedonian king to be given label of barbarian historian thucydides held macedonian king in glowing admiration especially for his engagement in panhellenic sports and fostering of literary culture see philosopher aristotle who studied at platonic academy of athens and established aristotelian school of thought moved to macedonia and is said to have tutored young alexander great as well as serving as an esteemed diplomat for philipii among alexander s retinue of artists writers and philosophers was pyrrho of elis founder of pyrrhonism school of philosophical skepticism during antigonid period antigonos gonatas fostered cordial relationships with of eretria founder of school of philosophy and zenon founder of stoicism in terms of early greek historiography and later roman historiography felix jacoby identified thirteen possible ancient historians who wrote about macedonia in his fragmente der griechischen aside from accounts in herodotus and thucydides works compiled by jacoby are only fragmentary whereas other works are completely lost such as history of an illyrian war fought by perdiccas iii written by antipater see also for further details macedonian historians marsyas of pella and marsyas of philippi wrote histories of macedonia ptolemaic king ptolemy i soter authored a history about alexander and hieronymus of cardia wrote a history about alexander s royal successors for marsyas of pella see also for further details following indian campaign of alexander great macedonian military officer nearchus wrote a work of his voyage from mouth of indus river to persian gulf macedonian historian craterus published a compilation of decrees made by popular assembly of athenian democracy ostensibly while attending school of aristotle philip v of macedon had manuscripts of history of philipii written by theopompus gathered by his court scholars and disseminated with further copies sports and leisure thumb 400px a fresco showing hades and persephone riding in a chariot from tomb of queen eurydice i of macedon at vergina greece 4thcenturybc when alexander i of macedon petitioned to compete in foot race of ancient olympic games event organizers at first denied his request explaining that only greeks were allowed to compete however alexanderi produced proof of an argead royal genealogy showing ancient argive lineage a move that ultimately convinced olympic hellanodikai authorities of his greek descent and ability to compete by end of 5thcenturybc macedonian king archelausi was crowned with olive wreath at both olympia and delphi in pythian games for winning chariot racing contests philipii allegedly heard of olympic victory of his horse in either an individual horse race or chariot race on same day his son alexander great was born on either 19 or 356bc non royal macedonians also competed in and won various olympic contests by 4th century bc in addition to literary contests alexander great staged competitions for music and athletics across his empire dining and cuisine thumb 450px a banquet scene from a macedonian tomb of agios athanasios thessaloniki 4thcenturybc shown are six men reclining on couches with food arranged on nearby tables a male servant in attendance and female musicians providing entertainment ancient macedonia produced only a few fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in greek world including eels from gulf and special wine produced in chalcidice earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in macedonia during 3rdcenturybc which perhaps influenced later bread of medieval europe cattle and goats were consumed although there was no notice of macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until middle ages comedic playwright menander wrote that macedonian dining habits penetrated athenian high society for instance introduction of meats into dessert course of a meal macedonians also most likely introduced to athenian cuisine a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced salted and sauced meats served during wine course this particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by athenian comic poet alexis about declining morals of athenians in age of demetrius i of macedon symposium in macedonian and wider greek realm was a banquet for nobility and privileged class an occasion for feasting drinking entertainment and sometimes philosophical discussion hetairoi leading members of macedonian aristocracy were expected to attend such feasts with their king they were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for acquisition of game meat as well as for sport ethnic identity statues depicting ancient macedonians wearing kausia a headgear that led persians to refer to macedonians as greeks with hats that look like shields left athenian terracotta figurine c 300 bc right macedonian terracotta figurine 3rd century bc ancient authors and modern scholars alike disagree about ethnic identity of ancient macedonians ernst badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between greeks and macedonians exist in written speeches of arrian who lived at time of roman empire when any notion of an ethnic disparity between macedonians and other greeks was incomprehensible johannes engels comes to a similar conclusion see hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between macedonians and greeks only a political distinction contrived after creation of league of corinth in 337bc which was led by macedonia through league s elected hegemon philipii when he was not a member of league itself hatzopoulos stresses fact that macedonians and other peoples such as epirotes and cypriots despite speaking a greek dialect worshiping in greek cults engaging in panhellenic games and upholding traditional greek institutions nevertheless occasionally had their territories excluded from contemporary geographic definitions of hellas and were even considered barbarians by some see johannes engels comes to a similar conclusion about comparison between macedonians and epirotes saying that of epirotes despite them not being considered as refined as southern greeks never came into question engels suggests this perhaps because epirotes did not try to dominate greek world as philip ii of macedon had done see n g l hammond asserts that ancient views differentiating macedonia s ethnic identity from rest of greek speaking world should be seen as an expression of conflict between two different political systems democratic system of city states e g athens versus monarchy macedonia other academics who concur that difference between macedonians and greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include michael b sakellariou malcolm errington ancient allegations that macedonians were non greek all had their origin in athens at time of struggle with philipii then as now political struggle created prejudice orator aeschines once even found it necessary to counteract prejudice vigorously fomented by his opponents to defend philip on this issue and describe him at a meeting of athenian popular assembly as being entirely greek demosthenes allegations were lent an appearance of credibility by fact apparent to every observer that life style of macedonians being determined by specific geographical and historical conditions was different to that of a greek city state this alien way of life was however common to western greeks of epirus and as well as to macedonians and their fundamental greek nationality was never doubted only as a consequence of political disagreement with macedonia was issue raised at all and b champion demosthenes could drop barbarian category altogether in advocating an athenian alliance with great king against a power that ranked below any so called barbarian people macedonians in case of aeschines philipii could be a barbarian due for vengeance of god but after orator s embassy to pella in 346 he became a thorough greek devoted to athens it all depended upon one s immediate political orientation with macedonia which many greeks instinctively scorned was always infused with deep seated ambivalence anson argues that some hellenic authors expressed complex or even ever changing and ambiguous ideas about exact ethnic identity of macedonians who were considered by some such as aristotle in his politics as barbarians and others as semi greek or fully greek this was manifested in different mythological genealogies concocted for macedonian people with hesiod s catalogue of women claiming that macedonians descended from macedon son of zeus and and was therefore a nephew of hellen progenitor of greeks see by end of 5th century bc hellanicus of lesbos asserted macedon was son of aeolus latter a son of hellen and ancestor of aeolians one of major tribes of greeks as well as belonging to tribal groups such as aeolians dorians achaeans and ionians anson also stresses fact that some greeks even distinguished their ethnic identities based on polis i e city state they originally came from see roger d woodard asserts that in addition to persisting uncertainty in modern times about proper classification of macedonian language and its relation to greek ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about macedonians for instance demosthenes when labeling philipii of macedon as a barbarian whereas polybius called greeks and macedonians as i e part of same race or kin see johannes engels also discusses this ambiguity in ancient sources simon hornblower argues on greek identity of macedonians taking into consideration their origin language cults and customs any preconceived ethnic differences between greeks and macedonians faded by 148bc soon after roman conquest of macedonia and then rest of greece with defeat of achaean league by roman republic at battle of corinth 146 bc technology and engineering architecture macedonian architecture although utilizing a mixture of different forms and styles from rest of greece did not represent a unique or diverging style from other ancient greek architecture among classical orders macedonian architects favored ionic order especially in peristyle courtyards of private homes there are several surviving examples albeit in ruins of macedonian palatial architecture including a palace at site of capital pella summer residence of vergina near old capital aigai and royal residence at demetrias near modern volos at vergina ruins of three large banquet halls with marble tiled floors covered in debris of roof tiles with floor plan dimensions measuring roughly 16 7 x 17 6 m 54 8 x 57 7 ft demonstrate perhaps earliest examples of monumental triangular roof trusses if dated before reign of antigonus ii gonatas or even onset of hellenistic period later macedonian architecture also featured arches and vaults palaces of both vergina and demetrias had walls made of bricks while latter palace had four corner towers around a central courtyard in manner of a fortified residence fit for a king or at least a military governor macedonian rulers also sponsored works of architecture outside of macedonia proper for instance following his victory at battle of chaeronea 338 bc philipii raised a round memorial building at olympia known as decorated inside with statues depicting him his parents amyntas iii of macedon and eurydice i of macedon his wife olympias and his son alexander great see also for further details thumb 300px ruins of ancient theatre in maroneia rhodope east macedonia and thrace greece ruins of roughly twenty greek theatres survive in present day regions of macedonia and thrace in greece sixteen open air theatres three and a possible theatre in veria undergoing excavation military technology and engineering by hellenistic period it became common for greek states to finance development and proliferation of ever more powerful torsion siege engines naval ships and standardized designs for arms and armor under philipii and alexander great improvements were made to siege artillery such as bolt shooting ballistae and siege engines such as huge rolling siege towers e w marsden and m y contend that macedonian rulers antigonus i monophthalmus and his successor demetrius i of macedon had most powerful siege artillery of hellenistic world at end of 4thcenturybc siege of salamis cyprus in necessitated building of large siege engines and drafting of craftsmen from parts of west asia siege tower commissioned by demetriusi for macedonian siege of rhodes 305 304 bc and manned by over three thousand soldiers was built at a height of nine stories it had a base of eight wheels that were steered in either direction by pivots three sides covered in iron plates to protect them from fire and mechanically opened windows shielded with wool stuffed leather curtains to soften blow of ballistae rounds of different sizes to accommodate firing of missiles ranging from arrows to larger bolts during siege of by philip v of macedon in besiegers built tunnels to protect soldiers and sappers as they went back and forth from camp to siege works these included two siege towers connected by a makeshift curtain wall mounted with stone shooting ballistae and sheds to protect approach of battering ram despite early reputation of macedon as a leader in siege technology alexandria in ptolemaic egypt became center for technological improvements to catapult by 3rdcenturybc as evidenced by writings of philo of alexandria other innovations although perhaps not as prolific as other areas of greece in regards to technological innovations there are some inventions that may have originated in macedonia aside from siege engines and artillery rotary operated olive press for producing olive oil may have been invented in ancient macedonia or another part of greece or even as far east as levant or anatolia mold pressed glass first appeared in macedonia in 4thcenturybc although it could have simultaneously existed in achaemenid empire first known clear translucent glass pieces of greek world have been discovered in macedonia and rhodes and date to second half of 4thcenturybc greek technical and scientific literature began with classical athens in 5thcenturybc while major production centers for technical innovation and texts during hellenistic period were alexandria rhodes and pergamon currency finances and resources thumb above and drachms below issued during reign of alexander great now in numismatic museum of athens minting of silver coinage began during reign of alexanderi as a means to pay for royal expenditures archelausi increased silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote foreign and domestic commerce minting of coinage significantly increased during reigns of philipii and alexander great especially after increase in state revenues following seizure of hills during hellenistic period royal houses of macedonia ptolemaic egypt and kingdom of pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities largely to ensure funding of their armies by end of conquests of alexander great nearly thirty mints stretching from macedonia to babylon produced standard coins right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments i e autonomous municipal governments of thessaloniki pella and amphipolis within macedonian commonwealth macedonians were also first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation state revenues were also raised by collecting produce from arable lands timber from forests and taxes on imports and exports at harbors some mines groves agricultural lands and forests belonging to macedonian state were exploited by macedonian king although these were often leased as assets or given as grants to members of nobility such as hetairoi and philoi tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of macedonian seaports existed from at least reign of amyntasiii and callistratus of d c aided perdiccasiii in doubling kingdom s annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents after defeat of perseus at pydna in 168bc roman senate allowed reopening of iron and copper mines but forbade mining of gold and silver by four newly established autonomous client states that replaced monarchy in macedonia see also for further details law may originally have been conceived by senate due to fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow macedonians to fund an armed rebellion see also for further details romans were perhaps also concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from macedonian silver mining macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148bc i e just before establishment of roman province of macedonia and when romans lifted ban on macedonian silver mining in it may simply have reflected local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of senate s decree legacy reigns of philip ii and alexander great witnessed demise of classical greece and birth of hellenistic civilization following spread of greek culture to near east during and after alexander s conquests macedonians then migrated to egypt and parts of asia but intensive colonization of foreign lands sapped available manpower in macedonia proper weakening kingdom in its fight with other hellenistic powers and contributing to its downfall and conquest by romans however diffusion of greek culture and language cemented by alexander s conquests in west asia and north africa served as a precondition for later roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for byzantine empire according to errington thumb 400px left alexander mosaic a roman mosaic from pompeii italy c 100 bc ethnic macedonian rulers of ptolemaic and seleucid successor states accepted men from all over greek world as their hetairoi companions and did not foster a national identity like antigonids modern scholarship has focused on how these hellenistic successor kingdoms were influenced more by their macedonian origins than eastern or southern greek traditions while spartan society remained mostly insular and athens continued placing strict limitations on acquiring citizenship cosmopolitan hellenistic cities of asia and northeastern africa bore a greater resemblance to macedonian cities and contained a mixture of subjects including natives greek and macedonian colonists and greek speaking hellenized easterners many of whom were product of intermarriage between greeks and native populations deification of macedonian monarchs perhaps began with death of philipii but it was his son alexander great who unambiguously claimed to be a living god as pharaoh of egyptians he was already titled son of ra and considered living incarnation of horus by his egyptian subjects a belief that ptolemaic successors of alexander would foster for their own dynasty in egypt see and for details following his visit to oracle of in 334bc that suggested his divinity alexander traveled to oracle of zeus ammon greek equivalent of egyptian amun ra at siwa oasis of libyan desert in to confirm his divine status after priest and oracle of zeus ammon at siwa oasis convinced him that philipii was merely his mortal father and zeus his actual father alexander began styling himself as son of zeus which brought him into contention with some of his greek subjects who adamantly believed that living men could not be immortals see and for details although ptolemaic and seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers kings were not worshiped in kingdom of macedonia while zeus ammon was known to greeks prior to alexander s reign particularly at greek colony of cyrene libya alexander was first macedonian monarch to patronize egyptian persian and babylonian priesthoods and deities strengthening fusion of near eastern and greek religious beliefs after his reign cult of isis gradually spread throughout hellenistic and roman world while beliefs in egyptian god sarapis were thoroughly hellenized by ptolemaic rulers of egypt before spread of his cult to macedonia and aegean region german historian johann gustav droysen argued that conquests of alexander great and creation of hellenistic world allowed for growth and establishment of
