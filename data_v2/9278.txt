leonardo da vinci was last of three dreadnoughts built for royal italian navy in early 1910s completed just before beginning of world war i ship saw no action and was sunk by a magazine explosion in 1916 with loss of 248 officers and enlisted men italians blamed austro hungarian saboteurs for her loss but it may have been accidental leonardo da vinci was refloated in 1919 and plans were made to repair her budgetary constraints did not permit this and her hulk was sold for scrap in 1923 design and description conte di cavour class was designed to counter french dreadnoughts which caused them to be slower and more heavily armored than first italian dreadnought giorgerini p 269 ships were long at waterline and overall they had a beam of and a draft of gardiner gray p 259 conte di cavour class ships displaced at normal load and at deep load they had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men giorgerini pp 270 272 they were powered by three sets of parsons steam turbines two sets driving outer propeller shafts and one set two inner shafts steam for turbines was provided by twenty blechynden water tube boilers eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both fuel oil and coal designed to reach a maximum speed of from leonardo da vinci only reached a speed of using ships carried enough coal and oilgiorgerini pp 268 272 to give them a range of at armament and armor thumb left upright 1 2 layout of main armament main battery of conte di cavour class consisted of thirteen 305 millimeter model 1909 guns in five centerline gun turrets with a twin gun turret superfiring over a triple gun turret in fore and aft pairs and a third triple turret amidships hore p 175 their secondary armament consisted of eighteen guns mounted in casemates on sides of hull for defense against torpedo boats ships carried fourteen guns thirteen of these could be mounted on turret tops but they could be positioned in 30 different locations including some on forecastle and upper decks they were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes one on each broadside and third in stern giorgerini pp 268 277 278 conte di cavour class ships had a complete waterline armor belt that had a maximum thickness of amidships which reduced to towards stern and towards bow they had two armored decks main deck was thick on flat that increased to on slopes that connected it to main belt second deck was thick frontal armor of gun turrets was in thickness and sides were thick armor protecting their barbettes ranged in thickness from walls of forward conning tower were 280 millimeters thick giorgerini pp 270 272mclaughlin p 421 construction and service leonardo da vinci named after artist and inventor silverstone p 300 was built by odero shipbuilding co at their sestri ponente genoa shipyard she was laid down on 18 july 1910 launched on 14 october 1911 and completed on 17 may 1914 ship saw no combat during war and spent most of it at anchor giorgerini p 272 admiral paolo thaon di revel italian naval chief of staff believed that austro hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in narrow waters of adriatic threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to actively deploy fleet instead revel decided to implement a blockade at relatively safer southern end of adriatic with battle fleet while smaller vessels such as mas torpedo boats conducted raids on austro hungarian ships and installations meanwhile revel s battleships would be preserved to confront austro hungarian battle fleet in event that it sought a decisive engagement halpern pp 141 142 150 sinking thumb upside down hulk of leonardo da vinci under repair she capsized in taranto harbor giorgerini pp 272 277 in of water allen p 23 after an internal magazine explosion on night of 2 3 august 1916 while loading ammunition casualties included 21 officers and 227 enlisted men whitley pp 157 158 subsequent investigation blamed austro hungarian saboteurs but unstable propellant may well have been responsible regia marina wanted to raise ship and rejected initial plans to demolish wreck with explosives they ultimately settled on a plan to make ship s hull airtight and raise it using compressed air and pontoons this required that ship s coal ammunition and gun turrets be removed or cut loose respectively by divers to reduce her weight a further complication was that largest drydock in taranto had a maximum depth of only and upside down leonardo da vinci drew this meant that her funnels had to be cut off as well allen pp 24 26 all of this preparation required over two years and ship was refloated on 17 september 1919 a deep channel had been dredged from her location to drydock and she was moved there a special wooden framework had to be built to support her still inverted after water in drydock had been drained her decks were not designed to handle stresses involved in her unique situation and had to be reinforced to withstand weight of hull and preliminary repairs were made in preparation for righting her a deep spot in harbor was dredged for this task and some of ballast were added in spots calculated to assist in righting effort primary work was done by of water pumped into ship s starboard p 26 and she was successfully righted on 24 january 1921 whitley p 158 regia marina planned to modernize leonardo da vinci by replacing her amidships turret with six anti aircraft guns but ultimately lacked funds to do so and sold her for scrap on 22 march 1923 preston p 176 footnotes references further
