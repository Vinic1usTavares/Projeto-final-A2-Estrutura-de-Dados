1821 norfolk and long island hurricane was one of four known tropical cyclones that have made landfall in new york city another even more intense hurricane in pre columbian times sometime between 1278 and 1438 left evidence that was detected in southern new jersey by paleotempestological research third was 1893 new york hurricane and fourth was hurricane irene in 2011 first of three recorded tropical cyclones recorded in 1821 atlantic hurricane season storm that would eventually strike new york was first observed off southeast united states coast on september 1 with winds estimated in excess of 135 mph 215 km h it moved ashore near wilmington north carolina and passed near norfolk virginia before moving through delmarva peninsula and new jersey just inland on september 3 hurricane struck approximately near jamaica bay which later became part of new york city and on september 4 it was observed over new england this was just 6 years after destructive great september gale of 1815 meteorological history a tropical cyclone was first observed on september 1 off southeast coast of united states initially it was believed to be same storm that struck guadeloupe on same day though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms hurricane tracked by bahamas while tracking generally northward and it attained major hurricane status over western atlantic ocean as it approached united states coastline hurricane was very intense with winds estimated at over 135 mph 215 km h and potentially as strong as 160 mph 260 km h or a category 5 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale late on september 2 hurricane made landfall near wilmington north carolina and later turned to northeast to cross pamlico sound hurricane accelerated northeastward and passed over hampton roads area early on september 3 after crossing chesapeake bay cyclone traversed delmarva peninsula near atlantic coastline and at around 1500 utc eye passed directly over cape henlopen delaware a thirty minute period of calm was reported it continued across delaware bay and later passed over cape may new jersey where a fifteen minute calm was reported modern researchers estimate it was a category 3 or category 4 hurricane upon striking new jersey one of few hurricanes to hit state moving ashore at very low tide it paralleled state s coastline just inland and after exiting into lower new york bay hurricane made landfall on new york city at around 1930 utc on september 3 this makes it only major hurricane to directly hit city a minimal hurricane in 1893 also made landfall on what later became part of new york city one modern researcher estimates hurricane was moving at a forward speed of 35 mph 55 km h and upon moving ashore had a pressure of 965 mbar hurricane continued northeastward through new england and after entering massachusetts on september 4 its exact path was unknown one researcher estimated cyclone tracked northeastward until losing its identity over southeastern maine while another assessed storm as passing far to west of maine based on arrangement of effects in new england meteorologist william c redfield deduced that wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular previously winds were believed to be in a straight line impact in north carolina a powerful storm surge flooded large portions of portsmouth island residents estimated island would have been completely under water had worst of storm lasted for two more hours strong winds occurred across eastern north carolina resulting in at least 76 destroyed houses numerous people were killed in currituck strongest winds of hurricane lasted for about an hour in southeastern virginia after which storm rapidly abated several houses were completely destroyed with many others receiving moderate to severe damage winds destroyed most of roof of courthouse and uprooted trees across region fallen tree limbs damaged a stone bridge in norfolk hurricane produced a strong storm surge along virginia coastline which reached 10 feet 3 m at pungoteague on delmarva peninsula storm surge which reached several hundred yards inland destroyed two bridges and flooded many warehouses along elizabeth river rough waves grounded uss guerriere and uss congress and also destroyed several schooners and brigs along eastern shore storm surge flooded barrier islands along atlantic coastline causing severe crop damage and downing many trees several houses were destroyed and at pungoteague impact of hurricane was described as unexampled destruction five people drowned in chincoteague considered one of most violent hurricanes on record in mid atlantic hurricane caused 200 000 in damage in virginia 1821 usd 3 1 million 2007 usd gale force winds affected delmarva peninsula on poplar island in talbot county maryland winds peaked at 1600 utc on september 3 strongest winds were confined to atlantic coastline with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in washington d c and baltimore maryland fierce winds were observed in cape henlopen delaware with strongest gales occurring after eye passed over area upon making landfall on cape may new jersey cyclone produced a 5 foot 1 5 m storm surge on delaware bay side of city lasting for several hours hurricane force winds were described as blowing with great violence causing widespread devastation across region wind gusts in cape may county reached over and around in atlantic county in little egg harbor hurricane damaged to port strong winds reached as far inland as philadelphia pennsylvania where winds of over 40 mph 60 km h downed trees and chimneys in city precipitation accrued to 3 92 inches 99 6 mm further to north hurricane destroyed a windmill at bergen point new jersey though hurricane struck at low tide it produced a storm surge of over 29 feet 9 m along several portions of new jersey coastline causing significant overwash hurricane produced a storm surge of 13 feet 4 m in only one hour at battery park a record only broken 191 years later by hurricane sandy manhattan island was completely flooded to canal street one hurricane researcher remarked that storm surge flooding would have been much worse had hurricane not struck at low tide however few deaths were reported in city since flooding affected neighborhoods much less populated than today hurricane brought light rainfall as it passed new york city though strong winds left severe damage across city high tides occurred along hudson river strong waves and winds blew many ships ashore along long island one ship sank killing 17 people along long island winds destroyed several buildings and left crops destroyed in new england hurricane produced widespread gale force winds with damage greatest in connecticut black rock harbor light in black rock connecticut was destroyed on september 21 elsewhere in state winds damaged or destroyed churches houses and small buildings moderate crop damage to fruit was reported as well strong winds extended into eastern massachusetts though little damage was reported in boston area hurricane force winds reached as far north as maine historical context swiss re insurance company estimates that a hurricane with exact track of 1821 storm would cause 107 billion in direct property damage in 2014 damage would reach over 1 billion in atlantic and ocean counties in new jersey and new haven and hartford counties in connecticut damage would reach over 2 billion in nassau and suffolk counties on long island as well as fairfield county connecticut indirect losses including lost tax revenue and lower real estate would reach nearly 250 billion nationwide for a similar storm damage would be far greater than what occurred during hurricane sandy in 2012 which caused 65 billion in damage in country when it struck new jersey see also list of north carolina hurricanes pre 1900 list of new jersey hurricanes list of new york hurricanes list of new england
