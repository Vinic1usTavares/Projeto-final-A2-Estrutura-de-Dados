thomas dwight s anatomy of a contortionist scribner s 1889 from 1850s onwards a culture of physical exercise developed in india to counter colonial stereotype of supposed degeneracy of indians compared to british a belief reinforced by then current ideas of lamarckism and eugenics this culture was taken up from 1880s to early 20th century by indian nationalists such as who taught exercises and unarmed combat techniques under guise of yoga meanwhile proponents of indian physical culture like k v iyer consciously combined hata yoga with bodybuilding in his bangalore gymnasium singleton notes that poses much like durvasasana ganda and were found in thomas dwight s 1889 article anatomy of a contortionist while poses close to warrior pose downward dog utthita supta virasana and others were described in niels s 1924 danish text eller known in english as primary gymnastics these in turn were derived from a 19th century scandinavian tradition of gymnastics dating back to pehr ling and found their way to india by early 20th century yoga asanas were brought to america in 1919 by yogendra sometimes called father of modern yoga renaissance his system influenced by physical culture of max muller in 1924 swami kuvalayananda founded health and yoga research center in maharashtra he combined asanas with indian systems of exercise and modern european gymnastics having according to scholar joseph alter a profound effect on evolution of yoga in 1925 yogananda having moved from india to america set up self realization fellowship in los angeles and taught yoga including asanas breathing chanting and meditation to tens of thousands of americans as described in his 1946 autobiography of a yogi tirumalai krishnamacharya 1888 1989 studied under kuvalayananda in 1930s creating a marriage of hatha yoga wrestling exercises and modern western gymnastic movement and unlike anything seen before in yoga tradition sjoman argues that krishnamacharya drew on dipika gymnastic exercise manual to create mysore palace system of yoga singleton argues that krishnamacharya was familiar with gymnastics culture of his time which was influenced by scandinavian gymnastics his experimentation with asanas and innovative use of gymnastic jumping between poses may well explain singleton suggests resemblances between modern standing asanas and scandinavian gymnastics krishnamacharya known as father of modern yoga had among his pupils people who became influential yoga teachers themselves russian eugenie v peterson known as indra devi pattabhi jois who founded ashtanga vinyasa yoga in 1948

himself in each posture dharma yoga website suggests that he created some 300 of these origins of asanas thumb upright kapala asana from 1830 manuscript of joga pradipika asanas have been created at different times a few being ancient some being medieval and a growing number recent some that appear traditional such as virabhadrasana i warrior pose i are relatively recent that pose was probably devised by krishnamacharya around 1940 and it was popularised by his pupil iyengar a pose that is certainly younger than that is parsvakonasana revolved side angle pose it was not in first edition of pattabhi jois s yoga mala in 1962 virabhadrasana reversed warrior pose is still more recent and may have been created since 2000 several poses that are now commonly practised such as dog pose and standing asanas including trikonasana triangle pose first appeared in 20th century as did sequence of asanas surya namaskar salute to sun a different sun salutation aditya hridayam is certainly ancient as it is described in yuddha canto 107 of ramayana surya namaskar in its modern form was created by raja of pant k pattabhi jois defined variant forms surya namaskar a and b for ashtanga yoga possibly derived from krishnamacharya surya namaskar can be seen as a modern physical culture oriented rendition of simple ancient practice of prostrating oneself to sun in 1966 iyengar s classic light on yoga was able to describe some 200 asanas consisting of about 50 main poses with their variations sjoman observes that whereas many traditional asanas are named for objects like tree pose legendary figures like matsyendrasana sage matsyendra s pose or animals like tortoise pose an overwhelming eighty three of iyengar s asanas have names that simply describe body s position like utthita parsvakonasana extended side angle pose these are he suggests ones that have been developed later a name following this pattern is six triangles pose described in 2015 mittra illustrated 908 poses and variations in his 1984 master yoga chart and many more have been created since then number of asanas has thus increased with time as summarised in table sjoman notes that names of asanas have been used promiscuous ly in a tradition of amalgamation and borrowing over centuries making their history difficult to trace presence of matching names is not proof of continuity since same name may mean a different pose and a pose may have been known by multiple names at different times estimates here are therefore based on actual descriptions of asanas estimates of number of asanas no of asanas

lion pose simhasana is named for an avatar of vishnu in form of man lion narasimha india 12th century asanas of hatha yoga originally had a spiritual purpose within hinduism attainment of samadhi a state of meditative consciousness scholar of religion andrea jain notes that medieval hatha yoga was shared among yoga traditions from shaivite to vaishnavas jains and sufis in her view its aims too varied including spiritual goals involving tantric manipulation of subtle body and at a more physical level destroying poisons singleton describes hatha yoga s purpose as transmutation of human body into a vessel immune from mortal decay citing gheranda metaphor of an earthenware pot that requires fire of yoga to make it serviceable mallinson and singleton note that purposes of asana practice were until around fourteenth century firstly to form a stable platform for pranayama mantra repetition japa and meditation practices that in turn had spiritual goals and secondly to stop accumulation of karma and instead acquire ascetic power tapas something that conferred supernatural abilities hatha yoga added ability to cure diseases to this list not all hindu scriptures agreed that asanas were beneficial 10th century garuda purana stated that techniques of posture do not promote yoga though called essentials they all retard one s progress while early yogis often practised extreme austerities tapas to overcome what they saw as obstacle of body in way of liberation yoga scholar and practitioner theos bernard in his 1944 hatha yoga report of a personal experience stated that he was prescribed a group of asanas calculated to bring a rich supply of blood to brain and to various parts of spinal cord and a series of reconditioning asanas to stretch bend and twist spinal cord followed when he was strong enough by meditation asanas bernard named purpose of hatha yoga as to gain control of breath to enable pranayama to work something that in his view required thorough use of six purifications asanas work in different ways from conventional physical exercises according to satyananda saraswati placing physical body in positions that cultivate awareness relaxation and concentration leslie writes in yoga anatomy that from one point of view all of asana practice can be viewed as a methodical way of freeing up spine limbs and breathing so that yogi can spend extended periods of time in a seated position iyengar observed that practice of asanas brings steadiness health and lightness of limb a steady and pleasant posture produces mental equilibrium and prevents fickleness of mind he adds that they bring agility balance endurance and great vitality developing body to a fine physique which is strong and elastic without being muscle bound but iyengar states their real importance is way they train mind conquer ing body and making it a fit vehicle for spirit names of asanas illustrating spiritual evolution asana level vishnu s couch salute to sun gods virabhadra matsyendra heroes sages dog mammals pigeon birds cobra reptiles fish frog locust invertebrates tree plants mountain inanimate iyengar saw it as significant that asanas are named after plants insects fish and amphibians reptiles birds and quadrupeds as well as legendary heroes sages and avatars of hindu gods in his view illustrating spiritual evolution for instance lion pose simhasana recalls myth of narasimha half man half lion and an avatar of vishnu as told in bhagavata purana message is iyengar explains that while performing asanas yogi takes form of different creatures from lowest to highest not despising any for he knows that throughout whole gamut of creation there breathes same universal spirit through mastery of asanas iyengar states dualities like gain and loss or fame and shame disappear sjoman argues that concept of stretching in yoga can be looked at through one of patanjali s yoga sutras 2 47 which says that asanas are achieved by loosening effort and meditating on endless ananta sjoman points out that this physical loosening is to do with mind s letting go of restrictions allowing natural state of unhindered perfect balance to emerge he notes that one can only relax through effort as only a muscle that is worked is able to relax that is there is a distinction between dormancy and relaxation thus asanas had a spiritual purpose serving to explore conscious and mind exercise since mid 20th century asanas have been used especially in western world as physical exercise in this context their overtly hindu purpose is masked but its ecstatic transcendent possibly subversive elements remain that context has led to a division of opinion among christians some asserting that it is acceptable as long as they are aware of yoga s origins others stating that hatha yoga s purpose is inherently hindu making christian yoga an evident contradiction or indeed diametrically opposed to christianity a similar debate has taken place in a muslim context under crown prince mohammed bin salman yoga formerly banned as a hindu practice has been legalised while mainly hindu bali has held a yoga competition in defiance of a ruling by indonesia s muslim ulema council in a secular context journalists nell frizzell and reni eddo lodge have debated in guardian whether western yoga classes represent cultural appropriation in frizzell s view yoga has become a new entity a long way from yoga sutras of patanjali and while some practitioners are culturally insensitive others treat it with more respect eddo lodge agrees that western yoga is far from patanjali but argues that changes cannot be undone whether people use it as a holier than thou tool as a tactic to balance out excessive drug use or practised similarly to its origins with spirituality that comes with it from a hindu perspective practice of asanas in western world as physical exercise is sometimes seen as yoga that has lost its way in 2012 hindu american foundation ran a take back yoga campaign to emphasise yoga s roots in hinduism for women thumb seal posture from mary bagot stack s building body beautiful 1931 it closely resembles locust pose she had learnt some asanas in india in 1912 in west yoga is practiced mainly by women for example in britain in 1970s women formed between 70 and 90 percent of most yoga classes as well as most of yoga teachers it has been suggested that yoga was seen as a support for women in face of male dominated medicine offering an alternative approach for chronic medical conditions as well as to beauty and ageing and it offered a way of meeting other women singleton notes that women in yoga are in tradition of mollie bagot stack s 1930 league of health and beauty influenced by stack s visit to india in 1912 when she learnt some asanas and in turn of genevieve stebbins s harmonic gymnastics effects muscle usage a 2014 study indicated that different asanas activated particular groups of muscles varying with skill of practitioners from beginner to instructor eleven asanas in surya namaskar sequences a and b of ashtanga vinyasa yoga were performed by beginners advanced practitioners and instructors activation of 14 groups of muscles was measured with electrodes on skin over muscles among findings beginners used pectoral muscles more than instructors whereas instructors used deltoid muscles more than other practitioners as well as which stabilises knee yoga instructor grace bullock writes that such patterns of activation suggest that asana practice increases awareness of body and patterns in which muscles are engaged making exercise more beneficial and safer claimed benefits medieval hatha yoga texts make a variety of claims for benefits brought by asanas both spiritual and physical hatha yoga pradipika hyp states that asanas in general described as first auxiliary of hatha yoga give steadiness good health and lightness of limb hyp 1 17 specific asanas it claims bring additional benefits for example matsyendrasana awakens kundalini and makes semen steady hyp 1 27 paschimottanasana stokes up digestive fire slims belly and gives good health hyp 1 29 shavasana takes away fatigue and relaxes mind hyp 1 32 siddhasana bursts open door to liberation hyp 1 35 while padmasana destroys all diseases hyp 1 47 and if done together with retention of breath in pranayama confers liberation hyp 1 44 49 these claims lie within a tradition across all forms of yoga that practitioners can gain supernatural powers but with ambivalence about their usefulness since they may obstruct progress towards liberation hemachandra s yogashastra 1 8 9 lists magical powers which include healing destruction of poisons ability to become as small as an atom or to go wherever one wishes invisibility and shape shifting thumb indian minister for women and child development maneka gandhi joining a programme of yoga for pregnant women in 2018 asanas have been popularised in western world by claims about their health benefits attained not by medieval hatha yoga magic but by physical and psychological effects of exercise and stretching on body history of such claims was reviewed by william j broad in his 2012 book science of yoga broad argues that while health claims for yoga began as hindu nationalist posturing it turns out that there is ironically a wealth of real benefits physically practice of asanas has been claimed to improve flexibility strength and balance to alleviate stress and anxiety and to reduce symptoms of lower back pain claims have been made about beneficial effects on specific conditions such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes there is evidence that practice of asanas improves birth outcomes and physical health and quality of life measures in elderly and reduces sleep disturbances and hypertension iyengar yoga is effective at least in short term for both neck pain and low back pain contraindications national institutes of health notes that yoga is generally safe when performed properly though people with some health conditions older people and pregnant woman may need to seek advice for example people with glaucoma are advised not to practise inverted postures yoga journal provides separate lists of asanas that it states are inadvisable and should be avoided or modified for each of following medical conditions asthma back injury carpal tunnel syndrome diarrhoea headache heart problems high blood pressure insomnia knee injury low blood pressure menstruation neck injury pregnancy and shoulder injury practice of asanas has sometimes been advised against during pregnancy but that advice has been contested by a 2015 study which found no ill effects from any of 26 asanas investigated study examined effects of set of asanas on 25 healthy women who were between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant authors noted that apart from their experimental findings they had been unable to find any scientific evidence that supported previously published concerns and that on contrary there was evidence including from systematic review that yoga was suitable for pregnant women with a variety of possible benefits common practices thumb upright yoga sutras 2 46 state that asanas here natarajasana should be steady and comfortable in yoga sutras only rule patanjali suggests for practicing asana is that it be steady and comfortable body is held poised with practitioner experiencing no discomfort when control of body is mastered practitioners are believed to free themselves from dualities such as heat and cold hunger and satiety or joy and grief this is first step toward relieving suffering by letting go of attachment traditional and modern guidance different schools of yoga such as iyengar and yoga institute agree that asanas are best practised with a rested body on an empty stomach after having a bath from point of view of sports medicine asanas function as active stretches helping to protect muscles from injury these need to be performed equally on both sides stronger side first if used for physical rehabilitation surya namaskar thumb adho mukha svanasana downward facing dog pose is performed at least once and often twice in

sets of series second set moving opposing leg first asanas include adho mukha svanasana downward dog others differing from tradition to tradition with for instance a choice of urdhva mukha svanasana upward dog or cobra for one pose in sequence schools too differ in their approaches to sequence for example in iyengar yoga variations such as inserting i and are suggested styles in western world asanas are taught in differing styles by various schools of yoga some poses like trikonasana are common to many of them but not always performed in same way some independently documented approaches are described below thumb upright 1 5 utthitha trikonasana an important pose in iyengar yoga using a prop a yoga brick pose requires practitioner to work different parts of body in different directions iyengar yoga emphasises precision and alignment and prioritises correct movement over quantity i e moving a little in right direction is preferred to moving more but in a wrong direction postures are held for a relatively long period compared to other schools of yoga this allows muscles to relax and lengthen and encourages awareness in pose props including belts blocks and blankets are freely used to assist students in correct working in asanas beginners are introduced early on to standing poses executed with careful attention to detail for example in trikonasana feet are often jumped apart to a wide stance forward foot is turned out and centre of forward heel is exactly aligned with centre of arch of other foot sivananda yoga practices asanas hatha yoga as part of raja yoga with goal of enabling practitioners to sit in meditation for a long time there is little emphasis on detail of individual poses teachers rely on basic instructions given in books by sivananda and swami vishnu in trikonasana top arm may be stretched forward parallel to floor rather than straight up sivananda yoga identifies a group of 12 asanas as basic these are not necessarily easiest poses nor those that every class would include trikonasana is last of 12 whereas in other schools it is one of first and used to loosen hips in preparation for other poses thumb upright 0 8 left eka pada bakasana one legged crane an asana in ashtanga vinyasa yoga s advanced series in ashtanga vinyasa yoga poses are executed differently from iyengar yoga vinyasa means flowing and poses are executed relatively rapidly flowing continuously from one asana to next using defined transitional movements asanas are grouped into six series one primary one intermediate and four advanced practice begins and ends with chanting of mantras followed by multiple cycles of sun salutation which forms foundation of ashtanga yoga practice and then one of series ashtanga vinyasa practice emphasises aspects of yoga other than asanas including focus points bandhas energy locks and pranayama kripalu yoga uses teachers from other asana traditions focussing on mindfulness rather than using effort in poses teachers may say allow your arms to float up rather than bring up your arms goal is to use asanas as a path of transformation approach is in three stages firstly instruction in body alignment and awareness of breath during pose secondly holding pose long enough to observe unconscious patterns of tension in body mind and thirdly through deep concentration and total surrender allowing oneself to be moved by prana in trikonasana teacher may direct pupils attention to pressing down with outer edge of back foot lifting arch of foot and then experimenting with micro movements exploring where energy moves and how it feels thumb bikram choudhury leading a bikram yoga class in in bikram yoga as developed by bikram choudhury there is a fixed sequence of 26 poses in which trikonasana is ninth its task to focus on opening hips bikram version of trikonasana is a different pose parsvakonasana from that in iyengar yoga position of feet is seen as critically important along with proper breathing and distribution of weight about 30 on back foot 70 on front foot apart from brands many independent teachers for example in britain offer an unbranded hatha yoga types of asana asanas can
