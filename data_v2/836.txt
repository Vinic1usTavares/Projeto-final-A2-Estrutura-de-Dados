hms brilliant was a 36 gun fifth rate frigate of british royal navy that saw active service during seven years war with france she performed well against french navy in 1760 battle of bishops court and 1761 battle of cape finisterre but was less capable when deployed for bombardment duty off enemy ports she also captured eight french privateers and sank two more during her six years at sea royal navy decommissioned brilliant in 1763 navy sold her in 1776 and she became a mercantile vessel for british east india company eic brilliant she wrecked in august 1782 on comoro islands while transporting troops to india design and construction 150px thumb left sir thomas slade naval architect for brilliant in 1756 design thomas slade surveyor of navy and former master shipwright at deptford dockyard was designer of venus class of 36 gun frigates alongside their smaller cousin 32 gun southampton class venus class represented an experiment in ship design fast medium sized and heavily armed capable of overhauling smaller craft and single handedly engaging enemy cruisers or large privateers as a further innovation slade borrowed from contemporary french ship design by removing lower deck gun ports and locating ship s cannons solely on upper deck this permitted carrying of heavier ordinance without substantial increase in hull size that would have been required to keep lower gun ports consistently above waterline lower deck carried additional stores enabling venus class frigates to remain at sea for longer periods without resupply designed in 1756 and launched following year venus was one of first royal navy vessels to be built to a classic frigate design with a single gun deck and an emphasis on speed her principal role was that of a hunter of french privateers one naval historian has described venus class frigates including brilliant as best british fighting cruisers of their day however they remained slightly inferior to her french equivalents in both speed and weight of ordinance admiralty approved venus class design on 13 july 1756 and ordered three ships efn other venus class vessels were and brilliant was last of these and only one to be constructed at plymouth dockyard construction thomas bucknall navy s master shipwright at plymouth oversaw construction which commenced with laying of keel on 28 august 1756 vessel was formally named brilliant on 17 march 1757 a 1755 admiralty review of plymouth dockyard had found it inefficient poorly staffed and suffering from notorious neglect admiralty minutes 27 february 1755 cited in middleton 1988 p 111 but work on brilliant proceeded apace and she was completed by early october 1757 crew her designated complement was 240 men comprising four commissioned officers a captain and three lieutenants overseeing 50 warrant and petty officers 108 naval ratings 44 marines and 34 servants and other ranks among these other ranks were five positions reserved for widow s men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to families of sailors who died at sea armament brilliants principal armament consisted of 26 cast iron twelve pound cannons located along her upper deck guns were specifically constructed with short barrels as traditional twelve pound cannons were too long to fit within frigate s narrow beam each cannon weighed with a gun barrel length of compared with their equivalent in larger royal navy vessels twelve pounder guns were supported by ten six pounder guns eight on quarterdeck and two on forecastle each weighing with a barrel length of taken together twelve pound and six pound cannons provided a broadside weight of she was also equipped with twelve 1 2 pound swivel guns for anti personnel use these swivel guns were mounted in fixed positions on quarterdeck and forecastle royal navy service thumb 150px left sir hyde parker captain of brilliant from 1757 to 1759 by george romney c 1782 privateer hunter brilliant was commissioned in october 1757 under command of post captain hyde parker and entering navy service during early stages of seven years war against france her first engagement was on 19 december 1757 when in company with 28 gun she encountered french privateer diamond a contemporary report described quebec built diamond as a very fine vessel of 200 tons burthen carrying 14 carriage guns and a cargo of furs diamond opened fire on brilliant as she approached but before british could retaliate french vessel exploded and sank detonation was assumed to have been caused by sparks flying back from privateer s guns and igniting her powder magazine only 24 of diamonds 70 crew survived explosion these men were hauled aboard brilliant and coventry as prisoners of war on 24 december brilliant and coventry encountered their second privateer 24 gun le dragon there was a brief exchange of fire in which four french sailors were killed and up to 12 wounded against six wounded men aboard coventry after outgunned french vessel struck her colours british took her surviving 280 crew prisoner on following day a third french ship hove into view intrepid a 14 gun snow rigged privateer after a short chase she fell within range of brilliants guns french fired first wounding one british sailor responding broadside from brilliant capsized intrepid and killed ten men among her crew of 120 survivors were taken prisoner aboard brilliant and handed over to british authorities at plymouth in march 1758 brilliant alone captured two more french vessels 20 gun privateer le nymphe and 12 gun le vengeur on 8 april these two captured vessels were sailed to plymouth coastal raids in late 1758 brilliant joined a royal navy squadron supporting amphibious raids along french coastline in company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in battle of saint cast on 11 september 1758 progenitor of royal geographic society james rennell was a midshipman aboard brilliant during this period and produced his first coastal map while frigate was stationed off saint cast brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach shore by afternoon of battle she was close enough to beach for her crew to witness surrounding and defeat of british grenadier guards but was too distant to range her guns onto their french assailants brilliant resumed her privateer hunting in spring of 1759 on 17 april she encountered and forced surrender of 22 gun french vessel basque around west of cape clear as with previous privateer captures captured french ship and her crew were taken to plymouth and handed over to navy authorities captain parker left brilliant in 1759 having been promoted to captaincy of 74 gun command of brilliant temporarily transferred to captain john lendrick with frigate assigned to a squadron under admiral george rodney for a coastal raid on le havre raid took place on 3 july with brilliant acting to protect squadron s bomb vessels and transport ships from some distance offshore lendrick was subsequently replaced by james logie who remained with brilliant until she was decommissioned in 1763 battle of bishops court 250px right thumb battle of bishops court 1760 brilliant is partly obscured at centre rear by james davie 1780 battle of bishops court was a shift in brilliants focus from capturing french privateers to direct engagement with an enemy naval squadron between 21 and 26 february 1760 a force of three french vessels 44 gun marechal de belle isle 36 gun blonde and 30 gun terpsichore arrived off coast of ireland under command of privateer francois thurot they landed 600 french troops and captured town of carrickfergus thurot held town for five days brilliant and her sister ship were in port at kinsale in southern ireland and were sent north to intercept thurot s force while at sea they were joined by whose captain john elliott assumed overall command of squadron three royal navy frigates reached dublin on morning of 26 february but bad weather prevented them from entering belfast lough on same day thurot re embarked his troops and put to sea evading british vessels and seeking to return south to france after two days of searching three royal navy frigates encountered thurot s forces at 4 a m on 28 february between mull of galloway and isle of man a general chase ensued with brilliant overhauling 36 gun blonde and engaging her in battle at around 9 a m off shore from isle of man blonde quickly surrendered as did terpsichore which had been fired upon by pallas thurot s flagship marechal de belle isle fought on alone against all three royal navy vessels with her crew making repeated attempts to board and seize aeolus after ninety minutes of close combat thurot was killed by a shot through neck and marechal de belle isle was so battered from cannon fire that she began to sink her surviving crew surrendered and were taken prisoner brilliant pallas and aeolus then anchored off isle of man to repair damage to their rigging and masts before sailing for portsmouth with their prizes french had suffered 300 casualties in battle a further 1000 men were taken prisoner including both soldiers and crew british casualties were small with aeolus suffering four killed and 15 wounded pallas one killed and five wounded and brilliant escaping with no deaths and 11 men wounded battle of cape finisterre 250px left thumb battle of cape finisterre 1761 brilliant is engaged with maliceuse and hermione at far right from a painting by h fletcher c 1890 on 14 august 1761 brilliant was accompanying 74 gun from lisbon to england when they encountered courageux a 74 gun french ship of line and two frigates and hermione after some maneuvering british and french squadrons finally engaged with each other at 6 00 a m on morning of 14 august off shore from cape finisterre bellona opened fire on while brilliant engaged maliceuse and hermione through skillful sailing logie was able to keep both french frigates at bay and unable to assist courageux which surrendered to bellona after ninety minutes of fighting at 7 30 a m maliceuse and hermione made sail and retreated with brilliant too damaged to give chase british losses in battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on brilliant on french side losses on courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded historian william laird clowes has suggested that much higher french casualty rate was result of differences in tactics french gun crews trained to fire at masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable it ahead of a boarding attempt by contrast british crews were trained to fire into hulls of enemy ships later service there were several small victories for brilliant throughout 1761 with capture of 6 gun privateers le and le curieux from st malo and 8 gun la from bayonne after a period spent refitting at portsmouth in january 1763 brilliant was sailed to dublin to assist in clearing stores and transporting crew from 66 gun which was in port after being damaged at sea later that year she had her final victory at sea overhauling and forcing surrender of small 8 gun privateer l esperance war with france was by now drawing to a close and in march 1763 logie brought brilliant to deptford dockyard where she was decommissioned and her crew paid off to join other vessels east india company and loss brilliant remained at deptford until 1776 when navy offered her for sale as surplus to navy requirements sir william james purchased her on 1 november 1776 for sum of he retained her name and converted her into an east indiaman in 1781 captain charles mears sailed brilliant on 5 may

when she struck and heavily damaged under command of captain horatio nelson which was anchored off kentish coast seven months later on 28 august while transporting troops to india she struck a rock off johanna in comoro islands and was lost majority of crew survived wreck but more than 100 soldiers and three officers from 15th hanoverian regiment drowned legacy naval historian william clowes described venus class frigates including brilliant as best british fighting cruisers of days before accession of george iii even so they were slower than their french counterparts having been built of much heavier timbers and with less flexible joints this proved to be a substantial defect for a vessel designed for chase in 1759 royal navy captain william hotham described a captured french frigate of equivalent size as having quite advantage on aeolus or brilliant in speed and admiralty generally regarded brilliant and her sister ships as superior only as convoy escorts and in short range engagements admiralty board also considered brilliant too lightly armed for her size she measured an additional 50 tons burthen over a standard 32 gun frigate but carried only four more cannon for these reasons brilliant was last vessel to be built in venus class subsequent generations of royal navy frigates preserved elements of her design but with an extended hull to allow for additional gun
