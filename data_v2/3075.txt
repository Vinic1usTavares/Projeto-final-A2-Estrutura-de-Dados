thought bubble conveys thoughts of figure while ben day dots echo effect of mechanized printing process it is one of most representative paintings of pop art movement and part of museum of modern art s permanent collection since 1971 painting is considered among lichtenstein s most significant works perhaps on a par with his acclaimed 1963 diptych whaam drowning girl has been described as a masterpiece of melodrama and is one of artist s earliest images depicting women in tragic situations a theme to which he often returned in mid 1960s painting shows a teary eyed woman on a turbulent sea she is emotionally distressed seemingly from a romance a thought bubble reads i don t care i d rather sink than call brad for help this narrative element highlights cliched melodrama while its graphics reiterate lichtenstein s theme of painterly work imitating mechanized reproduction work is derived from a 1962 dc comics panel while also borrowing from hokusai s great wave off kanagawa and from elements of modernist artists jean arp and joan miro it is one of several lichtenstein works that mention a character named brad who is absent from picture both graphical and narrative elements of work are cropped from source image background during late 1950s and early 1960s a number of american painters began to adapt imagery and motifs of comic strips roy lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958 andy warhol produced his earliest paintings in style in 1960 lichtenstein unaware of warhol s work produced look mickey and popeye in 1961 although warhol had produced of comic strips and of other pop art subjects he supposedly relegated himself to campbell s soup cans as a subject at time to avoid competing with more finished style of comics by lichtenstein he once said i ve got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from lichtenstein and james rosenquist that will be very personal that won t look like i m doing exactly what they re doing thumb left alt a black and white portrait photograph of a man at bust length facing and looking at viewer while wearing a turtleneck shirt under a blazer all in front of a painting in 1961 roy lichtenstein s cartoon work advanced from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and wartime armed forces drowning girl depicted advancement of lichtenstein s cartoon work which represented his 1961 departure from his abstract expressionism period from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and wartime armed forces lichtenstein said that at time i was very excited about and very interested in highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love hate war etc in these cartoon images lichtenstein parodied four picassos between 1962 and 1963 picasso s depictions of weeping women may have influenced lichtenstein to produce portrayals of vulnerable teary eyed women such as subjects of hopeless and drowning girl another possible influence on his emphasis on depicting distressed women in early to mid 1960s was that his first marriage was dissolving at time lichtenstein s first marriage to isabel wilson which resulted in two sons lasted from 1949 to 1965 couple separated in 1963 when lichtenstein made his transition to comic based work he began to mimic style while adapting subject matter he applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing like techniques style he adopted was simple well framed images solid fields of bold color often bounded by thick stark border lines borrowed technique was representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated half tone screens of ben day dots used in newspaper printing pbs asserts that this is an adaptation of ligne claire style associated with herge lichtenstein once said of his technique i take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental subject of drowning girl is an example of lichtenstein s post 1963 comics based women who look hard crisp brittle and uniformly modish in appearance as if they all came out of same pot of makeup in early 1960s lichtenstein produced several fantasy drama paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable such as drowning girl hopeless and in car these works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent girls next door in a variety of tenuous emotional states in hopeless and drowning girl for example heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs with one displaying helplessness and other defiance she would rather drown than ask for her lover s help drowning girl aforementioned works and oh jeff i love you too but are among those tragedies that make author a popular draw at museums history thumb right tony abruzzo s splash page from run for love in secret hearts no 83 november 1962 was source for drowning girl drowning girl is derived from splash page from run for love illustrated by tony abruzzo and lettered by ira schnapp in secret hearts 83 november 1962 dc comics this is same comic book issue that inspired hopeless in 1963 lichtenstein was parodying various types of sources such as commercial illustrations comic imagery and even modern masterpieces masterpieces represented what could have been dubbed canon of art and was thought of as high art while low art subject matter included comic strip images his masterworks sources included likes of cezanne mondrian and picasso during this time in his career lichtenstein noted that things that i have apparently parodied i actually admire at time lichtenstein was exploring theme of industrialization of emotion in lichtenstein s obituary los angeles times critic christopher knight said work was a witty rejoinder to de kooning s famously brushy paintings of women his comic romances often depicted stereotypical representations of thwarted passions although lichtenstein foundation website claims that lichtenstein did not begin using his opaque projector technique until fall of 1963 lichtenstein described his process for producing comics based art including drowning girl when lichtenstein had his first solo show at leo castelli gallery in new york city in february 1962 it sold out before opening in addition to drowning girl exhibition included look mickey engagement ring blam and refrigerator show ran from february 10 through march 3 1962 according to lichtenstein foundation website drowning girl was part of lichtenstein s first exhibition at ferus gallery in los angeles from april 1 april 27 1963 featuring masterpiece portrait of madame cezanne and other works from 1962 and 1963 it was also part of his second solo exhibition at leo castelli gallery from september 28 october 24 1963 that included torpedo los baseball manager in car conversation and whaam marketing materials for show included lithograph crak museum of modern art acquired drowning girl in 1971 and their webpage for this work credits philip johnson and mr and mrs bagley wright for acquisition description some sources describe subjects of lichtenstein s tragic girls series as heroines in sense that they are counterparts to heroes and others do not in sense that they are not heroic drowning girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in to power of ocean than call for aid lichtenstein s version of scene eliminates everything but sea and a few body parts of subject her head shoulder and hand which are barely above water as her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them because lichtenstein only presents a single frame viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it furthermore viewer has no way to know who brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him according to grove encyclopedia of american art most important element of lichtenstein s procedure in early 1960s was enlargement and unification of his source material although according to some sources changes made to produce drowning girl are not regarded as significant lichtenstein made several notable changes from original source in original illustration drowning girl s boyfriend appears in background clinging to a capsized boat lichtenstein cropped image dramatically showing girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave he changed caption from i don t care if i have a cramp to i don t care and boyfriend s name from mal to brad with former narrative change lichtenstein removed evidence that drowning girl has a cramp in her leg with latter narrative change lichtenstein attempted to change perception of boyfriend when discussing another work i know brad lichtenstein stated that name brad sounded heroic to him and was used with aim of cliched oversimplification lichtenstein s method entailed strengthening of formal aspects of composition a stylization of motif and a freezing of both emotion and actions although comic book panels depict a moment in time drowning girl is borrowed from an example of a comic book panel depiction of a moment relatively more pregnant with past and future dependent drama than most moments this work also marks a phase in lichtenstein s career when many of his works were given present titles such as sleeping girl crying girl and blonde waiting which accentuates works relation to process and action according to grove encyclopedia of american art during this phase of lichtenstein s career a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to cheerful lightness of lichtenstein s work as balanced completely harmonious composition left thumb narrative content of drowning girl narrative content was in forefront of much of lichtenstein s work as a means to engage viewer measuring 171 6 cm x 169 5 cm 67 625 in x 66 75 in drowning girl presents a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river literally drowning in emotion according to janis hendrickson melodrama makes it clear that she has been hurt by a brad name given to several of lichtenstein s heroes vian borchert says that caption makes it clear that subject is practically drowning in a sea of tears in typical lichtenstein fashion tragic female is presented in a suspended state of distress according to janis hendrickson subject s head appears to rest on a wave as if it were a pillow and lies in water as if it were a bed creating a blend of eroticism and final resting place waters of sea swirl around subject s waves of hair creating perception of a whirlpool painting is representative of lichtenstein s affinity for single frame drama that reduces viewer s ability to identify with it and that abstracts emotion his use of industrial and mechanical appearance further trivialize sentiments although painterly touches add to its simplification general context in early 1960s lichtenstein s theme of comics based work was hotly debated in a 1963 new york times article brian o doherty wrote that lichtenstein s work was not art saying lichtenstein was one of worst artists in america who briskly went about making a sow s ear out of a sow s ear this was part of a widespread debate about merits of lichtenstein s comic blow ups as true art in january 1964 life ran a story under title is he worst artist in u s on this controversy later reviews were much kinder todd brewster noted that this may have been motivated by popular demand he told life in 1986 that those cartoon may have disturbed critics but collectors tired of solemnity of abstract expressionism were ready for some comic relief why couldn t funny pages be fine art his work is now widely accepted although some criticize him for borrowing from comics without attributing original creators paying royalties or seeking permission from copyright holders david has dedicated decades to identifying all of lichtenstein s source materials and has posted more than 1 000 images on flickr detailing lichtenstein s unrecognized sources some critics question lichtenstein s artistic skills everett kinstler said that despite lichtenstein s association with romance comics in his day no comics publisher would have hired lichtenstein he wasn t good enough kinstler said lichtenstein lacked ability to portray emotional range of story through facial expressions and body language independently reception thumb lichtenstein acknowledges that wave is adapted from great wave off kanagawa famous woodblock print by hokusai drowning girl was painted at apex of lichtenstein s use of enlarged dots cropping and magnification of original source in 1993 solomon r guggenheim museum curator diane waldman noted that lichtenstein made drowning girl a cornerstone of his career because of his extraordinary sense of organization his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an pattern according to 2007 edition of oxford dictionary of american art and artists work is a mix of cliche melodrama pathos and absurdity in 1995 art scholar jonathan fineberg called it a remarkably impassive style image is typical of lichtenstein s depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a cliched manner lichtenstein s tinkering with source material resulted in a recomposition with sharper focus after he eliminated several elements that distract from depiction of woman such as capsized boat troubled male subject and general seascape result lanchner wrote was swirling swooping waves and animate white foam that envelope subject with a pictorial buoyancy that form an aquatic continuum drowning girl presents an acknowledgement to flamboyant of art nouveau waves are intended to recall hokusai as well as biomorphic forms of arp and miro just as source comics may have intended to lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between original comic book source panel and hokusai s great wave off kanagawa making this work a bridge between two adaptation of wave print is said to add a decorative look and feel to painting without which work might be much more alarming to viewer lichtenstein even made connection between drowning girl s arabesque waves and art nouveau aesthetic regarding this work lichtenstein stated tojner describes work as lichtenstein s finest formulation of a counter image to many explosions in his universe noting that drama is past its peak although it may seem to be at a crescendo he also notes that tears are drawn with classic lichtenstein waxy fullness despite surrounding water which must be significant since naturalistic justification is absent a november 1963 art magazine review stated that this was one of broad and powerful paintings of 1963 exhibition at castelli s gallery nonetheless name of work was not universally known in art magazine s review of his 1964 castelli gallery show lichtenstein was referred to as author of i don t care i d rather sink drowning girl in 2005 gary garrels of museum of modern art wrote that work is a poetics of utterly banal of displaced ordinariness resulting in an image frozen in time and space making it iconic comparing this to source garrels says it is a rendering in a simplified vocabulary produced while lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity according to grove encyclopedia of american art extreme examples of his formalization become virtual abstraction when viewer recalls that motif is an element of a larger work thus lichtenstein reinforced a non realist view of comic strips and advertisements presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques lichtenstein s magnification of his source material stressed plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial america nonetheless lichtenstein appears to have accepted american capitalist industrial culture in 2003 sarah rich and joyce henri robinson contrasted lichtenstein s ben day dots use in drowning girl with another artist s work noting that work satirizes melodrama of soap operas and serial comics turning drama of title figure s potential suicide into a high camp performance in 2009 lanchner wrote of how lichtenstein s translation of a highly charged content with coolly handled presentation intensified contrast between two many sources describe whaam and drowning girl as lichtenstein s most famous works daily mail listed it along with whaam and oh jeff i love you too but as one of his most famous at time of its 2013 lichtenstein retrospective display at tate modern it is also regarded as one of his most influential works along with whaam and look mickey john museum of modern art chief curator noted that 2004 moma in berlin exhibition held during museum s renovation was a synoptic overview of 20th century art highlights from 212 piece exhibition according to various publications such as new york times and artnet were van gogh s starry night matisse s dance and lichtenstein s drowning girl all of which were touring outside united states for first time drowning girl was part of largest ever retrospective of lichtenstein

huffington post described drowning girl as lichtenstein s masterpiece of melodrama danish art critic and louisiana museum of modern art director poul erik tojner called work an example of lichtenstein s post coital perdition pieces describing it as star witness of this genre of his works he notes that subject is reaching far flung depths as she acts out of pride tojner perceived eroticism in this painting likening open mouth to a vaginal feature and noting singularity of lichtenstein using an open mouth with that in mind he compares tears to ejaculate residue see also 1963 in art notes
