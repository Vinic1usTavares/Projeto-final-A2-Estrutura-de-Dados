activates warning that his modifications are irreversible meanwhile team must contend with aliens from crashed fighter mckay figures out that there is no way to guide alternate reality drive but that they can return to their original reality by reversing drive and jumping back through realities they had visited before they use maneuvering thrusters to stabilize ship s orbit above red giant and

breach in ship s hull and are picked up by lorne kavan smith after daedalus disappears in end mckay is shown working on fixing alternate reality drive despite sheppard s admonishments production original concept of an episode involving alternate realities was a room in atlantis that shifts into alternate realities however idea had several issues including possibility of no atlantis in one reality so robert c cooper suggested using daedalus final draft of daedalus variations was completed on february 11 on february 12 prosthetics meeting for episode as well as seed broken ties and whispers took place which most likely involved unknown aliens featured from episode appearance of aliens was revealed in advertisement for episode on july 27 in an interview with episode writer alan mccullough he described episode as a great team show and a visual effects spectacular on march 10 captain sobol was cast sobol was alternate commander of daedalus rather than colonel caldwell mitch pileggi by time episode aired sobol was female portrayed by tracy waterhouse she held rank of colonel instead and her name was spelled sobel much of episode was filmed on daedalus set due to that visual effects were required to fill in external shots episode was reportedly one of most expensive vfx budgets in series and is most expensive for season star map behind captain s chair of daedalus is usually lit green however episode s writer and supervising producer alan mccullough deliberately turned map 90 degrees and changed color from green to orange so as to make ship different from normal daedalus mccullough also stated that episode is a one off but did not rule out a return beyond fifth season he also said that he originally planned team to visit a reality where ancients won war against wraith but this idea was dropped as it would detract from main storyline episode was jason momoa s first appearance with his customised wig after he had his hair cut by time fourth season was completed for first three episodes he had it sewn back on however when sci fi wouldn t allow his hairstyle to be changed they switched to wig after momoa complained about pain of having his hair sewn on again reception daedalus variations was given a household rating of 1 3 making stargate atlantis fourth most viewed series for week on sci fi channel they were beaten by ecw on sci fi with 1 4 ghost hunters international with 1 6 and season three premiere of eureka which earned highest rating of 2 1 episode was also received generally positive tory ireland mell of ign praised episode for its reasonably short teaser thinking shorter it is better episode as well as its gripping storyline and introduction of alien race particularly fact that very little is known about them stating it was a perfect tease by writers episode was rated 9 1 out of 10 overall marx pyle of syfy portal which was since renamed airlock alpha compared episode as atlantis version of star trek next generation episode q who in respect to introduction of a new big bad for future it was praised for being a fun filler episode and pyle enjoyed scene where two converse and space battle believing only battlestar galactica could beat them however pyle criticised episode for absence of woolsey and mckay s apparent quick understanding of new technologies including alternate reality drive as well as feeling that
