shackleton rowett expedition 1921 22 was sir ernest shackleton s last antarctic project and final episode in heroic age of antarctic exploration venture financed by john quiller rowett is sometimes referred to as quest expedition after its ship quest a converted norwegian sealer shackleton had originally intended to go to arctic and explore beaufort sea but this plan was abandoned when canadian government withheld financial support shackleton thereupon switched his attention to antarctic quest smaller than any recent antarctic exploration vessel soon proved inadequate for its task and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems before expedition s work could properly begin shackleton died on board ship just after its arrival at sub antarctic island of south georgia major part of subsequent attenuated expedition was a three month cruise to eastern antarctic under leadership of party s second in command frank wild shortcomings of quest were soon in evidence slow speed heavy fuel consumption a tendency to roll in heavy seas and a steady leak ship was unable to proceed further than longitude well short of its easterly target and its engine s low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through pack ice following several fruitless attempts wild returned ship to south georgia on way visiting elephant island where he and 21 others had been stranded after sinking of ship endurance during shackleton s imperial trans antarctic expedition six years earlier wild had thoughts of a second more productive season in ice and took ship to cape town for a refit here in june 1922 he received a message from rowett ordering ship home to england so expedition ended quietly quest voyage is not greatly regarded in histories of polar exploration due to event that defines it in public memory overshadowing its other activities shackleton s untimely death background shackleton after endurance shackleton returned to britain from endurance expedition in late may 1917 while world war i was under way many of his men enlisted promptly upon their return too old to enlist shackleton nevertheless sought an active role in war effort huntford p 649 and eventually departed for murmansk with temporary army rank of major as part of a military mission to north russia shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home i feel i am no use to anyone unless i am storm in wild lands fisher p 435 he returned to england in february 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would with cooperation of north russian government develop natural resources of region fisher p 437 this scheme came to nothing as red army took control of that part of russia during russian civil war to provide himself with an income shackleton had to rely on lecture circuit during winter of 1919 20 he lectured twice a day six days a week for five months fisher p 441 canadian

turned towards another exploration venture he decided to turn away from antarctic go northwards and as he put it fill in this great blank now called beaufort sea fisher pp 442 445 this area of arctic ocean to north of alaska and west of canadian arctic archipelago was largely unexplored shackleton believed on basis of tidal records that it contained large undiscovered land masses that would be of greatest scientific interest to world apart from possible economic value shackleton also hoped to reach northern pole of inaccessibility most remote point in arctic regions wild p 2 in march 1920 his plans received general approval of royal geographical society and were supported by canadian government on this basis shackleton set about acquiring necessary funding which he estimated at ps50 000 over ps2 million at 2016 values later that year shackleton met by chance an old school friend john quiller rowett who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get shackleton started with this money in january 1921 shackleton purchased wooden norwegian whaler foca i together with other equipment and began process of hiring of a crew in may 1921 policy of canadian government towards arctic expeditions changed with advent of a new prime minister arthur meighen who withdrew support from shackleton s proposal huntford pp 680 682 shackleton was required to rethink his plans and decided to sail for antarctic instead a varied programme of exploration coastal mapping mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern ocean would replace abandoned beaufort sea venture antarctic preparation objectives thumb upright alt head and shoulders of a dark haired man looking directly to straps of a harness over his shoulders are visible sir ernest shackleton expedition s leader even before his problems with canadian government shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to beaufort sea according to rgs librarian hugh robert mill as early as march 1920 shackleton had talked about two possible schemes beaufort sea exploration and an oceanographical expedition with object of visiting all little known islands of south atlantic and south pacific mills p 287 by june 1921 latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of antarctic continent and mapping of around 2 000 miles 3 200 km of uncharted coastline it would also encompass a search for lost or wrongly charted sub antarctic islands including dougherty island and nimrod islands harrington p 1 and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands a scientific research program would include a visit to gough island and an investigation of a possible underwater continental connection between africa and america shackleton s biographer margery fisher calls plan diffuse and far too comprehensive for one small body of men to tackle within two years fisher pp 446 49 while according to roland huntford expedition had no obvious goal and was only too clearly a piece of improvisation a pretext for shackleton to get away fisher describes expedition as representing dividing line between what has become known as heroic age of antarctic exploration and mechanical age shackleton called voyage pioneering referring specifically to aeroplane that was taken but ultimately not used on expedition in fact this was only one of technological firsts that marked venture there were gadgets in profusion ship s crow s nest was electrically heated there were heated overalls for lookouts a wireless set and a device called an which could trace and chart ship s route automatically photography was to figure prominently and a large and expensive outfit of cameras machines and general photographic appliances was acquired frank wild quoted in leif mills p 289 among oceanographical research equipment was a lucas deep sea sounding machine wild p 13 this ample provision arose from sponsorship of rowett who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking to cover costs of entire expedition mills pp 287 88 extent of rowett s contribution is not recorded in an undated prospectus for southern expedition shackleton had estimated total cost as about ps100 000 whatever total rowett appears to have funded lion s share enabling frank wild to record later that unique among antarctic expeditions of era this one returned home without any outstanding debt wild preface huntford p 693 records that rowett estimated that expedition had cost him ps70 000 according to wild without rowett s actions expedition would have been impossible his generous attitude is more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return and what he did was in interest of scientific research and from friendship with shackleton his only recognition was attachment of his name to title of expedition rowett was according to huntford a stodgy prosaic looking businessman huntford p 682 who was in 1920 a co founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in aberdeen known as rowett research institute now part of university of aberdeen he had also endowed dental research work at

huntford describes her as straight stemmed with an awkward square rig and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas fisher reports that she was built in 1917 weighed 204 tons and had a large and spacious deck difference in figures provided by huntford and fisher may represent distinction between tonnage a measure of volume and displacement a measure of weight although she had some modern facilities such as electric lights in cabins huntford shackleton voyages p 259 she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages shackleton on first day out observed that in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even storm mills pp 287 90 leif mills in his biography of frank wild says that had ship been taken to beaufort sea in accordance with shackleton s original plans she would probably have been crushed in arctic pack ice on her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns requiring repairs at every port of call personnel times had reported that shackleton planned to take a dozen men to arctic chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier expeditions in fact quest left london for south with 20 men of whom eight were old endurance comrades another james dell was a veteran from discovery 20 years previously fisher p 464 some of endurance hands had not been fully paid from earlier expedition but were prepared to join shackleton again out of personal loyalty another shackleton

marr wrote in his diary that it was as though all london had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell shackleton s original intention was to sail down to cape town visiting main south atlantic islands on way from cape town quest would head for enderby land coast of antarctica where once in ice it would explore coastline towards coats land in weddell sea at end of summer season ship would visit south georgia before returning to cape town for refitting and preparation for second year s work ship s performance in early stages of voyage disrupted this schedule serious problems with engine necessitated a week s stay in lisbon and further stops in madeira and cape verde islands mills pp 292 93 these delays and slow speed of ship led shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely visits to south atlantic islands and instead he turned ship towards rio de janeiro where engine could receive a thorough overhaul quest reached rio on 22 november 1921 engine overhaul and replacement of a damaged topmast wild p 44 delayed party in rio for four weeks this meant that it was no longer practical to proceed to cape town and then on to ice shackleton decided to sail directly to grytviken harbour in south georgia fisher pp 466 67 equipment and stores that had been sent on to cape town would have to be sacrificed but shackleton hoped that this shortfall could

subdued and listless he also began drinking champagne each morning to pain contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea a severe storm ruined expedition s proposed christmas celebrations and a new problem with engine s steam furnace slowed progress and caused shackleton further stress fisher pp 473 476 by 1 january 1922 weather had abated rest and calm after storm year has begun kindly for us wrote shackleton in his diary on 4 january south georgia was sighted and late that morning quest anchored at grytviken after visiting whaling establishment ashore shackleton returned to ship apparently refreshed he told frank wild that they would celebrate their deferred christmas next day and retired to his cabin to write his diary fisher pp 476 477 old smell of dead whale permeates everything he wrote it is a strange and curious place a wonderful evening in darkening twilight i saw a lone star hover gem like above bay later he slept and was heard snoring by surgeon mcilroy who had just finished his watch keeping duty shortly after 02 00 on morning of 5 january macklin who had taken over watch was summoned to shackleton s cabin he found shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia and asking for a painkilling drug in a brief discussion macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things and needed to lead a more regular life macklin records shackleton as saying you re always wanting me to give up things what is it i ought to give up macklin replied chiefly alcohol boss i don t think it agrees with you immediately afterwards shackleton had a very severe paroxysm during which he died macklin diary quoted by fisher p 477 huntford p 690 death certificate signed by macklin gave cause as atheroma of coronary arteries and heart failure in modern terms coronary thrombosis later that morning wild now in command gave news to shocked crew and told them that expedition would carry on wild p 66 body was brought ashore for embalming before

leader wild had to arrange where expedition should now go kerr reported that a longstanding problem with ship s furnace was manageable and after supplementing stores and equipment wild decided to proceed generally in accordance with shackleton s original intentions he would take ship eastward towards bouvet island and then beyond before turning south to enter ice as close as possible to enderby land and begin coastal survey work there expedition would also investigate an appearance of land in mouth of weddell sea reported by james clark ross in 1842 but not seen since ultimately progress would depend on weather ice conditions and capabilities of ship wild pp 73 75 78 79 quest left south georgia on 18 january heading south east towards south sandwich islands there was a heavy swell such that overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below waves filling waist with water wild pp 82 87 as they proceeded wild wrote that quest rolled like a log leaked and required regular pumping was heavy on coal consumption and was slow all these factors led him to change his plan at end of january bouvet island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to edge of pack ice on 4 february wild pp 88 91 98 now little quest can really try her mettle wrote wild as ship entered loose pack wild pp 98 99 he noted that quest was smallest ship ever to attempt to penetrate heavy antarctic ice and pondered on fate of others shall we escape or will quest join ships in davy jones s locker during days that followed as they moved southward in falling temperatures

was no more successful than before wild p 132 on 24 february after a series of further efforts had failed wild set a course westward across mouth of weddell sea towards elephant island where wild and 21 others had been stranded during shackleton s imperial trans antarctic expedition six years earlier they would then return to south georgia before onset of winter wild p 136 for most part long passage across weddell sea proceeded uneventfully there was a growing level of unrest among crew perhaps provoked by disappointment with apparent aimlessness of voyage worsley in particular was critical of wild s leadership mills pp 302 303 wild in his own account dealt with this discontent by threat of most drastic treatment wild pp 137 139 on 12 march they reached 64deg11 s 46deg4 w which was area where ross had recorded an appearance of land in 1842 but there was no sign of it and a depth sounding of over indicated no likelihood of land nearby wild p 144 from 15 to 21 march quest was frozen into ice and shortage of coal became a major concern wild hoped that diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from seals at elephant island mills p 304 on 25 march island was sighted wild wanted if possible to revisit cape wild site of old endurance expedition camp but bad weather prevented this they viewed site through binoculars picking out old landmarks before landing on western coast to hunt for elephant seals mills p 305 they were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with coal so that aided by a favourable wind they reached south georgia on 6 april return

robert baden powell marr presented a flag to local scout troop during five day stay with help of some of islanders expedition made brief landings on small inaccessible island south west of tristan and visited even smaller nightingale island collecting specimens wild pp 206 214 wild s impressions of stay at tristan were not altogether favourable he noted appalling squalor and poverty and said of

an official reception and they were honoured at dinners and lunches by local organisations they were also met by rowett s agent with message that they should return to england fisher p 483 wild wrote i should have liked one more season in enderby quadrant much might be accomplished by making cape town our starting point and setting out early in season wild p 287 on 19 july they left cape town and

articles were developed from this material fisher pp 516 517 but it was in leif mills s words little enough to show for a year s work lack of a clear defined expedition p 464 mills p 330 was aggravated by failure to call at cape town on way south which meant that important equipment was not picked up on south georgia wild found little that could make up for this loss there were no dogs on island so no sledging work could be carried out which eliminated wild s preferred choice of a revised expedition goal an exploration of graham land on antarctic peninsula wild pp 74 75 death of shackleton before beginning of serious work was a heavy blow and questions were raised about adequacy of wild as his replacement some reports imply that wild drank heavily practically an alcoholic according to huntford huntford p 693 mills p 297 mills suggests that even if shackleton had lived to complete expedition it is arguable whether under circumstances it could have achieved more than it did under wild s command non use of aeroplane was a disappointment shackleton had hoped to pioneer use of air transport in antarctic waters and had discussed this issue with british air ministry
