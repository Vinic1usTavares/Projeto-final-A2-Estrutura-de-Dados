of fleet ancona was damaged by austrian shellfire including one shell that started a fire her career was uneventful after war resulting from a combination of emergence of more modern ironclads and a

which was fought concurrently with austro prussian war sondhaus p 1 italian fleet commander admiral carlo pellion di persano initially adopted a cautious course of action he was unwilling to risk battle with austrian navy despite fact that austrian fleet was much weaker than his own persano claimed he was simply waiting on ironclad ram en route from britain but his inaction weakened morale in fleet with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice greene massignani pp 217 222 rear admiral wilhelm von tegetthoff brought austrian fleet to ancona on june 27 in attempt to draw out italians at time many of italian ships were in disarray several ships did not have their entire armament and several others had problems with their engines ancona having entered service only two months before was not yet ready for combat persano held a council of war aboard ironclad to determine whether he should sortie to engage tegetthoff but by that time austrians had withdrawn making decision moot minister of navy agostino depretis urged persano to act and suggested island of lissa to restore italian confidence after their defeat at battle of custoza previous month on 7 july persano left ancona and conducted a sweep into adriatic but encountered no austrian ships and returned on 13th wilson pp 216 218 battle of lissa thumb upright map showing disposition of fleets on 20 july on 16 july persano took italian fleet out of ancona bound for lissa where they arrived on 18th with them they brought troop transports carrying 3 000 soldiers italian warships began bombarding austrian forts on island with intention of landing soldiers once fortresses had been silenced in response austrian navy sent fleet under tegetthoff to attack italian ships sondhaus pp 1 2 ancona was at that time assigned to 1st division commanded by admiral giovanni vacca along with ironclads and principe di carignano divisional flagship wilson p 219 after arriving off lissa on 18th persano ordered 1st division to bombard austrian fortresses protecting island but vacca informed him that his ships guns could not elevate high enough to hit high fortifications persano then sent vacca s division to vis to force harbor defenses but by time they arrived night was approaching and so he cancelled attack wilson pp 221 222 next morning persano ordered ironclad to enter harbor vis and attack madonna battery supported by ancona and rest of 1st division vacca found it impossible to employ his ships in confined waters and so he left formidabile to handle battery with day s attacks again having yielded no results persano decided to make another attempt on 20th vacca would take his three ships to patrol to north east of island while rest of fleet would again try to land soldiers wilson pp 221 224 before italians could begin attack dispatch boat arrived bringing news of tegetthoff s approach persano s fleet was in disarray vacca s ships were three miles to northeast from persano s main force and three other ironclads were further away to west wilson pp 223 225 persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with vacca s first in line abreast formation and then in line ahead formation ancona was third ship in italian line wilson p 232 shortly before action began persano left his flagship and transferred to turret ship affondatore though none of his subordinates on other ships were aware of change they there thus left to fight as individuals without direction more dangerously by stopping re d italia he allowed a significant gap to open up between vacca s three ships and rest of fleet wilson pp 233 tegetthoff took his fleet through gap between vacca s and persano s ships in an attempt to split italian line and initiate a melee he failed to ram any italian vessels on first pass so he turned back toward persano s ships and took re d italia san martino and palestro under heavy fire vacca turned his division to port taking them away from austrian ships hammering persano s division he briefly attempted to engage austrian wooden ships under anton von petz in rear but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam frigates wilson pp 234 massignani p 232 by this time re d italia had been badly damaged and she attempted to close up with ancona while she reversed course to meet ancona ship was rammed and sunk by austrian flagship ancona was set on fire by austrian shells but her crew quickly put them out ancona then rallied with coastal defense ship to make another attack on von petz s unarmored ships but two italian vessels collided and became entangled while their crews worked to free ships austrians were able to escape wilson pp 236 240 persano broke off engagement to consolidate his forces but his ships low on coal and ammunition and with badly demoralized crews could not be rallied by persano s half hearted attempt to launch an attack italian fleet began to withdraw followed by austrians as night began to fall opposing fleets disengaged completely heading for ancona and pola respectively wilson pp 238 241 250 in course of battle ancona had been hit many times with several of her iron plates having been dislodged an austrian shell managed to enter one of her gun ports and explode inside wilson p 245 after battle vacca replaced persano he was ordered to attack main austrian naval base at pola but war ended before operation could be carried out wilson p 251 later career for rest of her long career ancona served in a variety of roles both in main fleet and in italy s colonial empire ordovini et al pp 343 344 after end of war government lost confidence in fleet and drastically reduced naval budget cuts were so severe that fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack port of civitavecchia in september 1870 as part of wars of italian unification instead ships were laid up and sailors conscripted to man them were sent home gardiner p 336 some time after 1866 ship was rebuilt as a central battery ship with most of her guns located in a central armored casemate two other guns were placed in bow as chase guns with a third mounted as a stern chaser at around 1871 her armament was also revised to two guns in bow and eight 8 in guns four on each broadside and last in stern later her armament was changed again to eight guns six guns four quick firing qf guns and two hotchkiss revolver cannons ancona was stricken from naval register in 1903 and then broken up for scrap notes references ancona category ships built by arman brothers
