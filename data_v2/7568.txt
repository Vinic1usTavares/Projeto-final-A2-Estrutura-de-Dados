thumb right 180px alt half length and dark portrait of a serious and slightly plump man wearing a black academic gown with white collar ruffled cuff and a large mortarboard christopher smart english poet christopher smart 1722 1771 was confined to mental asylums from may 1757 until january 1763 smart was admitted into st luke s hospital for lunatics upper moorfields london on 6 may 1757 he was taken there by his father in law john newbery although he may have been confined in a private madhouse before then while in st luke s he wrote jubilate agno and a song to david poems considered to be his greatest works although many of his contemporaries agreed that smart was mad accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied and some felt that he had been committed unfairly smart was diagnosed as incurable while at st luke s and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to mr potter s asylum bethnal green all that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry smart s isolation led him to abandon poetic genres of 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as jubilate agno rejoice in lamb his asylum poetry reveals a desire for unmediated revelation and it is possible that self evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of evangelical christianity late 18th century critics felt that smart s madness justified them in ignoring his a song to david but during following century robert browning and his contemporaries considered his condition to be source of his genius it was not until 20th century with rediscovery of jubilate agno not published until 1939 that critics reconsidered smart s case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet possible target of a plot by his father in law a publisher to silence him background smart was confined to asylums during a time of debate about nature of madness and its treatment during 18th century madness was both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something unintelligible by reason and therefore threatening to society and to humanity smith and sweeny 1997 p 16 it was commonly held to be an incurable affliction whose sufferers should be isolated from society keymer 2003 p 144 physician william battie who later treated smart wrote we find that madness is contrary to opinion of some unthinking persons as manageable as many other distempers which are equally dreadful and obstinate and yet are not looked upon as incurable and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned much less shut up in loathsome prisons as criminals or nuisances to society battie 1758 p 93 in particular battie defined madness as deluded imagination mounsey 2001 p 209 however he was attacked by other physicians such as john monro who worked at bethlem hospital in his remarks on dr battie s treatise on madness monro explained that those who were mad had correct perceptions but that they lacked ability to judge properly although monro promoted ideas of reform his suggested treatment beating patients was as harsh on patients as battie s preferred option of completely isolating patients from society in 1758 battie and others argued that those deemed mad were abused under british asylum system and they pushed for parliamentary action battie s treatise on madness emphasised problems of treating hospitals as tourist attractions and punitive measures taken against patients arguments of battie and others resulted in passage of act for regulating private madhouses 1774 but were too late to help smart keymer 2003 pp 184 185 modern critics however have a more cynical view of 18th century use of term madness when diagnosing patients psychiatrist thomas szasz viewed idea of madness as arbitrary and unnatural szasz 1972 pp xv xvi agreeing with szasz s position philosopher michel foucault emphasised that asylums were used in 18th century to attack dissenting views and that idea of madness was a cultural fear held by british public rather than a legitimate medical condition foucault 1989 pp 38 64 in particular foucault considered 18th century a time of great confinement foucault 1989 p 6 this description is consistent with smart s 1760s writings on subject in which according to thomas keymer category of madness is insistently and made to seem little more than invention of a society strategically concerned to discredit all utterances or conduct that threatens its interests and norms keymer 2003 p 183 18th century treatment of inpatients was simple they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread oatmeal some meat or cheese and a little amount of beer which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs mounsey 2001 p 205 they were denied contact with outsiders including family members and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be cause of their madness these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside mounsey 2001 p 204 if their actions appeared afresh and without assignable cause then their condition would be labelled as original madness and deemed incurable an institution like st luke s run by battie held both curable and incurable patients mounsey 2001 p 206 there were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment and many were released after a year to make room for new mounsey 2001 p 207 asylum during 1740s smart published many poems while a student at pembroke college cambridge he eventually left university in 1749 to devote his time to poetry in 1750 smart started to familiarise himself with grub street london s writing district and met john newbery a publisher soon after newbery began publishing smart s works in various magazines and in collections including poems on several occasions 1752 of these works smart was known for his seatonian prize winning poems his pastoral poem hop garden and his mock epic hilliad in 1752 smart married newbery s daughter anna maria carnan and had two daughters with her by 1754 sherbo pp 22 100 although many of smart s works were published between 1753 and 1755 he had little money to provide for his family mounsey p 159 at end of 1755 he finished a translation of works of horace but even that provided little income having no other choices smart signed a 99 year long contract in november 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled universal visiter or monthly memorialist and strain of writing caused smart s health to deteriorate sherbo pp 102 104 on 5 june 1756 smart s father in law newbery published without permission smart s hymn to supreme being a poem which thanked god for recovery from an illness of some kind possibly a disturbed mental state curry 2005 p 5 during illness smart was possibly confined to newbery s home and unable to write or be socially active out of sympathy for smart many of his friends including writer and critic samuel johnson began to write in universal visiter to fulfill smart s contractual obligation to produce content for magazine anderson 1974 pp 36 37 publication of hymn to supreme being marked beginning of smart s obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying without ceasing curry 2005 pp 6 7 smart s behaviour was probably influenced by st paul s command in first epistle to thessalonians to pray without ceasing and william law s spirit of prayer which argues that a constant state of prayer will establish a connection with god anderson 1974 p 37 smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends activities and call them into street to pray with him piozzi 1849 p 24 these calls for public prayer continued until an incident that smart later described in jubilate agno for i blessed god in st james s park till i routed all company for officers of peace are at variance with me and watchman me with his staff jubilate agno b 90 91 smart 1980 p 26 christopher hunter smart s biographer and nephew described situation though fortune as well as constitution of mr smart required utmost care he was equally negligent in management of both and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid produced temporary alienations of mind which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary hunter 1791 pp xx xxi hunter reports that samuel johnson visited smart during latter s confinement and it was johnson that on first approaches of mr smart s malady wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned hunter 1791 p xx however at no time did smart ever believe himself to be insane these meetings began before smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed although not as significantly to universal visiter ainsworth and noyes 1943 p 90 in joking about writing for universal visiter johnson claimed for poor smart while he was mad not then knowing terms on which he was engaged to write i hoped his wits would return to him mine returned to me and i wrote in universal visitor no longer keymer 1999 p 188 there are other possibilities beyond madness or religious fervor that may have led to smart s confinement newbery may have used imprisonment of his son in law as leverage to control publication of smart s work and as a warning to others who worked for him not to cross him another theory suggests smart s actions were a result of alcohol and had nothing to do with a mental imbalance mounsey 2001 p 200 however smart may have been imprisoned for embarrassing his father in law in some way which could have resulted from an incident in which smart drank hester thrale reinforced this latter possibility when she claimed that smart s religious fervor tended to coincide with times that smart was intoxicated smart s own testimony that he blessed god in st james s park till i routed all company jubilate agno b 90 91 as representing his religious madness is equally dismissed as resulting from drinking as he was known for pulling pranks and board of green cloth government body that controlled st james s park would treat most disturbances in park as resulting from madness mounsey 2001 p 201 if smart was placed into asylum as a result of actions at st james s he would not have been only one since records show that board of green cloth was responsible for admitting sixteen people to bethlem hospital for frenzy at st james s park during century prior to smart being placed in st luke s specific events of smart s confinement are unknown he may have been in a private madhouse before st luke s and later moved from st luke s to mr potter s asylum until his release at st luke s he transitioned from being curable to incurable and was moved to mr potter s asylum for monetary reasons mounsey 2001 pp 202 204 during smart s confinement time his wife anna left and took children with her to ireland sherbo 1967 p 135 there is no record that he ever saw her again mounsey 2001 p 239 his isolation led him into writing religious poetry and he abandoned traditional genres of 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote jubilate agno guest 1989 p 123 during his time in asylum smart busied himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry these lyric fragments eventually formed his jubilate agno and a song to david smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus mind or as self therapy smith and sweeny 1997 p 14 although 20th century critics debate whether his new poetic self examination represents an expression of evangelical christianity his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for unmediated revelation from god hawes 1996 p 140 there is an inner light that serves as a focal point for smart and his poems written during his confinement and that inner light connects him to christian god hawes 1996 p 141 st luke s hospital for lunatics thumb upright alt handwritten manuscript of a page with about a hundred lines each a sentence beginning with word let a page from jubilate agno written while in asylum few details are known about smart s time at st luke s hospital for lunatics he was admitted to st luke s on 6 may 1757 as a curable patient sherbo 1967 p 112 it is possible that smart was confined at newbery s behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between two newbery had previously mocked smart s immorality in a collection of pretty poems for amusement of children six foot high mounsey 2001 p 181 regardless of newbery s exact reasons there is evidence suggesting that newbery s admittance of smart into mental asylum was not based on madness to have smart admitted newbery probably provided a small bribe although bribes were against st luke s policy there is little information about smart s condition during his stay at st luke s possibly because battie s denied his patients from being visited including by their own family members one of few records that survive of smart s time at st luke s was an entry in st luke s minute book which read 12 may battie having acquainted this committee that christopher smart who was admitted on 6th day of may 1757 continues disordered in his senses notwithstanding he has been admitted into this hospital above 12 calendar months and from present circumstances of his case there is not reason to expect his speedy recovery and he being brought up and examined ordered that he be discharged and that notice be sent to his securities to take him away during smart s confinement at st luke s not even other doctors were allowed to see smart unless they had received personal permission from battie mounsey 2001 p 210 it was improbable that smart could have left asylum without being released by battie even if smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means rules for release would have been almost impossible to follow based on system that battie had in place which isolated individual from all contact eventually smart was deemed incurable and would not have been released by hospital but for its lack of funds mr potter s madhouse after being released from st luke s smart was taken to a private madhouse mounsey 2001 p 208 elizabeth lenoir smart s daughter was brought to see her father and stated that he was committed by mr newbery to care of a mr potter who kept a private house at bethnal green sherbo qtd p 122 she described her experience as being held in a small neat parlour however mr potter s private madhouse was not homely and smart s treatments were far worse as he describes for they work on me with their harping irons which is a barbarous instrument because i am more unguarded than others jubilate agno b 129 smart was left alone for four years except for his cat jeoffry and occasional gawker who would come to see those deemed mad sherbo 1967 p 133 piozzi described smart s general situation he was both a wit and a scholar and visited as such while under confinement for madness it is very possible that he felt homeless during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a limbo between public and private space from being watched by outsiders hawes 1996 p 155 in london only a few of his works were still being published but proceeds were taken by newbery however smart did get to see published a collection of his work under pseudonym mrs midnight titled mrs midnight s orations and other select pieces as they were spoken at oratory in hay market london sherbo 1967 p 167 smart did not profit from work but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again smart according to his 20th century biographer arthur sherbo had only his god and his poetry sherbo 1967 p 164 a few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of treatment smart received and freed him from mr potter s release there is little information about how and why smart was released from asylum but his daughter claimed he grew better and some misjudging friends who misconstrued mr newbery s great kindness in placing him under necessary salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more what is known about actual events is that john sherratt christopher smart s friend believed that smart s confinement was unfair and wanted to negotiate smart s release in january 1763 he met with a parliamentary committee to discuss issue of individuals falsely imprisoned and abuses that they would receive in asylums in particular sherratt argued that many were admitted for habitual intoxication which undermined battie s and other asylum keeper s reputations a finding by parliamentary committee released 27 january 1763 bolstered sherratt s chances to release smart to those around him smart appeared perfectly sane and he was most likely released because of legislation concurrently being passed in parliament advocating for a reform to patient care smart left asylum on 30 january 1763 with sherratt mounsey 2001 pp 239 246 upon leaving asylum smart took manuscripts of a song to david many translations of psalms and jubilate agno a song to david was published on 6 april 1763 harsh reviews followed which mocked smart s time in asylum instead of dealing with poems mounsey 2001 pp 239 247 256 jubilate agno stayed in manuscript form and passed into hands of friends of william cowper a poet also placed into asylum and smart s contemporary when they investigated concept of madness work stayed in private holdings until it was rediscovered in 20th century by william stead anderson 1974 p 70 it was not published until 1939 when it was printed with title rejoice in lamb a song from bedlam hawes 1996 p 177 analysis samuel johnson s biographer james boswell described a moment when charles burney inquired of his friend johnson of smart s state johnson used term madness to comment on state of society before explaining to burney that smart s actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from usual mode of world my poor friend smart shewed disturbance of his mind by falling upon his knees and saying his prayers in street or in any other unusual place now although rationally speaking it is greater madness not to pray at all than to pray as smart did i am afraid there are so many who do not pray that their understanding is not called in question concerning this unfortunate poet christopher smart who was confined in a mad house he had at another time following conversation with dr charles burney burney how does poor smart do sir is he likely to recover johnson it seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with disease for he grows fat upon it burney perhaps sir that may be from want of exercise johnson no sir he has partly as much exercise as he used to have for he digs in garden indeed before his confinement he used for exercise to walk to ale house but he was carried back again i did not think he ought to be shut up his infirmities are not noxious to society he insisted on people praying with him and i d as lief pray with kit christopher smart as any one else another charge was that he did not love clean linen and i have no passion for it johnson continued mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it boswell 1986 pp 97 98 in an article printed in gentleman s magazine hester piozzi smart s acquaintance and johnson s close friend argued that in many aspects smart appears sane in every other transaction of life no man s wits could be more regular than those of smart for this prevalence of one idea keeping first place in his head had in no sense except in what immediately related to itself perverted his judgement at all his opinions were unchanged as before nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of distraction than any other man less so perhaps as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer beyond smart s circle of friends few were willing to dismiss claims that smart was affected by madness most contemporary literary critics knew of smart s time in asylum and upon publication of his a song to david called attention to aspects of poem which they could use to claim that smart was still mad view was widely held and poet william mason wrote to thomas gray i have seen his song to david from thence conclude him as mad as ever toynebee and whibley 1935 p 802 19th century it was a century before a positive twist was put on christopher smart s time in asylum victorian poet robert browning argued that a song to david was great because smart was mad at time jacobs 1998 p 193 in his poem parleyings 1887 browning claimed armed with this instance have i diagnosed your case my christopher man was sound and sane at starting all at once ground gave way beneath his step then as heaven were loth to linger let earth understand too well how heaven at need can operate off fell flame robe and man resumed sobriety as he began so did he end nor alter pace not he browning 1887 p 84 to browning smart s temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in a song to david poetry similar to that of john milton and john keats christopher smart as browning s poem continued pierced screen twixt thing and word lit language straight from soul left no fine film flake on naked coal live from 1887 p 86 browning s remarks brought about a later appreciation of a song to david and smart s madness smart 1983 p 101 a review of browning s claimed that christopher smart was possessed by his subject and where there is true possession where fires of poet s imagination are not choked by self consciousness or by too much fuel from intellect idiosyncrasy mannerism and even conventional formulae are for time burnt and purged away athenaeum 19 february 1887 p 248 19th century poet dante gabriel rossetti emphasised benefits of smart s madness and claimed that a song to david was only great accomplished poem of last century smart 1983 p 103 two years later francis palgrave continued theme when he wrote that song exhibited noble wildness and transitions from grandeur to tenderness from earth to heaven and that it was unique in our poetry palgrave francis t treasury of sacred song london 1889 p 350 seven years after palgrave critic john churton collins agreed with rossetti and palgrave but to a lesser extent when he wrote this poem stands alone most extraordinary phenomenon perhaps in our literature one rapt strain in poetry of eighteenth century work of a poet who though he produced much has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates power here displayed collins john churton treasury of minor british poetry london 1896 p 395 20th century and contemporary twentieth century critics favoured view that smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems smith and sweeny 1997 p 15 a review by mathews titled thin partitions in 30 march 1901 academy claimed that now christopher smart was a very beggarly poet of eighteenth century but had not smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem kit smart in fact though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse could not write poetry nor anything else legally mad that is for he appears to have been very mad in his senses and a decent citizen out of them he went mad legally and medically once and nothing came out of it perhaps because he was not mad enough then he went mad again and being duly shut up in bedlam wrote one of finest outbursts of lyric genius in eighteenth century perhaps finest before advent of blake smart regained his senses and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry and he never did anything after mathews 1974 p 280 in 1933 a e housman sided with browning s and mathew s interpretation and connected smart s madness with poetic genius in his lecture name and nature of poetry as matters actually stand who are english poets of that age in whom pre eminently one can hear and recognize true poetic accent emerging clearly from contemporary dialect these four collins christopher smart cowper and blake and what other characteristic had these four in common they were mad youngquist 1989 qtd p 47 in 1994 branimir rieger differed from housman s view by distancing smart from others when he argued that collins and cowper pine as isolated individuals guiltily aware of a vitality that is not finally human but divine smart soars beyond individuality to embrace that vitality but at a cost of all human relationship rieger 1994 p 120 however there are many that disagreed that smart suffered from madness edward ainsworth and charles noyes when discussing smart s hymn to supreme being said mind that composed this hymn was not deranged yet in poem one sees morbidly religious mind which in disorder was to produce jubilate agno and with order restored song to david ainsworth and noyes 1943 p 87 additionally they claimed that smart s preternatural excitement to prayer seems to have been poor smart s only real mental aberration unless his drunkenness be considered pathological when his mind was removed entirely from field of prayer he was but little changed from his sane state his powers of reason though thus warped were not taken from him and he neither raved nor sank into mental lethargy ainsworth p 88 nevertheless ainsworth and noyes were not completely sceptical about smart s diagnosis when they continued but when desire to pray struck him smart abandoned what world chose to call rationality in 1960 neurologist russell brain diagnosed smart as suffering from cyclothymia or manic depression brain 1960 pp 113 122 brain based his diagnosis on smart s own claims about how he felt and he concluded that in smart s case mental illness was not result of his drunkenness but he drank because he was mentally unstable arthur sherbo in 1967 argued that nature of smart s madness is impossible to diagnose at this distance in time and then argued that since battie himself pronounced him uncured he must have been subject to hallucinations strong drink taken often enough and in sufficient quantity will have that effect of course but battie distinguishing between original and consequential madness would allow only that excessive drinking could become a very common tho remoter cause of madness others differed john ball in his modern practice of physic 1760 lists anxiety of mind and too much strong vinous or spirituous liquors as antecedent causes of madness smart s mania however it manifested itself and it usually manifested itself in loud public prayer did not stem from drunkenness it was aggravated however by frequent recourse to bottle ironically enough as mrs piozzi recognised if smart had prayed in privacy of his home all might have been well for him sherbo 1967 p 115 possible religious component of smart s condition was taken up by 20th century critics as an explanation for why 18th century saw smart as mad laurence binyon in 1934 believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed smart smart s madness seems to have taken form of a literal interpretation of injunction pray without ceasing he embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his obsession with a fixed idea is a common form of insanity but such obsessions are a mental imprisonment whereas song is unmistakably expression of a great release binyon 1934 p 8 binyon s idea was picked up by sophia blaydes in 1966 who pointed out that society was prejudiced against those who experienced enthusiasm a strong spiritual connection to god it was against religious prejudice that she argued cause of smart s eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of age one which was founded in reason but developed in fear there was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of smart s work he had been confined for madness it was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it what could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally to some degree it was fear of enthusiasm blaydes p 47 in 18th century as blaydes continued word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired result of this change was that british society viewed enthusiasm as enemy to both reason and social order blaydes pp 51 53 thus smart hack writer would not have been greeted by a hostile audience but smart enthusiast would have been condemned immediately result would be obvious his past work previously lauded would be ignored and his future work would receive immediate condemnation such was history of smart s contemporary reputation blaydes p 55 in determining if smart was really mad or not blaydes concluded in smart s day any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for judgment of madness two accounts of smart and nature of his madness have been preserved for us each permits some doubt that poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age blaydes p 58 frances anderson in 1974 characterised smart s illness as insanity and obsession but believed that smart s madness consisted of his efforts to obey literally st paul s injunction to thessalonians pray without ceasing during his episodes of illness as anderson continued smart probably suffered some periods of delirium but also appeared to know what he was doing anderson 1974 p 38 smart s actions were similar to 18th century methodists that were addicted to public prayer with what was thought to be overly charged high spirits such of religious emotionalism were often confined not only to private madhouses but also to bedlam later in 1998 charles rosen pointed out that enlightenment condemned religious enthusiasm as appropriate for uneducated and great unwashed and it is understandable that only original and vital religious poetry between 1760 and 1840 should have been written by poets considered genuinely mad by their contemporaries smart blake and holderlin rosen 1998 p 122 accounts at end of 20th century focused on effects of smart s confinement clement hawes following michel foucault s interpretation of 18th century that there was an animality of madness believed that smart emotionally connected with animals because of medical stigmatization he felt at hands of his fellow man hawes 1996 p 161 chris mounsey agreeing with hawes s interpretation believed that smart s treatment was a process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as quietly as possible contrary to allan ingram argued that jubilate agno was a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable mad individual presented a gross distortion of human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human but mad language could be even more disturbing ingram 1998 p 6 notes references ainsworth edward g and noyes charles christopher smart a
