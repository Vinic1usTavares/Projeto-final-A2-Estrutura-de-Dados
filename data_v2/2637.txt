forde airport bringeland in 1986 history large scale construction of airports in norway started in 1950s largely funded by north atlantic treaty organization nato bergen airport flesland opened in 1955 followed by alesund airport vigra in 1958 first plans for an airport in sunnfjord were launched by engineer arne who proposed building an airfield in floro and having operate to it using scottish aviation twin pioneer construction started in 1956 but was halted after airline could not guarantee operations during winter a committee led by erik himle and later preben munthe was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in norway sud aviation caravelle was about to phased into use on main domestic routes and committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners including one airport in floro wideroe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead which could be served using short take off and landing aircraft which were being developed at time smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate hakon was appointed minister of transport and communications in 1965 and was a proponent of proposal political rationale was that despite that total operating costs would rise it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population regional airports only received a simple terminal and a runway first such airports were opened in helgeland in 1968 forde was declared as a center of growth in 1965 which resulted in a series of public agencies and industrial enterprises being built in town selection of forde was tied to its central location within sogn og fjordane as it was within a two hour drive from nearly entire county immediately after appointment industrial development corporation of norway started establishing an industrial facility at oyrane an industrial park opened 1968 which included a shipyard surplus earthwork from dredging port facilities was used to fill in land for a runway process went so quickly that municipal council had not made a formal decision to build airport before groundwork was completed thumb left oyrane is peninsula with industrial complex between river and bay andreas hjelmeland established fordefly in 1966 as second airline

scheduled services commenced on 1 july 1971 same day as floro airport sogndal airport and airport opened from before airport was built it was evident that location was not well suited and planning of an alternative location for airport began in 1968 main concern was that airport lacked an instrument landing system and could thus only be used during daylight and good weather first alternative location proposal was for but was discarded by civil aviation administration because of poor weather conditions later proposals were and then on sognefjord by 1972 caa had concluded that there probably was not a suitable location for an airport near forde and recommended that town instead by served by floro airport located away located south of town in neighboring municipality of was proposed by caa in 1974 plans were developed and in 1983 ministry of transport and communications recommended that oyrane be closed and replaced with an all new airport at bringeland construction

remains as a parking lot facilities forde airport oyrane was located in industrial area oyrane immediately west of town center of forde terminal facilities were located on shore of river of jolstra and consisted of a control tower a passenger terminal a hangar for fordefly and a wharf used by seaplanes airport was owned by forde municipality it consisted of a single asphalt runway aligned 14 32 and with a on each end runway length was limited by fjord to north and by national road 5 to south from northern end of runway a taxiway ran due south about to terminal airport had very poor operating conditions whenever an aircraft was to land cranes at shipyard had to be moved to allow sufficient clearance conversely airport could not be used when ships were launched industrial buildings were located just next to taxiway control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of entire runway surrounding terrain consisting of deep fjords mountains and a town made it impossible to install an instrument landing system this again meant that airport could only be served during daylight airport never received a permanent operating license airlines and destinations oyrane was served by wideroe which held permission to operate all subsidized routes on regional network wideroe served airport with its fleet of 19 passenger de havilland canada dhc 6 twin otter aircraft and provided
