tropical storm bonnie was a small and rather weak tropical storm that brought squally weather to northern caribbean sea and gulf coast of united states in july 2010 third tropical cyclone and second named storm of 2010 atlantic hurricane season bonnie developed from a tropical wave over bahamas on july 22 it strengthened to a tropical storm while crossing islands and made landfall on southeastern coast of florida following day inland bonnie weakened to a tropical depression before entering gulf of mexico where its surface circulation dissipated on july 24 remnants of storm moved ashore between louisiana and mississippi early on july 25 prompting severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in area precursor to bonnie produced considerable amounts of rainfall across greater antilles resulting in light to moderate flooding in dominican republic hundreds of people were displaced and several bridges collapsed over rushing waters one person drowned after being swept away by a swollen river in puerto rico elsewhere light amounts of rainfall was reported in haiti bahamas and florida effects were more severe from remnants of bonnie with heavier rain amounts and higher winds reported near gulf coast especially in louisiana damage as a result of storm and its remnants totaled 1 36 million 2010 usd meteorological history on july 10 a tropical wave exited african coast and moved westward over open atlantic for several days initially associated weather activity was limited to weak showers and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization although upper level wind shear remained somewhat adverse a process of slow development became evident by july 19 as surface pressures began to fall wave proceeded along extreme northeastern caribbean where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with hispaniola by july 22 activity reestablished over bahamas with a distinct area of low pressure centered between islands of acklins and great inagua satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation leading national hurricane center nhc to issue formation of tropical depression three around 1500 utc however post storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed upon its formation depression was forecast to be steered to west northwest along a well established subtropical ridge later that day minimum pressure dropped to 1006 mbar 29 74 inhg and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants although its cloud pattern remained disorganized with circulation center disassociated from deepest convection a reconnaissance aircraft flight into cyclone found that winds had increased it was therefore upgraded to tropical storm bonnie southeast of nassau bahamas about five hours after nhc initiated advisories on system thumb right bonnie shortly after its entrance into gulf of mexico around 2100 utc bonnie moved over ragged island in bahamas with winds of 40 mph 65 km h and shortly thereafter it attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph 75 km h due to increasingly unfavorable conditions aloft little change in intensity occurred during following day as storm accelerated toward florida though tropical storm force winds prevailed they were confined to a few rainbands to north and east of center at that time with deepest convection dislocated over southeast florida on july 23 at 1430 utc center of bonnie made landfall near elliott key with winds of 40 mph 65 km h interaction with land caused organization to deteriorate further and its corresponding convection quickly diminished in addition a second reconnaissance flight affirmed a lack of significant winds it is estimated cyclone lost tropical storm status around 1800 utc that same day on morning of july 24 deep convection briefly redeveloped over center as bonnie emerged into gulf of mexico despite redevelopment storm subsequently entered a region of intense upper level winds causing associated convection to become sheared away rapidly embedded within a well established steering flow bonnie further degenerated to a tight swirl of low clouds with no more than a few remaining patches of strong thunderstorms subsequent satellite images confirmed bonnie no longer maintained a definable structure following final advisory by nhc system was pronounced dissipated while located about 100 mi 160 km from mouth of mississippi river remnant low of bonnie drifted west northwestward before dissolving over southeast louisiana on july 25 preparations thumb left usfws staff in panama city florida watching bonnie approaching state on july 23 when nhc initiated advisories on bonnie a tropical storm warning was issued for central and northwest islands of bahamas in florida a tropical storm watch was issued for golden beach northward to jupiter inlet and included lake okeechobee in addition a tropical storm warning was issued from golden beach to bonita springs on west coast of state and included florida keys and florida bay by early july 23 tropical storm warning from golden beach to bonita springs was discontinued while a tropical storm warning was issued from englewood to deerfield beach florida six hours later a tropical storm watch was put into effect for destin florida to morgan city louisiana it was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning three hours later tropical storm watch from deerfield beach to jupiter inlet florida and all tropical storm warnings in bahamas were discontinued all tropical storm watches and warnings had been discontinued by 1500 utc july 24 shortly before bonnie dissipated three cruise ships carnival pride carnival destiny and grandeur of seas had to alter their courses due to presence of bonnie due to threat of a tropical storm louisiana governor bobby jindal declared a state of emergency on july 22 along gulf coast concerns arose regarding potential effects of storm on bp oil spill earlier in year due to risk of intoxicated storm surge authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low lying areas along coastlines on july 23 admiral thad allen ordered oil spill site to be evacuated as bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2 000 people in that area ships and vessels in area began preparation for evacuation on july 24 closer to shore approximately 1 300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate impact caribbean precursor to bonnie brought significant rainfall to parts of puerto rico and hispaniola leading to widespread flooding in puerto rico one person drowned after being caught in a swollen river and roughly 500 people required evacuation in dominican republic according to officials in dominican republic system produced more than of rain across territory several towns in country were isolated after bridges collapsed some light flooding also occurred in haiti though no damage was reported as bonnie moved through bahamas residents stocked up on food and water as a precautionary measure however no major preparations took place most businesses remained open during system s passage and schools were already closed for summer throughout islands effects from bonnie were relatively minimal heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported no known damage or loss of life took place united states thumb left 250px rainfall from bonnie in united states due to weak and disorganized structure of storm its effects upon landfall in florida were minimal gusty winds damaged newly planted trees and some power lines were downed throughout state roughly 14 000 people lost power a storm surge of was measured at virginia key tropical storm force winds were recorded in several areas although sustained winds of over 40 mph 65 km h were confined to virginia key rainfall was also minimal with a maximum of falling in northern miami dade county overall monetary losses as a result of storm in florida amounted to 2 000 2010 usd in pinellas county one person was hospitalized after being struck by lightning at fred howard park on july 24 on july

louisiana bonnie s remnants brought heavy rain to parts of texas in hidalgo county u s route 69 was reportedly covered with high water further inland moisture from bonnie combined with a cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over arkansas mississippi and tennessee in arkansas lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power to much of city of after striking a transformer significant wind damage took place in dallas county where awnings were blown off homes structures sustained roof damage and trees were felled heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding covering several
