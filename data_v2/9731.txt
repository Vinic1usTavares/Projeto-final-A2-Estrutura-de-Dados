die with him he felt that there was no celebrity archaeologist to replace him and ultimately felt that situation in british archaeology made him angry and sad in british archaeology magazine aston was described as mortimer wheeler of our times because despite strong differences between their personalities both had done much to bring archaeology to british public it went on to note that aston reminded archaeologists that their job is to do archaeology and if that was an archaeology that meant nothing to ordinary people there was no point in it and government would be among first to notice
