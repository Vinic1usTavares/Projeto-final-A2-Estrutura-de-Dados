was co written by supervising producer j r orci and executive producer jeff pinkner based on a story by akiva goldsman producer frederick e o toye served as director goldsman had joined series halfway through season by writing and directing mythology riddled episode bad dreams and was instrumental in convincing showrunners to depict more fringe mythology earlier than planned most notably with depiction of parallel universes title of road not taken is based on robert frost poem of same name new media consultants and scientists robert chiappetta and glen whitman aided in production of episode they had worked on series throughout first season with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising others on scientific concepts whitman later explained that they come to us with questions is this possible where can we go with this then we go and read very technical articles or talk with scientists and then translate that into storytelling medium of our show for road not taken he and chiappetta were asked to again find a new and gruesome way to blow people up this time by rooting it in concept of pyrokinesis chiappetta explained they wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up so this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology left thumb 160px as episode centered around concept of pyrokinesis several immolation stunts had to be performed carefully they and episode writers developed a storyline in which a victim s childhood experimentation when they were injected with something was now coming back to haunt them whitman noted that concept like others in show was based on real scientific knowledge notion is some kind of a medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place it really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame pinkner added and if you haven t yet mastered pyrokinesis and ability to excite molecules that are outside your body well then you re going to excite ones inside your body and you re going to blow up sadly for harris immolation scene first unit director gary rake emphasized safety explaining that everyone really has to think about what s going on and really focus tonight this is a quintessential moment where we can t have any mistakes everything in scene was flame retardant and a special burn unit crew was present actor michael gaston s arm immersed in a special gel was actually inflamed and then extinguished after filming was cut then gaston s stand in stuntman don hewitt jr was completely set on fire hewitt wore same costume a wig a face shield and was also covered in a flammable gel it was gaston s final episode with series actress jasika nicole who plays junior fbi agent astrid farnsworth described episode in a may 2009 interview it s about spontaneously combusting this is episode i get to get out of lab i remember thinking i can t wait to see what set s going to look like and how they will make it look when spontaneous combusting takes place and we get there and it s just smoke on walls like a kitchen fire i thought that was so funny because i thought there were going to be body parts everywhere like a small explosion but it s a really good episode which leads you into coolest parts of finale episode cultural references episode contains many cultural references which annalee newitz of io9 attributed to episode s writers it was bound to happen that one day these four would get together and spawn an episode so packed with in pop culture references that smacking is probably in order peter and walter reference 1984 supernatural comedy film ghostbusters while investigating opening scene s case and later debate origin of term pyrokinesis coined by author stephen king in his 1981 novel firestarter emmanuel grayson refers to titular character of 1982 science fiction film star trek ii wrath of khan as well as romulans and united federation of planets when describing government conspiracies to peter and olivia grayson also believes himself to be mr spock this reference is made even more appropriate by fact that spock s mother was named amanda grayson reception ratings road not taken was first broadcast in united states on may 5 2009 on fox network it

payoff for those of us who have been glued to set every tuesday night looking for answers website later listed road not taken as one of crucial episodes new viewers must watch to get into show television without pity graded episode with a a noel murray of a v club complimented episode s opening scene for providing a succinct synopsis of season to new viewers who may have been newly discovering series after watching its lead in american idol though he graded episode with an a murray did however critique its climatic scene for being clumsily paced and staged murray mainly found positive aspects with episode explaining for a show that started out being a fairly dour procedural with wacky mad scientist elements fringe has really worked its way into that fantasy sci fi sweet spot where its own forward momentum makes ridiculous look likely and arcane mythology seem well worth time to sort through and analyze other highlights murray found was noble s performance which he considered his finest moment in series to date and olivia s visions of other universe ign s ramsey isler rated episode with a score of 9 2 out of 10 he thought that after a stereotypical over top characterization in past episodes gaston stepped up his portrayal as harris and was annoying in a much more believable way isler found revelation surrounding harris to be deliciously surprising and wrote that last twenty minutes of episode really ramped up suspense and action however ign reviewer thought that while conversation with grayson was an hilarious homage to leonard nimoy it seemed completely superfluous in terms of overall storyline isler concluded his review on a positive note by focusing on noble s performance calling it one of best scenes he has ever done as walter bishop it was emotional believable and perfectly accurate for a character that has a high level of self loathing and remorse for what he s done and hopeless frustration of not being able to remember exactly why he did it references works cited external links road not taken at fox category 2009 american television episodes category fringe season 1 episodes category films with screenplays by akiva goldsman
