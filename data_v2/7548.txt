treaty of waitangi is a treaty first signed on 6 february 1840 by representatives of british crown and maori chiefs rangatira from north island of new zealand it has become a document of central importance to history to political constitution of state and to national mythos of new zealand and has played a major role in framing political relations between new zealand s government and maori population especially from late 20th century treaty was written at a time when british colonists and new zealand company acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and would be settlers were pressuring british crown to establish a colony in new zealand and when some maori leaders had petitioned british for protection against french incursions it was drafted with intention of establishing a british governor of new zealand recognising maori ownership of their lands forests and other possessions and giving maori rights of british subjects it was intended by british crown to ensure that when lieutenant governor william hobson subsequently made declaration of british sovereignty over new zealand in may 1840 maori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored once it had been written and translated it was first signed by northern maori leaders at waitangi copies were subsequently taken around new zealand and over following months many other chiefs signed treaty of waitangi signings in south island christchurch city libraries around 530 to 540 maori at least 13 of them women signed treaty of waitangi despite some maori leaders cautioning against it orange treaty of waitangi bridget williams books 1987 appendices p 260 an immediate result of treaty was that queen victoria s government gained sole right to purchase land in total there are nine signed copies of treaty of waitangi including sheet signed on 6 february 1840 at waitangi text of treaty includes a preamble and three articles it is bilingual with maori text translated from english article one of english text cedes all rights and powers of sovereignty to crown article two establishes continued ownership of maori over their lands and establishes exclusive right of pre emption of crown article three gives maori people full rights and protections as british subjects however english text and maori text differ in meaning significantly particularly in relation to meaning of having and ceding sovereignty these discrepancies led to disagreements in decades following signing eventually contributing to new zealand wars of 1845 to 1872 during second half of 19th century maori generally lost control of much of land they had owned sometimes through legitimate sale but often due to unfair land deals or through outright confiscations in aftermath of new zealand wars in period following new zealand wars new zealand government mostly ignored treaty and a court case judgement in 1877 declared it to be a simple nullity beginning in 1950s maori increasingly sought to use treaty as a platform for claiming additional rights to sovereignty and to reclaim lost land and governments in 1960s and 1970s responded to these arguments giving treaty an increasingly central role in interpretation of land rights and relations between maori people and state in 1975 new zealand parliament passed treaty of waitangi act establishing waitangi tribunal as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with interpreting treaty researching breaches of treaty by british crown or its agents and suggesting means of redress in most cases recommendations of tribunal are not binding on crown but settlements totalling almost 1 billion have been awarded to various maori groups various legislation passed in later part of 20th century has made reference to treaty but treaty has never been made part of new zealand municipal law nonetheless treaty has become widely regarded as founding document of new zealand new zealand government established waitangi day as a national holiday in 1974 each year holiday commemorates date of signing of treaty early history first contact between maori and europeans was in 1642 when dutch explorer abel tasman arrived and was fought off and again in 1769 when english navigator captain james cook claimed new zealand for britain at mercury islands nevertheless british government showed little interest in following up this claim for over half a century first mention of new zealand in british statutes is in murders abroad act of 1817 which clarified that new zealand was not a british colony despite being claimed by captain cook and not within his majesty s dominions between 1795 and 1830 a steady flow of sealing and then whaling ships visited new zealand mainly stopping at bay of islands for food supplies and recreation many of ships came from sydney trade between sydney and new zealand increased as traders sought timber and flax and missionaries purchased large areas of land in bay of islands this trade was seen as mutually advantageous and maori tribes competed for access to services of europeans that had chosen to live on islands because they brought goods and knowledge that were essential to local iwi maori word for social unit often called tribe or people at same time europeans living in new zealand needed protection that maori chiefs could provide as a result of trade maori society changed drastically up to 1840s they changed their society from one of subsistence farming and gathering to cultivating useful trade crops thumb upright left james busby british resident in new zealand he drafted a document known as declaration of independence of new zealand maori generally respected british partially due to encouragement from missionaries and also due to british status as a major maritime power which had been made apparent to maori travelling outside new zealand other major powers in area around 1830s included american whalers whom maori accepted as cousins of british and french catholics who came for trade and as missionaries maori were still deeply distrustful of french due to a massacre of 250 people that had occurred in 1772 when they retaliated for killing of marion du fresne and some of his crew while threat of french never materialised in 1831 it prompted thirteen rangatira major chiefs from far north of country to meet at kerikeri to compose a letter to king william iv asking for help to guard their lands it is first known plea for british intervention written by maori binney judith 2007 te kerikeri 1770 1850 meeting pool bridget williams books wellington in association with craig potton publishing nelson chapter 13 maori leaders assembly pa 1831 by manuka henare pp 114 116 in response british government sent james busby in 1832 to be british resident in new zealand in 1834 busby drafted a document known as declaration of independence of new zealand which he and 35 northern maori chiefs signed at waitangi on 28 october 1835 establishing those chiefs as representatives of a proto state under title of united tribes of new zealand this document was not well received by colonial office in britain and it was decided that a new policy for new zealand was needed from may to july 1836 royal navy officer captain william hobson under instruction from sir richard bourke visited new zealand to investigate claims of lawlessness in its settlements hobson recommended in his report that british sovereignty be established over new zealand in small pockets similar to hudson s bay company in canada hobson s report was forwarded to colonial office from april to may 1838 house of lords held a select committee into state of islands of new zealand new zealand association later new zealand company missionaries joel samuel polack and royal navy made submissions to committee on 15 june 1839 new letters patent were issued to expand territory of new south wales to include entire territory of new zealand from latitude 34deg south to 47deg 10 south and from longitude 5 east to east governor of new south wales george gipps was appointed governor over new zealand this was first clear expression of british intent to annex new zealand thumb upright captain william hobson hobson was called to colonial office on evening of 14 august 1839 and given instructions to take constitutional steps needed to establish a british colony he was appointed consul to new zealand and was instructed to negotiate a voluntary transfer of sovereignty from maori to british crown as house of lords select committee had recommended in 1837 normanby gave hobson three instructions to seek a cession of sovereignty to assume complete control over land matters and to establish a form of civil government but he did not provide a draft of treaty mc dowell and webb nz legal system lexisnexis 2006 p g 1930 captain william hobson pp 202 203 instructions from lord normanby to captain hobson dated 14 august 1839 normanby wrote at length about need for british intervention as essential to protect maori interests but this was somewhat deceptive hobson s instructions gave no provision for maori government of any kind nor any maori involvement in administrative structure of new colony historian claudia orange argues that prior to 1839 colonial office had initially planned a maori new zealand in which european settlers would be accommodated without a full colony where maori might retain ownership and authority over much of land and cede some land to settlers as part of a colony governed by crown however normanby s instructions in 1839 show that colonial office had shifted their stance toward colonisation and a settler new zealand in which a place had to be kept for maori primarily due to pressure from increasing numbers of british colonists colonial office was forced to accelerate its plans because of both new zealand company s hurried dispatch of tory to new zealand on 12 may 1839 to purchase land and plans by french captain jean francois l to establish a french colony in after examining colonial office documents and correspondence both private and public of those who developed policies that led to development of treaty historian paul moon similarly argues that treaty was not envisioned with deliberate intent to assert sovereignty over maori but that crown originally only intended to apply rule over british subjects living in fledgling colony and these rights were later expanded by subsequent governors through perceived necessity hobson left london on 15 august 1839 and was sworn in as lieutenant governor in sydney on 14 january finally arriving in bay of islands on 29 january 1840 meanwhile a second new zealand company ship cuba had arrived in port nicholson on 3 january with a survey party to prepare for settlement aurora first ship carrying immigrants arrived on 22 january on 30 january 1840 hobson attended christ church at kororareka russell where he publicly read a number of proclamations first was letters patent 1839 in relation to extension of boundaries of new south wales to include islands of new zealand second was in relation to hobson s own appointment as lieutenant governor of new zealand third was in relation to land transactions notably on issue of pre emption king marie 1949 a port in north a short history of russell p 38 drafting of treaty thumb upright henry williams who translated treaty into maori with help of his son edward marsh williams without a draft document prepared by lawyers or colonial office officials hobson was forced to write his own treaty with help of his secretary james freeman and british resident james busby neither of whom was a lawyer historian paul moon believes certain articles of treaty resemble treaty of utrecht 1713 british sherbro agreement 1825 and treaty between britain and 1826 entire treaty was prepared in three days in which it underwent many revisions there were doubts even during drafting process that maori chiefs would be able to understand concept of relinquishing sovereignty realising that a treaty in english could not be understood debated or agreed to by maori hobson instructed missionary henry williams and his son edward marsh williams who was more proficient in te reo maori language to translate document and this was done overnight on 4 february mcdowell and webb lexisnexis 2006 p 174 175 translation of treaty was reviewed by james busby and he proposed substitution of word for to describe confederation or gathering of chiefs this no doubt was a reference to northern confederation of chiefs with whom hobson preferred to negotiate who eventually made up vast majority of signatories to treaty hobson believed that elsewhere in country crown could exercise greater freedom over rights of first discoverers which proved unwise as it led to future difficulties with other tribes in south island debate and signing thumb a later reconstruction in a painting by marcus king depicting tamati waka nene in act of signing hobson is falsely shown in full uniform he was actually wearing civilian clothing on 5 february original english version treaty and its translation into treaty of waitangi bridget williams books 1987 ch 3 were put before a gathering hui of northern chiefs inside a large marquee on lawn in front of busby s house at waitangi hobson read treaty aloud in english and williams read his maori version maori chiefs rangatira then debated treaty for five hours much of which was recorded and translated by missionary station printer william colenso rewa a catholic chief who had been influenced by french catholic bishop pompallier said maori people don t want a governor we aren t european it s true that we ve sold some of our lands but this country is still ours we chiefs govern this land of our ancestors moka kainga mataa argued that all land unjustly purchased by europeans should be returned asked yesterday i was cursed by a white man is that way things are going to be protestant chiefs such as hone heke te tamati waka nene and his brother eruera were accepting of governor hone heke said bishop pompallier who had been counselling many catholic maori in north concerning treaty urged them to be very wary of treaty and not to sign anything he left after initial discussions and was not present when chiefs signed p lowe french and maori heritage 1990 thumb right location of waitangi within new zealand for maori chiefs signing at waitangi would have needed a great deal of trust nonetheless expected benefits of british protection must have outweighed their fears in particular french were also interested in new zealand and there were fears that if they did not side with british that french would put pressure on them in a similar manner to that of other pacific islanders farther north in what would become french polynesia maori at signing were further encouraged by english missionaries who believed that british regulation would be invaluable to future welfare of maori as european settlers continued to arrive afterward chiefs then moved to a river flat below busby s house and lawn and continued deliberations late into night busby s house would later become known as treaty house and is today new zealand s most visited historic building hobson had planned for signing to occur on 7 february however on morning of 6 february 45 chiefs were waiting ready to sign around noon a ship carrying two officers from hms herald arrived and were surprised to hear they were waiting for governor so a boat was quickly despatched back to let him know although official painting of signing shows hobson wearing full naval regalia he was in fact not expecting chiefs that day and was wearing his dressing king nga iwi o te motu reed 2001 p 34 or in plain clothes except his hat treaty signing began in afternoon hobson headed british signatories hone heke was first of maori chiefs who signed that day as each chief signed hobson said he iwi tahi tatou meaning we are now one people two chiefs marupo and ruhe protested strongly against treaty as signing took place but they eventually signed and after marupo shook governor s hand seized hold of his hat which was on table and gestured to put it on later signings hobson considered signing at waitangi to be highly significant he noted that twenty six of forty six head chiefs had signed hobson had no intention of requiring unanimous assent of maori to treaty but was willing to accept a majority as he reported that signings at waitangi represented clear recognition of sovereign rights of her majesty over northern parts of this island however those that signed at waitangi did not even represent north as a whole an analysis of signatures shows that most were from bay of islands only and that not many of chiefs of highest rank had signed on that day hobson considered initial signing at waitangi to be de facto treaty while later signings merely ratified and confirmed it to enhance treaty s authority eight additional copies were sent around country to gather additional signatures manukau copy waikato manukau copy tauranga copy bay of plenty copy herald bunbury copy henry williams copy east coast copy and printed copy about 50 meetings were held from february to september 1840 to discuss and sign copies and a further 500 signatures were added to treaty while most did eventually sign especially in far north where most maori lived a number of chiefs and some tribal groups ultimately refused including te waikato iwi te arawa and ngati and possibly moka kainga mataa a number of non signatory waikato and central north island chiefs would later form a kind of confederacy with an elected monarch called kingitanga kingitanga movement would later form a primary anti government force in new zealand wars while copies were moved around country to give as many tribal leaders as possible opportunity to sign some missed out especially in south island where inclement weather prevented copies from reaching otago or stewart island assent to treaty was unanimous in as well as possibly wellington to whanganui region but there were at least some holdouts in every other part of new zealand sovereignty proclamations on 21 may 1840 lieutenant governor hobson proclaimed sovereignty over whole country north island by treaty and south island and stewart island by discovery and new zealand was constituted as a colony separate from new south wales on 16 november 1840 british government was told that north island had been ceded with unanimous adherence which was not accurate and while hobson claimed south island by discovery based on uncivilised state of natives in actuality he had no basis to make such a claim in reality hobson issued proclamation because he felt it was forced on him by settlers from new zealand company who had attempted to form an independent settlement government at port nicholson and claimed legality from local chiefs two days after proclamation on 23 may 1840 hobson declared settlement s government as illegal hobson also failed to report to british government that maori text of treaty was substantially different from english one which he might not have known at time and also reported that both texts had received 512 signatures where in truth majority of signatures had been on maori copies that had been sent around country rather than on single english copy basing their decision on this information on 2 october 1840 colonial office approved hobson s proclamation they did not have second thoughts when later reports revealed more detail about inadequacies of treaty negotiations and they did not take issue with fact that large areas of north island had not signed government had never asked for hobson to obtain unanimous agreement from indigenous people extant copies thumb group of nine documents that make up treaty of waitangi in 1841 treaty documents housed in an iron box narrowly escaped damage when government offices at official bay in auckland were destroyed by fire they disappeared from sight until 1865 when a native department officer worked on them in wellington at request of parliament and produced an erroneous list of signatories papers were fastened together and then deposited in a safe in colonial secretary s office in 1877 english language rough draft of treaty was published along with photolithographic facsimiles and originals were returned to storage in 1908 historian and bibliographer dr thomas hocken searching for historical documents found treaty papers in poor condition damaged at edges by water and partly eaten by rodents papers were restored by dominion museum in 1913 and kept in special boxes from then on in february 1940 treaty documents were taken to waitangi for display in treaty house during centenary celebrations it was possibly first time treaty document had been on public display since it was signed after outbreak of war with japan they were placed with other state documents in an outsize luggage trunk and deposited for secure custody with public trustee at palmerston north by local member of parliament who did not tell staff what was in case however as case was too large to fit in safe treaty documents spent war at side of a back corridor in public trust office in 1956 department of internal affairs placed treaty documents in care of alexander turnbull library and they were displayed in 1961 further preservation steps were taken in 1966 with improvements to display conditions from 1977 to 1980 library extensively restored documents before treaty was deposited in reserve bank in anticipation of a decision to exhibit document in 1990 sesquicentennial of signing full documentation and reproduction photography was carried out several years of planning culminated with opening of climate controlled constitution room at national archives by mike moore prime minister of new zealand in november 1990 it was announced in 2012 that nine treaty of waitangi sheets would be relocated to national library of new zealand in 2013 in 2017 he permanent exhibition at national library opened displaying treaty documents along with declaration of independence and 1893 women s suffrage petition treaty text meaning and interpretation english text treaty itself is short consisting of a preamble and three articles english text from which maori text is translated starts with preamble and presents queen victoria being desirous to establish a settled form of civil government and invites maori chiefs to concur in following articles first article of english text grants queen of england absolutely and without reservation all rights and powers of sovereignty over new zealand second article guarantees to chiefs full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their lands and estates forests fisheries and other properties it also specifies that maori will sell land only to crown crown pre emption third article guarantees to all maori same rights as all other british subjects maori text maori text has same overall structure with a preamble and three articles first article indicates that maori chiefs give absolutely to queen of england for ever complete government over their land according to a modern translation by hugh with no adequate word available to substitute for sovereignty as it was not a concept in maori society at time translators instead used kawanatanga governorship or government second article guarantees all maori chieftainship over their lands villages and all their treasures translated with treasures here translating from taonga to mean more than just physical possessions as in english text but also other elements of cultural heritage second article also says chiefs will sell land to queen at a price agreed to by person owning it and by person buying it latter being appointed by queen as her purchase agent translated which does not accurately convey pre emption clause of english text third article gives maori same rights and duties of citizenship as people of england translated roughly same as english text differences thumbnail right manuscript copy of treaty of waitangi in maori in hand of henry kemp english and maori texts differ as a translation of document originally penned in english maori text generally fails to convey meaning of english text differences between two texts have made it difficult to interpret treaty and continues to undermine its effect most critical difference between texts revolves around interpretation of three maori words kawanatanga governorship which is ceded to queen in first article rangatiratanga chieftainship not mana leadership which was stated in declaration of independence just five years before treaty was signed which is retained by chiefs in second and taonga property or valued possessions which chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of also in second article few maori involved with treaty negotiations understood concepts of sovereignty or governorship as they were used by 19th century europeans and lawyer moana jackson has stated that ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in maori terms furthermore kawanatanga is a loan translation from governorship and was not part of maori language term had been used by henry williams in his translation of declaration of independence of new zealand which was signed by 35 northern maori chiefs at waitangi on 28 october 1835 declaration of independence of new zealand had stated ko te kingitanga ko te mana i te w h to describe all sovereign power and authority in land there is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term some scholars notably ruth ross argue that mana prestige authority would have more accurately conveyed transfer of sovereignty however it has more recently been argued by others including judith binney that mana would not have been appropriate this is because mana is not same thing as sovereignty and also because no one can give up their mana english language text recognises maori rights to properties which seems to imply physical and perhaps intellectual property maori text on other hand mentions taonga meaning treasures or precious things in maori usage term applies much more broadly than english concept of legal property and since 1980s courts have found that term can encompass intangible things such as language and culture even where physical property such as land is concerned differing cultural understandings as to what types of land are able to be privately owned have caused problems as for example in foreshore and seabed controversy of 2003 04 pre emption clause is generally not well translated while pre emption was present in treaty from very first draft it was translated to a word which simply meant to buy sell or trade many maori apparently believed that they were simply giving british queen first offer on land after which they could sell it to anyone another less important difference is that meaning england alone is used throughout in maori text whereas united kingdom of great britain and ireland is used in first paragraph of english based on these differences some maori academics argue that two versions of treaty are distinctly different documents they refer to as te o waitangi and treaty of waitangi and that maori text should take precedence because it was one that was signed at waitangi and by most signatories waitangi tribunal tasked with deciding issues raised by differences between two texts also gives additional weight to maori text in its interpretations of treaty entire issue is further complicated by fact that at time writing was a novel introduction to maori society as members of a predominately oral society maori present at signing of treaty would have placed more value and reliance on what hobson and missionaries said rather than written words of treaty document james 1996 making peoples a history of new zealanders from polynesian settlement to end of nineteenth century pp 195 6 although there is still a great deal of scholarly debate surrounding extent to which literacy had permeated maori society at time of signing what can be stated with clarity is that of 600 plus rangatira who signed written document only 12 signed their names in latin alphabet many others conveyed their identity by drawing parts of their moko personal facial tattoo while still others marked document with an x maori beliefs and attitudes towards ownership and use of land were different from those prevailing in britain and europe chiefs would traditionally grant permission for land to be used for a time for a particular purpose a northern chief nopera also early on summarised his understanding of treaty as ko te o te whenua i riro i a te kuini ko te o te whenua i ki nga maori shadow of land will go to queen of england but substance of land will remain with us nopera later reversed his earlier statement feeling that substance of land had indeed gone to queen only shadow remained for maori role in new zealand society effects on maori land and rights 1840 1960 in november 1840 a royal charter was signed by queen victoria establishing new zealand as a crown colony separate from new south wales from may 1841 short term effect of treaty was to prevent sale of maori land to anyone other than crown this was intended to protect maori from kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated indigenous peoples in other parts of world from their land with minimal compensation however before treaty had been finalised new zealand company had made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from great britain to new zealand hoping british would be forced to accept its land claims as a fait accompli in which it was largely successful in part treaty was an attempt to establish a system of property rights for land with crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse initially this worked well with governor and his representatives having sole right to buy and sell land from maori maori were eager to sell land and settlers eager to buy crown was supposed to mediate process to ensure that true owners were properly identified difficult for tribally owned land and fairly compensated by standards of time in particular governor had responsibility to protect maori interests still hobson as governor of new zealand and his successor robert fitzroy both took seriously their duty as protectors of maori from unscrupulous settlers working actively to prevent shady land deals hobson created a group of protectors of aborigines officials specifically appointed to verify owners land boundaries and sales lack of funds often prevented land deals at this time which created discontent among those who were willing but unable to sell combined with a growing awareness of profit margins that government was receiving by reselling land at a profit there was growing discontent among maori with pre emption clause at this time maori and others argued that government s abuse of pre emption clause was incompatible with article three of treaty which guaranteed maori equal rights to those of british subjects fitzroy was sympathetic to their pleas and decided to waive pre emption clause in 1844 allowing land sales directly to individuals new zealand wars and land sales growing disagreement over british sovereignty of country led to several armed conflicts and disputes beginning in 1840s including flagstaff war a dispute over flying of union flag at then colonial capital kororareka in bay of islands maori king movement kingitanga began in 1850s partly as a means of focusing maori power in a manner which would allow them to negotiate with governor and queen on equal footing chiefs justified king s role by treaty s guarantee of rangatiratanga chieftainship conflict continued to escalate in early 1860s when government used maori king movement as an excuse to invade lands in eastern parts of north island culminating in crown s confiscation of large parts of waikato and taranaki from maori treaty was used to justify idea that chiefs of waikato and taranaki were rebels against crown fitzroy s successor george grey was appointed governor in 1845 he viewed protectors as an impediment to land acquisition and replaced them with new officials whose goals were not to protect maori interests but rather to purchase as much land as possible grey restored pre emption by passing native land purchase act in 1846 which contemporary writers viewed as a first step towards a negation of treaty of waitangi this ordinance also tightened government control of maori lands prohibiting maori from leasing their land and restricting felling of timber and harvesting of flax a high court case in 1847 r v symonds upheld crown s right to pre emption and allowed grey to renegotiate deals made under fitzroy s waiving of pre emption clause r v symonds 1847 388 governor grey set out to buy large tracts of maori land in advance of settlement at low prices later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using difference to develop land access roads and bridges donald mclean acted as grey s intermediary and negotiator and as early as 1840 was aware that maori had no concept of sale of land in british sense soon maori became disillusioned and less willing to sell while crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy consequently government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased from wrong people altogether whole of south island was purchased by 1860 in several large deals and while many of sales included provisions of 10 per cent of land set aside for native inhabitants these land area amounts were not honoured or were later transmuted to much smaller numbers in some cases grey or his associates bullied owners into selling by threatening to drive them out with troops or employ rival chiefs to do so thumb beach front scene at kohimarama auckland circa 1860 with bishop selwyn s mission station where kohimarama conference was held two waka and a group of whare are visible in foreground in july 1860 during conflicts governor thomas gore browne convened a group of some 200 maori including over 100 pro crown chiefs handpicked by officials to discuss treaty and land at kohimarama auckland this became known as kohimarama conference and was an attempt to prevent spread of fighting to other regions of new zealand but many of chiefs present were critical of crown s handling of taranaki conflict those at conference reaffirmed treaty and queen s sovereignty and suggested that a native council be established but this did not occur native land court native land court later renamed maori land court was established under native land court act of 1862 which also finally abolished crown right to pre emption it was through this court that much maori land was alienated and way in which it functioned is much criticised today a single member of a tribal group could claim ownership of communal tribal land which would trigger a court battle in which other tribal members were forced to participate in or else lose out accumulation of court fees lawyers fees survey costs and cost of travelling to attend court proceedings resulted in mounting debts that could only be paid by eventual sale of land in effect maori were safe from court only until a single tribal member broke ranks and triggered a case which would invariably result in sale of land by end of century nearly all of highest quality maori land had been sold with only two million hectares remaining in maori possession although treaty had never been incorporated into new zealand municipal law its provisions were first incorporated into legislation as early as land claims ordinance 1841 and native rights act 1865 however in 1877 wi parata v bishop of wellington judgement judge prendergast argued that treaty was a simple nullity in terms of transferring sovereignty from maori to united kingdom wi parata v bishop of wellington 1877 3 nz jurist reports ns supreme court this remained legal orthodoxy until at least 1970s helen robinson simple nullity or birth of law and order treaty of waitangi in legal and historiographical discourse from 1877 to 1970 nz universities law review 24 2 2010 maori have since argued that prendergast s decision as well as laws later based on it were a politically convenient and deliberate ploy to legitimise seizure of maori land and other resources despite this maori frequently used treaty to argue for a range of demands including greater independence and return of confiscated and unfairly purchased land this was especially case from mid 19th century when they lost numerical superiority and generally lost control of most of country and had little representation in government or councils where decisions that impacted their affairs were made simultaneously maori rights over fisheries guaranteed in article 2 of treaty were similarly degraded by laws passed in late 19th century over longer term land purchase aspect of treaty declined in importance while clauses of treaty which deal with sovereignty and maori rights took on greater importance in 1938 judgement of case te v aotea district maori land board considered treaty as valid in terms of transfer of sovereignty but judge ruled that as it was not part of new zealand law it was not binding on crown treaty returned to public eye after treaty house and grounds were purchased by governor general viscount bledisloe in early 1930s and donated to nation dedication of site as a national reserve in 1934 was probably first major event held there since 1840s profile of treaty was further raised by centenary of 1940 for most of twentieth century text books government publicity and many historians touted treaty as moral foundation of colonisation and argued that it set race relations in new zealand above those of colonies in north america africa and australia there was some popular acceptance of idea that treaty transferred sovereignty since early twentieth century popular histories of new zealand and treaty often claimed that treaty was an example of british benevolence and therefore an honourable contract robinson simple nullity or birth of law and order p264 however even though maori continued to challenge this narrative its lack of legal significance in 1840 and subsequent breaches tended to be overlooked until 1970s when these issues were raised by maori protest movement resurgence and place in new zealand law 1960 present waitangi day act of 1960 was a token gesture towards acknowledging treaty of waitangi and somewhat preceded maori protest movement as a whole it established waitangi day although it did not make it a public holiday and english text of treaty appeared as a schedule of waitangi day act but this did not make it a part of statute law subsequent amendments to act as well as other legislation eventually acquiesced to campaigns to make waitangi day a national holiday in 1976 during late 1960s and 1970s treaty of waitangi became focus of a strong maori protest movement which rallied around calls for government to honour treaty and to redress treaty grievances maori boycotted waitangi day in 1968 over maori affairs amendment act which was perceived as a further land grab and maori expressed their frustration about continuing violations of treaty and subsequent legislation by government officials as well as inequitable legislation and unsympathetic decisions by maori land court continuing alienation of maori land from its owners protest movement can be seen as part of worldwide civil rights movement which emerged in 1960s as a response to protest movement treaty finally received limited recognition in 1975 with passage of treaty of waitangi act 1975 which established waitangi tribunal but this initially had very limited powers to make findings of facts and recommendations only act was amended in 1985 to enable it to
