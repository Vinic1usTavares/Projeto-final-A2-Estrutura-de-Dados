source is also on eastern edge of mount yeager it flows northwest for a short distance before passing through olympus pond and turning west for next several miles creek continues in this direction running through pennsylvania state game lands 18 and receiving tributaries such as reilly creek and little nescopeck creek a eventually creek passes northwestern edge of mount yeager and continues into butler township here creek heads southwest at a more southerly angle crossing interstate 80 receiving oley creek and passing an area of strip mines a few miles later creek turns west southwest and crosses pennsylvania route 309 continuing onwards it passes communities of and st johns and then crosses interstate 81 several miles later creek leaves butler township and enters sugarloaf township it continues west in this township receiving tributary little nescopeck creek b crossing pennsylvania route 93 and making several meanders after a number of miles creek meanders into black creek township where it turns north and picks up tributary black creek right before crossing interstate 80 and flowing through a gap in nescopeck mountain in gap creek crosses from black creek township into nescopeck township where it meanders northwest passing borough of nescopeck and entering susquehanna river on border between nescopeck township and columbia county tributaries nescopeck

deep black waters historically two tribes of native americans known as fork indians and delaware indians lived near mouth of nescopeck creek other parts of nescopeck creek watershed were settled by lenni lenape indians lenni lenape inhabited nescopeck creek watershed a thousand years before european settlers there is no definitive record of permanent settlements in interior of nescopeck creek s watershed but temporary native american settlements existed in what is now nescopeck state park by 1700s lenni lenape had left nescopeck creek watershed due to encroaching iroquois and european settlers stewardship report pp 6 7 there were two major native american trails in nescopeck creek watershed these were lehigh path which is also known as warrior trail and trade trail parts of these trails would become vine street and broad street in hazleton respectively stewardship report p 8 european inhabitation in early 1700s some european settlers who were granted warrants by william penn explored native american trails in nescopeck creek watershed on these paths skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and native americans one example is sugarloaf massacre when a group of native americans ambushed some soldiers on lehigh path near nescopeck creek in 1780 first mill was built in nescopeck creek watershed in 1788 stewardship report p xviii by 1791 there were four settlers along nescopeck creek in 1795 samuel mifflin built a sawmill at mouth of nescopeck creek a gristmill was built on nescopeck creek same year a flood of nescopeck creek in 1786 known as pumpkin flood was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on creek light industries such as lumbering and tanning gradually developed in nescopeck creek watershed this led to creation of numerous communities in nescopeck creek watershed such as white haven freeland and hazleton additionally anthracite coal was discovered in 1813 coal became an important industry for nescopeck creek region by 1836 with formation of hazleton coal company in 1830s and 1840s a number of patch towns designed to attend mines were built in nescopeck creek watershed population in nescopeck creek
