online through singer s official website in february 2002 closer to song s release as a single it depicts bjork as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire bleached nude body video was considered inappropriate and was banned from prime time mtv following her music video for pagan poetry bjork promoted song by performing on vespertine world tour and several tv and radio shows background and development in 2000 bjork starred on her acting debut dancer in dark whilst she worked on film she also began producing her next album writing new music and teaming with new collaborators she had to go to denmark to work on film and there was nothing going on she was lying on beach whilst looking at ocean with a ghetto blaster listening to producer thomas knak s music when she realised he was from copenhagen she called him up cocoon produced by knak was one of last songs to be written for album its melody came to bjork in a sudden rush and she contacted him she made a long distance late night phone call to knak in denmark and woke him up i didn t have any track of time so she didn t really know that i was asleep she was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe if i had time she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on said producer knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track similar to his own releases pytlik 2003 p 162 he liked idea of having two songs on album and immediately after he put down phone he started working his original treatment of cocoon made with an asr 10 appeared relatively intact in final version knak elaborated she had two changes one for one semitone up and another for i think about slower or something i don t really make music so i m not really used to thinking could singer really sing in a tempo from there she started working on lyrics and one more melody for vocal they met up in january 2001 in london to record song he went into a studio with only three tracks for mix and was impressed that there were many technicians and programmers that probably had been using a hundred however singer was protecting idea of raw version and said this is how we wanted to be they added two changes to song and then spent rest of day recording bjork s vocals they wanted to have only one take that really worked so that they did not have to edit different takes they recorded 20 takes and used fifth or sixth and because of that producer thought that this track is very intimate and personal because of way vocals were recorded way song was recorded was kind of rough according to knak it s also very close to mic all these things that you wouldn t normally keep in that sense it is very kind of almost naked in structure and in feeling because of lyrics composition cocoon is a song based around a bassline and beats that sound like fingertips on skin discussing glitch sound of song bjork said when you take technology and use areas where it breaks where it s faulty you re entering a mystery zone where you can t control it bjork s whispered vocals in cocoon were described as near cracking falsetto and a breathy ecstasy lyrically for michael cragg from guardian newspaper it feels almost intrusive like reading someone s diary as they write about a new love as bjork had just started relationship with barney its lyrics are set between metaphor with her singing who would have known that a boy like him would have entered me lightly restoring my and over sharing whilst also stating he slides inside half awake half asleep gorgeousness he s still inside me when asked about its sexually explicit nature singer responded yeah i guess a part of me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me and maybe give back to place that is nourishing me i don t know what to say when i read books or see films or listen to albums i want certain things i want a heart i m very old school like that i m very emotional i just didn t want anybody to know i wanted it for myself lyric to cocoon was a whole diary then i had to edit 90 per cent of it out it s very hard to explain but when i read it and other person it s about reads it we don t feel abused or anything i think there s songs where i ve been more scruffy about what i m expressing i have a problem with music that s too indulgent it s like keep your own dirty laundry please critical reception cocoon was received with positive reviews from music critics allmusic s heather phares called song seductively alien seth stevenson from slate magazine gave a positive review to it commenting that because of song bjork is actually at her best either barely murmuring or full out yelling and she may be most stylized vocalist in music today michael cragg from guardian commented that vespertine is littered with defining moments while first single hidden place choir assisted undo and collaboration aurora are among highlights it s cocoon that best represents album s sense of heavy lidded post coital hibernation david fricke from rolling stone commented that flurry of rhythm at start of song felt like gravity of a spider scurrying across linoleum ian gittins author of bjork human behaviour stories behind every song referred to cocoon as eyes of many of most significant moments of vespertine as well as most complete display and literal philosophy that singer had taken for album gittins 2002 p 119 british magazine nmes joe logic was also positive saying soft organs and rice krispies eh cereal ed feature heavily on a very minimalist cocoon a beautiful love song featuring bjork whispering sexual lyrics over a track that to rococo rot would be proud of stephen dalton from same publication was less positive and stated then there is uncomfortably intimate tremble whisper bjork voice of cocoon where she relates joy of shutting herself away with her lover with a broken music box and some mouldy old string greg kot from blender magazine commented that album openers hidden place and cocoon live up to their billing as sound sanctuaries with bjork singing a barely above a whisper lullaby enhanced by plush embrace of a choir wire opined that track nearly matches macabre tone of dancer in dark particularly trembling moment three minutes in when her barely audible whisper conjures a feeling beyond sadness as she pleads who would have known chart performance in united kingdom cocoon debuted at its peak of number 35 on uk singles chart on issue dated 17 march 2002 it fell to number 65 next week before falling off chart song debuted at number 61 in france on issue dated 23
