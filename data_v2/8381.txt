vance v terrazas 444 u s 252 1980 was a united states supreme court decision that established that a united states citizen cannot have his or her citizenship taken away unless he or she has acted with an intent to give up that citizenship supreme court overturned portions of an act of congress which had listed various actions and had said that performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive proof of intent to give up u s citizenship however court ruled that a person s intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of preponderance of evidence i e more likely than not rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on basis of clear convincing and unequivocal evidence background laurence terrazas was born in united states in 1947 note different order of names in this lower court case because terrazas s father was mexican and because mexico s citizenship laws then followed principle of ius sanguinis terrazas held mexican citizenship at birth and because he was born in united states terrazas also held us citizenship under ius soli of fourteenth amendment therefore terrazas was a dual citizen of united states and mexico at birth while enrolled at a mexican university in 1970 terrazas applied for a certificate of mexican nationality as part of his application terrazas signed a statement renouncing united states citizenship as well as any submission obedience and loyalty to any foreign government especially to that of united states of america during subsequent discussions with a us consular official terrazas gave conflicting answers as to whether or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a us citizen when he applied for his certificate of mexican nationality state department eventually concluded that he had lost his us citizenship a decision which terrazas appealed first before state department s board of appellate review and subsequently to courts before 1967 supreme court ruling in afroyim v rusk us law had provided for numerous ways for citizens to lose their citizenship in its afroyim ruling supreme court held that fourteenth amendment barred congress from revoking anyone s citizenship without their consent specifically court held that a law automatically revoking citizenship of anyone who had voted in a foreign election was unconstitutional and unenforceable however us law continued after afroyim to list several other expatriating acts voluntary performance of any of which would result in automatic loss of citizenship immigration and nationality act sec 349 8 u s c sec 1481 phrase voluntarily performing any of following acts with intention of relinquishing united states nationality was added in 1986 and various other changes have been made over time to list of expatriating acts see notes 7th circuit court of appeals ruled that according to afroyim v rusk congress is constitutionally devoid of power to revoke citizenship and that congress had no power to legislate any evidentiary standard for proving terrazas s intent to relinquish his citizenship that fell short of a requirement of proof by clear convincing and unequivocal evidence secretary of state and shapiro epitaph for mandatory jurisdiction aba journal december 1988 p 66 in 1937 during a time of constitutional challenges to many federal statutes congress also provided for direct appeals to supreme court from decisions of any federal court trial or appellate holding a federal statute unconstitutional on june 27 1988 president reagan signed legislation that freed court from virtually all appeals this ruling to supreme court questioning not only appellate court s finding on required standard of proof but also challenging finding that a separate intent to give up citizenship was required as opposed merely to performance of a designated expatriating act opinion a 5 4 majority of supreme court held that it was not enough for government to prove voluntary commission of an act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation that is so inherently inconsistent with continued retention of american citizenship that congress may accord to it its natural consequences i e loss of nationality rather court held that its 1967 ruling in afroyim v rusk emphasized that loss of citizenship requires individual s assent in addition to his voluntary commission of expatriating act and that trier of fact must in end conclude that citizen not only voluntarily committed expatriating act prescribed in statute but also intended to relinquish his citizenship on that point supreme court agreed with 7th circuit ruling in terrazas s favor majority then turned its attention to question of a standard of proof in loss of citizenship cases terrazas had argued and 7th circuit had agreed that 14th amendment as interpreted in afroyim had left congress without any constitutional authority to set standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence supreme court majority rejected this claim and held that congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence more likely than not when cases alleging loss of us citizenship were involved finally supreme court majority upheld validity of another aspect of law as enacted by congress that government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress was up to person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence supreme court did not explicitly rule on whether or not terrazas had lost his us citizenship rather it remanded case back to original trial court a federal district court in illinois for further proceedings consistent with court s ruling although court s membership was divided on question of whether a preponderance of evidence standard was sufficient for establishing someone s intent to give up their u s citizenship all nine judges agreed with key holding in afroyim v rusk that us citizenship was safeguarded by fourteenth amendment and could not be taken away by an act of congress from a person without consent dissents four justices who disagreed with majority filed three separate dissenting opinions all of dissenting justices supported afroyim v rusk principle that retention of us citizenship was a constitutionally protected right and they all agreed contrary to court s majority that terrazas s actions should not have led to loss of his citizenship justice thurgood marshall rejected majority s decision that an intent to give up citizenship could be established merely by a preponderance of evidence arguing that court s casual dismissal of importance of american citizenship cannot withstand scrutiny he said that he would hold that a citizen may not lose his citizenship in absence of clear and convincing evidence that he intended to do so justice john paul stevens also argued that a person s interest in retaining his american citizenship is surely an aspect of liberty of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law and that due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met in terrazas s case or others like it additionally stevens felt that congress had not adequately addressed question of specific intent to relinquish citizenship since we accept dual citizenship he wrote taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an american citizen moreover as now written statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship justices william j brennan jr and potter stewart argued that since terrazas was born a dual us mexican national his having taken an oath of allegiance to mexico was consistent with his being a citizen of u s in brennan s words formal oath of allegiance to mexico adds nothing to existing foreign citizenship and therefore cannot affect his united states citizenship brennan argued in addition that since congress has provided for a procedure by which one may formally renounce citizenship before us consular officials a procedure that all conceded that terrazas used terrazas was still a us citizen subsequent developments after receiving terrazas s case from supreme court on remand district court again ruled that terrazas had lost his citizenship on subsequent appeal 7th circuit court of appeals reversed its earlier decision and this time using a preponderance of evidence standard per instructions of supreme court ruled against him finding this time that there was abundant evidence that plaintiff intended to renounce his united states citizenship when he acquired certificate of mexican nationality willingly knowingly and voluntarily since office of u s secretary of state changed hands twice following supreme court s ruling in case edmund muskie replacing cyrus vance in 1980 and alexander haig assuming position in 1981 subsequent lower court cases are known as terrazas v muskie and terrazas v haig congress amended immigration and nationality act in 1986 to specify as required by vance v terrazas that a potentially expatriating act may result in loss of citizenship only if it was performed with intention of relinquishing united states nationality public law 99 653 100 stat 1986 u s code congressional and administrative news although terrazas ruling left intact congress s right to specify a preponderance
