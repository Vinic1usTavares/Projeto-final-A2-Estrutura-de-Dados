emperor 1457 1464 rebellion was orchestrated by cao and his officers due to fear of being next on tianshun s purge list of those who helped him gain back throne from his half brother jingtai emperor who had earlier succeeded during 1449 tumu crisis robinson 1999 84 85 leaked plot of rebellion was a failure three of cao s brothers were killed during ensuing battle and cao qin was forced to commit suicide during a last stand against imperial troops storming his beijing residential compound rebellion marked high point in political tension over allowing mongols to be employed in ming military

jingtai emperor led a coup against jingtai in 1457 and reclaimed throne as tianshun emperor 1457 1464 during ming dynasty 1368 1644 mongols enrolled in military service were either originally prisoners of war or they were those who voluntarily submitted to ming and settled in china serruys 1959 209 others fled their homeland on northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts seeking refuge in china where mongol families found lodging and hospitality robinson 1999 95 some mongols became distinguished military officers were granted noble ranks and on rarer occasions became ministers in state bureaucracy mongols of noble lineage socialized with chinese literati of two capitals nanjing and beijing while they also had their sons educated in chinese classic texts robinson 1999 117 nonetheless mongols in ming empire were often held in suspicion by chinese ming authorities mongols of lower social stature were often accused by chinese officials of being prone to violence banditry and becoming beggars and even prostitutes ming officials used excuse of military campaigns to relocate and scatter mongol troops and families throughout china so that they would not be concentrated in north china which neighbored enemy territory of mongol heartland robinson 1999 84 96 wu argues that there was a noticeable shift in ming court policies after 1449 tumu crisis in dealing with mongols he stated that beforehand ming court actively encouraged mongol immigration and afterwards merely managed those who had already sided with ming robinson 1999 85 wu 106 111 on july

lead a force of 15 000 troops to bolster defenses of shaanxi robinson 1999 95 96 historian david m robinson states that these developments must also have fed suspicion about mongols living in north china which in turn exacerbated mongol feelings of insecurity however no direct link can be found between decision by ming mongols in beijing to join 1461 coup and activities of steppe mongols in northwest robinson 1999 96 day before coup on august 6 1461 tianshun emperor issued an edict telling his nobles and generals to be loyal to throne this was in effect a veiled threat to cao qin after latter had his associate in imperial guard murdered to cover up crimes of illegal foreign transactions robinson 1999 97 this soldier in imperial guard had acted as cao s private commercial agent but when this man failed to keep affairs secret cao had soldier s wife tell authorities that her husband had gone mad and fled lu gao lu gao d 1461 head officer of imperial guard had authorities apprehend

robinson 1999 104 loyalty of cao s mongol officer clients was secure due to circumstances of thousands of military officers who had to accept demotions in 1457 because of earlier promotions in aiding jingtai s succession robinson 1999 100 robinson states that mongol officers no doubt expected that if cao fell from power they would soon follow cao either planned to kill ma ang and sun tang as they were to depart capital with 15 000 troops to shaanxi on morning of august 7 or he simply planned to take advantage of their leave robinson 1999 98 99 conspirators are said to have planned to place
