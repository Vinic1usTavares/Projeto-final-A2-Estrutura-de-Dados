he described his politics as those of a socialist artist although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to endless internecine warfare he observed in socialist organizations many joyce scholars such as richard ellmann dominic manganiello robert scholes and george j watson agree that joyce s interest in socialism and pacifistic anarchism continued for much of his life and that both

eyesight much of work was done with assistance of younger admirers including samuel beckett for some years joyce nursed eccentric plan of turning over book to his friend james stephens to complete on

indistinguishable to most people from familiar word salad produced by patients on back wards of any state hospital cleckley hervey 1982 mask of sanity revised edition mosby medical library joyce s method of stream of consciousness literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to limit in finnegans wake which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure english based mainly on complex multi level puns this approach is similar to but far more extensive than that used by lewis carroll in jabberwocky this has led many readers and critics to apply joyce s oft quoted description in wake of ulysses as his unreadable blue book of eccles finnegans wake 179 26 27 to wake itself however readers have been able to reach a consensus about central cast of characters and general plot much of wordplay in book stems from use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages role played by beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for joyce to use and as joyce s eyesight worsened of writing text from author s dictation gluck p 27 view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by giambattista vico and metaphysics of giordano bruno of nola are important to interplay of characters vico propounded a cyclical view of history in which civilisation rose from chaos passed through theocratic aristocratic and democratic phases and then lapsed back into chaos most obvious example of influence of vico s cyclical theory of history is to be found in opening and closing words of book finnegans wake opens with words riverrun past eve and adam s from swerve of shore to bend of bay brings us by a vicus of back to howth castle and environs vicus is a pun on vico and ends a way a lone a last a loved a long in other words book ends with beginning of a sentence and begins with end of same sentence turning book into one great cycle indeed joyce said that ideal reader of wake would suffer from ideal insomnia finnegans wake 120 9 16 and on completing book would turn to page one and start again and so on in an endless cycle of reading legacy thumb
