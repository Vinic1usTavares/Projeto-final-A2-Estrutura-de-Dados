stretch in foster township rest of stretch consisted of pa 59 now realigned and pa 746 now decommissioned pa 746 was decommissioned in 1946 and pa 59 was realigned in 1952 with pa 646 being extended onto its current alignment route has remained virtually unchanged since change in 1952 route description ormsby to rew pa 646 begins at an intersection with pa 59 in small borough of ormsby highway situated around several oil wells progresses to northwest through a moderately populated region of residential homes pa 646 continues on this progression for several miles a pipeline running through kinzua valley after an intersection with a local dirt road highway leaves ormsby and continues into under populated forests in keating township route follows an old railroad grade entering small

dirt road up pratt hollow pa 646 progresses to north and exits rew rew to bells camp pa 646 after crossing out of rew enters dense woodlands once again where yet another pipeline is crossed when highway reaches this pipeline alignment of highway turns winding along summit road along base of pratt hollow highway continues northward winding around several mountains through bradford oil field

lane a local road before turning to north and out of summit route heads northward for a short distance paralleling a grade right of way road which heads eastward to a short distance later pa 646 enters a small developed area where route intersects with pa 346 right thumb pa 646 from ny 16 in foster township at state line at intersection with pa 346 pa 646 turns off its right of way which continues along a pipeline as a dirt road and onto a concurrency with aforementioned touring route pa 646 and pa 346 head eastward intersecting with several dirt roads in a light woodland two highways

intersecting with fullerton road which terminates at olean road route continues northward paralleling pa 546 and knapp creek before crossing state line into new york a distance northwest of fullerton right of way continues northward as ny 16 towards olean history designation right thumb southern terminus of pa 746 at aiken when mass amount of state legislative routes were assigned in pennsylvania in 1928 pa 646 consisted of only stretch from pa 346 in derrick city to new york state line there was no concurrency with pa 346 at that time stretch from pa 59 to pa 346 was not state maintained rest of current pa 646 was an alignment of pa 59 entire alignment of pa 646 was paved in 1930 also that year stretch from pa 59 in aiken to pa 46 in rew was designated as pa 746 a spur off pa 46 this set of highways remained intact for over a decade until 1946 when pa 746 was decommissioned in favor of extending pa 646 over its alignment now pa 646 continued along a concurrency with pa 346 and east of red rock it went southward away from pa 346 down to pa 59 in aiken where it ended in 1952 pa 59 was realigned off its aiken alignment and pa 646 was extended to ormsby where it ended at pa 59 historic bridges there were three bridges constructed along pa 646 in 1930 when alignment was designated as pa 59 three bridges are in gilmore and all cross pennbrook run first one is long and is a concrete tee beam bridge that handles an average of 957 people daily 2004 bridge is structurally deficient and cost to replace bridge would amount to 591 000 second bridge in gilmore itself is a long concrete slab bridge across pennbrook run this bridge is structurally deficient and would cost 656 000 to replace it completely final bridge along pa 646 was constructed north of gilmore over pennbrook run like first bridge it is a tee beam construction with a length of like previous two bridges this one is also structurally deficient in its structure having not been replaced since construction in 1930 to replace bridge it would cost 408 000 major intersections see also references external links 646
