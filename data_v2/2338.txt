1980s and early 1990s which often led to intense searching and occasional violence among shoppers over finding toys randy kornfield wrote film s original screenplay after witnessing his in laws go to a santa monica toy store at dawn in order to get his son a power ranger while admitting to missing clamor for cabbage patch kids and power rangers producer chris columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a buzz lightyear action figure from film toy story released that year as a result he rewrote kornfield s script which was accepted by 20th century fox columbus was always attracted to dark side of happiest holiday of year so wrote elements of film as a satire of commercialization of christmas brian levant was hired to direct film columbus said levant ood humor in material and was very animated and excited and he had a vision of what he wanted to do levant said story that was important to me was between father and son it s a story about love and a father s journey to deliver it in form of a turbo man doll fact that i got to design a toy line and do commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker but at its root movie s about something really sweet it s about love and building a better family i think that s consistent with everything i ve done arnold schwarzenegger was quickly cast he became available in february 1996 after fox s remake of planet of apes was held up again columbus also exited that project to work on jingle all way film marks schwarzenegger s fourth appearance as lead in a comedy film following twins 1988 kindergarten cop 1990 and junior 1994 schwarzenegger was paid a reported 20 million for role he enjoyed film having experienced last minute christmas shopping himself and was attracted to playing an ordinary character in a family film columbus initially wanted joe pesci to play myron comedian sinbad was chosen instead partly due to his similar height and size to schwarzenegger sinbad was suggested for part by schwarzenegger s agent but producers felt he was unsuited to role of a villain as it could harm his clean family oriented comedy act and reputation although sinbad felt character would generate audience s sympathy rather than hate furthermore he missed audition due to his appearance with first lady hillary clinton and musician sheryl crow on uso tour of bosnia and herzegovina but columbus waited for him to return to allow him to audition and although sinbad felt he had messed it up he was given part he improvised majority of his lines in film schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with sinbad s character filming filming took place in minnesota for five weeks from april 15 1996 at time it was largest film production to ever take place in state jingle all way was set and filmed in twin cities metropolitan area of minnesota at locations such as bloomington s mall of america mickey s diner downtown minneapolis linden hills residential areas of edina and primarily downtown saint paul unused shops in seventh place mall area were redecorated to resemble christmas decorated stores while energy park studios were used for much of filming and christmas lights stayed up at rice park for use in film mall of america and state s semi wintry weather proved attractive for studio although schwarzenegger stated that locals were well behaved and cooperative levant often found filming impossible due to scale and noise of crowds who came to watch production especially in mall of america but overall found locals to be respectful and lovely people levant spent several months in area before filming in order to prepare film uses artistic license by treating minneapolis and saint paul as one city as this was logistically easier police are labeled twin cities police in film additionally city s parade is renamed parade and takes place on 2nd avenue during day rather than nicollet mall at night levant wanted to film parade at night but was overruled for practical reasons parade was filmed at universal studios hollywood in california on new york street set due to safety concerns set was designed to

man time racer vehicle while no tie in promotions could be secured despite this several critics wrote that film was only being made in order to sell toy columbus dismissed this notion stating that with only roughly 200 000 turbo man toys being made merchandising was far less than year s other releases such as space jam and 101 dalmatians film s release coincided with tickle me elmo craze in which high demand for doll during 1996 christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for turbo man world premiere was held on november 16 1996 at mall of america in bloomington where

average rating of 3 9 10 site s critical consensus reads arnold schwarzenegger tries his best but jingle all way suffers from an uneven tone shifting wildly from a would be satire on materialism to an antic slapstick yuk fest audiences polled by cinemascore gave film an average grade of b on an a to f scale emanuel levy felt film highly formulaic and criticized levant s direction as little more advanced than a television sitcom although he felt that script did not provide sufficient opportunity for hartman wilson and conrad to give exceptional performances he opined that schwarzenegger has developed a light comic delivery punctuated occasionally by an ironic one liner while sinbad has good moments neil jeffries of empire disagreed feeling schwarzenegger to be wooden and sinbad to be trying desperately to be funnier than his hat but praised lloyd as saving grace of film new york times critic janet maslin felt film lacked any real plot failed in its attempt at satire should have included myron s only mentioned son and mostly wasted hartman while levant s direction was listless similarly bbc s neil smith criticized film s script its focus on commercialization of christmas as well as schwarzenegger s performance which shows comic timing of a dead moose but singled out hartman for praise chicago tribune critic michael wilmington panned film wondering why characters primarily howard acted so howard langston is supposed to be a successful mattress manufacturer but movie paints him as a hot tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head jack garner of usa today condemned film finding it more cynical than satirical stating this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by potential jingle of cash registers he wrote of levant s directorial failure as he offers no sense of comic timing while pauses in midst of much of dialogue are downright painful trevor johnston suggested that film seems to mark a point of decline in schwarzenegger career arc and anti consumerism message largely failed with jim belushi s corrupt mall santa with his stolen goods warehouse provid ing film s sole flash of dark humour ign s mike drucker praised its subject matter as one of few holiday movies to directly deal with commercialization of christmas although felt last twenty minutes of film let it down as first hour or so had some family entertainment value if taken with a grain of salt he concluded film was a member of so corny its good genre while arnold delivers plenty of one liners ripe for sound board crank callers jamie malanowski of new york times praised film s satirical premise but felt it was full of unrealized potential because filmmakers wrongly equate mayhem with humor roger ebert gave film two and a half stars writing that he liked a lot of movie which he thought had energy and humor which would have mass audience appeal he was though disappointed by its relentlessly materialistic view of christmas and by choice to go with action and mild violence over dialogue and plot kevin carr of 7m pictures concluded that while film is not very good as a form of family entertainment it is surprisingly fun at 1996 stinkers bad movie awards film was nominated for three awards worst actor arnold schwarzenegger worst supporting actress rita wilson and most painfully unfunny comedy brian levant was nominated for razzie award for worst director but lost to andrew bergman for striptease sinbad however won blockbuster entertainment award for favorite supporting actor in a family film lawsuit in 1998 murray hill publishing sued 20th
