scheme following year however army s budget was cut in half and scope of scheme reduced following resolution of washington naval treaty which arguably improved australia s strategic outlook as a result of this battalion s authorised strength was reduced to just 409 men of all ranks and training and recruitment were scaled back significantly in 1927 territorial titles were introduced into australian army and battalion adopted title of east melbourne regiment at this time battalion was afforded motto secundus in 1929 following election of scullin labor government compulsory training scheme was suspended altogether as it was decided to maintain part time military force on a volunteer only basis in order to reflect change citizen forces was renamed militia at this time end of compulsory training and fiscal austerity that followed with economic downturn of great depression meant that manpower available to many militia units at this time dropped well below their authorised establishments and as a result decision was made to amalgamate a number of units subsequently 29th battalion was amalgamated with 22nd in 1930 forming 29th 22nd battalion although they were later split again in august 1939 and 29th re raised in its own right second world war and beyond following outbreak of second world war australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for

form 29th 46th battalion this unit went on to serve overseas in new guinea and on new britain after war following demobilisation of wartime army australia s part time military was re formed in 1948
