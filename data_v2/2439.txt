firmly establish mythology of series where we explored different avenues of government conspiracy and turning it into more than just flying saucers and having what writer called a defining moment for scully where agent would hear from a fellow scientist that she was dealing with truly extraterrestrial material scene where poisonous fumes were emitted by dr secare was inspired by case of gloria ramirez which occurred in california in february 1994 carter remembered this when writing script and it became an established aspect of mythology in subsequent seasons lovece 1996 p 105 writers killed off recurring character deep throat to give audiences impression that anyone outside of fox mulder and dana scully were expendable decision to shut down x files was done to separate mulder and scully allowing producers to work around gillian anderson s pregnancy which contributed to an important plot development in second season and affected rest of series lowry 1995 pp 157 fox initially opposed idea fearing that closing down x files would lead viewers to believe that show had been cancelled edward 1997 p 76 ending of this episode mirrors that of pilot including mulder calling scully at 11 21

throat s last words lowry 1995 p 156 executive producer r w goodwin decided to make his directorial debut with episode as he considered it best script by far offering a combination of elation and stark terror filming and effects opening car chase was shot by crew member j p finn who was lone producer and directed much of second unit it was shot at an abandoned shipyard in north vancouver known as shipyard goodwin went so far as saying that location was perfect for them to shoot in it would be reused in third season episode 2shy scene with fox mulder and dana scully visiting doctor berube ken kramer was a big challenge due to use of monkeys goodwin wanted monkeys to all act crazy at same time on cue when filming when looking back he said they did a pretty good job location used for warehouse where mulder finds tanks had address 1616 pandora which producers decided to incorporate into episode itself as a symbol of mulder opening pandora s box shot of dr secare resurfacing out of water was created by visual effects unit actor simon webb was raised up on a crane under water which had been levered so that he could actually be raised out of bay according to goodwin timing was not quite right but that failed shot worked on a different level and proved to be a fascinating shot scene had to be re shot later however when filming episode production crew did not know that webb had a phobia towards water first test shot of scully removing alien fetus doll from liquid nitrogen went right but under hot studio lights model started falling apart leading following take to flash
