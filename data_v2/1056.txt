thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing although word thoroughbred is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse it technically refers only to thoroughbred breed thoroughbreds are considered hot blooded horses that are known for their agility speed and spirit thoroughbred as it is known today was developed in 17th and 18th century england when native mares were crossbred with imported oriental stallions of arabian barb and turkoman breeding all modern thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally imported into england in 17th and 18th centuries and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly english breeding during 18th and 19th centuries thoroughbred breed spread throughout world they were imported into north america starting in 1730 and into australia europe japan and south america during 19th century millions of thoroughbreds exist today and around 100 000 foals are registered each year worldwide thoroughbreds are used mainly for racing but are also bred for other riding disciplines such as show jumping combined training dressage polo and fox hunting they are also commonly crossbred to create new breeds or to improve existing ones and have been influential in creation of quarter horse standardbred anglo arabian and various warmblood breeds thoroughbred racehorses perform with maximum exertion which has resulted in high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from lungs other health concerns include low fertility abnormally small hearts and a small hoof to body mass ratio there are several theories for reasons behind prevalence of accidents and health problems in thoroughbred breed and research is ongoing breed characteristics thumb upright left thoroughbreds

phifer track talk p 38 terminology thoroughbred is a distinct breed of horse although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a thoroughbred term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is purebred merriam webster merriam webster dictionary of english usage p 905 while term probably came into general use because english thoroughbred s general stud book was one of first breed registries created in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a thoroughbred except for horses belonging to thoroughbred breed nonetheless breeders of other species of purebred animals may use two terms interchangeably though thoroughbred is less often used for describing purebred animals of other species term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed though often not capitalized especially in non specialist publications and outside us for example australian stud book new york times and bbc do not capitalize

england early racing flat racing existed in england by at least 1174 when four mile races took place at smithfield in london racing continued at fairs and markets throughout middle ages and into reign of king james i of england it was then that handicapping a system of adding weight to attempt to equalize a horse s chances of winning as well as improved training procedures began to be used during reigns of charles ii william iii anne and george i foundation of thoroughbred was laid term thro bred to describe horses was first used in 1713 barrett daily telegraph chronicle of horse racing p 9

color in thoroughbreds in all about 160 stallions of oriental breeding have been traced in historical record as contributing to creation of thoroughbred addition of horses of eastern bloodlines whether arabian barb or turk to native english thoroughbred pp 22 23 ultimately led to creation of general stud book gsb in 1791 and practice of official registration of horses according to peter willett about 50 of foundation stallions appear to have been of arabian bloodlines with remainder being evenly divided between turkoman and barb breeding thumb matchem a grandson of godolphin arabian

including barb turk and other bloodlines erigero who s your momma ii animal genetics although most researchers conclude that number of eastern mares imported into england during 100 years after 1660 was small 19th century researcher bruce lowe identified 50 mare families in thoroughbred breed later augmented by other researchers to 74 erigero new research sheds light on old pedigrees animal genetics however it is probable that fewer genetically unique mare lines existed than lowe identified recent studies of mtdna of thoroughbred mares indicate that some of mare lines thought to be genetically distinct may actually have had a common ancestor in 19 mare lines studied haplotypes revealed that they traced to only 15 unique foundation mares suggesting either a common ancestor for foundation mares thought to be unrelated or recording errors in gsb later development in britain by end of 18th century english classic races had been established these are st leger stakes founded in 1776 oaks founded in 1779 and derby in 1780 later 2 000 guineas stakes and 1 000 guineas stakes were founded in 1809 and 1814 1 000 guineas and oaks are restricted to fillies but others are open to racehorses of either sex aged three years distances of these races ranging from to led to a change in breeding practices as breeders concentrated on producing horses that could race at a younger age than in past and that had more speed in early 18th century emphasis had been on longer races up to that were run in multiple heats older style of race favored older horses but with change in distances younger horses became preferred willett classic racehorse pp 34 36 selective breeding for speed and racing ability led to improvements in size of horses and winning times by middle of 19th century bay middleton a winner of epsom derby stood over 16 hands high a full hand higher than darley arabian winning times had improved to such a degree that many felt further improvement by adding additional arabian bloodlines was impossible this was borne out in 1885 when a race was held between a thoroughbred iambic considered a mid grade runner and best arabian of time asil race was over and although iambic was handicapped by carrying more than asil he still managed to beat asil by 20 lengths willett classic racehorse pp 39 41 an aspect of modern british breeding establishment is that they breed

because 100 year gap between founding of gsb and american stud book meant that most american bred horses possessed at least one or two crosses to horses not registered in gsb act was not repealed until 1949 after which a horse was only required to show that all its ancestors to ninth generation were registered in a recognized stud book willett classic racehorse pp 71 74 many felt that jersey

racing changed from older style of four mile 6 km races in which horses ran in at least two heats new style of racing involved shorter races not run in heats over distances from five furlongs up to this development meant a change in breeding practices as well as age that horses were raced with younger horses and sprinters coming to fore it was also after civil war that american thoroughbred returned to england to race iroquois became first american bred winner of epsom derby in 1881 success of american bred thoroughbreds in england led to jersey act in 1913 which limited importation of

racing club in australia was formed throughout 1830s australian colonies began to import thoroughbreds almost exclusively for racing purposes and to improve local stock each colony formed its own

business involving thoroughbreds willett thoroughbred pp 238 40 registration breeding and population thumb twilight thoroughbred mare who serves as subject of equine genome project number of thoroughbred foals registered each year in north america varies greatly chiefly linked to success of auction market which in turn depends on state of economy foal crop was over 44 000 in 1990 but declined to roughly 22 500 by 2014 largest numbers are registered in states of kentucky florida and california australia is second largest producer of thoroughbreds in world with almost 30 000 broodmares producing about 18 250 foals annually britain produces about 5 000 foals a year and worldwide there are more than 195 000 active broodmares or females being used for breeding and 118 000 newly registered foals in 2006 alone thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness generating around 34 billion in revenue annually in united states and providing about 470 000 jobs through a network of farms training centers and race tracks unlike a significant number of registered breeds today a horse cannot be registered as a thoroughbred with jockey club registry unless conceived by live cover witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion artificial insemination ai and embryo transfer et though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries cannot be used with thoroughbreds one reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with ai and although dna and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns ai still requires more detailed record keeping equine research breeding management and foal development p 349 main reason however may be economic a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover thus practice prevents an oversupply of thoroughbreds although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible as an example in 2008 australian stallion encosta de lago covered 227 mares australian stud book encosta de lago aus australian jockey club limited and victoria racing club limited retrieved 2009 1 25 by allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than couple of thousand possible with ai it also preserves high prices paid for horses of finest or most popular lineages concern exists that closed stud book and tightly regulated population of thoroughbred is at risk of loss of genetic diversity because of level of inadvertent inbreeding inevitable in such a small population according to one study 78 of alleles in current population can be traced to 30 foundation animals 27 of which are male ten foundation mares account for 72 of maternal tail female lineages and as noted above one stallion appears in 95 of tail male lineages thoroughbred pedigrees are generally traced through maternal line called distaff line line that a horse comes from is a critical factor in

a total of 385 018 600 for an average of 101 347 per horse however that average sales price reflected a variation that included at least 19 horses that sold for only 1 000 each and 34 that sold for over 1 000 000 apiece highest price paid at auction for a thoroughbred was set in 2006 at 16 000 000 for a two year old colt named green monkey record prices at auction often grab headlines though they do not necessarily reflect animal s future success in case of green monkey injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008 and he never won a race conversely even a highly successful thoroughbred may be sold by pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat best known example of this was 1986 kentucky derby winner ferdinand exported to japan to stand at stud but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002 presumably for pet food however value of a thoroughbred may also be influenced by purse money it wins in 2007 thoroughbred racehorses earned a total of 1

increase horse s price at a sale and perhaps help horse have a sounder racing career but genes for poor legs will still be passed on excess stress a high accident rate may also occur because thoroughbreds particularly in united states are first raced as 2 year olds well before they are completely mature though they may appear full grown and are in superb muscular condition their bones are
