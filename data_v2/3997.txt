detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before tucker walks free pembleton starts off acting friendly while bayliss who has taken watson case very personally is more aggressive adena used

when bayliss leaves pembleton speaks to tucker in a soft and comforting tone trying to get tucker to trust him pembleton suggests tucker had a drink and blacked out night he killed adena and he seems close to getting a confession before tucker once again insists he is innocent with four hours left before deadline bayliss returns and says tucker failed polygraph test bayliss and pembleton then aggressively team up on tucker talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions they bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against tucker involving a 14 year old girl then suggest he attempted to have sex with adena and killed her because she resisted they confront tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of adena and ask him if he is sure he didn t kill her to which a frightened and confused tucker replies not right now i m not with less than an hour left and still without a confession detectives are exhausted and tucker turns table on them he claims pembleton has attitude of a man trying to distance himself from his african american heritage because he is ashamed to be black tucker also accuses bayliss of hiding a dark side inside him that he is afraid to embrace eventually tucker admits he harbored pedophilic feelings for adena and feels shame that one great love of my life was an 11 year old girl he breaks down and cries but still insists he did not kill her 12 hour time limit and detectives fail to get a confession tucker is released and bayliss is miserable he was unable to close case pembleton who has a new respect for bayliss tries to comfort him by saying he is now convinced tucker is killer but bayliss is no longer so sure production thumb left episode was final acting role of moses gunn pictured three men and adena was directed by martin campbell and written by tom fontana executive producer of homicide life on street interrogation room at homicide division colloquially referred to by detectives as box is a setting that appears in almost every episode of homicide life on street while filming an interrogation scene there in gone for goode first episode of first season director barry levinson commented to fontana that acting from andre braugher and kyle secor was so effective an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation comments partially inspired fontana to write three men and adena fontana said i only had courage to write that episode based on fact that i had seen what braugher and secor could do in pilot episode almost entire episode of three men and adena takes place within confines of police interrogation room with braugher secor and moses gunn actor who guest starred as risley tucker it was gunn s final acting role before his death in december 1993 fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only fifth week of show but he said it was important for barry levinson and i to establish that we weren t going to do same old show every week three men and adena marked conclusion of adena watson murder case a story arc that began at start of first season watson case was based on real life 1988 baltimore slaying of kim wallace which is chronicled in homicide a year on killing streets 1991 david simon non fiction book that served as basis of homicide series elements of interview in three men and adena were incorporated from real life police interrogations in that case wallace case was never solved and fontana insisted that watson case in homicide remain unsolved as well despite pressure from nbc for a more satisfying conclusion fontana said we never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to real girl to have this fake tv solution because it s not o k that she died that no one took responsibility scene when tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn t commit murder was inspired by a similar real life interaction fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research fontana said it was so chilling and i was like oh man how do you get there martin campbell spent three days of preparation on box set analyzing it from every angle to learn feel of room fontana comes from a playwriting background and three men and adena involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting much like a play actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting according to fontana campbell never shot a scene from same angle twice so entire hour keeps changing point of view of camera so that you never get tired of being in that room while filming episode campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue then film scene again from another angle braugher said experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in performances although dialogue in final episode did not stray from original script fontana said campbell and actors came up with rhythm and pacing of performances largely on their own particularly during fast paced questions when pembleton and bayliss team up on tucker fact that tucker goes free upholds a common theme in homicide life on street that life is not always fair and that criminals sometimes get away with their crimes a conviction that often put show s producers at odds with nbc executives fontana deliberately wrote script so that it would remain ambiguous whether tucker committed murder or not he wanted character to have a genuine feeling of love for adena watson but strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed girl braugher praised fontana for creating such a three dimensional character in tucker and said fontana s genius is that we are never quite certain as to what it is that we have on our hands fontana also wanted pembleton and bayliss to have different interpretations of same interrogation bayliss begins interview convinced of man s guilt and becomes uncertain by end and pembleton has opposite experience multiple police departments have requested copies of three men and adena for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of intricacies of police interrogation process interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas including presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession during opening scene of episode bayliss watches music video for surround by british band bleach reception ratings in its original american broadcast on march 3 1993 three

fact that it was not a happy ending david p kalat writer of homicide life on street unofficial companion described episode as an astonishing tour de force of writing and acting that demonstrates all of homicide s best qualities he also praised chemistry between braugher and secor particularly when they found a common voice during interrogation rocky mountain news critic dusty saunders said

most extraordinary thing i ve ever seen in a television hour leonard praised tension setting and writing particularly when tucker turned tables on detectives he said episode was better than such works

considered three men and adena one of best homicide episodes and particularly praised performance of moses gunn mendoza also said claustrophobia of box contributes to palpable tension baltimore sun television critic david zurawik said episode established box as main stage for pembleton and moral center of homicide universe zurawik also said stark and minimalist episode was musical theater as much as television a celebration and explosion of language an angry urban opera with voices of bayliss and pembleton coming together and then falling back as tucker sings a final aria of rage and contempt calgary herald writer bruce weir said episode is homicide at its finest brilliantly written intensely acted and continuously surprising emily nussbaum of new york times called three men and adena standout episode of series and described it as a potent showcase for series smartly mordant dialogue and its willingness to explore cliches of tv detectives instead of merely repeating them los
