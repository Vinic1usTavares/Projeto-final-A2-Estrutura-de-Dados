itanium is a family of 64 bit intel microprocessors that implement intel itanium architecture formerly called ia 64 intel marketed processors for enterprise servers and high performance computing systems itanium architecture originated at hewlett packard hp and was later jointly developed by hp and intel itanium based systems have been produced by hp hp integrity servers line and several other manufacturers in 2008 itanium was fourth most deployed microprocessor architecture for enterprise class systems behind x86 64 power isa and sparc in february 2017 intel released current generation kittson to test customers and in may began shipping in volume it is last processor of itanium family intel officially announced end of life and product discontinuance of itanium cpu family on january 30 2019 history development 1989 2000 in 1989 hp determined that reduced instruction set computing risc architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle hp researchers investigated a new architecture later named explicitly parallel instruction computing epic that allows processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle epic implements a form of very long instruction word architecture in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions with epic compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at same time so microprocessor simply executes instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel goal of this approach is twofold to enable deeper inspection of code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating need for runtime scheduling circuitry hp believed that it was no longer cost effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors so it partnered with intel in 1994 to develop ia 64 architecture derived from epic intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on ia 64 in expectation that resulting microprocessor would be used by majority of enterprise systems manufacturers hp and intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering first product merced in 1998 during development intel hp and industry analysts predicted that ia 64 would dominate in servers workstations and high end desktops and eventually supplant risc and complex instruction set computing cisc architectures for all general purpose applications compaq and silicon graphics decided to abandon further development of alpha and mips architectures respectively in favor of migrating to ia 64 several groups ported operating systems for architecture including microsoft windows openvms linux hp ux solaris unix and monterey 64 latter three were canceled before reaching market by 1997 it was apparent that ia 64 architecture and compiler were much more difficult to implement than originally thought and delivery timeframe of merced began slipping intel announced official name of processor itanium on october 4 1999 within hours name itanic had been coined on a usenet newsgroup a reference to rms titanic unsinkable ocean liner that sank on her maiden voyage in 1912 itanic has since often been used by register and others to imply that multibillion dollar investment in itanium and early hype associated with it would be followed by its relatively quick demise thumb right 400px itanium server sales forecast history itanium merced 2001 by time itanium was released in june 2001 its performance was not superior to competing risc and cisc processors itanium competed at low end primarily four cpu and smaller systems with servers based on x86 processors and at high end with ibm power and sun microsystems sparc processors intel repositioned itanium to focus on high end business and hpc computing attempting to duplicate x86 s successful horizontal market i e single architecture multiple systems vendors success of this initial processor version was limited to replacing pa risc in hp systems alpha in compaq systems and mips in sgi systems though ibm also delivered a supercomputer based on this processor power and sparc remained strong while 32 bit x86 architecture continued to grow into enterprise space building on economies of scale fueled by its enormous installed base only a few thousand systems using original merced itanium processor were sold due to relatively poor performance high cost and limited software availability recognizing that lack of software could be a serious problem for future intel made thousands of these early systems available to independent software vendors to stimulate development hp and intel brought next generation itanium 2 processor to market a year later itanium 2 2002 2010 thumb intel itanium 2 9000 heat removed itanium 2 processor was released in 2002 and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for whole gamut of high end computing first itanium 2 code named mckinley was jointly developed by hp and intel it relieved many of performance problems of original itanium processor which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem mckinley contains 221 million transistors of which 25 million are for logic measured 19 5 mm by 21 6 mm 421 mm2 and was fabricated in a 180 nm bulk cmos process with six layers of aluminium samuel d et al 2002 implementation of itanium 2 microprocessor ieee journal of solid state circuits vol 37 no 11 pp 1448 1460 in 2003 amd released opteron cpu which implements its own 64 bit architecture called amd64 opteron gained rapid acceptance in enterprise server space because it provided an easy upgrade from x86 under influence by microsoft intel responded by implementing amd s x86 64 instruction set architecture instead of ia 64 in its xeon microprocessors in 2004 resulting in a new industry wide de facto standard intel released a new itanium 2 family member codenamed madison in 2003 madison used a 130 nm process and was basis of all new itanium processors until montecito was released in june 2006 in march 2005 intel announced that it was working on a new itanium processor codenamed tukwila to be released in 2007 tukwila would have four processor cores and would replace itanium bus with a new common system interface which would also be used by a new xeon processor later that year intel revised tukwila s delivery date to late 2008 in november 2005 major itanium server manufacturers joined with intel and a number of software vendors to form itanium solutions alliance to promote architecture and accelerate software porting alliance announced that its members would invest 10 billion in itanium solutions by end of decade in 2006 intel delivered montecito marketed as itanium 2 9000 series a dual core processor that roughly doubled performance and decreased energy consumption by about 20 percent intel released itanium 2 9100 series codenamed montvale in november 2007 in may 2009 schedule for tukwila its follow on was revised again with release to oems planned for first quarter of 2010 itanium 9300

intel around 440 million to keep producing and updating itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014 in 2010 two companies signed another 250 million deal which obliged intel to continue making itanium cpus for hp s machines until 2017 under terms of agreements hp has to pay for chips it gets from intel while intel launches tukwila poulson kittson and kittson chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of platform itanium 9700 kittson 2017 rumors of a successor to poulson code named kittson began to circulate in 2012 2013 this was at first associated with a forthcoming 22 nm process shrink and later revised in face of declining itanium sales to a less ambitious 32 nm node in april 2015 intel although it had not yet confirmed formal specifications did confirm that it continued to work on project meanwhile aggressively multicore xeon e7 platform displaced itanium based solutions in intel roadmap in july 2016 hp spin off hewlett packard enterprise hpe announced in computer world

controllers chipset is heart of system level architecture for each system design development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to use of itanium ibm created a chipset in 2003 and intel in 2002 but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as ddr2 or pci express before tukwila moved away from fsb chipsets supporting such technologies were manufactured by all itanium server vendors such as hp fujitsu sgi nec and hitachi tukwila itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with intel xeon processor ex intel s xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers goal was to streamline system development and reduce costs for server oems many of which develop both itanium and
