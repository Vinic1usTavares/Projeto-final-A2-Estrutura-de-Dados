in united states acting white is a pejorative term usually applied to black people which refers to a person s perceived betrayal of their culture by assuming social expectations of white society success in education in particular depending on one s cultural background can be seen as a form of selling out by being disloyal to one s culture term is controversial and its precise meaning is hard to define some minority students are discouraged from achieving in school by negative prejudices of ethnic peers such a view has been expressed in articles in new york times time magazine and wall street journal and by public figures and academics across political spectrum history of usage thumb 150px right sex offender comedian and media figure bill cosby brought term to wider knowledge in a 2004 speech question of whether or not acting white attitudes are prevalent has been debated in academic literature in 1986 nigerian sociologist john ogbu co authored with signithia fordham co authored a study that concluded that high performing african american students in a washington d c and acting white theory was born black comedian media figure and convicted sex offender bill cosby used term in what became a noted may 2004 speech when he challenged black community against idea that gaining education was acting white black people accused of acting white are sometimes referred to as black anglo saxons a term coined by comedian paul mooney case studies and research not all scholars define acting white in same way most definitions include a reference to situations where some minority adolescents ridicule their peers for engaging in behaviors perceived to be characteristic of whites in this scenario they equate white behavior with high grades in school a result researchers can quantify but term is not limited to this in 1986 signithia fordham co authored with nigerian sociologist john ogbu a study that concluded that high performing african american students in a washington d c high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture as part of a strategy for achievement while struggling to maintain a black identity ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book black american students in an affluent suburb a study of academic disengagement concluding that black students own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work minority education and caste 1978 that school disengagement among caste like minorities occurs because white society limits job success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling in his new book he said that non whites failed to observe link between educational achievement and access to jobs in 1997 scholars philip j cook and jens ludwig published a report finding that blacks do not face any stronger social pressures than whites to succeed in school nor do they have greater feelings of alienation towards education in general they noted anecdotal and ethnographic research confirming that minority students hold these views but they concluded that these are not inherently and do not substantially affect student behavior in classroom they labeled issue something of a distraction from what they saw as more important educational reforms philip j cook and jens ludwig weighing burden of acting white are there race differences in attitudes toward education journal of policy analysis and management vol 16 no 2 spring 1997 pp 256 78 though ogbu s 1978 study s conclusion was widely discussed a 2003 work also challenged its validity in 2003 karolyn tyson a sociologist and william darity jr an economist of university of north carolina at chapel hill conducted an 18 month study at 11 north carolina schools study concluded that white and black students have essentially same attitudes about scholastic achievement students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self esteem when they do better in school they compared attitudes identified as acting white to normal adolescent pains experienced in john hughes movies a 2010 study roland g fryer jr and paul torelli suggested that phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels but might explain a significant role in disparities between black and white students at high achievement levels fryer has also written that in contrast to fordham and ogbu s theory acting white prejudices are actually more common more integrated school with historically black schools free of any effects he found that groups such as italian immigrants in boston s west end and maori of new zealand display similar behaviors he concluded that there is necessarily a trade off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low achieving group especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders a fundamental drawback of much of research so far is that people studied have been asked to rate their own popularity in eyes of others which naturally brings those scores into question roland g fryer jr has remarked asking teenagers whether they re popular is like asking them if they re having sex stuart buck a lawyer also explored this issue in acting white ironic legacy of desegregation 2010 he said that segregated black schools had featured teachers counselors and others of same race as student population and adults often acted as mentors to students integration of many public schools since mid to late 20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites a black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave minority group margaret beale spencer and vinay harpalani 2008 margaret beale spencer vinay harpalani what does acting white actually mean racial identity adolescent development and academic achievement among black youth in minority status oppositional culture and schooling 222 john u ogbu ed 2008 argue that usage of term acting white by black teenagers does not reflect their cultural values rather it is a manifestation of their racial identity development experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure spencer and harpalani employ william e cross s 1991 framework and contend that black teenagers use of acting white in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers use of term nerd only difference is that black teenagers express it in racialized terms as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be black expressions such as acting white may or may not reflect black teenagers cultural values and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive for example ogbu 2003 himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of acting white by her black peers because like white people she did not have to process her hair these kind of examples show that accusations of acting white are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes although such accusations may reflect these attributes rather acting white is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be black in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles that is also why such accusations are less common among black adults who have come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues commentary political observer john mcwhorter has commented t have a variety of identities open to them for trying on anti establishment postures white kids can be stoners or goths black kids can be nonwhite he interpreted those kids as black nerds he stated that acting white attitude developed as creation of an other among newly integrated african american kids in their 2003 study tyson and darity said that school staff and faculty who hold racist attitudes about ability of black students use acting white disparagement as a cover for disparities in student performance shelby steele wrote in content of our character that what he identified as middle class black values are falsely viewed by majority of blacks as white while they are colorblind he argued that this attitude is distinct from other issues of young blacks in poverty kenji yoshino a new york university school of law professor in his covering hidden assault on our civil rights 2006 criticizes social pressures to conform to mainstream white culture he said this violated african americans civil rights and they can uphold their own social distinctions he said they should be able to freely choose to identify with white culture if they wish anne arnett ferguson a professor at smith college wrote in 2001 that white culture ruthlessly excludes african american cultural modes as relevant and meaningful she highlighted insistence in schools of standard english over black vernacular english as an example clarence page made comparison to crab mentality on news
