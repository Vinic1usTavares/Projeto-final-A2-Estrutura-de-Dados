viceroy and denied him protection of troops under his command castelli and martin rodriguez moved to fort for an interview with cisneros juan florencio commander of infantry grenadiers joined them

priest julian s de aguero said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him lopez pp 51 53 he feared that no matter which party prevailed in open cabildo it would take revenge against other mutiny of alzaga being a recent precedent he felt that open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of aforementioned manipulation of guest list meeting lasted from morning to midnight including reading of proclamation debate and vote mitre p 327 there was no secret ballot votes were heard one at a time and recorded in minutes galasso p 53 main themes of debate were legitimacy of government and authority of viceroy principle of retroversion of sovereignty to people stated that in absence of legitimate monarch power returned to people they were entitled to form a new government this principle was commonplace in spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy but had never been applied in case law luna independencia p 32 its validity divided assembly into two main groups one group rejected it and argued that situation should remain unchanged this group supported cisneros as viceroy other group supported change and considered that they should establish a junta like ones established in spain to replace viceroy mitre pp 315 316 there was also a third position taking middle ground luna

between criollos and peninsulars viceroy supporters felt that will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos galasso p 54 one of speakers for first position was bishop of buenos aires benito lue y riega leader of local church who said not only is there no reason to get rid of viceroy but even if no part of spain remained unsubdued spaniards in america ought to take it back and resume command over it america should only be ruled by natives when there is no longer a spaniard there if even a single member of central junta of seville were to land on our shores we should receive him as sovereign cited by pigna p 234 juan jose castelli was main speaker for revolutionaries he based his speech on two key ideas government s lapsed legitimacy he stated that supreme central junta was dissolved and had no rights to designate a regency and principle of retroversion of sovereignty he spoke after riega and replied that american people should assume control of their government until ferdinand vii could return to throne nobody could call whole nation a criminal nor individuals that have aired their political views if right of conquest belongs by right to conquering country it would be fair for spain to quit resisting french and submit to them by same principles for which it is expected that americans submit themselves to peoples of pontevedra reason and rule must be equal for everybody here there are no conquerors or conquered here there are only spaniards spaniards of spain have lost their land spaniards of america are trying to save theirs let ones from spain deal with themselves as they can do not worry we american spaniards know what we want and where we go so i suggest we vote that we replace viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to parent state if it is saved from french and independent if spain is finally subjugated cited by pigna p 236 pascual ruiz huidobro stated that since authority that appointed cisneros had expired cisneros should no

of buenos aires had no right to make unilateral decisions about legitimacy of viceroy or council of regency without participation of other cities of viceroyalty he argued that such an action would break unity of country and establish as many as there were cities his intention was to keep cisneros in power by delaying any possible action juan jose paso accepted his first point but argued that situation in europe and possibility that napoleon s forces could conquer american colonies demanded an urgent resolution pigna p 237 he then expounded argument of elder sister reasoning that buenos aires should take initiative and make changes deemed necessary and appropriate on express condition that other cities would be invited to comment as soon as possible luna breve p 62 rhetorical device of elder sister comparable to lopez p 92 makes an analogy between relationship of buenos aires and other cities of viceroyalty with a sibling relationship priest juan nepomuceno sola then proposed that cabildo should receive provisional command until formation of a governing junta made up of representatives from all populations of viceroyalty manuel alberti miguel de azcuenaga who would be members of primera junta some days later and or aguirre supported his vote among others cornelio saavedra suggested that cabildo should receive provisional command until formation of a governing junta in manner and form that cabildo would deem as appropriate he said there shall be no doubt that it is people that create authority or command cited by abad de santillan p 408 at time of vote castelli s position coincided with that of saavedra abad de santillan p 409 manuel belgrano stood near a window and in event of a problematic development he would give a signal by waiving a white cloth upon

cisneros galasso p 60 there were also many different proposals involving removal of cisneros many of them required new authorities to be elected by cabildo pascual ruiz huidobro proposed that cabildo should rule in interim and appoint a new government but this proposal made no reference to popular sovereignty or creation of a junta this proposal received 35 votes and sought simply to replace cisneros with huidobro huidobro was most senior military officer and thus natural candidate under current laws to replace viceroy in lack of a new appointment from spain galasso pp 61 62 juan nepomuceno sola proposed a junta composed of delegates from all provinces of viceroyalty while cabildo should govern in interim this proposal received nearly 20 votes galasso p 62 cornelio saavedra

representatives from other cities leiva arranged for former viceroy cisneros to be appointed president of junta and commander of armed forces galasso p 67 p 277 there are many interpretations of his motives for departing from decision of open cabildo in this way four other members were appointed to junta criollos cornelio saavedra and juan jose castelli and peninsulars juan nepomuceno sola and jose santos leiva wrote a constitutional code to regulate actions of junta it stipulated that junta could not exercise judicial power which was reserved for royal audiencia of buenos aires that cisneros could not act without support of other members of junta that cabildo could dismiss anyone who neglected his duty that cabildo s consent would be required to create new taxes that junta would sanction a general amnesty for those who had aired opinions at open cabildo and that junta would invite other cities to send delegates commanders of armed forces including saavedra and pedro andres garcia agreed to this code junta swore oath of office that afternoon lopez p 64 these developments shocked revolutionaries unsure of what to do next they feared that they would be punished like revolutionaries of chuquisaca and la paz lopez p 59 moreno abjured relations with others and shut himself in his home lopez p 60 there was a meeting at rodriguez pena s house they felt that cabildo would not pursue such a plot without blessing of saavedra and that castelli should resign from junta tagle took a different view he thought that saavedra may have accepted out of weakness or naivety

than viceroy was seen as an insult to will of open cabildo colonel martin rodriguez warned that if army were to commit support to a government that kept cisneros they would soon have to fire on people and that they would revolt galasso p 74 he said that everyone without exception demanded removal of cisneros that night castelli and saavedra informed cisneros of their resignation from newly formed junta lopez p 66 they explained that population was on verge of violent revolution and would remove cisneros by force if he did not resign as well they warned that they did not have power to stop that neither castelli to stop his friends nor saavedra to prevent regiment of patricians from mutiny cisneros wanted to wait for following day but they said that there was no time for further delays so he finally agreed to resign lopez p 67 he sent a resignation letter to cabildo for consideration on following day chiclana felt encouraged when saavedra resigned and started to request signatures for a manifesto about will of people moreno refused any further involvement but castelli and pena trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected lopez p 68 friday may 25 thumb alt depiction of events of may 25 people gathered in front of buenos aires cabildo on morning of may 25 in spite of bad weather a crowd gathered in plaza de la victoria as did militia led by domingo french and antonio beruti abad de santillan p 411 they demanded recall of junta elected previous day final resignation of cisneros and appointment of a new junta that did not include him historian bartolome mitre stated that french and beruti distributed blue and white ribbons similar to modern cockade of argentina among those present mitre pp 341 342 later historians doubt it but consider it possible that revolutionaries used distinctive marks of some kind for identification galasso p 81 it was rumored that cabildo might reject cisneros resignation luna independencia p 37 because of delays in issuing an official resolution crowd became agitated clamoring that people want to know what is going on galasso p 84 cabildo met at 9 am and rejected cisneros resignation galasso p 82 they considered that crowd had no legitimate right to influence something that cabildo had already decided and implemented they considered that as junta was in command demonstration should be suppressed by force and made members responsible for any changes to resolution of previous day to enforce those orders they summoned chief commanders but these did not obey galasso p 83 many of them including saavedra did not appear those that did stated that they could not support government order and that commanders would be disobeyed if they ordered troops to repress demonstrators crowd s agitation increased and they overran chapter house lopez p 70 71 leiva and lezica requested that someone who could act as spokesman for people should join them inside hall and explain people s desires lopez p 71 beruti chiclana french and grela were allowed to pass leiva attempted to discourage rioter pancho planes but he entered hall as well cabildo argued that buenos aires had no right to break political system of viceroyalty without discussing it with other provinces french and chiclana replied that call for a congress had already been considered cabildo called commanders to deliberate with them lopez p 73 as had happened several times in last few days romero explained that soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against rioters on behalf of cisneros lopez pp 74 75 cabildo still refused to give up until noise of demonstration was heard in hall lopez p 75 they feared that demonstrators could overrun building and reach them martin rodriguez pointed out that only way to calm demonstrators was to accept cisneros resignation leiva agreed convinced other members and people returned to plaza rodriguez headed to azcuenaga s house to meet other revolutionaries to plan final stages of revolution demonstration overran cabildo again and reached hall of deliberations lopez p 76 beruti spoke on behalf of people and said that new junta should be elected by people and not by cabildo he said that besides nearly 400 people already gathered barracks were full of people who supported them and he threatened that they would take control by force if necessary lopez p 77 cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing thumb left alt allegoric images of members of primera junta members of primera junta after a long interval a document containing 411 signatures was

well known residents and contained many illegible signatures french and beruti signed document stating for me and for six hundred more however there is no unanimous view among historians about authorship of document scenna pp 38 47 meanwhile weather improved and sun broke through clouds people in plaza saw it as a favorable omen for revolution sun of may was created a few years later with reference to this event cabildo accepted document and moved to balcony to submit it directly to people for ratification but because of late hour and weather number of people in plaza had declined leiva ridiculed claim of remaining representatives to speak on behalf of people lopez p 78 this wore patience of few who were still in plaza in rain beruti did not accept any further delays and threatened to call people to arms facing prospect of further violence popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present primera junta was finally established it was composed by president cornelio saavedra members manuel alberti miguel de azcuenaga manuel belgrano juan jose castelli domingo matheu and juan larrea and secretaries juan jose paso and mariano moreno rules governing it were roughly same as those issued day before with additional provisions that cabildo would watch over members of junta and that junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies lopez p 79 saavedra spoke to crowd and then moved on to fort among salvos of artillery and ringing of bells lopez p 81 meanwhile cisneros dispatched a post rider to cordoba argentina to warn santiago de liniers about what had happened in buenos aires and to request military action against junta abad de santillan p 424 aftermath thumb alt portrait of primera junta primera junta ruled after revolution buenos aires endured whole spanish american wars of independence without being reconquered by royalist armies or successful royalist counter revolutions bethell p 116 however it faced several internal conflicts may revolution lacked a clear leader as other regions of latin america secretary mariano moreno led initial phase of government but he was removed shortly afterwards bethell pp 116 117 council of regency royal audiencia of buenos aires and peninsulars opposed new situation luna independencia p 46 royal audiencia secretly swore allegiance to council of regency a month later and sent communiques to other cities of viceroyalty to request them to deny recognition to new government luna independencia p 48 to put an end to these activities junta assembled cisneros and all members of royal audiencia on pretext that their lives were in danger and sent them into exile aboard british ship dart luna independencia p 47 captain mark was instructed to avoid american ports and deliver all of them directly to canary islands junta then appointed a new audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to revolution luna independencia p 49 every city in territory of modern argentina other than cordoba endorsed primera junta cities of upper peru however did not take a position owing to recent outcomes of chuquisaca and la paz revolutions asuncion del paraguay rejected junta and swore loyalty to council of regency banda oriental under francisco javier de elio remained a royalist stronghold former viceroy santiago de liniers organized a counter revolution in cordoba and this became first military campaign of independent government despite importance of liniers himself and his prestige as a popular hero for his role when british invaded population of cordoba preferred to support revolution domina p 80 this reduced power of counter revolutionary army by means of desertions and sabotage luna mariano moreno p 108 liniers s troops were quickly defeated by forces led by francisco ortiz de ocampo abad de santillan p 425 ocampo refused to shoot captive liniers hence execution ordered by junta was carried out by juan jose castelli after victory primera junta sent military expeditions to many other cities to demand support and election of representatives to it santillan pp 426 thumb left alt portrait of mariano moreno mariano moreno was an influential member of primera junta montevideo which had a historical rivalry with buenos aires opposed primera junta and council of regency declared it new capital of viceroyalty along with francisco

supported buenos aires junta luna independencia p 52 jose gervasio artigas led them and kept montevideo under siege luna independencia p 62 final defeat of montevidean royalists was carried out in 1814 by carlos maria de alvear and william brown santillan p 516 captaincy general of chile followed a process analogous to that of may revolution and elected a government junta that inaugurated brief period known as patria vieja junta was defeated in 1814 at battle of rancagua and subsequent reconquista of chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more andes provided an effective natural barrier between argentine revolutionaries and chile so there was no military confrontation between them until crossing of andes led by jose de san martin in 1817 a campaign that resulted in defeat of chilean royalists luna independencia pp 108 116 primera junta increased in size when it incorporated representatives sent by provinces bethell p 117 from then on junta was renamed junta grande luna independencia pp 61 62 it was dissolved shortly after june 1811 defeat of argentine troops at battle of and two successive exercised executive power over united provinces of rio de la plata luna

viceroyalty of peru at salta while san martin advanced towards royalist stronghold of lima by sea on a chilean argentine campaign war for independence gradually shifted towards northern south america luna independencia pp 116 126 from 1814 argentina descended into civil war abad de santillan pp 524 525 consequences according to historian felix luna s breve historia de los argentinos one of most important societal consequences of may revolution was shift in way people and its rulers related luna breve p 65 until then conception of common good prevailed while royal authority was fully respected if an instruction from crown of spain was considered detrimental to common good of local population it was half met or simply ignored with revolution concept of common good gave way to that of popular sovereignty as theorized by moreno castelli and monteagudo among others luna breve pp 65 66 this idea held that in absence of a legitimate authority people had right to appoint their own leaders luna breve p 66 over time popular sovereignty would give way to idea of majority rule this maturation of ideas was gradual taking many decades to crystallize into stable electoral and political systems but it was what ultimately led to adoption of republican system as form of government for argentina domingo faustino sarmiento stated similar views in his facundo and noted that cities were more receptive to republican ideas while rural areas were more resistant to them which led to surge of caudillos sarmiento p 79 another consequence also according to luna was dissolution of viceroyalty of rio de la plata into several different units most of cities and provinces had distinctive populations economies attitudes contexts and interests until revolution all of these peoples were held together by authority of spanish government but with its disappearance people from montevideo paraguay and upper peru began to distance themselves from buenos aires luna breve p 67 brief existence of viceroyalty of rio de la plata which had lasted barely 38 years impeded consolidation of a patriotic feeling and failed to bring a sense of community to all of population new country of argentina lacked an established concept of national identity capable to unite population under a common idea of statehood shumway pp 3 4 juan bautista alberdi sees may revolution as one of early manifestations of power struggles between city of buenos aires and provinces one of axial conflicts at play in argentine civil wars domina pp 84 85 alberdi wrote in his book escritos revolution of may 1810 in buenos aires intended to win independence of argentina from spain also had consequence of emancipating province of buenos aires from argentina or rather of imposing authority of this province upon whole nation emancipated from spain that day spanish power over argentine provinces ended and that of buenos aires was established historical perspectives historiographical studies of may revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details most of information was properly recorded at time and was made available to public by primera junta as patriotic propaganda because of this historical views on topic differ in their interpretations of meanings causes and consequences of events rather than in accuracy of their depiction of events themselves modern version of events does not differ significantly from contemporary one archer pp 3 5 thumb upright alt portrait of bartolome mitre bartolome mitre wrote one of first historical interpretations of may revolution first people to write about may revolution were participants who wrote memoirs biographies and diaries gelman p 32 however their works were motivated by purposes other than historiographic ones such as to explain reasons for their actions clean their public images or express their support or rejection of public figures and ideas of time for example manuel moreno wrote biography of his brother mariano as propaganda for revolutions in europe gelman pp 53 54 and cornelio saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned to justify himself to his sons saavedra pp 105 106 first remarkable historiographical school of interpretation of history of argentina was founded by members of 1837 generation including bartolome mitre poli gonzalvo pp 19 20 mitre regarded may revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by spanish monarchy and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to charismatic authority of caudillos poli gonzalvo p 22 these authors views were treated as canonical until end of 19th century when proximity of centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives gelman p 187 newer authors would differ about relative weight of causes of may revolution and about whose intervention in events was more decisive but main views expressed by mitre were kept gelman p 191 such as to consider revolution to be birth of modern p 16 and an unavoidable event gelman p 17 these authors introduced idea of popular intervention as another key element by time of world wars liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective ricardo levene and academia nacional de la historia were exponents of this tendency which still kept most perspectives of mitre gelman p 256 left wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti imperialism they minimized dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism gelman p 257 however most of their work was focused on other historical periods may revolution was not product of actions of a single political party with a clear and defined agenda but a convergence of sectors with varying interests galasso p 86 thus there are a number of conflicting perspectives about it because different authors highlight different aspects galasso pp 86 87 mitre for example referred to representation of landowners an 1809 economic report by mariano moreno and role of merchants to support view that may revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with europe galasso p 87 right wing revisionists center around saavedra and social customs of time to describe revolution under conservative principles and left wing revisionists use example of moreno castelli and rioters led by french and beruti to describe it as a radical revolution revolutionary purposes thumb alt portrait of ferdinand vii revolutionaries of may revolution declared loyalty to ferdinand vii of spain government created on may 25 pronounced itself loyal to deposed king of spain ferdinand vii but historians disagree on whether this was sincere or not bethell p 103 since mitre many historians think that this professed loyalty was merely a political deception to gain autonomy mitre pp 325 mariano moreno p p 106 p 96 primera junta did not pledge allegiance to council of regency which was still in operation and in 1810 it still seemed unlikely that napoleon would be defeated and ferdinand returned to throne which finally happened on december 11 1813 with treaty of pigna p 243 purpose of such a deception would have been to gain time to strengthen position of patriotic cause and avoid reactions that may have led to a counter revolution by making it appear that monarchical authority was still respected and that no revolution had taken place ruse is known as mask of ferdinand vii it was upheld by primera junta junta grande and first triumvirate assembly of year xiii was intended to declare independence but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members pigna p 377 however it suppressed mention of ferdinand vii in official documents luna independencia p 82 before declaration of independence of 1816 supreme directors considered other options such as to negotiate with spain or become a british protectorate fermin chavez change was potentially favorable for britain as trade with cities of area was facilitated without monopoly that spain had maintained over their colonies for centuries kaufmann p 49 however britain s first priority was war against france in europe and they could not appear to support american independence movements or allow military attention of spain to be divided onto two different fronts bethell p 106 consequently they pushed to avoid explicit independence demonstrations bethell p 107 this pressure was exerted by lord strangford british ambassador at court of rio de janeiro he expressed support for junta but under condition that behavior is consistent and that capital is retained on behalf of mr dn ferdinand vii and his legitimate successors strangford cited by p 130 later conflicts between buenos aires montevideo and artigas led to internal conflicts on british front between strangford and portuguese regent john vi of portugal kaufmann p 59 juan bautista alberdi and later historians such as norberto galasso luis romero and jose carlos doubted mitre s interpretation and put forward different ones alberdi thought that argentine revolution is a chapter of revolution as also of spanish one as also of french and european one alberdi pp 64 69 they did not consider it a dispute between independentism and colonialism but instead a dispute between new libertarian ideas and absolutism abad de santillan p 413 intention was not to cut ties with spain but to relationship similarly american revolution was not separatist at its initial steps either thus it would have characteristics of a civil war instead galasso p 23 some points that would justify idea would be inclusion of larrea matheu and belgrano in junta and later appearance of jose de san martin larrea and matheu were spanish belgrano studied for many years in spain galasso pp 10 11 and san martin had spent most of his adult life waging war in spain against french galasso p 12 when san martin talked about enemies he called them royalists or goths but never spanish galasso p 11 according to those historians spanish revolution against absolutism got mixed up with peninsular war galasso p 16 when ferdinand vii stood against his father charles iv who was seen as an absolutist king many spaniards got mistaken impression that he sympathized with new enlightened ideas galasso p 18 thus revolutions made in americas in name of ferdinand vii such as may revolution chuquisaca revolution or one in chile would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under new ideas galasso p 24 even if spain was at war with france ideals of french revolution liberty equality and fraternity were still respected galasso p 17 those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of napoleon but did not face any active french military attack they promoted instead fights between spanish armies for keeping either old or new order galasso p 21 this situation would change with final defeat of napoleon and return of ferdinand vii to throne as he began absolutist restoration and persecuted supporters of new libertarian ideas within spain for people in south america to stay as a part of spanish empire but with a new relationship with mother country was no longer a feasible option only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism legacy thumb upright alt commemorative monument at plaza de mayo may pyramid commemorative monument at plaza de mayo may 25 is a national day in argentina known as first patriotic government with character of a public holiday public holiday is set by law 21 329 and is always celebrated on may 25 regardless of day of week argentina centennial and argentina bicentennial were celebrated in 1910 and 2010 may 25 was designated as a patriotic date in 1813 but argentine declaration of independence suggests july 9 as an alternative national day at first this added to conflicts between buenos aires and provinces during argentine civil war because date in may related to buenos aires and date of july 9 related to whole country silvia sigal thus unitarian bernardino rivadavia canceled celebration of july 9 and federalist juan manuel de rosas allowed it again but maintained may celebrations by 1880
