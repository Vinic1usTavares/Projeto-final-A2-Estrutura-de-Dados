rival green bay packers 191st meeting in two teams history and third season opener in which both teams played each other in chicago bears held a 93 91 6 all time lead and also led series in season opener record with 17 12 2 however packers had won nine of last ten games between two including last game a 55 14 victory at lambeau field wbbm tv analyst jeff joniak believed bears would have to run to gain an advantage against packers when chicago played green bay in week four last season latter had 30th ranked run defense and allowed 235 rushing yards in that game additionally offense had to avoid drives that required long yardage as bears had scored 74 points outside of red zone 29th best in league while also protecting quarterback jay cutler from linebackers julius peppers and clay matthews iii on defense new 3 4 defense faced a fast paced green bay offense featuring quarterback aaron rodgers and tailback eddie lacy rodgers led packers who led nfc north in touchdowns with 58 along with having highest average yards per play 6 17 in nfl in 2014 also provided a challenge for bears defensive backs blitzing rodgers was also a liability as he had a league best 130 4 rating with 15 touchdowns and one interception against blitz however packers did not have receiver jordy nelson who had caught 13 touchdowns in 2014 as he had suffered an acl tear during preseason quarterback david fales cornerback tracy porter runningback ka deem carey linebacker jon bostic center hroniss grasu tackle tayo fabuluje and receiver cameron meredith were inactive for game packers won coin toss and elected to defer meaning bears started game with ball on first possession of game bears offense reached as far as packers eight yard line but ended with robbie gould kicking a 28 yard field goal after packers punted bears came close to allowing a turnover when cutler was sacked by peppers and fumbled though call was reversed next four drives of game ended in scores for both teams packers scored with rodgers 13 yard touchdown pass to james jones followed by bears reclaiming lead in second quarter with matt forte s one yard touchdown run next two possessions concluded with field goals mason crosby tied game with a 37 yarder though bears ended first half with 13 10 lead with gould s 50 yarder prior to forte s touchdown run gould had kicked a 27 yard field goal but sam shields was offsides on play giving bears a 4th and 1 which bears capitalized with via forte s one yard run bears then had two potential touchdowns nullified by forte dropping a pass and receiver alshon jeffery s touchdown was canceled by tackle jermon bushrod s holding penalty packers also had a potential touchdown hurt by a penalty as rodgers had an eight yard touchdown pass to jones voided by holding penalties in second half packers scored quickly with jones one yard touchdown catch bears responded with gould s 44 yard field goal but packers eventually scored again via randall cobb s five yard touchdown catch on chicago s following drive offense drove to green bay s six yard line to set up a first and goal situation while forte s four yard run brought bears to two cutler s passes to eddie royal jeffery and royal again fell incomplete leading to bears turning ball over on downs packers punted again but bears failed to score when cutler was intercepted by matthews turnover set up lacy s two yard touchdown run to increase score to 31 16 with 1 55 left in game with 34 seconds left bears scored with cutler s 24 yard touchdown pass to tight end martellus bennett narrowing margin to eight points however green bay s davante adams recovered onside kick and packers ran out clock to end game gould s first field goal of game allowed him to set franchise record for most field goals with 244 breaking a tie with kevin butler forte recorded 184 rushing yards in game most by a bears running back in a loss since walter payton s 175 yards in a 1984 loss to packers week 2 vs arizona cardinals chicago hosted arizona in week two 92nd meeting all time bears who possessed a 58 27 6 record against cardinals entering game won most recent meeting in 2012 28 13 though arizona won last game at soldier field in 2009 41 21 bears faced a 3 4 defense for second consecutive week and cardinals had a blitz heavy defense to attack it jeff joniak wrote matt forte would have to be utilized when passing bears had to be wary of left side cornerback patrick peterson in 2014 arizona s opponents only threw passes of at least ten yards to that side 29 times fifth lowest in nfl as a result teams attempted to throw to right with 51 deep passes though only 29 4 percent were completed sixth lowest in league defensively bears had to provide pressure to carson palmer who had excelled in season opener against saints with a three touchdown game against a line that allowed no sacks in week one while also focusing on challenging speed of arizona receivers lineman ego ferguson ka deem carey hroniss grasu jon bostic tayo fabuluje were inactive for game cardinals won toss and decided to receive on opening kickoff david johnson returned it 108 yards for a touchdown after both teams exchanged punts receiver josh bellamy caught a 48 yard touchdown pass from cutler his first career touchdown reception on cardinals ensuing drive bears forced fourth down after palmer s pass to johnson went out of bounds but was reversed after it was determined he had a knee and elbow two plays later arizona gained 42 yards on palmer s pass to john brown added with a defensive pass interference penalty on corner kyle fuller placing offense at bears 11 yard line after two plays palmer threw a six yard touchdown pass to jaron brown on chicago s next drive runningback jeremy langford scored on a one yard dive however cardinals scored two touchdowns in 52 seconds after larry fitzgerald s eight yard touchdown reception tony jefferson intercepted cutler scoring on 26 yard return cutler tried to dive to tackle jefferson but landed on his right shoulder and suffered a hamstring injury jimmy clausen replaced cutler for rest of game despite losing cutler bears were able to score three points with robbie gould s 40 yard field goal and got ball back on next drive with linebacker jared allen intercepting palmer s pass intended for j j nelson on first play however bears had to settle for gould s 23 yard field goal in third quarter clausen s pass for marquess wilson was intercepted by patrick peterson with cardinals capitalizing on turnover with palmer s 28 yard touchdown pass to fitzgerald after bears punted arizona increased score with johnson s 13 yard touchdown run gould eventually kicked a 51 yard field goal to make score 42 23 but fitzgerald caught another touchdown pass this time of nine yards to widen margin by 25 points though chandler catanzaro s extra point was wide left bears fell to 0 2 for first time since 2003 while 48 points allowed were most at home in team history week 3 at seattle seahawks bears first away game of season occurred in seattle who led all time series 10 6 including last three regular season games however bears had won last game in seattle in 2009 25 19 bears offense not featuring jay cutler nor alshon jeffery faced a defense led by kam chancellor who returned to seahawks after a holdout without chancellor for first two games of season defense had allowed quarterbacks to complete 72 percent of their passes with a passer rating of 116 4 jeff joniak believed that to counter legion of boom bears had to balance rushing and passing attacks while watching for a blitz that pressured aaron rodgers 19 times in week two on defense bears had to watch for quarterback russell wilson though he had struggled with pressure in first two games being sacked a total of eight times additionally run defense had to be aware of a running game led by lynch corps had averaged 121 5 yards per game on special teams bears had to stop speedy rookie receiver tyler lockett who had scored on a punt return earlier in season seahawks won coin toss and kicked off before bears first offensive play they were penalized for delay of game and eventually punted after both teams each traded punts once seattle s richard sherman utilized a trick punt return similar to one bears had utilized with devin hester and johnny knox in past to record a 64 yard return to bears 19 yard line seattle eventually scored first with steven hauschka s 31 yard field goal five drives all of which ended in punts for both teams later seahawks ended first half with hauschka s 21 yarder prior to seahawks last drive controversy over bears last punt arose after pat o donnell punted ball started to bounce out of bounds but it hit seahawks linebacker brock coyle in leg making it available to recover with defensive back sherrick mcmanis taking advantage however officials ruled punt as downed by mcmanis which led to john fox challenging call though it stood

bears punted on all ten drives in game first time since data was first compiled in despite hardships defense improved allowing only one touchdown after allowing five against cardinals additionally having game as one of two teams without a sack bears recorded four against seattle two each by defensive end jarvis jenkins and linebacker pernell mcphee week 4 vs raiders returning to soldier field for week four bears hosted oakland raiders who held a 7 6 all time lead entering game this was first game between two at soldier field since 2003 where bears won 24 21 and first since 2011 when raiders won 25 20 in oakland bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end khalil mack while secondary is guided by 39 year old charles woodson who possessed 61 career interceptions and had sealed raiders win previous week against browns however raiders had struggled against tight ends allowing five catches of at least 25 yards with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across first three games on defense chicago was against quarterback derek carr who led raiders offense to 74 combined points in last two games along with rookie receiver amari cooper who had 20 receptions entering game while also recording a 68 yard touchdown in week two jeff joniak wrote that bears had to prevent raiders from gaining yardage after touching ball raiders were seventh in yards after catch while latavius murray who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three was ranked fourth in league in rushing yards and was leading afc in yards per carry with 4 8 ranked fifth in yards after contact cooper had 177 yards after catch second most in league among wide receivers while 53 7 percent of carr s passing yards occurred due to these plays in comparison bears allowed fewest yards after contact david fales punter patrick o donnell alshon jeffery ka deem carey hroniss grasu tackle jermon bushrod and nose tackle jeremiah ratliff were inactive raiders won coin toss and deferred in second half bears managed to record an 80 yard drive to score on opening possession via jay cutler s seven yard touchdown pass to eddie royal during drive lineman charles leno landed on center will montgomery s leg injuring latter and prompting matt slauson to replace him robbie gould s extra point was blocked and his struggles continued with following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds after game s four next drives culminated with punts raiders scored on carr s 26 yard touchdown pass to cooper despite initially being ruled out of bounds raiders challenged call and ruling was overturned on bears next series slauson botched snap to cutler and raiders dan williams recovered oakland capitalized on takeaway with roy helu scoring on a four yard touchdown reception though bears responded with cutler taking advantage of an open martellus bennett to score on a five yard touchdown on oakland s next drive carr s swing pass to murray was deflected and landed towards pernell mcphee intercepting pass gould eventually kicked a 19 yard field goal in second half raiders punted on first drive though they reclaimed ball after stacy mcgee recovered matt forte s fumble oakland eventually took lead with sebastian janikowski s 29 yard field goal gould eventually gave bears lead back with gould s 54 yard kick and reclaimed possession of ball with murray dropping a pitch and sam acho recovered however bears gave ball back when cutler s pass for bennett fell short and was intercepted by woodson leading to janikowski s 41 yard field goal with 2 05 left in game cutler began leading a two minute drill after a six yard run by forte followed by a sack by mack and incomplete pass to josh bellamy to bring up fourth down cutler successfully converted with a seven yard pass to bennett who beat keenan lambert cutler s next pass to marquess wilson fell incomplete and forte s seven yard run led to another third down situation which led to cutler s first down conversion of seven yards to wilson with 56 seconds left on next set of downs cutler s pass for receiver cameron meredith was overthrown though a 12 yard pass to royal allowed offense to enter oakland territory where bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining offense entered field goal range with cutler s nine yard pass to wilson followed by a two yard run by forte with seven seconds left bears used another timeout and allowed gould to attempt 49 yard field goal gould successfully converted field goal with two seconds remaining on clock to give bears 22 20 lead in an last second attempt to score raiders attempted lateral passes on kickoff return but were penalized for an illegal lateral in early stages of play and bears eventually recovered to clinch win gould was later named nfc special teams player of week his third st potw honor and tying him with kickers jeff jaeger and paul edinger for most in team history field goal was gould s eleventh career game winner forte ran for 91 yards in game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8 071 becoming 14th player in nfl history to record 8 000 and 3 500 career rushing and receiving yards respectively while becoming second fastest player to achieve milestone with 111 games win would be only home win for bears all season finishing year with a horrific 1 7 home record bears would finish 3 13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined week 5 at kansas city chiefs for fifth game of season bears visited kansas city who trailed bears 5 6 in all time series game was first in kansas city since 2003 which chiefs won 31 3 entering game bears were plagued by injuries with 16 players listed on injury report jermon bushrod concussion was ruled out safety antrel rolle ankle was doubtful and 13 others were questionable jeff joniak wrote that offense had to be cautious of bob sutton s 3 4 defense particularly front five guided by linebacking duo tamba hali and justin houston however pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015 to combat defense chiefs cornerbacks had to be targeted particularly fleming and rookie marcus peters who was targeted most among cornerbacks in nfl and four touchdowns respectively additionally chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns most in nfl and in red zone was ranked worst in league also chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295 5 passing yards per game ranked 28th in league while recording only two interceptions bears defense which had recorded six sacks in last two games faced an offensive line that allowed a league high 19 sacks despite struggles on ol chiefs quarterback alex smith had receivers like jeremy maclin who had recorded 148 receiving yards in previous game though smith had a 49 5 completion percentage to receivers one of worst in league in rushing attack chiefs had running back jamaal charles who was tied with matt forte for most rushes of ten yards or more in nfl with eleven however charles had fumbled 26 times in his career including twice in 2015 on special teams facing former bears st coordinator dave toub kansas city return unit was led by davis kickoffs and de anthony thomas punts davis ranked fourth in nfl in kr yards while thomas was tied for seventh in pr yards bears coverage unit took on pro bowl punter dustin who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average while allowing only 51 yards on return along with kicker cairo santos led league in field goals bushrod rolle alshon jeffery eddie royal david fales guard patrick omameh and defensive end will sutton were inactive chiefs won toss and deferred until second half after bears and chiefs first drives ended with punts bears next possession started at their own nine yard line after an 18 yard punt return by marc mariani was nullified by jeremy langford s holding penalty three plays into drive chiefs jaye howard and allen bailey sacked jay cutler in endzone leading to a fumble that was recovered by wilson and gave chiefs touchdown after getting ball back bears were able to score three points late in first quarter with robbie gould s 44 yard field goal chiefs eventually punted again and bears were again pinned inside their own five yard line drive stalled and pat o donnell punted from endzone despite playing a team with offensive line struggles bears failed to employ a pass rush during chiefs next drive and once they did on third down smith threw a pass to thomas who scored on 19 yard play kansas city increased margin to 17 3 with nine seconds left in second quarter with santos 35 yard field goal cutler kneeled to end first half on chiefs first drive of second half offense reached bears nine yard line but santos field goal was blocked by pernell mcphee allowing bears to take over at their own 17 first play of bears drive was a ten yard run by forte for a first down marking bears first since opening quarter and series concluded with gould s 30 yard field goal next four drives of game ended with punts while one of series held by bears concluded with a turnover on downs with 7 51 left in game and down 17 6 cutler attempted to lead another comeback for second consecutive game first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards concluding with cutler throwing a 22 yard touchdown pass to marquess wilson in corner of left endzone bears attempted to go for two but cutler s pass for mariani was ruled out after a challenge ruling was upheld chiefs eventually punted again with bears starting their next drive on their own 33 cutler led offense on an eight play 67 yard drive concluding with a seven yard touchdown pass to forte despite dropping snap however bears failed two point conversion chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in game smith reached bears 48 with a pass to maclin and on next play threw a nine yard pass to maclin however maclin juggled pass while going out of bounds as a result with two seconds left chiefs elected to try a nfl record 66 yard field goal however santos kick fell short giving bears 18 17 win this was chicago s first victory at arrowhead since 1993 where bears won 19 17 two team records were set during game after converting his second field goal of game gould became leader of most points in franchise history with 1 168 points surpassing kevin butler win was cutler s 46th with bears tying jim mcmahon for most in team history week 6

players had success against detroit in past in 12 career games against lions jay cutler threw for 2 669 yards 17 touchdowns seven interceptions and an 89 9 passer rating while matt forte in 14 games had 1 066 rushing yards six rushing touchdowns and four touchdown receptions his most against any opponent a potential weakness that forte and bears rushing attack could exploit was lions run defense with departures of defensive linemen ndamukong suh and nick fairley run defense which had allowed a league low 69 3 rushing yards per game in 2014 regressed in 2015 allowing 126 6 yards per game ranked 27th in league lions pass defense also suffered during season lions allowed quarterbacks to complete 78 percent of passes and a league high combined 128 7 passer rating while also allowing second most plays of 20 yards or more with 25 to take advantage of this bears saw returns of alshon jeffery eddie royal and martellus bennett from injuries as for bears defense they faced an offense that recorded 4 9 yards per play ranked 29th in nfl lions quarterback matthew stafford had also struggled having an average of 6 2 yards per pass worst in his six year career and had been benched in lions week five game against arizona detroit running backs also struggled averaging only 2 8 yards per carry as a whole lions offense led league in turnovers with 15 on special teams lions led league in kickoff returns of at least 20 yards with running back ameer abdullah leading nfl in same category with nine terrence mitchell antrel rolle runningback antone smith linebacker shea mcclellin tackle nick becton jermon bushrod and nose tackle bruce gaston were inactive bears won toss and deferred lions opening drive concluded with a touchdown when lance moore beat sherrick mcmanis to score on a 20 yard touchdown chicago retaliated with ten unanswered points via robbie gould s 27 yard field goal and jeremy langford s one yard touchdown run latter occurring in second quarter lions reclaimed lead with stafford s eight yard touchdown pass to tim wright though bears managed to score three points with gould s 23 yard kick late in first half lions reached bears two yard line where stafford threw a pass to golden tate as he crossed goal line he was stripped by kyle fuller with pass being intercepted by jonathan anderson and ruled a touchback however referee walt coleman ruled play as a touchdown stating that tate took three steps and broke plane on chicago s first drive of second half offense aided by cutler s 46 yard pass to marquess wilson reached detroit five but cutler s pass for jeffery in endzone was intercepted by mathis bears nearly regained ball on lions ensuing possession when sam acho stripped abdullah but abdullah managed to recover eventually lions punted and when bears also punted on next possession t j jones muffed it and josh bellamy recovered gould later kicked a 38 yard field goal on lions next series bears defense struggled allowing stafford to complete passes of 42 and 16 yards to tate and theo riddick respectively followed by a 22 yard touchdown pass to tate though it was nullified by calvin johnson s holding penalty bears were forced to punt again but pat o donnell s punt hit corey fuller in leg and safety chris prosinski recovered in fourth quarter bears scored on cutler s 11 yard touchdown pass to jeffery and regained possession quickly when stafford s toss to riddick deflected off of his hand and anderson intercepted it bears gained lead with forte s two yard run followed by cutler s two point conversion pass to forte however lions took lead with their next two scores matt prater s 32 yard field goal and stafford s six yard touchdown pass to johnson with 21 seconds left in fourth quarter bears drove 69 yards to lions 11 where gould tied game with a 29 yard kick in overtime first four drives ended with punts and on fifth prater kicked a 27 yard field goal to claim 37 34 win game featured three controversial officiating calls regarding second quarter tate touchdown fox nfl commentator ronde barber and fox rules analyst mike pereira believed tate had not controlled ball while falling to turf on contrary nfl vice president of officiating dean stated that tate controlled pass right at goal line this is not a receiver who is going to ground he is taking his third step he had demonstrated possession had become a runner late in fourth quarter pernell mcphee was penalized for roughing passer when it appeared that he had been pushed into stafford during lions game winning drive in overtime willie young was held but no penalty was called due to nfl s policies on criticizing officials cutler did not comment while john fox stated we re not allowed to talk about officials week 7 bye week bears entered bye week with a 2 4 record third in division to comply with nfl s collective bargaining agreement which required at least four straight off days off for players on byes bears only held practices on tuesday and wednesday entering bye bears had seventh best third down conversion percentage with 43 68 while having 118 first downs converted one more than that of teams that bears had played on october 22 jeremiah ratliff who had been suspended for first three games of 2015 season was released outside bears training facility he and ryan pace had an animated exchange forcing security to escort ratliff out and lake forest police to report to area no police intervention occurred ratliff had reported to halas hall in poor condition and when he was requested to leave and a relative to pick him up he was belligerent and insubordinate to replace ratliff bears signed jaguar ziggy hood later in day week 8 vs minnesota vikings bears returned from bye week by hosting 4 2 minnesota vikings in their rivalry vikings led all time series 55 51 2 vikings winning last game 13 9 though vikings had not beaten bears at soldier field since 2007 jeff joniak wrote that offense had to protect jay cutler vikings defense sacked matthew stafford seven times in week seven with a total of 17 in 2015 in eleven career games against minnesota cutler excelled throwing 23 touchdowns and 13 interceptions with an 8 3 record a player that joniak believed cutler could attack is cornerback xavier rhodes who allowed four passing touchdowns and a league worst ten penalties additionally running backs could target a defense that allowed six yards per carry one of worst in nfl on defense bears had to watch for adrian peterson who averaged 88 rushing yards per game including two consecutive games with at least 120 yards in each another player was quarterback teddy bridgewater who completed 25 passes to eleven players in week seven while watching for speed of minnesota receiving corps despite such successes as a whole vikings offense was averaging 325 5 yards per game third least in league in red zone vikings scored touchdowns on 42 11 percent of their drives among worst in nfl terrance mitchell shea mcclellin hroniss grasu jermon bushrod bruce gaston ka deem carey and cameron meredith were inactive bears won coin toss and deferred until second half bears special teams unit struggled with returner marc mariani return on both of vikings first two punts despite this bears took lead with robbie gould s 55 yard field goal however minnesota scored on marcus sherels s 65 yard punt return touchdown third return touchdown allowed by bears in 2015 despite this sherels muffed his return on ensuing punt blair walsh eventually kicked a 43 yard field goal in second quarter to make score 10 3 after game s next three drives ended in punts twice by bears first turnover of game occurred when kyle fuller intercepted bridgewater s pass for stefon diggs bears capitalized on takeaway with cutler s 21 yard touchdown pass to alshon jeffery who jumped over rhodes to make catch in left corner of endzone in third quarter bears reclaimed lead with gould s 33 yard field goal and after vikings punted had chance to increase margin to six points on gould s 51 yard attempt however gould s kick went wide left his first miss of season and ending a 17 kick streak minnesota took advantage by tying game via walsh s 48 yard field goal game s next two possessions ended with touchdowns for both teams bears scored with cutler whose targets jeffery and mariani were unavailable running four yards and colliding

touchdown pass to jeffery he tied sid luckman for most touchdown passes in bears history with 137 defensively pernell mcphee recorded his fifth sack during game and he became first bears player since brian urlacher in 2000 to have at least five sacks and one interception in first seven games during second half matt forte suffered a knee injury and along with eddie royal were missed following week s game loss of forte had been crucial for bears as he had been responsible for 32 percent of yards gained in 2015 most among running backs week 9 at san diego chargers on monday night football bears traveled west to face 2 6 san diego chargers two teams last met in 2011 at soldier field bears winning 31 20 though their last meeting in san diego was in 2007 which chargers won 14 3 and last mnf game in san diego was a chargers 20 7 victory in 1984 in eleven games bears led series 6 5 jeff joniak wrote that bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed most yards after catch in nfl additionally offenses often started drives at 32 yard line ranked 31st in league while chargers also had fewest points off turnovers with seven chargers were also allowing 6 34 yards per play second worst in nfl to attack offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver cornerback matchups and run with jeremy langford who was making his first career start with matt forte out defensively bears faced an offense struggling with injuries particularly at line of five positions four have seen two or more players starting however quarterback philip rivers excelled despite injuries having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7 9 yards per pass both of which were among highest in nfl rivers performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake peyton manning s single season passing yards record chargers had top ranked offense in nfl and also ranked first in yardage after catch another offensive player that bears faced was tight end antonio gates who led league in career touchdowns with 101 however san diego running game was struggling with 3 6 rushing yards per play which ranked 30th in league special teams wise both teams were among worst in nfl chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed while bears were 31st former also allowed a league high ten returns of 30 39 yards for chargers punt return unit they had only one yard in 2015 san diego also had league worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19 3 yards drives starting within their own 20 yard line 11 and average starting area 21 forte receiver eddie royal safety harold jones quartey shea mcclellin hroniss grasu tayo fabuluje and defensive lineman ziggy hood were inactive chargers won coin toss and elected to kick off despite reaching chargers 28 yard line two scoring opportunities were denied with jason verrett deflecting jay cutler s pass for alshon jeffery and robbie gould s field goal sailing wide left afterwards chargers scored with danny woodhead s 14 yard touchdown catch from rivers on bears next possession offense entered charger territory again reaching as far as 10 yard line where cutler was sack stripped by melvin ingram with ball being recovered by eric though chargers failed to capitalize and punted after bears punted as well they reclaimed ball when tracy porter stripped dontrelle inman and linebacker christian jones recovered however after two plays verrett intercepted cutler s pass for jeffery returning it 68 yards for touchdown chargers eventually missed extra point making score 13 0 on next drive cutler threw a one yard touchdown pass to martellus bennett after both teams exchanged punts chargers scored final points of first half with josh lambo s 31 yard field goal in second half after chargers punted gould s 34 yard field goal attempt hit left upright san diego punted again and bears engineered a 93 yard drive that culminated with langford scoring on a one yard run chargers increased margin to five points with lambo kicking a 22 yard field goal guiding an 80 yard drive cutler threw a 25 yard pass to tight end zach miller who caught pass with one hand as he scored go ahead touchdown afterwards langford scored on two point conversion chargers final drive fell apart with plays like lamarr houston s two sacks and on 4th down and 23 rivers deep pass fell incomplete with 1 09 left in game cutler kneeled three times to end game with cutler s touchdown to bennett he overtook sid luckman for most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138 additionally his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown most in league miller s touchdown catch was his first since 2011 season week 10 at st louis rams week 10 s game was on road in st louis where bears played 4 4 rams historically two teams have played each other often with rams joining cardinals as most common opponent outside of nfc north bears held series lead 52 36 3 though rams won last game in 2013 42 21 chicago s offense faced a defense with a stingy pass rush that featured 14 players with at least 5 sacks and eight with at least two rush had second most sacks in league with 27 while robert quinn despite missing previous week s game with a knee injury led rams with five rams blitzed often with six sacks on first down and five on second and third with combined 16 sacks on blitzes being most in league st louis secondary starred janoris jenkins and johnson who broke up a combined 18 passes and allowed only two touchdowns in 2015 as a unit rams defense allowed no touchdowns in last ten quarters while also having second best scoring defense in nfl with 13 8 points per game while also being one of three teams to force at least 70 negative plays jeff joniak wrote that bears had to excel on third down bears 30th ranked third down offense took on a defense that was ranked fifth in category for bears defense rookie running back todd gurley was a target in his first four games he averaged 141 rushing yards on 22 attempts and by week ten had fourth most rushing yards in league and a league high 5 6 yards per carry additionally defense had to pressure quarterback nick foles in red zone he completed only 47 percent of his passes with two interceptions on third down situations he completed only 46 percent with four interceptions when blitzed he completed 54 percent with five sacks though he also has five touchdowns like bears rams third down offense struggled being ranked last in third down conversions with 23 8 percent special teams wise punt unit had to stop tavon austin who scored one of nfl s eight punt return touchdowns in 2015 to get to austin punter pat o donnell s hang time of 4 56 seconds third best in nfl could allow unit s gunners to reach him in contrast rams kick return team was struggling being ranked 30th with nine starts after kickoffs within their own 20 yard line while also ranking 23rd in kick return yards with 22 4 rams kicker punter duo of greg zuerlein and johnny hekker are among best in nfl hekker had a gross punt average of 48 yards one of seven punters to do so while also being ranked fourth in net average with 43 3 zuerlein had kicked a 61 yard field goal against vikings in week nine but was missing a league high seven field goals including two that were blocked eddie royal matt forte return man deonte thompson harold jones quartey hroniss grasu ziggy hood and pernell mcphee were inactive bears won coin toss and elected to kick off rams scored on opening possession with gurley s six yard touchdown run but bears tied score on a two play drive after jeremy langford was stopped for a one yard loss jay cutler threw a short pass to zach miller who managed to break free and score on 87 yard play next drive for rams saw offense go three and out but on punt return marc mariani was quickly hit by bradley marquez and fumbled with ball being recovered by st louis maurice alexander on first play since turnover austin scored on a 17 yard reverse but touchdown was nullified by greg robinson s holding penalty rams eventually had to settle for zuerlein s 26 yard field goal after bears punted they regained possession on first play of rams next drive when shea mcclellin stripped tre mason and recovered ball robbie gould eventually kicked a 35 yard field goal to tie score at end of first quarter rams punted on their next drive and bears took lead with cutler throwing a two yard touchdown pass to miller st louis later punted again and chicago s next series started at their own 14 yard line due to cornerback alan ball s holding penalty on punt return after langford s three yard run cutler held off a blitzing defense to throw a screen pass to langford who scored on 83 yard play two teams exchanged punts for remainder of half first three drives of second half also ended in punts afterwards two teams traded field goals zuerlein s being 38 yards and gould s being 33 yards on st louis next drive team elected to try a fake punt but hekker s pass to cody davis fell short bears increased lead to 17 points with gould s 36 yard field goal and after rams turned ball over on downs again scored on langford s six yard touchdown run next two drives ended with turnovers for both teams willie young intercepted foles but runningback ka deem carey fumbled after being hit by rodney mcleod with fumble being recovered by aaron donald with 2 23 left in game rams reached bears 28 yard line before time expired miller s first touchdown was longest catch by a tight end since byron chamberlain s 88 yard play in and longest touchdown reception by a bear since matt forte s 89 yard score in 2010 with score and langford s 83 yard touchdown bears became first team since 2006 buffalo bills to score multiple touchdowns of at least 80 yards in a game week 11 vs denver broncos john fox joined by coordinators adam gase and jeff rodgers and quarterback jay cutler faced their former team in denver broncos for week eleven it would also be coldest game bears would play in 2015 in 14 games two teams split series though broncos won most recent game in 2011 13 10 in last game at soldier field bears won 37 34 offense took on one of league s top defenses denver s pass rush leading nfl in sacks with 32 with twelve players with at least 5 sacks broncos defense was allowing fewest average yards with 277 3 while also allowing third fewest points per game with 18 7 despite demarcus ware being out with a back injury broncos still had von miller who had more than five sacks in 2015 for bears despite alshon jeffery and eddie royal s injuries martellus bennett and zach miller could still play a role if passing cutler had to watch for defensive lineman malik jackson who had four pass breakups in previous four games when bears decide to run they faced a run defense that led league in multiple categories including sack percentage broncos offense was without peyton manning and in his place was brock osweiler osweiler who had 305 career passing yards had only played in garbage time during his nfl career but fits gary kubiak s west coast offense jeff joniak believed with osweiler broncos plays which consisted of 64 percent passes would decrease though tight ends owen daniels and vernon davis could be targeted more often meanwhile denver s rushing attack was struggling during season with an average of 86 rushing yards per game 29th ranked in nfl broncos won coin toss and deferred until second half after bears punted osweiler threw a pass to demaryius thomas who escaped chris prosinski to score on 48 yard play after both teams exchanged punts bears scored their first points of game in second quarter with robbie gould s 46 yard field goal and narrowed margin to one point when gould scored on a 37 yard kick denver and chicago traded punts again but former scored with brandon mcmanus 24 yard field goal as time expired in second quarter to make score 10 6 first three drives of second half ended with punts though first turnover of game occurred on next series when cutler s pass for receiver marquess wilson was intercepted by danny however broncos failed to capitalize when ronnie hillman was tripped by osweiler s feet on fourth down afterwards aided by two consecutive 29 yard plays via brandon marshall s defensive pass interference followed by wilson s 29 yard catch bears reached broncos 19 yard line where gould eventually kicked a 37 yard field goal broncos later increased their lead by eight when osweiler threw a ten yard touchdown pass to cody latimer on bears next series cutler capitalized on a late hit by t j ward and a 40 yard pass to wilson to reach broncos seven yard line despite reaching as far as four bears turned ball over on downs with three consecutive incomplete passes although denver punted again and chicago offense reaching broncos 33 yard line cutler was hit from behind by marshall while throwing and ball was intercepted by malik jackson broncos were forced to punt again and with 1 25 left in game bears drove 65 yards where jeremy langford scored on a two yard run however langford was stopped short on two point conversion and on onside kick thomas recovered osweiler kneeled once to end game bears ended game with no penalties for first time since 1995 against philadelphia eagles and becoming 24th team to do so in last 15 years bears also became first team to accomplish feat in a loss since 2013 packers loss to bears in week nine defense recorded five sacks team s most in 2015 week 12 at green bay packers thanksgiving day game second game of 2015 against packers was held on thanksgiving day in green bay two teams in their 190th meeting had never played each other on holiday in thanksgiving games bears were 16 15 2 while packers were 14 19 2 chicago s offense took on a defense that ranked second in league in first quarter points allowed with 1 9 along with a defense that recorded six sacks in week eleven against minnesota jeff joniak added that offense had to improve its red zone performance against denver bears failed to score on three of four trips to red zone leading to a 41 2 percent touchdown efficiency in 2015 in ten games bears were only able to score 14 touchdowns within 20 yard line on other side joniak stated defense had to stop packers offense early since 2014 packers had outscored opponents 151 27 at lambeau while also leading league in first quarter points with an average of 7 6 aaron rodgers had thrown eight first quarter touchdown passes most in nfl in 2015 while packers had a league best 57 scoring differential meanwhile bears defense had allowed nine touchdowns in first though defense had not given up a touchdown in third quarter joniak also wrote that bears had to match and surpass emotion on a night that featured brett favre s jersey retirement with their most physical error free and consistent performance eddie royal ka deem carey martellus bennett antrel rolle cornerback jacoby glenn nick becton and will sutton were inactive bears won toss and deferred first four drives of game ended without scores as packers turned ball over on downs during their first drive and ensuing series were punts on next drive tracy porter intercepted rodgers but was penalized for illegal contact and play was nullified afterwards rodgers threw a 25 yard touchdown pass to lacy bears woes continued with following kickoff when marc mariani and deonte thompson collided while attempting to catch kick and latter had to kneel in endzone for touchback next four possessions led to punts on green bay s next drive lacy recorded a 15 yard run but was hit from behind by chris prosinski and fumbled with ball being recovered by lamarr houston chicago took advantage of takeaway when jay cutler threw a three yard touchdown pass to zach

fewest negative plays in league despite frequency to blitz lions only had eight sacks when doing so through air lions pass defense struggled allowing a 30th ranked passer rating of 101 7 and 30 touchdown passes while recording only interceptions to excel bears had to maintain ball as they were ranked sixth in nfl in time of possession on defense bears took on a lions offense that had
