from book depository revealing changes that were made to her testimony by warren commission garrison s staff also test single bullet theory by aiming an empty rifle from window through which oswald was alleged to have shot kennedy they conclude that oswald was too poor a marksman to make shots indicating someone else or multiple marksmen were involved in 1968 garrison meets a high level figure in washington d c who identifies himself as x he suggests a conspiracy at highest levels of government implicating members of cia mafia military industrial complex secret service fbi and kennedy s vice president and then president lyndon baines johnson as either co conspirators or as having motives to cover up truth of assassination x explains that president was killed because he wanted to pull

interrogated businessman denies any knowledge of meeting ferrie o keefe or oswald but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder president some of garrison s staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods and leave investigation garrison s marriage is strained when his wife liz complains that he is spending more time on case than with his own family after a sinister phone call is made to their daughter liz accuses garrison of being selfish and attacking shaw only because of his homosexuality in addition media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking garrison s character and criticizing way his office is spending taxpayers money some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others such as ferrie are killed in suspicious circumstances before his death ferrie tells garrison that he believes people are after him and reveals there was a conspiracy around kennedy s death trial of clay shaw takes place in 1969 garrison presents court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing single bullet theory and proposes a dealey plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing oswald for murders of kennedy and officer j d but jury acquits shaw after less than one hour of deliberation film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind assassination but not enough evidence to link shaw to that conspiracy shaw died of lung cancer in 1974 but in 1979 richard helms testified that clay shaw had been a part time contact of domestic contacts division of cia end credits claim that records related to assassination will be released to public in 2029 cast production zachary sklar a journalist and a professor of journalism at columbia school of journalism met garrison in 1987 and helped him rewrite a manuscript that he was working on about kennedy s assassination he changed it from a scholarly book in third person to a detective story a in first person sklar edited book and it was published in 1988 while attending latin american film festival in havana cuba stone met sheridan square press publisher ellen ray on an elevator she had published jim garrison s book on trail of assassins riordan 1996 p 351 ray had gone to new orleans and worked with garrison in 1967 she gave stone a copy of garrison s book and told him to read it riordan 1996 p 352 he did and quickly bought film rights with 250 000 of his own money to prevent talk going around studios about projects he might be developing salewicz 1998 p 80 kennedy s assassination had always had a profound effect on stone kennedy murder was one of signal events of postwar generation my generation stone met garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours garrison stood up to stone s questioning and then got up and left his pride and dignity impressed director riordan 1996 p 353 stone s impressions from their meeting were that garrison made many mistakes he trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads but he went out on a limb way out and he kept going even when he knew he was facing long odds riordan 1996 p 354 stone was not interested in making a film about garrison s life but rather story behind conspiracy to kill kennedy he also bought film rights to jim marrs book crossfire plot that killed kennedy one of filmmaker s primary goals with jfk was to provide a rebuttal to warren commission s report that he believed was a great myth and in order to fight a myth maybe you have to create another one a counter myth riordan 1996 p 355 even though marrs book collected many theories stone was hungry for more and hired jane rusconi a recent yale university graduate to lead a team of researchers and assemble as much information about assassination as possible while director completed post production on born on fourth of july stone read two dozen books on assassination while rusconi read between 100 and 200 books on subject by december 1989 stone began approaching studios to back his film while in pre production on doors he met with three executives at warner bros who wanted him to make a film about howard hughes riordan 1996 p 356 however warren beatty owned rights and so stone pitched jfk studio president and chief operating officer terry semel liked idea he had a reputation for making political and controversial films including all president s men parallax view and killing fields riordan 1996 p 357 stone made a handshake deal with warner bros whereby studio would get all rights to film and put up 20 million for budget director did this so that screenplay would not be widely read and bid on and he also knew that material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it finally stone liked semel s track record of producing political films screenplay when stone set out to write screenplay he asked sklar who also edited marrs book to co write it with him and distill garrison and marrs books and rusconi s research into a script that would resemble what he called a great detective movie riordan 1996 p 358 stone told sklar his vision of film although he did employ ideas from rashomon his principal model for jfk was z stone broke film s structure down into four stories garrison investigating new orleans connection to assassination research that revealed what stone calls oswald legend who he was and how to try to inculcate that recreation of assassination at dealey plaza and information that character of x imparts on garrison which stone saw as means by which we were able to move between new orleans local into wider story of dealey plaza salewicz 1998 pp 82 83 sklar worked on garrison side of story while stone added oswald story events at dealey plaza and mr x character sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 page triple spaced screenplay and then stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length stone and sklar used composite characters most notably mr x character played by donald sutherland this was a technique that would be criticized in press riordan 1996 p 359 he was a mix of richard case and retired air force colonel fletcher prouty another adviser for film and who was a military liaison between cia and pentagon meeting prouty was for stone one of most extraordinary afternoons i ve ever spent pretty much like in movie he just started to talk salewicz 1998 pp 80 81 according to stone screenplay s early drafts suggested a four and a half hour film with a potential budget of 40 million double what stone had agreed to with warner bros riordan 1996 p 361 director knew film mogul arnon milchan and met with him to help finance film milchan was eager to work on project and launch his new company regency enterprises with a high profile film like jfk riordan 1996 p 365 milchan made a deal with warner bros to put up money for film stone managed to pare down his initial revision a 190 page draft to a 156 page shooting script riordan 1996 p 374 there were many advisers for film including gerald hemming a former marine who claimed involvement in various cia activities and robert groden a self proclaimed photographic expert and longtime jfk assassination researcher and author stone 2000 p 590 stone later published jfk documented screenplay a heavily annotated version of screenplay in which he cites sources for nearly every claim made in film casting trying to cast role of garrison stone sent copies of script to costner mel gibson and harrison ford initially costner turned stone down however actor s agent michael ovitz was a big fan of project and helped stone convince actor to take role riordan 1996 p 363 before accepting role costner conducted extensive research on garrison including meeting man and his enemies two months after finally signing on to play garrison in january 1991 his film dances with wolves won seven academy awards and so his presence greatly enhanced in studio s eyes riordan 1996 p 368 tommy lee jones was originally considered for another role that was ultimately cut from film and stone then decided to cast him as shaw riordan 1996 p 370 in preparation for film jones interviewed garrison on three different occasions and talked to others who had worked with shaw and knew him stone originally wanted james woods to play david ferrie but woods wanted to play garrison stone also approached willem dafoe and john malkovich who both turned down role according to gary oldman very little was written about oswald in script stone gave him several plane tickets a list of contacts and told him to do his own research oldman met with oswald s wife marina and her two daughters to prepare for role salewicz 1998 p 83 beata pozniak studied 26 volumes of warren report and spent time living with marina oswald since script contained few lines for oswalds pozniak interviewed acquaintances of oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with gary oldman many actors were willing to waive their normal fees because of nature of project and to lend their support riordan 1996 p 369 martin sheen provided opening narration jim garrison played chief justice earl warren during scene in which he questions jack ruby in a dallas jail and in a tv appearance assassination witness beverly oliver who claims to be lady seen in film also appeared in a cameo in ruby s club sean stone oliver stone s son plays garrison s oldest son jasper perry russo one of sources for fictional character willie o keefe appeared in a cameo as an angry bar patron who says oswald should get a medal for shooting kennedy principal photography story revolves around costner s jim garrison with a large cast of well known actors in supporting roles stone was inspired by casting model of documentary epic longest day which he had admired as a child it was realistic but it had a lot of stars supporting cast provides a map of american psyche familiar comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in dark woods cinematographer robert richardson was a week and a half into shooting city of hope for john sayles when he got word that stone was thinking about making jfk by time principal photography wrapped on city of hope richardson was ready to make stone s film to prepare richardson read up on various jfk assassination books starting with on trail of assassins and crossfire plot that killed kennedy original idea was to film opening sequence in 1 33 1 aspect ratio in order to simulate tv screens that were available at time of assassination then transition to 1 85 1 when garrison began his investigation and finally switch to 2 35 1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later however because of time constraints and logistics richardson was forced to abandon this approach stone wanted to recreate kennedy assassination in dealey plaza his producers had to pay dallas city council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks riordan 1996 p 371 he only had ten days to shoot all of footage he needed and so he used seven cameras two 35 mm and five 16 mm and 14 film stocks getting permission to shoot in texas school book depository was more difficult they had to pay 50 000 to put someone in window from which oswald was supposed to have shot kennedy they were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on floor at one time camera crew an actor and stone co producer clayton townsend has said that hardest part was getting permission to restore building to way it looked back in 1963 it took five months of negotiation production spent 4 million to restore dealey plaza to 1963 conditions riordan 1996 p 375 stone utilized a variety of film stocks richardson said it depends whether you want to shoot in 35 or 16 or super 8 in many cases lighting has to be different riordan 1996 p 377 for certain shots in film stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once using five cameras at same time in different formats richardson said of stone s style of direction oliver disdains convention he tries to force you into things that are not classic there s this constant need to stretch this forced cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before release date salewicz 1998 p 84 editing jfk marked a fundamental change in way that stone constructed his films a subjective lateral presentation of plot with editing s rhythm carrying story salewicz 1998 p 85 stone brought in hank corwin an editor of commercials to help edit film stone chose him because his chaotic mind was totally alien to film form but he had not developed long form yet and so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect he said in an interview because of being shot on various sized film stocks traditional 35mm film editing was impossible although digital editing was in nascent form and avid were still not available as editing systems when editing began on jfk for that reason all footage was transferred to 3 4 videotape and edited on videotape 35mm negative along with other sized film stocks were then conformed to match videotape edit years after its release stone said of film that it was beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it s not just about a conspiracy to kill john kennedy it s also about way we look at our recent history it shifts from black and white to color and then back again and views people from offbeat angles music because of his enormous commitment to steven spielberg s hook which opened same month as jfk composer john williams did not have time to compose a conventional score for entire film instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for jfk before he saw film in its entirety soon after recording this music he traveled to new orleans where stone was still shooting film and saw approximately an hour s worth of edited footage and dailies williams remembers i thought his handling of lee harvey oswald was particularly strong and i understood some of atmosphere of film sordid elements underside of new orleans stone and his team then actually cut film to fit williams music after composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to six he had done prior to seeing film for motorcade sequence williams described score he composed as strongly kinetic music music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines composer remembered moment he learned of kennedy s assassination and it stuck with him for years this was a significant factor in his deciding to work on film williams said this is a very resonant subject for people of my generation and that s why i welcomed opportunity to participate in this film reception critical reaction film s production and release were subject to intense scrutiny and criticism a few weeks after shooting had begun on may 14 1991 jon margolis wrote in chicago tribune that jfk was an insult to intelligence five days later washington post ran a scathing article by national security correspondent george lardner titled on set dallas in wonderland that used first draft of jfk screenplay to blast it for absurdities and palpable untruths in garrison s book and stone s rendition of it article pointed out that garrison lost his case against clay shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use shaw s homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association stone responded to lardner s article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues other critical articles soon followed anthony lewis in new york times stated that film tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a presidential assassination washington post columnist george will called stone a man of technical skill scant education and negligible conscience time ran its own critique of film in progress on june 10 1991 and alleged that stone was trying to suppress a rival jfk assassination film based on don delillo s 1988 novel libra stone rebutted these claims in a letter to magazine riordan 1996 p 386 richard corliss time s film critic wrote whatever one s suspicions about its use or abuse of evidence jfk is a knockout part history book part comic book movie rushes toward judgment for three breathless hours lassoing facts and factoids by thousands then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer s complacency stone s picture is in both meanings of word sensational it s tip top tabloid journalism in its bravura and breadth jfk is seditiously enthralling in its craft wondrously complex filmmaker ended up splitting his time between making his film responding to criticism and conducting a publicity campaign of his own that saw him omnipresent from cbs evening news to oprah however lardner post piece stung most because lardner had stolen a copy of script stone recalls he had first draft and i went through probably six or seven drafts upon theatrical release it polarized critics new york times ran an article by bernard weinraub entitled hollywood wonders if warner brothers let jfk go too far article called for intervention by studio asking at what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt highly charged message of a film maker like oliver stone newspaper also ran a review of film by vincent canby who wrote mr stone s hyperbolic style of film making is familiar lots of short often hysterical scenes tumbling one after another backed by a soundtrack that is layered like with noises dialogue music more noises more dialogue pat dowell veteran film critic for washingtonian had her 34 word capsule review for january issue rejected by her editor john on grounds that he did not want a positive review for a film he felt was preposterous associated with magazine dowell resigned in protest miami herald said about controversy in its review focus on of personality conveniently prevents us from having to confront tough questions stone s film raises riordan 1996 p 416 however roger ebert praised film in his review for chicago sun times saying rita kempley in washington post wrote on christmas day los angeles times ran a critical article entitled suppression of facts grants stone a broad brush riordan 1996 pp 405 406 new york newsday followed suit next day with two articles blurred vision of jfk and many theories of a jolly green giant a few days later chicago sun times followed suit with stone s film trashes facts dishonors j f k jack valenti then president and chief executive of motion picture association of america denounced stone s film in a seven page statement he wrote in much same way young german boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by leni riefenstahl s triumph of will in which adolf hitler was depicted as a newborn god both jfk and triumph of will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax mr stone and leni riefenstahl have another genetic linkage neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction stone recalls in an interview i can t even remember all threats there were so many of them time magazine ranked it fourth best film of 1991 while also including it in top 10 historically misleading films roger ebert of chicago sun times went on to name stone s film as best film of year and one of top ten films of decade as well as one of great movies sydney morning herald named jfk as best film of 1991 entertainment weekly ranked it 5th most controversial movie ever ebert s colleague richard roeper was less complimentary one can admire stone s filmmaking skills and performances here while denouncing utter presented as evidence of a conspiracy to murder roeper applauded film s dazzling array of filmmaking techniques and a stellar roster of actors but criticized stone s narrative as a work of fantastical fiction jfk is an interesting if overblown vision of a parallel universe as a dramatic interpretation of events it s bankrupt nonsense harry connick sr new orleans district attorney who defeated garrison in 1973 criticized stone s view of assassination stone was either unaware of details and particulars of clay shaw investigation and trial or if he was aware that didn t get in his way of what he perceived to be way case should have been in his book reclaiming history assassination of president john f kennedy a history of assassination published 16 years after film s release vincent bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to garrison s prosecution of shaw and stone s subsequent film bugliosi vincent reclaiming history assassination of president john f kennedy 2007 w w norton and company p 1347 1446 bugliosi lists thirty two separate lies and fabrications bugliosi pp 1360 1431 in stone s film and describes film as one continuous lie in which stone couldn t find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go bugliosi p 1431 david stated that 80 percent of film is in factual error and rejected premise of a conspiracy involving cia and so called military industrial complex as irrational warren commission investigator david called film a big lie that would make adolf hitler proud based on 62 reviews collected from notable publications by popular review aggregator rotten tomatoes film holds an 84 approval rating with an average score of 7 7 10 site s consensus reads as history oliver stone s jfk is dubious but as filmmaking it s electric cramming a ton of information and excitement into its three hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast jfk rotten tomatoes retrieved july 8 2018 box was released in theaters on december 20 1991 in its first week of release jfk tied with beauty and beast for fifth place in u s box office and its critics began to say it was a flop warner brothers executives argued that this was at least partly because film s long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films box office picked up momentum however in part due to a 15 million marketing campaign from studio by first week in january 1992 it had grossed over 50 million worldwide eventually earning over 200 million worldwide and 70 million in united states during its initial run garrison s estate subsequently sued warner bros for a share of film s profits alleging fraud perpetrated through a book keeping practice known as hollywood accounting lawsuit contended that jfk made in excess of 150 million worldwide but studio claimed that under its net profits accounting formula film earned no money and that garrison s estate did not receive any of more than 1 million net profits income he was due awards and was nominated for eight academy awards including best picture best actor in a supporting role tommy lee jones best director oliver stone best original score john williams best sound michael gregg and tod a maitland best cinematography robert richardson best film editing and best adapted screenplay stone and zachary sklar it won two awards for best cinematography and best film editing stone was nominated for an award for outstanding directing by directors guild of america but did not win he also won a golden globe for best director and in his acceptance speech he said a terrible lie was told to us 28 years ago i hope that this film can be first step in righting that wrong entertainment weekly ranked jfk as one of 25 powerful political thrillers in 2012 motion picture editors guild listed film as ninth best edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership legislative impact final report of assassination records review board arrb partially credited concern over conclusions in jfk with passage of president john f kennedy assassination records collection act of 1992 also known as jfk act arrb stated that film popularized a version of president kennedy s assassination that featured u s government agents from federal bureau of investigation fbi central intelligence agency cia and military as conspirators while describing film as largely fictional arrb acknowledged stone s point that official records were to be sealed from public until 2029 and his suggestion that americans could not trust official public conclusions when those conclusions had been made in secret by arrb law all existing assassination related documents were to be made public by
