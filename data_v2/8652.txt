nikopol krivoi rog offensive was an offensive by red army s 3rd ukrainian front and elements of 4th ukrainian front against german 6th army in area of nikopol and krivoi rog in oblast in central ukraine between 30 january and it took place on eastern front of world war ii and was part of wider dnieper carpathian offensive a soviet attack against army group south to retake rest of ukraine that fell to germany in 1941 following soviet advance to dnieper in battle of dnieper during late 1943 german forces managed to hold to nikopol bridgehead on left bank of dnieper area of manganese ore mines of crucial importance to german war production that adolf hitler insisted on holding in november and december 3rd and 4th ukrainian fronts conducted multiple unsuccessful attacks against bridgehead a salient centered around supply base and rail junction of apostolovo and german troops in krivoi rog area following another failed attack in mid january nikopol krivoy rog offensive was launched by 3rd ukrainian front to north of salient on 30 january and elements of 4th ukrainian front to south of it joined in a day later soviet troops broke through 6th army s lines capturing apostolovo on 5 february splitting army in half nikopol fell on 8 february but despite heavy losses troops in bridgehead including german iv army corps were able to retreat across dnieper iv army corps launched an unsuccessful counterattack against apostolovo around this time resulting in a temporary soviet pause in order to prepare for advance against krivoi rog in northwest portion of salient two armies of 3rd ukrainian front began advance towards that city on 17 february and captured it on 22 february other armies from front then resumed advance and captured several bridgeheads over inhulets river which became next german defensive line fighting in area died down but soviet gains paved way for subsequent advances during second phase of dnieper carpathian offensive offensive resulted in loss of german salient and at least 15 000 casualties being inflicted on units of 6th army in fighting background following soviet advance in battle of dnieper in late 1943 german 6th army commanded by generaloberst karl adolf hollidt escaped a threatened soviet encirclement and retreated to krivoi rog area with its iv and xxix army corps clinging on to nikopol bridgehead over dnieper easternmost protrusion of a salient centred on key rail junction of apostolovo on 3 november these two corps were temporarily transferred to 1st panzer army and within weeks they became part of group schorner under command of general der gebirgstruppe ferdinand schorner along with xvii army corps to north during november and december 3rd and 4th ukrainian fronts launched a series of unsuccessful assaults against nikopol bridgehead and krivoi rog area which formed a salient 3rd ukrainian front directed its assaults against northern part of salient while 4th ukrainian front moved against southern part thumb army group south commander erich von manstein 1938 since its capture by germans in 1941 rich deposits of manganese in area of nikopol had been used in germany for production of high strength steel adolf hitler repeatedly stressed crucial importance of this area telling his commanders that loss of nikopol would mean end of war nikopol bridgehead also held operational significance because it could serve as a springboard for an assault to relieve german troops trapped in crimea and hitler refused demands by army group south commander generalfeldmarschall erich von manstein for its evacuation as a result bridgehead was heavily fortified with three lines of trenches in its first defensive line strengthened by barbed wire belts and minefields all heights and settlements immediately behind front were turned into fortified strongpoints these positions were what remained of fortified german dnieper line despite hitler s obsession with bridgehead mining of manganese ore ceased during winter of 1943 and 1944 and previously mined stocks could not be moved due to a lack of transport according to 6th army chief of staff generalleutnant max bork on 1 january 6th army was transferred from army group a which held southernmost part of ukraine west of dnieper to army group south whose sector ran from north of krivoi rog to marshes in northernmost portion of ukraine around this time manstein transferred 1st panzer army to northern sector leaving a few of its infantry divisions behind in nikopol bridgehead these joined 6th army on manstein flew to fuhrer headquarters expressly to persuade hitler to allow a withdrawal from nikopol and crimea in order to shorten front but his request was denied there were also formidable natural barriers in area kamenka river in 3rd ukrainian front s sector and dnieper in 4th ukrainian front s sector behind german front line in nikopol bridgehead was marshy floodplain of dnieper which rarely froze in winter only exits from bridgehead were a temporary bridge in northern sector east of nikopol and a pair of one lane pontoon bridges at far southern end of bridgehead at velikaya bolshaya lepetikha remainder of 6th army sector facing north and slightly east stretched between positions north of krivoi rog and north of apostolovo where sole rail line supplying army branched north and towards nikopol positions ran across open steppe divided at right angles by numerous ravines and watercourses of five major rivers a single hard surfaced road passed through army s sector designated through road iv but it was unusable due to its proximity to frontline except for a small area at krivoi rog due to a total lack of suitable road building materials german forces were unable to construct hard surfaced roads as a result when roads turned to mud in wet winter weather railway and tracked vehicles were sole reliable transportation method which meant that if soviet troops could capture apostolovo they would have effectively cut off german forces in bridgehead prelude preliminary attacks at end of 1943 3rd ukrainian front commanded by general armii rodion malinovsky was entrenched on line of veselyye terny and it included 8th guards 6th and 46th armies 17th air army and 23rd tank corps front included only nineteen rifle divisions and a tank corps and faced german lvii panzer xxx and xvii army corps general

commander general armii rodion malinovsky in late 1940s 3rd ukrainian front and elements of 4th ukrainian front were tasked in january with destroying german forces in area of nikopol and krivoi rog eliminating nikopol bridgehead and pushing german troops back behind line of inhulets and southern bug on 29 december 1943 marshal soyuza aleksandr vasilevsky representative of soviet high command stavka reported that defeat of german troops opposing 1st ukrainian front in zhitomir berdichev offensive and redirection of 2nd ukrainian front towards an attack on forced a reconsideration of operational plans for 3rd and 4th ukrainian fronts he concluded that a german withdrawal from nikopol bridgehead was likely and thus advocated a renewed attack to begin between 10 and 12 january 1944 stavka approved his plan and after preparations between 10 and 12 january 3rd and 4th ukrainian fronts began attack former s 8th guards and 46th armies advanced towards apostolovo against xxx army corps on 10 january and latter s 3rd guards 5th shock and 28th armies attacked iv and xxix army corps in nikopol bridgehead on 12 january attack of 3rd ukrainian front on 10 january spearheaded by what a german report estimated as 80 tanks and preceded by an artillery barrage included nine rifle divisions from both armies advancing in two waves it was stopped after gaining by two german panzer divisions which claimed to have destroyed two thirds of soviet tanks after latter outran their supporting infantry continued german counterattacks reduced breach to about a mile by end of day in four to five days of stubborn fighting soviet troops were unable to make decisive gains 3rd ukrainian front wedged into german line between through preponderance in infantry but could not break through due to german resistance shortages of ammunition and its lack of tanks which prevented creation of a strong attack group hollidt briefly considered withdrawing 24th panzer division from nikopol bridgehead to lead a counterattack against soviet gains in north but decided against it after 4th ukrainian front began its attack against bridgehead 4th ukrainian front suffered a similar lack of success and attacks were halted by 17 january to allow troops to consolidate their positions and to plan a more thorough offensive between 11 and 20 january in period which included these attacks 3rd guards 5th shock and 28th armies of 4th ukrainian front suffered total casualties of 3 191 killed and 9 938 wounded with 3rd guards and 28th armies bearing brunt of casualties in ten day period between 11 and 20 january that included soviet attack german 6th army reported casualties of 1 339 killed 4 865 wounded and 446 missing casualties of 834 killed 3 214 wounded and 419 missing were reported in next ten day period between 21 and 31 january soviet planning and preparations on day that attacks concluded vasilevsky submitted a new plan to stavka for an attack to begin on 30 january 3rd ukrainian front was given main role in operation and was reinforced with 37th army from 2nd ukrainian front with six rifle divisions 4th guards mechanized corps from 4th ukrainian front and 31st guards rifle corps from stavka reserve with three rifle divisions front received 64 tanks and was replenished with significant quantities of ammunition and fuel 4th ukrainian front also received more ammunition vasilevsky s plan stipulated that general leytenant mikhail s 37th army and general leytenant ivan s soviet 6th army were to launch diversionary attacks towards german lvii panzer corps at krivoi rog and xvii army corps of general der gebirgstruppe hans at nikopol respectively main blow of 3rd ukrainian front was planned to be delivered against xxx army corps of general der artillerie maximilian fretter pico by general leytenant vasily s 46th army general polkovnik vasily chuikov s 8th guards army and general leytenant trofim s 4th guards mechanized corps towards apostolovo and dnieper in

army s sector over three nights between 16 and 18 january 8th guards army was concentrated by reducing its sector west of dnieper and divisions from soviet 6th army crossed dnieper to take over former s previous positions 46th army was concentrated on flank of 8th guards army and 37th army moved forward on 46th army s right 4th guards mechanized corps was shifted forward from south of dnieper to take positions reinforcing intersection of 8th guards army and 46th army concentration of 3rd and 8th guards and 37th armies was picked up by german intelligence however full extent of 8th guards army s concentration went undetected and movement of 4th guards mechanized corps was missed entirely german redeployments anticipating an attack on northern part of salient hollidt withdraw his three panzer divisions from front to become an armored reserve for former on 24 january within days however he had to transfer an infantry division to crimea and two infantry division equivalents to 8th army this was capped by sending of 24th panzer division army s best equipped panzer division on a march to reinforce right flank of 1st panzer army on 28 january during battle of korsun cherkassy pocket significantly reducing armored forces available to german 6th army latter was left with only 9th panzer division for a reserve which fielded only thirteen tanks a third of its authorized strength and had a much reduced number of infantry and artillery comparison of forces german following transfers in late january german 6th army fielded twenty divisions including three panzer with an average combat strength of 2 500 and eight assault gun battalions as well as a large number of artillery and pioneer units of these eight infantry divisions four each in iv and xxix army corps and three assault gun battalions formed part of group schorner in nikopol bridgehead german infantry units had been reinforced by scraping rear units for manpower which enabled 17th 111th and 258th infantry divisions and 3rd mountain division to field 7 855 combat infantrymen by 16 january though remainder of these were combat experienced veterans 5 500 were transferred from rear units german 6th army was nominally supported by 1st air corps of luftflotte 4 at beginning of nikopol krivoy rog offensive on 30 january army fielded 260 000 men 6 420 guns and mortars 480 tanks and assault guns and 560 aircraft however a quarter of tanks assault guns and artillery pieces were unserviceable in addition a shortage of anti aircraft ammunition prevented german ground forces from defending against soviet air superiority which schorner described as absolute in a report to 6th army command soviet air attacks attacked supply lines and prevented effective employment of german artillery by destroying communications in addition to hindering movement of reserve forces by disrupting command and control order of battle german 6th army generaloberst karl adolf hollidt on 1 panzer 62nd 15th

most success breaking through german line in an 8 kilometer sector and advancing from veselyye terny against 62nd infantry division of lvii panzer corps stubborn resistance and counterattacks slowed soviet advance which devolved into what american historian earl f ziemke described as a series of uncoordinated skirmishes soviet 6th army attacked with its 60th guards and 244th rifle divisions managing to carve a small foothold in defenses of xvii army corps northeast of nikopol chuikov began main attack on 31 january by having his troops conduct reconnaissance with one battalion from each first echelon rifle division in order to retain surprise instead of conducting reconnaissance with one to two battalions from each corps between one and three days preceding operation a tactic that later became known as special echelon at dawn a 50 minute soviet artillery and air bombardment commenced and infantry and tanks of 8th guards and 46th armies jumped off at 09 15 fierce fighting ensued as soviet troops broke through defenses of 46th and 123rd infantry divisions and 16th panzergrenadier division inflicting heavy losses and forcing them to retreat leaving behind artillery vehicles and

of basavluk west of nikopol and ending at east of krivoi rog known as ursula position sholokhovo fell that morning although soviet advance was temporarily halted to south by replacement battalions of 258th and 302nd divisions in order to hold open retreat route for units east of dnieper and secure railway bridge over basavluk near perevizskiye 3rd mountain division used its replacement and pioneer battalions in conjunction with 258th division alarm units to counterattack against elements of 8th guards army and 4th guards mechanized corps but lost nearly half of their strength in fighting tank destroyer detachment of 3rd mountain managed to disable several soviet armored vehicles near perevizskiye but right flank of its pioneer battalion was turned on 6 february by a tank attack into settlement a counterattack supported by assault guns and a regiment of 3rd mountain retook northern part of settlement enabling establishment of a coherent german line east of basavluk with soviet advance there briefly halted 6th army command planned to recapture and hold a line east of kamenka but this was abandoned after schorner reported that such an action would lead to loss of most of vehicles continuing attack in spring which made roads impassable 46th army s 4th and 34th guards rifle divisions reached key rail junction of apostolovo german 6th army s main supply base on evening of 4 february there remnants of 123rd infantry division of xxx corps and elements of 9th panzer division were concentrated in an all around defense with up to 3 000 men 80 guns and 30 tanks and

apostolovo was captured by 8 00 that morning loss of apostolovo split german 6th army in half one part in area of krivoi rog and other in area of nikopol and marganets as lvii panzer corps around krivoi rog had thus lost contact with xxx army corps following retreat of 9th panzer division from apostolovo in addition attacks by soviet assault aviation disrupted movement of 3rd mountain division at tok railroad station on single rail line by destroying locomotives preventing evacuation of german wounded meanwhile 8th guards army and 4th guards mechanized corps captured kamenka and perevizskiye threatening encirclement of five divisions of xvii army corps in area of marganets and nikopol in six days 3rd ukrainian front had broken through german defenses and advanced between inflicting heavy losses on 6th army from apostolovo 46th army continued to advance west towards inhulets while 8th guards army and 4th guards mechanized corps attempted to reach dnieper to cut off

which were under constant soviet air attacks and shelling these disrupted german withdrawal but despite heavy losses group schorner was able to withdraw across river beginning with 3rd mountain division at nikopol german resistance stymied soviet advance on 2 february 3rd guards 5th shock and 28th armies continued to attack but only 5th shock was able to make small gains though on 3 february 4th ukrainian front advance reached a depth of 8 kilometers three soviet armies continued their attacks along previous routes on 4 february but were again unsuccessful taking advantage of german retreat from their main line of resistance in nikopol bridgehead on 5 february 3rd guards 5th shock and 28th armies began pursuit that day against german rearguard detachments advancing between 4 and 14 kilometers last german unit to evacuate northern portion of bridgehead from iv army corps was 302nd infantry division whose pioneers blew up bridge over dnieper at nikopol at midnight on 6 february

counterattack thumb german panzer iv tanks on move in following days fierce fighting took place over a narrow corridor held by german troops west of nikopol centered on a westward facing defensive line composed of forces withdrawn from bridgehead around marinskoye and perevizskiye including elements of 302nd division and remnants of 9th panzer division and units that had managed to make it out of bridgehead from iv xvii and xxix army corps in order to secure corridor retreat route for troops east of kamenka oberkommando der wehrmacht german supreme command projected an attack to attack soviet units in flank by retaking sholokhovo followed by an advance towards kamenka as well as recapturing bolshaya kostromka weakness of 302nd division rendered this broad offensive unfeasible resulting in additional commitment of 17th 9th and 258th infantry divisions as well as 97th jager division of iv and xxix corps to a counterattack west against bolshaya kostromka as well as a counterattack towards apostolovo to restore communications to west by reopening tok novosemyonovka railway line counterattack met with initial success recapturing and novosemyonovka beginning on 8

others struck junction of 8th guards and 46th armies on 11 february few soviet units in area were forced to withdraw and by end of day german troops had gained 8 to 10 kilometers threatening recapture of apostolovo malinovsky hastily rushed 48th guards rifle division and two anti tank artillery regiments forward from front reserve and 82nd guards and 152nd rifle divisions were concentrated to defend city german counterattack ran out of steam due to soviet air attacks on 12 february when 125th was forced to retreat to its original positions its losses in fighting were so severe that it had to be disbanded in following days however 8th guards army was significantly weakened due to muddy road conditions causing its artillery and tanks to lag behind as well as ammunition shortages on 10 february 4th guards mechanized corps was withdrawn to reserve in apostolovo area due to losses pursuit to krivoi rog during next several days german troops held dnieper marshes and nikopol dudchino road allowing elements of five infantry divisions including several from xvii corps to retreat although losing almost all their heavy equipment simultaneously 37th army continued to fight south of veselyye terny 46th army advanced northwest of apostolovo 8th guards army advanced to southwest of that city and soviet 6th army entered area on 10 february 3rd guards army transferred to 3rd

bridgehead northwest of malaya lepetikha for next several days advance paused as ammunition and artillery were brought up awaiting resumption of attack on krivoi rog during this lull in fighting german 6th army reorganized its forces due to heavy losses suffered in addition to disbandment of 125th two regiments of 302nd were combined into one while infantry division was merged into 258th alarm units were scraped together from artillerymen who had lost their guns rear personnel and stragglers in addition previous fighting had caused a lack of pioneers bridging equipment vehicles guns infantry ammunition and tanks 17th and 294th divisions had also suffered heavy losses in attempt to clear retreat route though troops of iv and xvii army corps held their positions at marinskoye 97th jager and 24th panzer divisions latter returned from its abortive march to korsun pocket attacked to west of bolshaya kostromka on 15 february to link up with lvii panzer corps erasing a soviet

armies against five german infantry divisions and two panzer divisions from lvii panzer corps former was to attack in a sector northeast of city and bypass city from north while latter was tasked with breaking through center of german line in a sector and frontally assaulting city from southeast in breakthrough sectors of armies 40 to 50 guns and mortars were concentrated per kilometer thumb soviet troops entering krivoy rog in february 1944 attack began on 17 february 37th army jumped off at 05 00 and 46th army at 10 00 following a 30 minute artillery preparation blizzard conditions made advance difficult and grounded soviet aviation but in first two days two armies advanced between in heavy fighting in mud and snow against german counterattacks 37th army s 82nd rifle corps reached city outskirts from northeast on 21 february at same time 46th army s 6th guards rifle corps and 34th rifle corps reached eastern and southeastern outskirts of city bulk of german defenses were concentrated in east where it was anticipated that main blow would come exploiting weak points discovered by soviet reconnaissance 37th and 46th armies moved into city at dawn on 22 february from northwest and southeast respectively it was cleared by 16 00 that day in celebration of capture of krivoi rog a 224 gun artillery salute was fired in moscow a special 37th army detachment prevented

8th guards and 6th armies resumed advance to inhulets 5th shock army resumed attack southwest from a bridgehead on dnieper on 26 february and reached line of velikaya and dudchino three days later inhulets became main german defensive line as a convenient natural barrier although 8th guards army s 35th and 57th guards rifle divisions captured a bridgehead in shyroke area almost simultaneously 37th army captured a bridgehead west of krivoi rog and 46th army a bridgehead north of shyroke aftermath soviet documents in central archives of russian ministry of defense estimated that they had captured 4 600 german military personnel during offensive for month of february in its casualty reports submitted to higher headquarters every ten days german 6th army reported casualties of 2 905
