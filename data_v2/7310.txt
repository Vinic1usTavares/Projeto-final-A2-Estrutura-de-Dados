thumb right a piano prepared for a performance of sonatas and interludes sonatas and interludes is a cycle of twenty pieces for prepared piano by american avant garde composer john cage 1912 1992 it was composed in 1946 48 shortly after cage s introduction to indian philosophy and teachings of art historian ananda k coomaraswamy both of which became major influences on composer s later work significantly more complex than his other works for prepared piano reiko ishii development of extended piano techniques in twentieth century american music pp 38 41 florida state university college of music 2005 available online accessed december 29 2007 pritchett p 32 sonatas and interludes is generally recognized as one of cage s finest achievements pritchett grove sonatas and interludes is a truly exceptional work and may be said to mark real start of cage s mature compositional life nicholls p 80 most critics agree that sonatas and interludes 1946 48 is finest composition of cage s early period cycle consists of sixteen sonatas thirteen of which are cast in binary form remaining three in ternary form and four more freely structured interludes aim of pieces is to express eight permanent emotions of rasa indian tradition in sonatas and interludes cage elevated his technique of rhythmic proportions to a new level of complexity in each sonata a short sequence of natural numbers and fractions defines structure of work and that of its parts informing structures as localized as individual melodic lines cage p 57 history of composition cage underwent an artistic crisis in early 1940s nicholls p 81 in addition to problems in his artistic life cage also had to deal with personal troubles a divorce from his wife of ten years in 1945 and a change in his sexuality that had happened by 1942 for details on this topic see marjorie perloff charles john cage composed in america university of chicago press 1994 his compositions were rarely accepted by public pritchett p 36 and he grew more and more disillusioned with idea of art as communication he later gave an account of reasons frequently i misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because i had little understanding of his language and i found other people misunderstanding what i myself was saying when i was saying something pointed and direct john cage interview by cott 1963 available as streaming audio at internet archive accessed december 29 2007 at beginning of 1946 cage met gita sarabhai an indian musician who came to united states concerned about western influence on music of her country sarabhai wanted to spend several months in us studying western music she took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with cage who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about indian music in return cage p 127 sarabhai agreed and through her cage became acquainted with indian music and philosophy purpose of music according to sarabhai s teacher in india was to sober and quiet mind thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences cage pp 158 226 and this definition became one of cornerstones of cage s view on music and art in general at around same time cage began studying writings of indian art historian ananda k coomaraswamy among ideas that influenced cage was description of rasa aesthetic and of its eight permanent emotions these emotions are divided into two groups four white humor wonder erotic and heroic accepting one s experience in cage s words and four black anger fear disgust and sorrow they are first eight of navarasas or nine emotions and they have a common tendency towards ninth of navarasas tranquility cage quoted in kostelanetz p 67 cage never specified which of pieces relate to which emotions or whether there even exists such direct correspondence between them pritchett p 30 he mentioned though that pieces with bell like sounds suggest europe and others with a drum like resonance suggest east cage booklet text for ajemian s recording of cycle john cage sonatas and interludes composers recordings inc cri 700 reissue a short excerpt from sonata ii which is clearly inspired by eastern music perry p 48 cage also stated that sonata xvi last of cycle is clearly european it was signature of a composer from west kostelanetz p 67 250px thumb right john cage with pianist maro ajemian to whom he dedicated sonatas and interludes cage started working on cycle in february 1946 while living in new york city idea of a collection of short pieces was apparently prompted by poet edwin denby who had remarked that short pieces can have in them just as much as long pieces can cage quoted in pritchett p 29 choice of materials and technique of piano preparation in sonatas and interludes were largely dependent on improvisation cage later wrote that cycle was composed by playing piano listening to differences and making a choice cage pp 19 57 essay composition as process cage uses same description of process several times but it is unclear whether he refers to piano preparation only or composition as well on several accounts he offered a poetic metaphor for this process comparing it with collecting shells while walking along a beach cage p 25 work on project was interrupted in early 1947 when cage made a break to compose seasons a ballet in one act also inspired by ideas from indian philosophy immediately after seasons cage returned to sonatas and interludes and by march 1948 it was completed cage dedicated sonatas and interludes to maro ajemian a pianist and friend ajemian performed work many times since 1949 including one of first performances of complete cycle on january 12 1949 in carnegie hall on many other occasions in late 1940s and early 1950s cage performed it himself critical reaction was uneven but mostly positive new york times review of carnegie hall concert quoted in pritchett p 35 work left one with feeling that mr cage is one of this country s finest composers and success of sonatas and interludes led to a grant from guggenheim foundation which cage received in 1949 allowing him to make a six month trip to europe there he met olivier messiaen who helped organize a performance of work for his students in paris on june 7 1949 and he befriended pierre boulez who became an early admirer of work and wrote a lecture about it for june 17 1949 performance at salon of suzanne tezenas in paris for details and full text of boulez lecture see pierre boulez john cage robert samuels jean jacques nattiez boulez cage correspondence translated by robert samuels cambridge university press 1995 while still living in paris cage began writing string quartet in four parts yet another work influenced by indian philosophy analysis piano preparation 300px thumb right part of table of preparations of sonatas and interludes in text accompanying first recording of sonatas and interludes cage specifically stated that use of preparations is not a criticism of instrument but a simple practical measure cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940 when he wrote a piece called bacchanale for a dance by fort and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for instrument however in sonatas and interludes preparation is very complex more so than in any of earlier pieces forty five notes are prepared mostly using screws and various types of bolts but also with fifteen pieces of rubber four pieces of plastic several nuts and one eraser table of preparations in edition peters 6755 copyright 1960 by henmar press it takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance despite detailed instructions any preparation is bound to be different from any other and cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to if you enjoy playing sonatas and interludes then do it so that it seems right to you for most part cage avoids using lower registers of piano and much of music s melodic foreground lies in soprano range of forty five prepared notes only three belong to three lowest octaves below f 3 d3 d2 and d1 furthermore d2 is prepared in such a way that resulting sound has frequency of a d4 resulting in two variants of d4 available one more prepared than other perry p 39 portion of keyboard above f 3 is divided into roughly three registers low middle and high low register has heaviest preparation and high register lightest different methods are used certain notes produce sounds that retain original frequency and a pianistic character others become drum like sounds detuned versions of original notes or metallic rattling sounds that have no sense of fundamental frequency at all use of soft pedal which makes hammers strike only two of three strings of each note or one for notes with only two strings complicates matter further for example note c5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when soft pedal is depressed but it sounds fairly normal if pedal is released it appears that cage was fully aware of implications of this certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note others place special emphasis on particular notes and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations see examples of analysis in perry and in nicholls pp 83 84 nicholls also provides examples of sonatas connected by use of identical note combinations 700px thumb center example 1 first five bars of sonata xv in cage s calligraphic notation definitive recording by maro ajemian supervised by composer all three major groups of sounds used in sonatas and interludes are present heavily prepared notes with no fundamental frequency discernible for instance d6 lightly prepared notes g 4 and non prepared notes g5 soft pedal is depressed throughout otherwise some of sounds would be different structure cycle comprises sixteen sonatas and four interludes arranged symmetrically four groups of four sonatas each are separated by interludes in following way sonatas i iv interlude 1 sonatas v viii interludes 2 3 sonatas ix xii interlude 4 sonatas xiii xvi cage refers to his pieces as sonata in sense that these works are cast in form that early classical keyboard sonatas such as those of scarlatti were aabb works are not cast in later sonata form which is far more elaborate only exceptions are sonatas ix xi which feature three sections prelude interlude and postlude sonatas xiv xv follow aabb scheme but are paired and given joint title gemini after work of richard lippold referring to a sculpture by lippold interludes on other hand do not have a unifying scheme first two

2 1 1 2 1 1 2 10 350px thumb right example 2 rhythmic proportions in sonata iii main technique cage used for composition is that of nested proportions an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines structure of a piece on both macroscopic and microscopic level so that larger parts of each piece are in same relation to whole as smaller parts are to a single unit of it for instance proportion for sonata iii is 1 1 3 1 4 3 1 4 in whole notes and a unit here is equal to 8 1 2 bars end of a unit is marked with a double barline in score unless it coincides with end of a section structure of this sonata is aabb section a consists of a single unit composed according to given proportion correlation on microscopic level a is repeated and aa forms first part of proportion on macroscopic level 1 1 b consists of three units and an appendix of 1 4 of a unit b is also repeated and bb gives second half of proportion 3 1 4 3 1 4 therefore aabb has proportions 1 1 3 1 4 3 1 4 correlation on macroscopic level musical phrases within each unit are also governed by same proportion pritchett p 33 analogous explanations are given in nicholls pp 82 83 perry pp 41 42 and many other sources see example 2 for a graph of structure of sonata iii proportions were chosen arbitrarily in all but last four pieces in cycle sonatas xiii and xvi use symmetrical proportions and sonatas xiv and xv share 2 2 3 3 proportion this symmetry and adherence of all four sonatas to ten bar unit were explained by cage as an expression of tranquility cage quoted in pritchett p 30 complexity of proportions prompted cage to use asymmetric musical phrases and somewhat frequent changes of time signature to achieve both microscopic and macroscopic correlation for example unit length of 8 1 2 in first section of sonata iii is achieved by using six bars in 2 2 time and two in 5 4 rather than eight bars in 2 2 and one in 1 2 in many sonatas microstructure how melodic lines are constructed deviates slightly from pre defined proportion nicholls p 83 cage had frequently used nested proportions technique and its variations before most notably in first construction in metal 1939 which was first piece to use it pritchett grove and numerous dance related works for prepared piano in sonatas and interludes however proportions are more complex partly because fractions are used in his 1949 lecture on sonatas and interludes pierre boulez specifically emphasized connection between tradition and innovation in sonatas and interludes structure of these sonatas brings together a pre classical structure and a rhythmic structure which belong to two entirely different worlds recordings sonatas and interludes has been recorded many times both in its complete form and in parts this list is
