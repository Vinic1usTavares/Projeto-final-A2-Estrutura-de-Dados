khewra salt mine or mayo salt mine is located in khewra north of pind dadan khan an administrative subdivision of jhelum district punjab region pakistan mine is located in salt range an outer range of himalaya mountains which rises from indo gangetic plain it is pakistan s largest world s 2nd largest mine is famous for its production of pink himalayan salt and is a major tourist attraction drawing up to 250 000 visitors a year its history dates back to its discovery by alexander s troops in 320 bc but it started trading in mughal era main tunnel at ground level was developed by dr h warth a mining engineer in 1872 during british rule after independence pakistan mineral development corporation took over mine which still remains largest source of salt in country producing more than 350 000 tons per annum of about 99 pure halite estimates of reserves of salt in mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons geology khewra salt mine is excavated within base of a thick layer of highly folded faulted and stretched layer of ediacaran to early cambrian evaporites of salt range formation this geological formation consists of a basal layer of crystalline halite which is intercalated with potash salts this basal layer is overlain by gypsiferous marl which is covered by interlayered beds of gypsum and dolomite with infrequent seams of oil shale these strata are overlain by of neoproterozoic to eocene sedimentary rocks that have been uplifted and eroded along with salt range formation to create salt range at southern edge of pothohar plateau ediacaran to early cambrian evaporites of salt range formation have been thrust southward over neoproterozoic to eocene sedimentary rocks by many kilometers which would have tectonically incorporated of fragments of underlying younger strata within these evaporites salt range is southern edge of a well described fold and thrust belt which underlies entire pothohar plateau and developed south of himalayas as a result of

microfossils have been used to make inferences about ages of salt range formation and its salt layers that are exposed within khewra salt mine for example while working with geological survey of india in 1930s and 1940s sahni reported finding evidence of angiosperms gymnosperms and insects inside mine which he regarded as originating from eocene period however on basis of additional geologic data later research has concluded that these palynomorphs were o h and seilacher a 1955 beitrage zur des in der salt range pakistan akademie der wissenschaften und der literatur mainz klasse abhandlungen

of lord mayo who visited it as viceroy of india salt reserves at khewra were discovered when alexander great crossed jhelum and region during his indian campaign mine was discovered however not by alexander nor by his allies but by his army s horses when they were found licking stones ailing horses of his army also recovered after licking rock salt stones during mughal era salt was traded in various markets as far away as central asia on downfall of mughal empire mine was taken over by sikhs hari singh sikh commander in chief shared management of salt range with gulab singh raja of jammu former controlled mine while latter held khewra salt quarried during sikh rule was both eaten and used as a source of revenue in 1872 some time after they had taken over sikhs territory british developed mine further they found mining to have been inefficient with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made movement of labourers difficult and dangerous supply of water inside mine was poor and there was no storage facility for mined salt only road to mine was over difficult rocky terrain to address these problems government levelled road built warehouses provided a water supply improved entrances and tunnels and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling location thumb entrance to mine khewra salt mine is situated in pind dadan khan of jhelum district located about 160 km 100 miles from islamabad and lahore it is accessed via m2 motorway about 30 kilometres 20 miles off lilla interchange while going towards pind dadan khan on lilla road mine is in mountains that are part of a salt range a mineral rich mountain system extending about 200 km from jhelum river south of pothohar plateau to where jhelum river joins indus river khewra mine is about 288 meters 945 feet above sea level and about 730 meters 2400 feet into mountain from mine entrance underground mine covers an area of 110 km2 43 sq miles production thumb display of daily salt production estimates of total reserves of salt in mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons in raw form it contains negligible amounts of calcium magnesium potassium sulphates and moisture with iron zinc copper manganese chromium and lead as trace elements salt from khewra also known as himalayan salt is red pink off white or transparent in early years of british rule khewra mine produced about 28 000 to 30 000 tons per annum it increased to about 187 400 tons per annum for five fiscal years ending 1946 7 and to 136 824 tons for two years ending 1949 50 with systematic working introduced by dr h warth mine s output was reported in 2003 to be 385 000 tons of salt per annum which amounts to almost half of pakistan s total production of rock salt at that rate of output tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years mine comprises nineteen stories of which eleven are below ground from entrance mine extends about 730 meters ft into mountains and total length of its tunnels is about 40 km 25 miles quarrying is done using room and pillar method mining only half of salt and leaving remaining half to support what is above temperature inside mine remains about throughout year narrow gauge khewra salt mines railway track laid during british era is used to bring salt out of mine in rail cars himalayan salt is pakistan s best known rock salt it is used for cooking as bath salt as brine and as a raw material for many industries including a soda ash plant set up by in 1940 salt from khewra mine is also used to make decorative items like lamps vases ashtrays and statues which are exported to united states india and many european countries use of rock salt to make artistic and decorative items started during mughal era when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it warth introduced use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from rock salt as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics in 2008 government of pakistan decided to sell off seventeen profitable organisations including khewra salt mines but plan was shelved mine is now operated by pakistan mineral

reserves scientific reports confirmed feasibility of this proposal but it was turned down flooding in 2010 in 2010 during torrential rain all over pakistan water from a nearby nullah entered mine
