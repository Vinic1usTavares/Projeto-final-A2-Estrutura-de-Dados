aggressive running style which favored running over players instead of around them questions began to arise over how long campbell could stay healthy he runs with a lot of reckless abandon said ron johnson a former running back whose own career was cut short you can run like that in college but you can t do that for 10 years and hope to survive pittsburgh steelers running back franco harris said knocking over people can look very good but you can t do it forever sometimes it s going to be somebody else who knocks you over so most important thing i think isn t to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you re healthy enough to play bum phillips though favored campbell s running style i ve been looking for a back like earl he said i m not going to change his style why would i you don t want a guy who gets hit and then flops on ground earl does same thing other backs do only better after an 11 5 regular season record in 1979 oilers defeated denver broncos in wild card round for their first home playoff win since 1960 houston then won divisional round game against san diego chargers despite both pastorini and campbell missing game due to injuries with both back in lineup

saints reuniting him with bum phillips new orleans saints saints received campbell in exchange for their first round draft pick in 1985 with which houston selected cornerback richard johnson trade
