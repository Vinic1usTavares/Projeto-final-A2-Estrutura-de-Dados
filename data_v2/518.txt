milk shark rhizoprionodon acutus is a species of requiem shark and part of family carcharhinidae whose common name comes from an indian belief that consumption of its meat promotes lactation largest and most widely distributed member of its genus milk shark typically measures long and can be found in coastal tropical waters throughout eastern atlantic and indo pacific regions occurring from surface to a depth of this species is common near beaches and in estuaries and has been recorded swimming up rivers in cambodia juveniles are known to inhabit tidal pools and seagrass meadows milk shark has a slender body with a long pointed snout and large eyes and is a nondescript gray above and white below this shark can be distinguished from similar species in its range by long furrows at corners of its mouth and seven to 15 enlarged pores just above them among most abundant sharks within its range milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans in turn it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals in common with other members of its family this species is viviparous with developing embryos sustained by a placental connection females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout year depending on location reproductive cycle is usually annual but may be biennial or triennial large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat fins and fishmeal despite this international union for conservation of nature has assessed this species as being of least concern because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained taxonomy and phylogeny thumbnail left early illustration of milk shark under obsolete name scoliodon german naturalist eduard ruppell published first scientific description of milk shark as carcharias acutus specific epithet means sharp in latin in his 1837 fische des rothen meeres fishes of red sea it has since been listed under several different genera including carcharhinus and scoliodon before finally being placed in genus rhizoprionodon via synonymization with type species r as ruppell did not mention a type specimen in 1960 wolfgang designated a long male caught off jeddah saudi arabia as lectotype for this species common name milk shark comes from a belief held in india that eating this shark s meat enhances lactation other names for this species include fish shark grey dog shark little blue shark longmans milk dog shark sharp nosed milk shark s sharp nosed shark and white eye shark a 1992 phylogenetic analysis by gavin naylor based on allozymes found that milk shark is most basal of four rhizoprionodon species examined extinct r known from middle miocene 16 12 ma deposits in southern france and portugal may be same as r acutus distribution and habitat milk shark has widest distribution of any rhizoprionodon species in eastern atlantic ocean it is found from mauritania to angola as well as around madeira and in gulf of taranto off southern italy in indian ocean it occurs from south africa and madagascar northward to arabian peninsula and eastward to south and southeast asia in pacific ocean this species occurs from china and southern japan through philippines and indonesia to new guinea and northern australia milk shark likely once had a contiguous distribution by way of tethys sea until during miocene epoch when eastern atlantic sharks were isolated from indo pacific sharks by collision of asia and africa occurring close to shore from surf zone to a depth of milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and occasionally enters estuaries in shark bay western australia juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of antarctica and posidonia australis although some sources state this species avoids low salinities it has been reported several times from fresh water in cambodia as far upstream as sap milk sharks may be found anywhere in water column from surface to bottom off kwazulu natal south africa its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer suggesting some form of seasonal movement description thumb left alt side view of front half of a slender shark gray above and white below with short broad fins and large eyes identifying features of milk shark are long furrows at corners of its mouth and enlarged pores above them largest member of its genus off west africa milk shark has been reported to reach and for males and and for females though there is uncertainty regarding species identity of these specimens even if accepted these figures are considered exceptional and most individuals do not exceed in length generally females are heavier and attain a greater maximum size than males milk shark has a slender build with a long pointed snout large round eyes with nictitating membranes protective third eyelids and no spiracles on each side of head behind corner of jaw there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores nostrils are small as are adjacent triangular skin flaps there are long furrows at corners of mouth on both upper and lower jaws tooth rows number 24 25 in both jaws upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique lower teeth have a similar shape though serrations are smaller and tips curve gently upward teeth of juveniles are smooth edged bester c biological profiles milk shark florida museum of natural history ichthyology department retrieved on september 10 2009 broad

edge of caudal fin may be dark and trailing edges of pectoral fins may be light biology and ecology one of most if not most abundant near shore sharks within its range milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes occasionally squid octopus cuttlefish crabs shrimp and gastropods are also taken in shark bay most important prey are herring smelt whitings and wrasses this is also only local shark species that preys on waigeo found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks in gulf of carpentaria it feeds mainly on herring and mullets and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans switching to fish as they grow older many predators feed on milk shark including larger sharks such as blacktip shark carcharhinus limbatus and australian blacktip shark carcharhinus tilstoni and possibly also marine mammals off kwazulu natal decimation of large sharks by use of gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers a known parasite of this species is copepod pseudopandarus australis there is some evidence that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other life history like other requiem sharks milk shark is viviparous females usually have a single functional ovary on left and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo details of its life history vary across different parts of its range females generally produce young every year though some give birth every other year or even every third year mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer april to july off western and southern africa and in winter off india alternately off oman parturition occurs year round with a peak in spring parturition also occurs continuously in australian waters in herald bight of shark bay number of newborns peaks in april and again in july one proposed explanation for lack of reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development though there is presently no evidence of this occurring females do not store sperm internally litter size ranges from one to eight with two to five being typical increasing with female size in waters females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2 1 and all female litters are not uncommon similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off senegal and eastern india reason for this imbalance is unknown and it has not been observed in related species such as atlantic sharpnose shark r gestation of embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases in first phase lasting two months to an embryonic length of embryo relies on yolk for sustenance and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also yolk sac during second phase which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of external gill filaments develop and yolk sac begins to be resorbed embryo ingesting histotroph a nutritious substance secreted by mother in meantime in third phase lasting six to eight months depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which fetus receives nourishment until birth young sharks are typically born at a length of and weigh there is an atypical record of a female caught off mumbai carrying a fetus only long that was already nearly fully developed long before gestation was complete pregnant females make use of inshore nursery areas to give birth taking advantage of warmer waters and abundant food known nursery areas include banc d arguin national park off mauritania and cleveland bay and herald bight off australia in herald bight large groups of small milk sharks can be found in shallow tidal pools as well as in seagrass beds where they are sheltered from predators by dense tall vegetation sharks move out of these coastal embayments when they mature males and female milk sharks mature at lengths of and respectively off west africa and respectively off southern africa and and respectively off oman these discrepancies in maturation size may be a result of regional variation or incidental selection from heavy fishing pressure growth rate for milk sharks off chennai have been calculated as in first year in second year in third year in fourth year in fifth year and per year from then on age at maturation is thought to be 2 3 years and maximum lifespan is at least 8 years human interactions thumb alt three small gray sharks sitting on ice in a fish market large numbers of milk sharks are caught commercially and sold as food milk shark is harmless to humans because of its small size and teeth caught using longlines gillnets trawls and hook and line this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range off northern australia it ranks among most common sharks caught in trawls and comprises 2 and 6 of annual gillnet and longline catches respectively this species is also one of most commercially important sharks caught off senegal mauritania oman and india some sport fishers regard it as a game fish international union for conservation of nature has listed milk shark under least concern despite being heavily fished it has a wide distribution and remains fairly common reproductive characteristics of this species suggests it is capable of withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation though not as much as grey sharpnose shark r or australian sharpnose shark r in 1980s and early 1990s stock assessments of milk shark off india s veraval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below maximum sustainable level however these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations moreover fishing pressure in region has increased substantially since assessments were conducted see also list of sharks references milk shark category fish of
