300 people canadian online explorer writer john pollock reviewed show and felt it featured usual assortment of wacky finishes and outside interference but that all in all it was a solid show pollock commented on musical performance shown at beginning of telecast stating crowd is silent in appreciation crowd is very hot for this opener and atmosphere should hopefully add to this show stated pollock when covering tna x division championship match pollock discussed street fight in his review commenting that crowd was really hot for this match as for last man standing match pollock said it was an outstanding match pollock also felt that main event got zero time pollock noted that fans in attendance started chanting fire russo during black tie brawl and chain match in his review which was a reference to tna writer vince russo wade keller of pro wrestling torch newsletter rated matches out of five stars in his review of event he gave main event 2 3 4 stars and discussed amount of time it was given stating it was just enough time for a suitable main event but that it did not leave much flex time for things to run past bare minimum for a ppv main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they re going to do with sting and nash keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in bout commenting that tna management needed to start fining wrestlers for taking unprotected to skull because it was just not worth long term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to skull over years of wrestling he gave last man standing bout 4 stars and said it was a superb match with a scaring finish since potential for something going wrong given angle s legit neck problems was substantial even if everything was planned to work out that way keller rated street fight 1 1 2 stars and stated it was pretty clunky late and early on crowd brawling got a little repetitive and that it felt like yet another weapons match match was okay but nothing more tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus like distraction than a valuable prop for match said keller in his coverage of black tie brawl and chain match which he gave 1 1 4 stars keller gave world tag team championship match 2 stars but did not give his opinion outside rating on contest he did comment on x division championship match saying it was a very good match and gave it 3 stars james caldwell also of pro wrestling torch newsletter published a review of show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on top matches on card he considered main event underwhelming due to audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another joe booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish and that it was not memorable but that it would generate talk about jarrett he gave bout 2 stars that was an epic match said caldwell when discussing last man standing match however he felt bout had a silly pin and count em stipulation and that all too real neck injury angle followed by some post match activity that took away from styles s win caldwell felt match made styles look like a star when he won then he came across like a punk attacking angle then a fool being in position for sting to take him out but that he had a memorable star making victory over angle he disapproved of styles being used a means to end of explaining sting s purpose driven tna life caldwell rated encounter 4 stars as for street fight he said it was a fun brawl for audience and gave it 2 1 2 stars caldwell believed that world tag team championship match had good heat that over rode stream of outside interference referee incompetence and overall over booking and that it was refreshing to see tna use an injury angle from tv to set up finish of an important ppv match he gave match 3 stars x division championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been great if it had avoided involving outside interference aftermath
