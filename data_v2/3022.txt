barbara stanwyck who had appealed to women dominated audiences during war years 20th century fox wanted monroe to be a star of new decade who would draw men to movie theaters and saw her as a replacement for aging betty grable their most popular blonde bombshell of 1940s according to film scholar richard dyer monroe s star image was crafted mostly for male gaze from beginning monroe played a significant part in creation of her public image and towards end of her career exerted almost full control over it she devised many of her publicity strategies cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as sidney skolsky and louella parsons and controlled use of her images in addition to grable she was often compared to another iconic blonde 1930s film star jean harlow comparison was prompted partly by monroe who named harlow as her childhood idol wanted to play her in a biopic and even employed harlow s hair stylist to color her hair monroe s screen persona focused on her blonde hair and stereotypes that were associated with it especially dumbness naivete sexual availability and artificiality she often used a breathy childish voice in her films and in interviews gave impression that everything she said was utterly innocent and uncalculated parodying herself with double entendres that came to be known as for example when she was asked what she had on in 1949 nude photo shoot she replied i had radio on thumb upright left alt monroe in gentlemen prefer blondes she is wearing a white dressing gown and is holding a phone she looks shocked with wide eyes and an

almost always chorus girls secretaries or models occupations where woman is on show there for pleasure of men monroe began her career as a pin up model and was noted for her hourglass figure she was often positioned in film scenes so that her curvy silhouette was on display and often posed like a pin up in publicity photos her distinctive hip swinging walk also drew attention to her body and earned her nickname girl with horizontal walk monroe often wore white to emphasize her blondness and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing either being shockingly revealing or even malfunctioning such as when a shoulder strap of her dress snapped during a press conference in press stories monroe was portrayed as embodiment of american dream a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to hollywood stardom stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated film scholar thomas harris wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available ideal playmate in contrast to her contemporary grace kelly who was

parsons at ciro s nightclub in may monroe s screen persona as a dim witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality this became an obstacle when she wanted to pursue other kinds of roles or to be respected as a businesswoman academic sarah churchwell studied narratives about monroe and has stated biographer lois banner has written that monroe often subtly parodied her status as a sex symbol in her films and public appearances and that marilyn monroe character she created was a brilliant archetype who stands between mae west and madonna in tradition of twentieth century gender tricksters monroe herself stated that she was influenced by west learning a few tricks from her that impression of laughing at or mocking her own sexuality she studied comedy in classes by mime and dancer lotte goslar famous for her comic stage performances and goslar also instructed her on film sets in gentlemen prefer blondes one of films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde monroe had sentence i can be smart when it s important but most men don t like it added to her character s lines according to dyer monroe became virtually a household name for sex in 1950s and her image has to be situated in flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised fifties in america such as freudian ideas about sex kinsey report 1953 and betty friedan s feminine mystique 1963 by appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal monroe was first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger in contrast to 1940s femme fatales spoto likewise describes her as embodiment of postwar ideal of american girl soft transparently needy worshipful of men naive offering sex without demands which is echoed in molly haskell s statement that she was fifties fiction lie that a woman had no sexual needs that she is there to cater to or enhance a man s needs monroe s contemporary norman mailer wrote that marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others but ice cream with her while groucho marx characterized her as mae west theda bara and bo peep all rolled into one according to haskell due to her status as a sex symbol monroe was less popular with women than with men as they couldn t identify with her and didn t support her although this would change after her death dyer has also argued that monroe s blonde hair became her defining feature because it made her racially unambiguous and exclusively white just as civil rights movement was beginning and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth century popular culture banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during civil rights movement but has also criticized dyer pointing out that in her highly publicized private life monroe associated with people who were seen as white ethnics such as joe dimaggio italian american and arthur miller jewish according to banner she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs for example in an image featured in look in 1951 she was shown in revealing clothes while

that shampoo comes in monroe in a lustre creme shampoo advertisement in 1953 monroe was perceived as a specifically american star a national institution as well known as hot dogs apple pie or baseball according to photoplay banner calls her symbol of a star whose joyful and glamorous public image helped nation cope with its paranoia in 1950s about cold war atom bomb and totalitarian communist soviet union historian fiona handyside writes that french female audiences associated whiteness blondness with american modernity and cleanliness and so monroe came to symbolize a modern liberated woman whose life takes place in public sphere film historian laura mulvey has written of her as an endorsement for american consumer culture twentieth century fox further profited from monroe s popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses such as jayne mansfield and sheree north other studios also attempted to create their own universal pictures with mamie van doren columbia

upright left left panel from pop artist james gill s painting marilyn triptych 1962 due to contrast between her stardom and troubled private life monroe is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media fame and consumer culture according to academic susanne monroe has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society and she is never completely situated in one time or place but has become a surface on which narratives of american culture can be re constructed and functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced transformed translated into new contexts and enacted by other people similarly banner has called monroe eternal shapeshifter who is re created by each generation even each individual to their own specifications monroe remains a cultural icon but critics are divided on her legacy as an actress david thomson called her body of work insubstantial and pauline kael wrote that she could not act but rather used her lack of an actress s skills to amuse public she had wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting and vice versa she did what others had good taste not to do in contrast peter bradshaw wrote that monroe was a talented comedian who understood how comedy achieved its effects and roger ebert wrote that monroe s eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on screen was magical similarly jonathan rosenbaum stated that she subtly subverted sexist content of her material and that difficulty some people have discerning monroe s intelligence as an actress seems rooted in ideology of a repressive era when women weren t supposed to be smart years 1947 scudda hoo scudda
