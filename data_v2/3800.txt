black prince s chevauchee also known as grande chevauchee was a large scale mounted raid carried out by an anglo gascon force under command of edward black prince between 5 october and 2 december 1355 as a part of hundred years war john count of armagnac who commanded local french forces avoided battle and there was little fighting during campaign anglo gascon force of 4 000 6 000 men marched from bordeaux in english held gascony to narbonne and back to gascony devastating a wide swathe of french territory and sacking many french towns on way while no territory was captured enormous economic damage was done to france modern historian clifford rogers concluded that importance of economic attrition of chevauchee can hardly be exaggerated english component resumed offensive after christmas to great effect and more than 50 french held towns or fortifications were captured during following four months in august 1356 black prince headed north on another devastating chevauchee with 6 000 men he was intercepted by main french army 11 000 strong and forced to battle at poitiers where he decisively defeated french and captured king john ii of france background since norman conquest of 1066 english monarchs had held titles and lands within france possession of which made them vassals of kings of france following a series of disagreements between philip vi of france and edward iii of england on 24 may 1337 philip s great council in paris agreed that lands held by edward iii in france should be taken back into philip s hands on grounds that edward iii was in breach of his obligations as a vassal this marked start of hundred years war which was to last 116 years before war commenced well over 1 000 ships a year departed gascony for england among their cargoes were more than of wine duty levied by english crown on wine from bordeaux capital of gascony was more than all other customs duties combined and by far largest source of state income bordeaux had a population of more than 50 000 greater than london s and bordeaux was possibly richer however by this time english gascony had become so truncated by french encroachments that it relied on imports of food mostly from england any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve gascony and financially cripple england french were well aware of this although gascony was cause of war edward iii was able to spare few resources for its defence and previously when an english army had campaigned on continent it had operated in northern france in most campaigning seasons gascons had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by french in 1339 french besieged bordeaux capital of gascony even breaking into city with a strong force before they were repulsed typically gascons could field 3 000 6 000 men large majority infantry although up to two thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons in july 1346 edward iii landed main english army in normandy in northern france philip concentrated french forces against this threat and over following year anglo gascons were able to push focus of fighting away from heart of gascony french port of calais fell to english on 3 august 1347 after an eleven month siege and shortly after truce of calais was signed this was partially result of both countries being financially exhausted same year black death reached northern france and southern england resulting in death of approximately 45 of population fighting continued in picardy and brittany and especially fiercely in south west france where english raided deep into french territory but no large forces took field negotiations for a permanent peace commenced in 1353 in avignon under auspices of pope innocent vi and war died down to skirmishes and small scale raids these talks collapsed in early 1355 in april 1355 edward iii and his council with treasury in an unusually favourable financial position decided to launch offensives that year in both northern france and gascony john ii of france attempted to strongly garrison his northern towns and fortifications against expected descent by edward iii at same time assembling a field army he was unable to largely due to lack of money prelude thumb upright 0 8 alt edward black prince edward black prince in their 1345 and 1346 gascon campaigns english had pushed main front back well beyond borders of gascony to north and west among other things guaranteeing its food supplies and putting gascon territory beyond reach of french advances from those directions numerous french held castles and small towns remained within what was nominally english territory just as english had outposts deep within french territory to immediate south lay county of armagnac largely untouched by war it was heartland of john count of armagnac french king s personal representative in south west and most powerful french noble in region john had long been a proponent of pressing war against gascony he had ignored his orders to keep truce in 1354 raiding repeatedly into agenais and besieging several important towns albeit unsuccessfully in spring 1355 he again made unsuccessful attempts to capture english held towns frustrated and with peace talks having failed he launched repeated raids deep into gascony throughout summer to great effect he devastated agricultural areas and burnt down suburbs of several gascon towns edward iii s eldest son edward of woodstock later commonly known as black prince was given gascon command and began assembling men shipping and supplies he was scheduled to sail in july but eventually set off on 9 september arriving in bordeaux capital of gascony on 20th accompanied by 2 200 english soldiers next day he was formally acknowledged as king s lieutenant in gascony with plenipotentiary powers gascon nobility pressed on him advantages of striking at county of armagnac black prince agreed to make armagnac his first target gascon nobles who had been preparing for expedition for some time reinforced him to a strength of somewhere between 5 000 and 6 000 and provided a bridging train and a substantial supply train latter largely carried grain for horses although later it was used to transport spoils of chevauchee english expedition to normandy was intended to be carried out with cooperation of french magnate charles ii of navarre but charles reneged on agreement instead a chevauchee a large scale mounted raid was attempted from english enclave of calais in november however french king had stripped area of fodder food and potential booty causing english to return to calais within ten days they had achieved nothing but did focus french attention on north chevauchee heading east on 5 october 1355 black prince s anglo gascon force left bordeaux on their own carefully planned chevauchee it took in reinforcements and supplies at saint macaire to south and continued through bazas reaching border with armagnac on 12 october rapid march to this point caused many of expedition s 15 000 horses to die or break down especially those which had accompanied english on exhausting eleven day sea voyage and been given inadequate time to recover this had been allowed for and they were replaced locally before crossing border new knights were dubbed as if it were eve of a formal battle and banners were unfurled as soon as armagnac was entered army started devastating countryside anglo gascons divided into three columns which marched parallel to each other to maximise destruction over eleven days chevauchee traversed armagnac from west to east in sight of pyrenees weather was fine and one combatant reported area to be a noble rich and beautiful region most towns were fortified in name only and were easily stormed and burnt within reach of line of march only two towns escaped destruction black prince wrote we rode through land of armagnac harrying and wasting country gascon lords were much comforted upright thumb alt a colourful fourteenth century depiction of a town being sacked a town being sacked john of armagnac deliberately avoided battle even though french forces in region outnumbered english he was reinforced by james de bourbon constable of france and jean de clermont marshal of france and french concentrated in strongly fortified large city of toulouse expecting a siege they broke bridges enabling access to city and confidently expected black prince to withdraw to gascony once he saw strength of fortifications english passed within a few miles of city and continued east fording strongly flowing garonne and ariege rivers former described by a member of expedition as rough rocky and most frightening and latter as even more dangerous several horses and a small but unknown number of men were lost during operation but supply wagons all crossed successfully this took french by surprise they had not even guarded fords area they now passed through was known as granary of southern france a contemporary described area east of toulouse as fattest land in world english continued to burn everything they could in particular targeting windmills as a region unable to grind its own grain was unlikely to be able to provide a surplus to support french military as before they stormed all but largest towns and strongest castles often amidst brutality and slaughter small groups ranged at least from main body looting and burning smaller places across a wide front major city of carcassonne east of toulouse was cultural political religious and financial centre of area and was captured when population abandoned town and retreated to strongly fortified citadel they offered a huge sum if english would spare town but this was refused after three days of rest and looting town was thoroughly fired tax records for region were also captured which enabled english to form an accurate view of damage they were doing to french economy and war effort they continued east in weather which had turned wintery whole area was burned according to a participant two days later on 8 november they reached narbonne from mediterranean it was only a little less populous than london but again town was rapidly captured and sacked while citadel was ignored french in citadel responded by bombarding english with artillery whole of southern france was in uproar a major offensive so late in year had not been expected and black prince s willingness to march from his base crossing rivers considered impassable to large bodies and living off land took french completely by surprise english scouts foragers and arson parties pushed out in all directions from narbonne some as far as french towns up to away began hastily reinforcing their fortifications two nuncios arrived from pope innocent attempting to arrange a truce they were turned away being told to apply to edward iii returning west thumb upright 0 8 left alt john count of armagnac john count of armagnac john of armagnac with bourbon and clermont moved at least part of french army to west of narbonne where road crossed river aude they apparently hoped to force english to attack them across river and so fight at an advantage english were unable to remain in any one place for long as it soon became stripped of food especially fodder and grain for 15 000 horses with army so on 10 november english moved out from narbonne their rearguard and stragglers being harassed by a sortie of town militia english crossed aude north of narbonne and then headed north east towards beziers their scouts reported that town was strongly held and so after a council of war they turned back to west expecting to have to fight armagnac s force it was an arduous march and water was short one chronicler writes that horses which would normally require of water each day had to be given wine instead french retreated to toulouse not wishing to meet english on equal terms when they anticipated that english combined arms tactics and use of longbowmen would lead to their defeat black prince pursued them as far as carcassonne where struggling to forage in territory which had already been well picked over he struck south towards prosperous city of which was destroyed on sunday 15 november english army razed four large french towns and devastated surrounding area while their leaders were inducted as lay brothers at dominican monastery at english then turned east again across county of foix on 17th black prince met with gaston count of foix most powerful french noble in region after armagnac and a great enemy of his details of discussion are unknown but gaston allowed english free passage arranged provisions allowed his men to join black prince s army and provided guides weather was bad and going difficult army again forded garonne and ariege in flood to amazement of locals numerous towns not belonging to gaston were looted and burnt french were initially quiescent as english swung wide to south of toulouse but james of bourbon persuaded john of armagnac to lead french army south west from toulouse on 18 november in an attempt to cut off english they hoped to turn back english at river save in eastern armagnac and so strand them in french territory two advance guards met in a fierce clash on 20 november french were defeated and they retreated english followed and camped close to french on 22nd in formation anticipating a battle next day but numerically superior french withdrew during night english headed directly for gascony following a different route to that of six weeks earlier marching was hard and water was short in places causing an increase in deaths among horses on 28 november english crossed border of gascony and many gascons left at this point balance of army returned to la reole on 2 december having marched black prince and his entourage moved on to bordeaux on 9th effect contemporary accounts agree chevauchee left immense destruction in its wake and that an enormous amount of booty was seized according to one account english soldiers jettisoned silver they had looted in order to be able to carry all gold and jewellery available it was reported that formal booty took 1 000 carts to transport a gross exaggeration but indicative of impression amount of loot seized made on contemporaries french knights and merchants captured were ransomed while no territory was captured enormous economic damage was done to france carcassonne alone generated more tax than seven entire provinces combined four main cities burnt down alone paid for 1 000 men at arms and generated an additional 100 000 ecu in tax each year if unadulterated this would be approximately half a tonne 0 5 tons of silver or two per cent of french crown s annual income it was estimated that towns destroyed generated a total of 400 000 ecu annually in war taxes all were subsequently given considerable tax exemptions and trade privileges for many years for example town of was exempted from war taxes for seven years in addition 500 villages were destroyed modern historian clifford rogers concluded that importance of economic attrition of chevauchee can hardly be exaggerated as well as direct financial effects towns throughout south of france looked to their defences spending large amounts over several years on building or repairing fortifications and being much less willing to let troops raised locally serve away from home contemporaries including black prince considered chevauchee to have been as successful in non financial terms as in financial punishment of minor lords who had switched sides to french persuasion of local magnates especially gaston of foix to move towards english securing of gascony against attack from south and establishment of a moral ascendancy over french forces all this had been achieved during black prince s first independent command and with almost no losses among anglo gascons aftermath majority of gascon troops involved in chevauchee dispersed to their homes for winter after a three week break and an enthusiastic celebration of christmas english force plus a small number of gascons was divided into four groups and resumed offensive french morale was low and lack of money for wages kept garrisons small more than 50 french held towns or fortifications were captured during following four months including strategically important towns close to borders of gascony and others over away armagnac put john of boucicaut in charge of defending this front over winter but as he had only 600 men he felt there was little he could do other local french commanders felt similarly under resourced and attempted no countermeasures several members of local french nobility went over to english black prince received homage from them on 24 april 1356 reinforcements of men and horses and supplies of food and materiel arrived from england during spring and at start of august 1356 black prince headed north on another chevauchee with an anglo gascon force of 6 000 he penetrated as far as loire then withdrew pursued by main french army 11 000 strong under john ii english were forced to battle at poitiers where they decisively
