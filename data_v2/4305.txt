general sejm and local sejmik on territories of austrian partition estates were disbanded following krakow uprising of 1846 in 1861 they were succeeded by sejm of land estates in question were primarily clergy and nobility with a token townsfolk representation peasantry was not represented history postulate sejm thumbnail leon sapieha first speaker of of estates of galicia thumbnail first polish viceroy of galicia count agenor romuald goluchowski parts of polish lithuanian commonwealth lesser poland territories were included in austrian partition as early as first partition of poland in 1772 in order to reduce dissent austrian empire in 1775 allowed polish nobility szlachta of newly acquired territories to continue their tradition of holding local parliament like meetings and gave permission for an advisory body postulate sejm to be held every year implementation of postulate sejm was delayed and eventually it held only four sessions all in lviv lwow in 1782 1784 1786 and 1788 body had no real power it could only write petitions to monarch who had no obligation to act on them polish legal scholar stanislaw noted that while sejm on surface continued polish parliamentary tradition real goal of powerless body as intended by austrian court was to drive a wedge between various groups of polish nobility reducing their unity and influence postulate sejm was composed of wealthy nobility and two deputies from city of lviv sessions lasted a few days each 1788 session was last one parts of austrian held commonwealth territories were briefly included in duchy of warsaw following polish austrian war in 1806 and populace represented at sejm of duchy of warsaw but this was short lived as territories in question were restored to austria following duchy s occupation and terms of congress of vienna in 1815 estates of galicia soon afterward in 1817 francis i of austria called for a new sejm now named estates of galicia which met again in lviv most scholars like jacek jedruch see this body as a continuation of postulate sejm and discuss both of them together austrian emperor decreed that members have to wear a special uniform this made it only polish parliament like body in history of polish politics with a dress code requirement excepting establishment of as a center for polish cultural study sejm reflected conservative attitudes of body s unelected members from nobility and landed gentry from late 1830s an influx of new members such as leon sapieha wladyslaw and agenor goluchowski made body more progressive and representative in 1840s sejm saw much debate on subject of abolition of serfdom estates last met in 1845 when they voted 116 to 10 on proposal to abolish serfdom however they lacked power to implement it and had to wait for emperor s decision estates were disbanded following krakow uprising of 1846 a mostly peasant rebellion aimed ironically at many of nobles who were supportive of abolition of serfdom in 1848 during spring of nations unrest when emperor tried to convene estates members refused demanding a more representative composition and increased powers emperor turned down their demand in 1861 estates were succeeded by country sejm composition and organization number of members was not fixed it varied from over 200 with 289 in 1782 and 213 in 1817 to as low as 41 in 1834 in most years sejm had averaged 60 to 80 deputies they were composed of clergy nobility either titled or above a certain relatively high income level two deputies from city of lviv representing burghers and later chancellor of university of lwow members were not elective holding mandates due to their offices titles or wealth this made sejm not representative and rather conservative estates met for a few days each year with some exceptions they were not convened in years 1831 and 1832 time of november uprising in neighboring polish congress kingdom estates had no dedicated location to meet to evade emperor s limitation on proceedings duration and topics to be discussed members met before each session at various locations while in session they met at former monastery buildings owned by university of lwow competences just like preceding postulate sejm estates had very limited competences they met to hear emperor decrees distribute tax assessments grant galician titles of nobility to individuals who already held similar titles elsewhere in austrian empire prepare petitions and appeals to be heard by emperor polish 19th century historian henryk schmitt wrote that role of estates was to listen to government decisions and file petitions which often waited for royal reply for several years he thus notes that estates were powerless a comedy their only purpose being to fulfill congress of vienna requirement
