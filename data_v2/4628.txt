1948 bermuda hurricane air weather service designation dog was an intense and long lived cape verde tropical cyclone that wrought significant damage to bermuda and areas of newfoundland in september 1948 storm was eighth named storm and third hurricane of annual hurricane season originating as a tropical wave off coast of africa on september 4 cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later after reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of lesser antilles hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track bringing it near bermuda at peak intensity as a category 4 hurricane on september 13 afterwards hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken waning tropical cyclone grazed cape race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on september 15 these remnants persisted for an additional day despite never making landfall tropical cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on bermuda and newfoundland in former hurricane brought winds in excess of downing power lines and felled trees property damage also resulted from strong winds overall damage on island totaled 400 000 after passing west of bermuda tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes two ships leicester and gaspar encountered hurricane and became stricken in open waters though most people were rescued from both ships six people perished on former while one died on latter beginning on september 15 hurricane tracked east of newfoundland producing heavy rainfall on land precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow inundating additional areas on island two people were killed overall hurricane caused eight fatalities meteorological history on september 3 tropical wave from which resulting hurricane would develop from was detected just off coast of western africa near dakar this marked second consecutive year in which a tropical cyclone could be traced back as far east as africa in hurdat official database for tropical cyclones in north atlantic dating back to 1851 atlantic hurricane season area of disturbed weather is estimated to have organized into a tropical storm by 0600 utc following day over course of succeeding week tropical cyclone moved in a general westward direction as it gradually intensified reaching hurricane intensity by 0000 utc on september 5 and then attaining equivalent of a modern day category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale at 0600 utc on september 8 up until this time its existence and trek across central atlantic was only inferred however aircraft reconnaissance detected and as such confirmed existence of tropical cyclone following day while hurricane was situated approximately east of antigua operationally however reconnaissance flight significantly underestimated winds of tropical cyclone with estimates of tropical storm force winds at storm s center thereafter hurricane began curving northward as it continued to intensify reaching equivalent of a modern day category 3 hurricane a major hurricane by september 11 two days later storm strengthened further into a category 4 hurricane as no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards this also marked storm s official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at however aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least at roughly same time frame storm s northward recurvature caused it to track just west of bermuda late on september 13 afterwards a weakening trend began as hurricane tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes by september 15 storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity after passing south of cape race later that day hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800 utc next day near greenland during storm s twelve day trek hurricane tracked approximately roughly equidistant to distance between new york city and london preparations and impact central atlantic and bermuda as hurricane traversed central atlantic united states weather bureau indicated that storm would not be a threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position however ships in storm s vicinity and to northwest of hurricane were advised caution other shipping lanes in forecast path of hurricane were also warned after recurving in direction of bermuda british overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds which were expected from hurricane aircraft from united states air force and navy stationed in bermuda were sent to airfields in united states to avoid hurricane while a navy task force of twelve ships including escort carrier uss mindoro cve 120 were dispatched from island u s naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of base similar precautionary measures were undertaken by british naval operating base on bermuda hurricane brought sustained winds estimated between with higher gusts a minimum pressure of 958 mbar hpa 28 30 inhg was recorded though a lower pressure may have occurred on island as barometer had been falling at time strong winds downed power lines and felled trees littering insular streets with debris as a result power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported radio stations based on island went silent due to power loss an emergency backup power generator at king edward memorial hospital was used to restore electrical power to facility however oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from strong winds heavy rainfall associated with hurricane flooded long stretches of roadway some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by rainfall at local harbor six vessels were inundated by strong offshore wave action overall property damage on island was estimated at 400 000 mid atlantic and newfoundland after sweeping past bermuda weather bureau continued to advise caution to shipping lanes in storm s proximity two coastal railway steamers destined for a newfoundland port were delayed as a result of approaching storm all flights headed for torbay airport were suspended until storm s passage before affecting newfoundland however hurricane impacted numerous shipping lanes in open atlantic freighter leicester which had departed from london and was headed for new york city was caught in hurricane late on september 14 while situated roughly southwest of cape race newfoundland as weather conditions deteriorated ship began to list and as such crew abandoned ship late following day american steamship cecil n bean and argentinian steamship both assisted in rescue operations and rescued 39 crew members however six other remained unaccounted for and were presumed dead portuguese fishing schooner gaspar was also caught in storm roughly off of newfoundland and although initial reports presumed that it had already sunk united states coast guard indicated that ship was in no need of assistance however ship was still abandoned and 41 crewmen were rescued though one person was lost much of effects from hurricane on newfoundland occurred on september 15 and continued until september 18 with winds equivalent to that of a category 1 hurricane cyclone brushed east of island bringing extensive flooding offshore a ship estimated winds in excess of off of grand bank precipitation peaked at a record at fort pepperrell in st john s train traffic was effectively halted because of hurricane silt kicked up by strong winds covered railroad tracks in southern portions of city while heavy rainfall flooded several city streets similar problems occurred in avondale nearby rennie river overflowed its banks inundating adjacent land urban flooding damaged adjacent infrastructure a three year old girl died on september 16 after a landslide triggered by rain filled first floor of her home this was only death associated with hurricane on island in holyrood local highway was washed out in areas a small trestle with two concrete abutments were swept off into adjacent bay another road leading to cape saint francis suffered wash outs as deep as small bridges were also damaged and some were washed away as with rennie river waterford river also overflowed its banks due to excessive recharge and as such inundated 13 homes another river near kilbride overflowed flooding adjacent plots of land and tearing apart pavement in this manner several roads were rendered impassable and were cut off to traffic see also list of bermuda hurricanes hurricane carrie record
