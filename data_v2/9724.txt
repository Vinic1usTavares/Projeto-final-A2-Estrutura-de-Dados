major event in darius s life was his expedition to punish athens and eretria for their aid in ionian revolt and subjugate greece although ultimately ending in failure at battle of marathon darius succeeded in re subjugation of thrace expansion of empire through conquest of macedon cyclades and island of naxos and sacking of city of eretria darius organized empire by dividing it into provinces and placing satraps to govern it he organized achaemenid coinage as a new uniform monetary system along with making aramaic official language of empire he also put empire in better standing by building roads and introducing standard weights and measures through these changes empire was centralized and unified darius also worked on construction projects throughout empire focusing on susa pasargadae persepolis babylon and egypt he had cliff face behistun inscription carved to record his conquests an important testimony of old persian language darius is mentioned in biblical books of zechariah and ezra nehemiah etymology thumb left name of darius i in old persian cuneiform on dna inscription of his tomb and are latin forms of greek dareios itself from old persian d a r y us which is a shortened form of d a r y v u s longer form is also seen to have been reflected in elamite da ri y a ma u is babylonian da a ri ia a mus aramaic and possibly longer greek form name is a nominative form meaning he who holds firm good ness which can be seen by first part meaning holder and adverb meaning goodness primary sources at some time between his coronation and his death darius left a tri lingual monumental relief on mount behistun which was written in elamite old persian and babylonian inscription begins with a brief autobiography including his ancestry and lineage to aid presentation of his ancestry darius wrote down sequence of events that occurred after death of cyrus great darius mentions several times that he is rightful king by grace of supreme deity ahura mazda in addition further texts and monuments from persepolis have been found as well as a clay tablet containing an old persian cuneiform of darius from romania harmatta and a letter from darius to preserved in a greek text of roman period in foundation tablets of apadana palace darius described in old persian cuneiform extent of his empire in broad geographical terms herodotus a greek historian and author of histories provided an account of many persian kings and greco persian wars he wrote extensively on darius spanning half of book 3 along with books 4 5 and 6 it begins with removal of alleged usurper gaumata and continues to end of darius s reign early life darius was eldest of five sons to hystaspes and in 550 bce hystaspes was a leading figure of authority in persia which was homeland of persians behistun inscription of darius states that his father was satrap of bactria in 522 bce according to herodotus hystaspes was satrap of persis although french iranologist pierre briant state that this is an error also according to herodotus iii 139 darius prior to seizing power and of no consequence at time had served as a spearman doryphoros in egyptian campaign 528 525 bce of cambyses ii then persian great king this is often interpreted to mean he was king s personal spear carrier an important role hystaspes was an officer in cyrus army and a noble of his court before cyrus and his army crossed aras river to battle with armenians he installed his son cambyses ii as king in case he should not return from battle however once cyrus had crossed aras river he had a vision in which darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon confines of europe and asia known world when cyrus awoke from dream he inferred it as a great danger to future security of empire as it meant that darius would one day rule whole world however his son cambyses was heir to throne not darius causing cyrus to wonder if darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs this led cyrus to order hystaspes to go back to persis and watch over his son strictly until cyrus himself returned darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as cambyses ii ascended throne peacefully and through promotion darius was eventually elevated to be cambyses s personal lancer accession thumb left lineage of darius great according to behistun inscription there are different accounts of rise of darius to throne from both darius himself and greek historians oldest records report a convoluted sequence of events in which cambyses ii lost his mind murdered his brother bardiya and was killed by an infected leg wound after this darius and a group of six nobles traveled to sikayauvati to kill an usurper gaumata who had taken throne by pretending to be bardiya during true king s absence many modern historians believe that gaumata was in fact true heir bardiya with historical account being altered by darius to make coup d etat appear more legitimate darius s account written at behistun inscription states that cambyses ii killed his own brother bardiya but that this murder was not known among iranian people a would be usurper named gaumata came and lied to people stating he was bardiya iranians had grown rebellious against cambyses s rule and on 11 march 522 bce a revolt against cambyses broke out in his absence on 1 july iranian people chose to be under leadership of gaumata as bardiya no member of achaemenid family would rise against gaumata for safety of their own life darius who had served cambyses as his lance bearer until deposed ruler s death prayed for aid and in september 522 bce along with otanes gobryas megabyzus and killed gaumata in fortress of sikayauvati herodotus provides a dubious account of darius s ascension several days after gaumata had been assassinated darius and other six nobles discussed fate of empire at first seven discussed form of government a democratic republic was strongly pushed by otanes an oligarchy was pushed by megabyzus while darius pushed for a monarchy after stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting while a monarchy would be led with a single mindedness not possible in other governments darius was able to convince other nobles to decide who would become monarch six of them decided on a test with otanes abstaining as he had no interest in being king they were to gather outside palace mounted on their horses at sunrise and man whose horse neighed first in recognition of rising sun would become king according to herodotus darius had a slave oebares who rubbed his hand over genitals of a mare that darius s horse favored when six gathered oebares placed his hands beside nostrils of darius horse who became excited at scent and neighed this was followed by lightning and thunder leading others to dismount and kneel before darius in recognition of his apparent divine providence in this account darius himself claimed that he achieved throne not through fraud but cunning even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with inscription darius son of hystaspes obtained sovereignty of persia by sagacity of his horse and ingenious contrivance of oebares his groom according to accounts of greek historians cambyses ii had left patizeithes in charge of kingdom when he headed for egypt he later sent to murder bardiya after killing patizeithes put his brother gaumata a magian who resembled bardiya on throne and declared him great king otanes discovered that gaumata was an impostor and along with six other iranian nobles including darius created a plan to oust pseudo bardiya after killing impostor along with his brother patizeithes and other darius was crowned king following morning early reign early revolts following his coronation at pasargadae darius moved to ecbatana he soon learned that support for bardiya was strong and revolts in elam and babylonia had broken out darius ended elamite revolt when revolutionary leader was captured and executed in susa after three months revolt in babylonia had ended while in babylonia darius learned a revolution had broken out in bactria a satrapy which had always been in favour of darius and had initially volunteered an army of soldiers to quell revolts following this revolts broke out in persis homeland of persians and darius and then in elam and babylonia followed by in media parthia assyria and egypt by 522 bce there were revolts against darius in most parts of achaemenid empire leaving empire in turmoil even though darius did not seem to have support of populace darius had a loyal army led by close confidants and nobles including six nobles who had helped him remove gaumata with their support darius was able to suppress and quell all revolts within a year in darius s words he had killed a total of nine lying kings through quelling of revolutions darius left a detailed account of these revolutions in behistun inscription elimination of intaphernes one of significant events of darius s early reign was slaying of intaphernes one of seven noblemen who had deposed previous ruler and installed darius as new monarch seven had made an agreement that they could all visit new king whenever they pleased except when he was with a woman one evening intaphernes went to palace to meet darius but was stopped by two officers who stated that darius was with a woman becoming enraged and insulted intaphernes drew his sword and cut off ears and noses of two officers while leaving palace he took bridle from his horse and tied two officers together officers went to king and showed him what intaphernes had done to them darius began to fear for his own safety he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that attack against his officers was first sign of revolt he sent a messenger to each of noblemen asking them if they approved of intaphernes s actions they denied and disavowed any connection with intaphernes s actions stating that they stood by their decision to appoint darius as king of kings darius choice to ask noblemen indicates that he was not yet completely sure of his authority taking precautions against further resistance darius sent soldiers to seize intaphernes along with his son family members relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves darius believed that intaphernes was planning a rebellion but when he was brought to court there was no proof of any such plan nonetheless darius killed intaphernes s entire family excluding his wife s brother and son she was asked to choose between her brother and son she chose her brother to live her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son but she would always have but one brother darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother s and her son s life military campaigns egyptian campaign after securing his authority over entire empire darius embarked on a campaign to egypt where he defeated armies of pharaoh and secured lands that cambyses had conquered while incorporating a large portion of egypt into achaemenid empire through another series of campaigns darius i would eventually reign over territorial apex of empire when it stretched from parts of balkans thrace macedonia bulgaria paeonia in west to indus valley in east invasion of indus valley thumb eastern border of achaemenid empire in 516 bce darius embarked on a campaign to central asia aria and bactria and then marched into afghanistan to taxila in modern day pakistan darius spent winter of 516 515 bce in gandhara preparing to conquer indus valley darius conquered lands surrounding indus river in 515 bce darius i controlled indus valley from gandhara to modern karachi and appointed greek scylax of to explore indian ocean from mouth of indus to suez darius then marched through bolan pass and returned through and back to persia babylonian revolt after bardiya was murdered widespread revolts occurred throughout empire especially on eastern side darius asserted his position as king by force taking his armies throughout empire suppressing each revolt individually most notable of all these revolts was babylonian revolt which was led by nebuchadnezzar iii this revolt occurred when otanes withdrew much of army from babylon to aid darius in suppressing other revolts darius felt that babylonian people had taken advantage of him and deceived him which resulted in darius gathering a large army and marching to babylon at babylon darius was met with closed gates and a series of defences to keep him and his armies out darius encountered mockery and taunting from rebels including famous saying oh yes you will capture our city when mules shall have foals for a year and a half darius and his armies were unable to retake city though he attempted many tricks and strategies even copying that which cyrus great had employed when he captured babylon however situation changed in darius s favour when according to story a mule owned by zopyrus a high ranking soldier foaled following this a plan was hatched for zopyrus to pretend to be a deserter enter babylonian camp and gain trust of babylonians plan was successful and darius s army eventually surrounded city and overcame rebels during this revolt scythian nomads took advantage of disorder and chaos and invaded persia darius first finished defeating rebels in elam assyria and babylon and then attacked scythian invaders he pursued invaders who led him to a marsh there he found no known enemies but an enigmatic

and threatened to disrupt trade between central asia and shores of black sea as they lived between danube river river don and black sea darius crossed black sea at bosphorus straits using a bridge of boats darius conquered large portions of eastern europe even crossing danube to wage war on scythians darius invaded european scythia in 513 bc miroslav ivanov vasilev policy of darius and xerxes towards thrace and macedonia p 70 where scythians evaded darius s army using feints and retreating eastwards while laying waste to countryside by blocking wells intercepting convoys destroying pastures and continuous skirmishes against darius s army seeking to fight with scythians darius s army chased scythian army deep into scythian lands where there were no cities to conquer and no supplies to forage in frustration darius sent a letter to scythian ruler to fight or surrender ruler replied that he would not stand and fight with darius until they found graves of their fathers and tried to destroy them until then they would continue their strategy as they had no cities or cultivated lands to lose despite evading tactics of scythians darius campaign was so far relatively successful as presented by herodotus tactics used by scythians resulted in loss of their best lands and of damage to their loyal allies this gave darius initiative as he moved eastwards in cultivated lands of scythians in eastern europe proper he remained resupplied by his fleet and lived to an extent off land while moving eastwards in european scythian lands he captured large fortified city of one of allies of scythians and burnt it darius eventually ordered a halt at banks of where he built eight great forts some eight miles distant from each other no doubt as a frontier defence in his histories herodotus states that ruins of forts were still standing in his day after chasing scythians for a month darius s army was suffering losses due to fatigue privation and sickness concerned about losing more of his troops darius halted march at banks of volga river and headed towards thrace he had conquered enough scythian territory to force scythians to respect persian forces persian invasion of greece thumb map showing key sites during persian invasions of greece darius s european expedition was a major event in his reign which began with invasion of thrace darius also conquered many cities of northern aegean paeonia while macedonia submitted voluntarily after demand of earth and water becoming a vassal kingdom joseph roisman ian worthington a companion to ancient macedonia john wiley sons 2011 pp 135 138 p 343 he then left megabyzus to conquer thrace returning to sardis to spend winter greeks living in asia minor and some of greek islands had submitted to persian rule already by 510 bce nonetheless there were certain greeks who were pro persian although these were largely based in athens to improve greek persian relations darius opened his court and treasuries to those greeks who wanted to serve him these greeks served as soldiers artisans statesmen and mariners for darius however increasing concerns amongst greeks over strength of darius s kingdom along with constant interference by greeks in ionia and lydia were stepping stones towards conflict that was yet to come between persia and certain of leading greek city states when aristagoras organized ionian revolt eretria and athens supported him by sending ships and troops to ionia and by burning sardis persian military and naval operations to quell revolt ended in persian reoccupation of ionian and greek islands as well as re subjugation of thrace and conquering of macedonia in 492 bc under mardonius joseph roisman ian worthington a companion to ancient macedonia john wiley sons 2011 pp 135 138 macedon had been a vassal kingdom of persians since late 6th century bc but retained autonomy mardonius 492 campaign made it a fully subordinate part of persian kingdom these military actions coming as a direct response to revolt in ionia were beginning of first persian invasion of mainland greece at same time anti persian parties gained more power in athens and pro persian aristocrats were exiled from athens and sparta darius responded by sending troops led by his son in law across hellespont however a violent storm and harassment by thracians forced troops to return to persia seeking revenge on athens and eretria darius assembled another army of 20 000 men under his admiral datis and his nephew artaphernes who met success when they captured eretria and advanced to marathon in 490 bce at battle of marathon persian army was defeated by a heavily armed athenian army with 9 000 men who were supported by 600 plataeans and 10 000 lightly armed soldiers led by miltiades defeat at marathon marked end of first persian invasion of greece darius began preparations for a second force which he would command instead of his generals however before preparations were complete darius died thus leaving task to his son xerxes family darius was son of hystaspes and grandson of arsames both men belonged to achaemenid tribe and were still alive when darius ascended throne darius justifies his ascension to throne with his lineage he claimed he could trace his ancestors back to achaemenes even though he was only distantly related with this in mind darius married atossa daughter of cyrus with whom he had four sons xerxes achaemenes and hystaspes he also married another daughter of cyrus with whom he had two sons arsames and gobryas darius married daughter of bardiya with whom he had a son furthermore darius married with whom he had two sons and he also married another woman of nobility daughter of otanes it is unknown if he had any children with her before these royal marriages darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier gobryas from an early marriage with whom he had three sons artobazanes and any daughters he had with her are not known although artobazanes was darius s first born xerxes became heir and next king through influence of atossa she had great authority in kingdom as darius loved her most of all his wives death thumb tomb of darius great located next to other achaemenid kings at naqsh e rustam which bears dna inscription after becoming aware of persian defeat at battle of marathon darius began planning another expedition against greek city states this time he not datis would command imperial armies darius had spent three years preparing men and ships for war when a revolt broke out in egypt this revolt in egypt worsened his failing health and prevented possibility of his leading another army soon after darius died in october 486 bce body of darius was embalmed and entombed in rock cut sepulchre at naqsh e rostam which he had been preparing xerxes eldest son of darius and atossa succeeded to throne as xerxes i however prior to xerxes s accession he contested succession with his elder half brother darius s eldest son who was born to his first wife before darius rose to power in 1923 german archaeologist ernst herzfeld made casts of cuneiform inscriptions on darius s tomb where he records his ancestry for posterity ariya meaning a persian son of a persian an iranian of iranian lineage inscription at naqsh i rustam near persepolis iran they are currently housed in archives of freer gallery of art and arthur m sackler museum smithsonian institution washington dc government organization thumb 350px volume of annual tribute per district in achaemenid empire herodotus book iii 89 95 early in his reign darius wanted to reorganize structure of empire and reform system of taxation he inherited from cyrus and cambyses to do this darius created twenty provinces called satrapies or archi which were each assigned to a satrap archon and specified fixed tributes that satrapies were required to pay a complete list is preserved in catalogue of herodotus beginning with ionia and listing other satrapies from west to east excluding persis which was land of persians and only province which was not a conquered land tributes were paid in both silver and gold talents tributes in silver from each satrap were measured with babylonian talent those paid in gold were measured with talent total tribute from satraps came to an amount less than 15 000 silver talents majority of satraps were of persian origin and were members of royal house or six great noble families these satraps were personally picked by darius to monitor these provinces each of these provinces were divided into sub provinces with their own governors which were chosen either by royal court or by satrap to assess tributes a commission evaluated expenses and revenues of each satrap to ensure that one person did not gain too much power each satrap had a secretary who observed affairs of state and communicated with darius a treasurer who safeguarded provincial revenues and a garrison commander who was responsible for troops additionally royal inspectors who were eyes and ears of darius completed further checks on each satrap imperial administration was coordinated by chancery with headquarters at persepolis susa and babylon with bactria ecbatana sardis and memphis having branches darius kept aramaic as common language which soon spread throughout empire however darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for persis and persians which was called aryan script and was only used for official inscriptions before this accomplishments of king were addressed in persian solely through narration and hymns and through masters of memory indeed oral history continued to play an important role throughout history of iran economy thumb right gold daric minted at sardis darius introduced a new universal currency daric sometime before 500 bce darius used coinage system as a transnational currency to regulate trade and commerce throughout his empire daric was also recognized beyond borders of empire in places such as celtic central europe and eastern europe there were two types of darics a gold daric and a silver daric only king could mint gold darics important generals and satraps minted silver darics latter usually to recruit greek mercenaries in anatolia daric was a major boost to international trade trade goods such as textiles carpets tools and metal objects began to travel throughout asia europe and africa to further improve trade darius built royal road a postal system and phoenician based commercial shipping daric also improved government revenues as introduction of daric made it easier to collect new taxes on land livestock and marketplaces this led to registration of land which was measured and then taxed increased government revenues helped maintain and improve existing infrastructure and helped fund irrigation projects in dry lands this new tax system also led to formation of state banking and creation of banking firms one of most famous banking firms was sons based in babylonian city of nippur these banking firms provided loans and credit to clients in an effort to further improve trade darius built canals underground waterways and a powerful navy he further improved and expanded network of roads and way stations throughout empire so that there was a system of travel authorization for king satraps and other high officials which entitled traveller to draw provisions at daily stopping places religion while there is no general consensus in scholarship whether darius and his predecessors had been influenced by zoroastrianism it is well established that darius was a firm believer in ahura mazda whom he saw as supreme deity however ahura mazda was also worshipped by of indo iranian religious tradition as can be seen at behistun inscription darius believed that ahura mazda had appointed him to rule achaemenid empire darius had dualistic philosophical convictions and believed that each rebellion in his kingdom was work of enemy of asha darius believed that because he lived righteously by asha ahura mazda supported him in many cuneiform inscriptions denoting his achievements he presents himself as a devout believer perhaps even convinced that he had a divine right to rule over world in lands that were conquered by his empire darius followed same achaemenid tolerance that cyrus had shown and later achaemenid kings would show he supported faiths and religions that were alien as long as adherents were submissive and peaceable sometimes giving them grants from his treasury for their purposes he had funded restoration of israelite temple which had originally been decreed by cyrus was supportive towards greek cults which can be seen in his letter to and supported elamite priests he had also observed egyptian religious rites related to kingship and had built temple for egyptian god amun construction thumb reconstruction drawing of palace of darius in susa thumb ruins of palace in persepolis during darius s greek expedition he had begun construction projects in susa egypt and persepolis he had linked red sea to river nile by building a canal darius canal which ran from modern to modern suez to open this canal he travelled to egypt in 497 bce where inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration darius also built a canal to connect red sea and mediterranean on this visit to egypt he erected monuments and executed on charge of treason when darius returned to persis he found that codification of egyptian law had been finished additionally darius sponsored large construction projects in susa babylon egypt and persepolis in susa darius built a new palace complex in north of city an inscription states that palace was destroyed during reign of artaxerxes i but was rebuilt today only glazed bricks of palace remain majority of them in louvre in pasargadae darius finished all incomplete construction projects from reign of cyrus great a palace was also built during reign of darius with an inscription in name of cyrus great it was previously believed that cyrus had constructed this building however due to cuneiform script being used palace is believed to have been constructed by darius in egypt darius built many temples and restored those that had previously been destroyed even though darius was a believer of ahura mazda he built temples dedicated to gods of ancient egyptian religion several temples found were dedicated to ptah and nekhbet darius also created several roads and routes in egypt monuments that darius built were often inscribed in official languages of persian empire old persian elamite and babylonian and egyptian hieroglyphs to construct these monuments darius employed a large number of workers and artisans of diverse nationalities several of these workers were deportees who had been employed specifically for these projects these deportees enhanced empire s economy and improved inter cultural relations at time of darius s death construction projects were still under way xerxes completed these works and in some cases expanded his father s projects by erecting new buildings of his own see also darius mede list of biblical figures identified in extra biblical sources references bibliography further reading external links category 6th century bc kings of
