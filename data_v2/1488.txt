justice in a reply to villard dated june 9 1911 cruce called lynching an outrage but he defended laws of oklahoma as adequate and its juries competent and said administration of justice in state proceeded with little cause for criticism except in cases of extreme passion which no law and no civilization can control he added naacp argued that nothing would change while governors like cruce sought to excuse lynching as product of uncontrollable passion of white people district judge john caruthers convened a grand jury in june 1911 to investigate telling them it was duty of people of a

referring to interview seth archer found tape in 2005 in woody guthrie archives in new york and reported claude s statement in southwest review in 2006 during interview claude guthrie told klein it
