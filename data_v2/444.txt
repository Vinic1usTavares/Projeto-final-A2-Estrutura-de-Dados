195px this episode marks departure of sophia peletier portrayed by madison lintz pretty much dead already was written by scott m gimple and directed by michelle maclaren it features recurring appearances from lauren cohan scott wilson irone singleton madison lintz emily kinney jane mcneill james allen mccune and amber chaney following initial broadcast of previous installment secrets writer robert kirkman teased following episode pretty much dead already he stated there s a lot of big stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent in writers room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus so we definitely wrote to it i think people are going to be a little shocked death of sophia peletier is a major incident in pretty much dead already largely affecting themes of episode after group has shot walkers housed in hershel greene s barn sophia appears from barn as a walker much to groups dismay a disturbed and distraught rick grimes pulls out his weapon and makes decision to shoot her despite being initially surprised about her character s being killed off madison lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for show lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her and stated that she was going to look back on and say that was amazing robert kirkman felt that killing sophia would add more dimension to show as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression when a good idea comes up you have to go with it he articulated sophia is a character who is still alive in comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters having carol survive her daughter as opposed to other way around as it is in comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories although kirkman was not on set during production of sequence gimple retrieved shell casings from blanks that were fired on set referred to as by writers kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating scene it s good to know people didn t see it coming that s a big concern when you have this kind of story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal you don t want people to be expecting it especially in walking dead i pride myself in fact that when you pick up an issue of comic you don t know what s going to happen at any time so any time we can work that into show and maintain that in a television environment it s very exciting for me i m glad people are being caught off guard other themes prevalent in episode include lori s pregnancy after getting into a heated argument rick reveals to shane about her pregnancy although he didn t question who biological father was robert kirkman felt that rick was smart enough to know that kid s either his or shane s and there may not be any way of ever finding out that definitively he continued bringing that up to his wife who he loves is only going to be painful for her i think that s him being a good husband and him showing his tremendous leadership ability in that he can put his self aside for betterment of someone else reception ratings

evaluated episode as completely depressing and added that dark nature made series excel goldman ultimately gave episode an eight out of ten signifying a great rating aaron rutkoff of wall street journal felt that episode was series best installment writing for grand rapids press john serba opined that pretty much dead already was a delightful ending to first portion of season zack handlen of a v club stated that prior to its ending episode was usual mix of pretty good and deeply irritating handlen lauded character development in installment episode puts a lot of effort into heightening tensions between hershel and rick s people and while it s not exactly subtle it makes enough sense to be effective this is conflict that should ve been building for a few episodes now instead of arriving fully formed right before it explodes but i m willing to take what i can get concluding his review he issued episode an a grade digital spy s morgan jeffrey avouched that pretty much dead already was excellent and added that tension slowly ratchets up to an almost unbearable level some critics were divided with episode time journalist nate rawlings felt that while writers put a lot of substance into characters many of them are still underdeveloped gina mcintyre of los angeles times felt that some parts of episode lacked cohesion and direction episode s concluding scene involving sophia s death was cited as episode highlight janet turley of huffington post asserted that sequence was fiction not afraid to provoke while goldman described it as an absolutely horrific scenario cnn s henry hanks opined that sequence left them with a final scene that we ll be talking about until then new york kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities and felt that scene was satisfying sad and fun she wrote it was everything you ve ever wanted this show to be zombies plus no dialogue such a winning combination and how great was it that sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere holed up with merle or morgan or those warmhearted gang members in atlanta and because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive we were finally able to care about loss of her short young life jen chaney of washington post echoed synonymous sentiments really final moments of last episode before amc series december january hiatus played like a fireworks finale on fourth of july assuming your fourth of july celebrations typically involve zombies and a pile of corpses rawlings concluded that it was perfect resolution for what he called television s slowest subplot mcintyre felt that concluding sequence was most eventful moment of episode and stated that it was difficult to watch ken tucker of entertainment weekly affirmed that scene reestablished walking dead to full form as well as redeemed season s general thus far hitfix s alan sepinwall reflected similar thoughts and observed that it was effective enough to keep viewers chattering until succeeding episode handlen summated sophia reveal is a punch in gut because narrative fiction teaches us longer someone stays missing better chance they ll turn up alive otherwise where would drama be by using little girl in this way show transforms what should ve been anti climax into a reinvention of an entire storyline it s not enough to make bad parts of earlier episodes great but it does show that writers had more on their mind than stalling mark maurer of star ledger felt that albeit predictable segment was well executed josh wigler of mtv said that storyline ended in a much darker way than anyone could have imagined references external links pretty much dead already at amc category 2011 american television episodes category walking dead season 2 episodes
