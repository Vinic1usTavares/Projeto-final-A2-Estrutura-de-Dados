distant part of milky way galaxy known as koprulu sector game revolves around three intelligent species fighting for dominance terrans are humans exiled from earth who are now skilled at adapting to any situation zerg are a race of insectoid aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection and obsessed with assimilating other races protoss are a humanoid species with advanced technology and psionic abilities who are attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophy about their way of life from zerg many journalists of industry have praised starcraft as one of most important and one

2017 original game along with expansion was released for free in april 2017 gameplay thumb left a protoss force attacking a zerg colony shown from starcrafts isometric perspective blizzard entertainment s use of three distinct races in starcraft is widely credited with revolutionizing real time strategy genre all units are unique to their respective races and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in technology tree every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed psionic and technologically adept protoss have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities powered by their psionic traits however their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes encouraging players to follow a strategy of quality of their units over quantity insectoid zerg possess entirely organic units and structures which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources but are accordingly weaker relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies humanoid terrans provide a middle ground between other two races providing units that are versatile and flexible they have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery such as tanks and nuclear weapons although each race is unique in its composition no race has an innate advantage over other each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths powers and abilities their overall strength is same balance stays complete via infrequent patches game updates provided by blizzard starcraft features artificial intelligence that scales in difficulty although player cannot change difficulty level in single player campaigns each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy ai modes scaling through course of campaign to hardest ai modes in level editor provided with game a designer has access to four levels of ai difficulties easy medium hard and insane each setting differing in units and technologies allowed to an ai faction and extent of ai s tactical and strategic planning single player campaign consists of thirty missions split into ten for each race resource management each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces minerals and vespene gas minerals are needed for all units and structures and they are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around battlefield players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings and they acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract gas from it in addition players need to regulate supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct number of units they need although nature of supply differs between races terrans use physical supplies held in depots protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons and zerg are regulated by number of controlling overlord units present supply mechanic essentially works in exactly same way for each race just with differing impacts on gameplay allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them base construction protoss and zerg building construction is limited to specific locations protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid while almost every zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass called creep that is produced by certain structures terran buildings are far less limited with certain primary base structures possessing ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location terran buildings however require worker unit to continue construction on building until it is completed also once a terran building has taken a certain amount of damage it will catch fire and can eventually burn to ground without further enemy action if repairs are not performed by a worker unit protoss by contrast only require a worker unit to begin process of transporting a building to theater of operations via warp and their buildings shields but not their structure are regenerative zerg worker unit physically transforms into structure created which is capable of slowly healing itself multiplayer multiplayer on starcraft is powered through

species bill roper one of game s producers stated this would be a major departure from warcraft approach comparing its two equal sides to those of chess and stating that starcraft would allow players to develop very unique strategies based on which species is being played and will require players to think of different strategies to combat other two species hand drawn graphics seen in e3 version were also replaced with rendered graphics in early 1997 new version of starcraft was unveiled receiving a far more positive response thumb left zerg in an early alpha build of starcraft however game
