suit existing pokemon fans and young children staff at 1up com summarized that various diversions here are cute slickly produced and entertaining assuming you really really dig pokemon and that even fans would be bored if over age of five justin leeper of game informer claimed that fans would enjoy it but everyone else will be turned off pun intended author tokyo drifter of gamepro guessed that game had been tailored for die hard fans and would please no one else ign s mary jane irwin stated that its intuitive interface copious instructions and mindless entertainment would keep young players entertained nintendo powers review called game hours of fun for pokemon fans reviewers complained about game s low level of interactivity due to most of gameplay time being spent watching television with pikachu summarizing gameplay in general as weak gamespot s ricardo torres argued that game s promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by gimmick of having to virtually watch television programs and long stretches of time this entails leeper claimed that pikachu will be content much longer than you will and decried channels non interactive nature while praising unlockable status of a few darryl vassar of gamespy went even further and claimed that there was no gameplay he gave game only one star out of five as a result despite calling animation quality and pokemon voices decent tokyo drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be two biggest barriers for pokemon fan enjoyment and gave game a 3 0 on a five point scale irwin stated that player would desire more interactivity and condemned programs overall with exception of pichu bros which she called only worthwhile programming game s 3d graphics received lukewarm opinions torres called them decent but unspectacular and bland his praise focused on animations of pokemon with distinct animations that suit their personalities especially that of pikachu irwin echoed these opinions vassar stated that pokemon animations were better than those in then upcoming gamecube title pokemon colosseum and found environments passable if boring and overly limited tokyo drifter found environments bright and colorful while wholeheartedly praising smooth and adorable pokemon animations sound and music were negatively received torres focused on their repetitiveness stating that some of music within programs was catchy but it starts to grate after some of mandatory repeated viewings you ll have to endure and that paucity of sound effects puts weight of audio burden on pokemon voices which while accurate are naturally repetitive irwin and vassar gave special focus to repetitiveness of voices tokyo drifter gave little opinion on voices but found lack of voice acting for oak to be disappointing critics praised large number of collectible items and pokemon in game torres noted game s many items to collect and pokemon for pikachu to meet and praised game s increased replay value as a result tokyo drifter thought similarly calling collecting aspects a prominent part of gaming experience irwin found collecting aspects a nice way to pass time and called incorporation of virtual pokemon mini a nice diversion within three days of its japanese release pokemon channel sold 12 581 copies making it thirteenth best selling game among all platforms during its release week july 14 to july 20 by
