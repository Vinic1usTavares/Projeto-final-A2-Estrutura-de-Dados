dance pop upon release album was successful in norway blogs leaked tracks from anniemal before it was released internationally and publications from other countries soon praised album for its blissful but melancholic sound before releasing album internationally in 2005 annie s record label 679 recordings was not confident in album s ability to achieve commercial success overseas so it did not heavily promote anniemal album eventually sold over 100 000 copies worldwide it yielded four singles chewing gum heartbeat happy without you and always too late background and development in late 1990s annie held a monthly dj night called pop till you drop with friend in her hometown of bergen norway there she met producer tore kroknes and two began dating annie and kroknes borrowed a small studio from downtempo duo royksopp to record her debut single greatest hit song which uses a sample of madonna s 1982 dance pop single everybody had a limited edition release in 1999 it became an underground hit at clubs in norway and britain resulting in offers for record deals two recorded annie s second single titled i will get on she focused on vocals and melodies in music and kroknes concentrated on production influenced by techno disco and house music as she began to work on her debut album kroknes became ill due to a heart defect he died eighteen months later in april 2001 because of their plan to make album together annie struggled with idea of collaborating with anyone else and stopped work on it entirely half a year passed before annie returned to music she asked timo kaukolampi from finnish electronic group op l bastards to dj in bergen starting with a song titled kiss me he had annie contribute vocals to some of his tracks she asked kaukolampi to work on album and he produced nine of its songs for her she could not afford to rent a studio so annie recorded demos by asking to use local studios at night or borrowing one owned by her friend in late 2003 annie signed with 679 recordings and advance enabled her to complete record producer richard x impressed with greatest hit asked her to record vocals for his debut album richard x presents his x factor vol 1 in exchange he contributed chewing gum and me plus one both written with hannah robinson annie also worked with royksopp who co wrote and produced three songs on album rather than recording and selecting from a large number of songs annie stopped after around thirteen and compiled track list she selected title anniemal based on a suggestion by kroknes two had planned on writing a song titled anniemal so she chose it as album s title because to her it just made sense anniemal is simple and easy and good composition when working on songs annie was involved with whole recording and production processes with a focus on melodies annie stated that while promoting album she wanted to make sure people knew of her involvement in album s writing and production of its twelve songs ten were co written by annie she stated that although singing songs written by someone else might not feel less personal it s special to be on stage and actually sing something you had done with respect to her involvement in songwriting process annie referred to herself as a bit of a control freak lyrics of anniemal generally describe falling in or out of love annie s vocals are thin and breathy working within a narrow vocal range reviewers noted a sense of melancholy in vocals suggesting that it could be attributed to death of kroknes annie acknowledged that none of songs are directly happy and that some are happy but still a bit melancholy she stated that she thought bittersweet melodies sound timeless very scandinavian of me she insisted however that she tries to write songs that are cheerful for me it s really easy to write depressive songs and that s why i never do that i try to do songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated i think there are too many songwriters writing sad depressive songs and i find it really boring listening to music where people are just complaining people should stop whining i find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs to make happy songs and that s why i like to do it i really like to make quite hopeful happy music with a little bit of melancholy in it with a little spice of melancholy anniemal focuses on heavily layered beats with a strong 1980s influence annie was influenced by 1980s dance pop and on no easy love she includes a sample of s 1982 song easier said than done unlike many of her contemporaries annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music songs styles span genres including bubblegum pop electro disco r b dance pop and rock annie s djing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music she stated that she wanted to make a pop album that would not quickly become dated an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn t sound terrible annie considered excluding greatest hit from anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not sound as if it were five years old critical reception anniemal received acclaim from music critics at metacritic which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics album received an average score of 81 based on 23 reviews which indicates universal acclaim scott plagenhoef of pitchfork referred to songs as a dozen slices of stylish sophisticated electro pop crisp tracks that move between fizzy and woozy all anchored by annie s breathy sometimes almost muted vocals site s endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts in his review for allmusic andy kellman described anniemal as cunning but also deeply affecting dylan hicks review for village voice stated that blogosphere and british music press overrated anniemal but that an overrated good record is still a good record jody rosen wrote for new york times that album is a true album strong from top to bottom and that there is charm in annie s deadpan delivery and her songwriting is full of flair for melody for which scandinavian pop is famous rosen also contributed a review to slate where she noted that other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than chewing gum but anniemal includes several other superb songs kitty empire s review in observer stated that album s songs boast a winning combination of innocence and experience breezy blonde melodies and just so productions popmatters pierre hamilton called anniemal riveting for how it lacks waxy sheen that listeners were used to hearing in manufactured pop music however a second popmatters review written by rob horning criticised album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop adding that result was exquisitely empty enough to suck feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant blank and in his review for billboard magazine michael paoletta described album as slinky and sensual cool and classy fun and fiery and labeled it one of best debut albums of 2005 several reviewers drew parallels between mainstream pop acts and annie entertainment weeklys raymond fiore called album an addictive debut where annie flaunts whispery kylie cool and old school madonna but added that this sugar rush of an album proves candy is best consumed in moderation hua hsu of blender magazine made a similar comparison proclaiming annie kylie minogue hipsters don t have to feel guilty about liking barry walters of rolling stone touted how album comes packed with both instant surface fizz and quirky finesse that sustains repeated listenings and ending his review
