adoptive father to roman province of lycia while older man governed it as legatus augusti pro praetore or imperial governor on returning to rome both were promoted into patrician class most likely

roman empire marcellus was governor of britannia from 101 to 104 at about this time roman army was hard pressed to hold territory agricola had conquered a generation before legio ii adiutrix had been withdrawn to danube in ad 92 with three cohorts of batavian auxiliaries emperor trajan needing reinforcements for his first dacian war had called for detachments from army in britain natives took advantage of understrength garrison excavations at newstead and elsewhere show signs of destruction by fire although romans often burnt what was not worth salvaging when they evacuated a fort excavations also revealed human remains and immense quantities of equipment including damaged armour at newstead this has been taken as clear evidence of hostile action frontier was withdrawn from antonine wall to line of future hadrian s wall marcellus certainly managed at least a portion of this major reorganisation neratius marcellus was a friend of pliny younger although none of pliny s letters to marcellus have survived one of his extant letters does mention him epistulae iii 8 pliny had requested that marcellus make suetonius a tribune in britain when he succeeded in obtaining this favour for suetonius latter eventually declined post which pliny then transferred to a relative of suetonius in his place this story indicates that marcellus was able to make military appointments easily through network of patronage apparently without consulting army birley vindolandia pp 95 96 another illustration of marcellus role in network of patronage of his time is a draft of a letter recovered from roman fort at vindolanda commander of ninth cohort of batavians stationed there flavius cerialis writes to his friend crispinus about meeting with governor marcellus text is damaged at this point and there have been several theories proposed by modern historians as to purpose of this communication anthony birley suggested cerialis was asking crispinus to intercede on his behalf for a promotion or transfer m p speidel and r suggest this was an example of or a letter introducing himself to crispinus in their edition of letter alan k bowman and j david thomas offer a more prosaic interpretation writer is asking crispinus to make his military service pleasant by putting him on good terms with as many influential people as possible bowman and thomas vindolanda latin writing

hadrian relied on his brother for advice birley believes that marcellus was on familiar terms with hadrian which may be reason for signal honour of a second consulship however birley then notes that it may be that he came to a sad end soon afterwards for among hadrian s close friends author of historia augusta lists a marcellus forced to suicide by emperor footnotes references category 1st
