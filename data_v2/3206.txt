mummy cave is a rock shelter and archeological site in park county wyoming united states near eastern entrance to yellowstone national park site is adjacent to concurrent u s routes 14 16 20 on left bank of north fork of shoshone river at an altitude of in shoshone national forest at its mouth cave is approximately wide and it extends approximately into a volcanic cliff above north fork it lies along left bank of river next to mouth of a small stream and opposite from mouth of blackwater creek largest known cave along north fork it is believed to have been carved by river s flow reason for its diversion away from alcove is unknown mummy cave was occupied between 7280 bc and ad 1580 discovered by cody resident gene smith in 1957 sniffin bill mummies in wyoming weston county gazette 2015 06 18 12 it was first studied in 1962 and excavated by buffalo bill historical center site includes unusual amounts of perishable materials such as hide feathers and wood as well as buried and mummified remains of an inhabitant named by researchers mummy joe and dated to about ad 800 cave is notable for depth of its cultural deposits extending over in depth and in particular for continuity of those deposits deposits have been classified into 38 occupation levels that represent at least seasonal use of site on an annual basis extending from paleoindian period to late prehistoric period geology thumb left a closer view of cave although it is referred to as a cave mummy cave is actually a broad shallow alcove in a vertical cliff it owes its depth to its overall size and stability of parent rock alcove s roof is about above river with rock floor of alcove at about above river by time it was discovered alcove had been almost entirely filled with alluvium cliff is composed of tertiary period volcanic ash mixed with larger rock fragments of volcanic origin a similar alcove is being cut by shoshone at mouth of clocktower creek cave fill has accumulated for at least 10 000 years and appears to have originated from nearby debris fans formed where weathered material has flowed down channels in neighboring cliffs apart from depth and consistent nature of alluvium mummy cave is also characterized by extreme dryness pointed shape of cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through rock to cave and there are no vertical joints in rock above archeological investigation investigation of mummy cave was led by robert edgar from 1963 to 1965 alcove was marked out into a grid with a permanent reference mark for elevation marked on wall initial investigation focused on establishing stratigraphy once layers of alluvium in cave floor were established excavation proceeded layer by layer excavations terraced cave floor into levels following established reference grid digging was done with hand trowels in artifact bearing layers while layers devoid of artifacts were excavated with shovels spoils were disposed of down embankment site had previously been disturbed by relic hunters who had dug a deep pit in what turned out to be most productive zone of excavation relic hunters appear to have stopped when they encountered a rock cairn that covered what proved to be a human burial site by end of 1963 a portion of site had been excavated to a depth of and shored with timbers while upper three cultural zones layers 36 38 were removed across site during 1964 season layers 29 35 were removed and some zones were excavated much more deeply in 1965 layers 24 28 were removed from central area of alcove by this time it was clear that excavation would proceed for full depth of site and that disposal of a considerable quantity of excavated debris would need to be addressed a bulldozer was brought in to remove sections of fill beyond drip line of shelter 1966 season was directed by wilfred m results of mummy cave investigations were published in science in 1968 results excavation of mummy cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts which span a period of over 9000 years artifacts were disposed in a manner that permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale this continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in rocky mountain region in particular stone projectile points found at mummy cave have been used to set standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in region point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout american west stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that mummy cave was first occupied near end of glaciation later occupancy spanned altithermal followed by a cooler climate from about 1000 bc earliest layers at mummy cave yielded a few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300 bc several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers by layer 6 first parallel oblique points appeared by layer 8 roughly corresponding to 6500 bc cultural evidence became continuous layers 8 9 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf shaped projectile points which have been interpreted as corresponding to angostura style points this implies that inhabitants of mummy cave during this era were big game hunters from great plains who adapted to mountain environment in layer 16 radiocarbon dated to bc a new type of point appeared these blackwater side notched points implied arrival of a group from eastern nebraska or western iowa replacing previous group which may have moved to north presence of such points suggests a connection with simonsen site in northeastern iowa which has been dated to early archaic period this transition coincided with climatic shift to altithermal side notched points recovered from layers 21 24 and 28 imply a return of previous inhabitants easterners had moved on to central columbian plateau layer 30 was dated to 2470 150 bc layer 32 was dated to 870 135 bc it is hypothesized that layers 32 38 represent presence of people of shoshonean culture with increasingly definitive shoshonean artifacts present from layer 36 onward including cordage and basketwork layer 38 yielded gray flat bottomed pottery of shoshonean manufacture layer 36 is notable as source of mummy desiccated body of an adult male covered by a sheepskin garment with fur and feather ornament was recovered from this layer and dated to about ad 770 by radiocarbon dating several thousand animal bones were discovered in mummy cave while large majority of bones could not be identified researchers at university of texas at el paso utep were able to determine biological origins of over two thousand bones as at many other archeological sites in region significant numbers of bighorn sheep ovis canadensis and deer from genus odocoileus were identified of particular interest to biologists was much larger number of sheep than deer eighty eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in region because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as one in which mummy cave is located this anomaly has led researchers at utep to propose that site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes mccracken harold et al mummy cave project in northwestern wyoming buffalo bill historical center 1978 accessed 2009 07 31 wide range of artifacts discovered at site has caused mummy cave to be seen as a highly significant site for study of rocky mountain archeology cave s significance was recognized by national park service with its placement on national register of historic places in 1981 see also archaeology of americas arlington springs
