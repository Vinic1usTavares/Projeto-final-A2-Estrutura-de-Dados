seeds of evil begins with new turok joshua appearing through a portal to face a female alien named adon she explains he has been called by elders of lost land lazarus concordance to defeat primagen a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in wreckage of his own lightship after attempting to witness creation of universe this incident led to creation of lost land a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning awakened by events of dinosaur hunter primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from lost land to destroy five energy totems powerful devices that bound primagen to his lightship destruction of these energy totems would allow primagen to escape confines of his lightship and resulting shockwave would destroy known universe as joshua defeats primagen s armies through lost land and acquires ancient magical powers from sacred talisman chambers a mysterious entity calling itself oblivion attempts to thwart his quest by creating false copies of talisman chamber portals that lead to areas populated by its servants flesh eaters ultimately joshua manages to reach primagen s lightship and defeat primagen himself if energy totems are not protected traces of his telepathic powers will remain at end of game adon states that mysterious force which conspired against joshua during his quest still exists setting stage for sequel turok 3 shadow of oblivion development thumb seeds of evil supports nintendo 64 expansion pak which allows game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels seeds of evil was developed by iguana entertainment with a team roughly same size as that of dinosaur hunter which was composed of 18 people however as development progressed more staff was brought on board to assist in completing game development started before dinosaur hunter was released and preliminary work on level and enemy design finished by july 1997 cerebral bore weapon was inspired by tall man s weapons from 1979 film phantasm base idea for weapon was conceived during a brainstorming session concerning weapon design original concept had weapon being slow and agonizing an artist suggested a leech gun but it was ultimately rejected by project manager david dienstbier game uses an optimized version of dinosaur hunter engine which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real time game s distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect resulting in players being able to see five times as far than they could in original game game s progression focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by mario and zelda franchises as dienstbier explained that s something that we learned from miyamoto start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress later objectives will make far more use of dynamic environments unlike original game where levels shared graphic assets seeds of evil features unique levels with different geometry textures and enemies having received nintendo 64dd development kits that included nintendo 64 expansion pak iguana entertainment added an optional high resolution mode to game early on in development cycle in conjunction with expansion pak this mode allows game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels a technical accomplishment for nintendo 64 at time an upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give game better formed creatures however motion capture was avoided because none of game s enemies are human dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume game features different animations for different creatures unlike its predecessor where enemies have two types of death animations seeds of evil includes a third and gorier one seeds of evil was originally designed to fit in a 12mb nintendo 64 cartridge nevertheless when cartridges prices fell storage was increased to allowing development team to add a multiplayer mode multiplayer levels were designed so that players could have all sort of mobility including running jumping climbing and swimming according to dienstbier this freedom of movement means that players have a lot less predictable death match play because they have far more possible escape routes within each level unlike single player levels multiplayer maps feature more basic geometry this choice was made to ensure a smooth frame rate cartridge size was ultimately increased to 32mb which was largest size for a nintendo 64 game at time actual development of game took overall 21 months to complete and over 10 000 hours of game testing were reportedly conducted in may 1998 a demonstration of game running in high resolution mode was presented at electronic entertainment expo game was fairly anticipated and worldwide retailers ordered 1 75 million copies of game before launch seeds of evil was originally planned to ship in october 1998 for acclaim entertainment s event however release date was pushed back to november release date was pushed back again to december due to minor bugs preventing game from receiving nintendo s approval game was released in north american on december 10 1998 game was rescheduled for a uk release on december 18 this delay was due to problems in fitting game on 32mb cartridge in japan game was released as a different game set in same fictional universe also titled turok 2 seeds of evil was released for game boy color alongside nintendo 64 game a port of game was released for microsoft windows on february 9 1999 port was developed from ground up by a studio based in salt lake city and supports gamespy for online multiplayer reception seeds of evil received very positive reviews from critics and sold 1 4 million copies by january 1999 next generation praised game s technical aspects and improvements over its predecessor while gamespot described seeds of evil as a landmark shooter and a must buy stating that game raised bar for first person shooters like rare s 1997 title goldeneye 007 graphics were seen as one of strongest aspects of game nintendo power remarked that in high resolution mode seeds of evil was as stunning as most sophisticated computer games of time saying that not even crisp reality of goldeneye 007 or rich fantasy of zelda looks this cool edge said that game s artistic range is remarkable especially for a nintendo 64 game and considered flamethrower to have easily best graphic realisation of such equipment yet seen in a videogame although graphics were widely praised for their details game s inconsistent frame rate and intense distance fog were generally criticized peer schneider of ign said that unlike its predecessor seeds of evil forgoes framerate for detail so often that some gamers will definitely be put off by music and sound effects were highlighted positively gamespot said that soundtrack is well suited to game and never intrusive while victor lucas of electric playground described it as suspenseful dynamic and always adrenaline charged similarly tim weaver of n64 magazine credited music for being dramatically scored with strings tom toms bass lines and nerve juddering screeches as enemies spring out at you from all angles he also remarked that soundtrack s loop was well disguised gameplay was praised for its deep single player missions and varied enemy types game revolution highlighted long and complex levels but admitted that players may run around in circles for hours trying to figure out where to go next this may be enjoyable for people who like puzzles and long gameplay but it is aggravating for more action oriented players n64 magazine gave high marks to game s level design and explained that addition of mission objectives gives game more focus and betters its predecessor s pretty limited and fairly simple key collection artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than goldeneye as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards player gamepro also noted that they were more aggressive than dinosaur hunter s game s large arsenal of weapons was also praised with gamespot remarking that cerebral bore is possibly grossest weapon ever conceived multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3d space and innovative game types critical reception for microsoft windows port was mixed tal blevins of ign criticized controls for its limited support of keyboard functions and graphics for their distance fog which was not common in computer games of time nevertheless he praised save system for letting players save game at any point writing for gamespot elliott chin criticized game for its confusing level design and insistence on playing a level again if player misses a key at 1998 gamespot game of year awards nintendo 64 version was awarded shooting game of year in a retrospective review martin watts of nintendo life stated that seeds of evil is quite possibly best third party effort ever released for nintendo 64 remaster in 2015 nightdive studios announced that they were developing a remastered
