chew valley is an area in north somerset england named after river chew which rises at chewton mendip and joins river avon at keynsham technically area of valley is bounded by water catchment area of chew and its tributaries however name chew valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas for example blagdon lake and its environs which by a stricter definition are part of yeo valley valley is an area of rich arable and dairy farmland interspersed with a number of villages landscape consists of valley of river chew and is generally low lying and undulating it is bounded by higher ground ranging from dundry down to north plateau to west mendip hills to south and hinton blewett marksbury and newton st loe plateau areas to east valley s boundary generally follows top of scarp slopes except at southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of chew valley grade gently into yeo valley and eastern mendip hills respectively river chew was dammed in 1950s to create chew valley lake which provides drinking water for nearby city of bristol and surrounding areas lake is a prominent landscape feature of valley a focus for recreation and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest because of bird species plants and insects area falls into domains of councils including bath and north east somerset north somerset and mendip part of area falls within mendip hills area of outstanding natural beauty most of undeveloped area is within bristol bath green belt many of villages date back to time of domesday book and there is evidence of human occupation since stone age there are hundreds of listed buildings with churches being grade i listed main commercial centre is chew magna etymology thumb alt river flowing between grassy banks with trees on both sides river chew between stanton drew and pensford there is no clear origin for name chew found scarcely anywhere else however there have been differing explanations of etymology including winding water ew being a variant of french eau meaning water word is a western dialect for a narrow passage and is old english for turning one explanation is that name chew began in normandy as cheux and came to england with norman conquest during eleventh century however others agree with ekwall s interpretation that it is derived from welsh cyw meaning young of an animal or chicken so that afon cyw would have been river of chickens other possible explanations suggest it comes from old english word ceo fish gill government and politics thumb alt image of valley showing

western end of area around nempnett thrubwell consists of harptree beds which incorporate clay shale and lias limestone clifton down limestone which includes calcite and dolomitic mudstones of carboniferous period is found in adjoining central band and dolomitic conglomerate of triassic period there are two main soil types both generally well drained mudstones around lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods main geological outcrops around lake are mudstone largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in underlying characteristic of gently rolling valley landscape bands of sandstone of triassic period contribute to undulating character of area there are also more recent alluvial deposits beside course of river chew transition between gently sloping landscape of upper chew and yeo valleys and open landscape of mendip hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres 250 770 ft predominant formation is dolomitic conglomerate of triassic period it formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of scarp slopes it takes form of rock fragments mainly derived from older carboniferous limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give appearance of concrete northern boundary is formed by sides of dundry plateau where most significant geological formation is inferior oolite of jurassic period found on higher ground around maes knoll this overlays lower lias clay found on adjoining slopes clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on slopes this area was once connected to cotswolds intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with characteristics of cotswold plateau unusual geological features have been recognised as sites of special scientific interest sssi for their geological interest including barns batch spinney rocks quarry and dundry main road south quarry oldest geological formation in valley is supra pennant measures of carboniferous period it is a significant feature towards north eastern part of area and is represented by pensford syncline coal basin which formed part of somerset coalfield it is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone most of area around stanton drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable soils to eastern part of area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils they are found on carboniferous clay and shales typical of supra pennant measures they are frequently waterlogged where topography dictates they tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour in south and south east of area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near surface for coal mining to have taken place around clutton and high littleton in eastern area of valley as river chew flows through and compton dando before joining river avon at keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils natural history valley has several areas designated as site of special scientific interest sssi for biological interest including blagdon lake burledge hill chew valley lake compton martin ochre mine harptree combe and two sites at folly farm flora small and medium sized fields of valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland some of which date back to most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in late medieval period hedgerows support nationally rare bithynian vetch vicia mature oak quercus and ash fraxinus excelsior trees are characteristic of area with occasional groups of scots pine pinus sylvestris and chestnuts castanea sativa elm ulmus trees have been lost in this area and dead dying elms are also evident in surrounding landscape fauna wildlife abounds in valley particularly water birds around rivers and lakes with chew valley lake considered third most important site in britain for wintering wildfowl in addition to water birds including ducks shoveller anas clypeata gadwall anas strepera and great crested grebes podiceps cristatus a wide variety of other bird species can be seen these range from small birds such as

late medieval period fields of this category are generally small in size regular in outline and often boundaries preserve outlines of earlier strip field system regional variations in field size and
