operation deny flight was a north atlantic treaty organization nato operation that began on 12 april 1993 as enforcement of a united nations un no fly zone over bosnia and herzegovina united nations and nato later expanded mission of operation to include providing close air support for un troops in bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in bosnia twelve nato members contributed forces to operation and by its end on 20 december 1995 nato pilots had flown 100 420 sorties operation played an important role in shaping both bosnian war and nato operation included first combat in balkans nato craft down 4 serb warplanes attacking bosnia in nato s history a 28 february 1994 air battle over banja luka and in april 1994 nato aircraft first bombed ground targets in an operation near gorazde these engagements helped show that nato had adapted to post cold war era and could operate in environments other than a major force on force engagement on plains of central europe cooperation between un and nato during operation also helped pave way for future joint operations although it helped establish un nato relations deny flight led to conflict between two organizations most notably significant tension arose between two after un peacekeepers were taken as hostages in response to nato bombing operations of deny flight spanned more than two years of bosnian war and played an important role in course of that conflict no fly zone operations of deny flight proved successful in preventing significant use of air power by any side in conflict additionally air strikes flown during deny flight led to operation deliberate force a massive nato bombing campaign in bosnia that played a key role in ending war background and operation sky monitor in october 1992 at beginning of bosnian war united nations security council passed resolution 781 this resolution prohibited unauthorized military flights in bosnian airspace following resolution nato began operation sky monitor during which nato forces monitored violations of no fly zone without taking any military action against violators by april 1993 nato forces had documented more than 500 violations of no fly zone beale pp 19 20 in response to these blatant violations of bosnian air space and implicitly of resolution 781 un security council issued resolution 816 while resolution 781 prohibited only military flights resolution 816 prohibited all flights in bosnian air space except for those expressly authorized by un flight coordination center in zagreb resolution also authorized un member states to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance with no fly zone restrictions resolution 816 in response to this resolution nato commenced operation deny flight on 12 april 1993 initially deny flight was intended only to enforce no fly zone however several nato members including united states were eager to find ways to end war and improve situation of civilians and hoped that military action could do so us had already taken unilateral actions to aid civilians caught in conflict by dropping humanitarian supplies into bosnia under operation provide promise and many us officials argued for use of military force these officials were eager to expand us air operations through deny flight hoping that an aggressive no fly zone and possible air strikes would end conflict more quickly beale p 19 nato forces suffered its first loss on second day of operations when a french mirage 2000 crashed in adriatic sea due to mechanical failure pilot ejected safely enforcement of no fly zone thumb a usaf f 15c takes off for a sortie to enforce no fly zone after its adoption operation deny flight was relatively successful in preventing fixed wing aircraft from flying over restricted air space in bosnia during monitoring phase of operation sky monitor unauthorized fixed wing flights averaged twenty per month but during deny flight average was three during conflict there were only an estimated 32 fixed wing military aircraft in bosnia all of them former yugoslav national army planes under control of bosnian serbs thus nato primarily needed to prevent incursions into bosnian airspace from croatia and serbia beale pp 21 first serious violation to no fly zone came on 28 february 1994 when six serb j 21 jastreb jets bombed a bosnian factory us air force f 16s shot down four of six serb jets over banja luka beale pp 2 3 this engagement was first combat engagement of operation deny flight and its only significant air to air combat engagement perhaps more importantly banja luka incident was also first combat engagement in history of nato owen p 21 serbs acknowledged loss of a fifth aircraft in incident serbian officially admitted 5 aircraft lost serbian while deny flight was relatively successful in stopping flights of fixed wing aircraft nato forces found it very difficult to stop helicopter flights which presented a more complicated challenge all sides in conflict used helicopters extensively for non military purposes and some of these flights were authorized by un under operation s rules of engagement nato fighters were only authorized to shoot down helicopters that committed a hostile act otherwise nato fighters issued orders to land or exit in other words land aircraft or leave no fly zone typically helicopters in bosnian airspace complied with these orders by landing but then took off again after nato forces departed beale p 20 none of parties in conflict respected ban on helicopter flights as evidenced when ratko mladic responded to a bbc journalist s question about his violation of ban with statement commander of bosnian serb armed forces does not ride on a donkey ratko mladic s very personal war deceptive markings on helicopters further complicated matters for nato pilots many of combatants painted their helicopters to look like those of organizations that un s zagreb flight coordination center had authorized to fly in restricted space for example army of republika srpska often painted a red cross logo on their helicopters and croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of un humanitarian aid helicopters questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after black hawk incident in iraq because nato pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification as a result of rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification nato forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during conflict beale pp 19 21 close air support and air strikes even before operation deny flight began a number of us officials lobbied for a large role for nato air power in bosnia in particular as part of bill clinton s platform during his 1992 campaign for president of united states he promised a lift and strike policy which included use of air strikes against bosnian serb forces after commencement of operation deny flight us officials including president clinton pushed for an expanded mission safire after bosnian serbs rejected vance owen plan on 6 may 1993 clinton and other us officials intensified these calls and they discussed possibility of using large scale strikes to coerce serbs into acceptance ultimately no such strikes were approved or carried out but american officials became more open to idea of using air power for coercion in june 1993 partly in response to pressure from united states security council passed resolution 836 which authorized nato forces to provide close air support for unprofor forces upon request procedure to request air support was quite difficult as it involved dual key of both un and nato approval un approval required contact with united nations headquarters in new york city making effective coordination nearly impossible given difference in time zones un approval process was later somewhat streamlined when un secretary general boutros boutros ghali delegated authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in bosnia yasushi akashi afsouth fact sheet even after this simplification however dual key remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through un air operations center in then pass up entire unprofor chain of command to akashi after akashi approved request he would make a request to nato commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on ground starr 1993 due to difficult dual key authorization measure nato did not fulfill its close air support mission for several months nonetheless nato soon began further planning for a third mission coercive air strikes as advocated by united states nato first prepared to use deny flight to carry out air strikes in august 1993 as part of a plan to end siege of sarajevo after diplomatic intervention plan was not executed but a precedent was established for possible use of air strikes thus in february 1994 after sarajevo marketplace bombing nato issued an ultimatum to serbs to withdraw all heavy weapons from an exclusion zone around sarajevo or face bombing bosnian serbs complied with nato demands and no strikes were carried out beale p 22 attack on gorazde in april 1994 bosnian serbs forces launched an attack on un safe area of gorazde initially us secretary of defense william perry told reporters that united states would not enter war to stop serbs from overrunning gorazde and other senior officials publicly downplayed possibility of using air strikes gordon april 5 1994 several days into attack however a number of unprofor soldiers were injured and one was killed by serb fire thus general michael rose unprofor commander requested nato strikes under mandate of 836 gordon april 11 1994 on 10 april in response to request two us air force f 16s dropped bombs on serb targets including a tank and a command post next day two us marine corps f a 18c aircraft strafed additional targets in area that same day general ratko mladic commander of bosnian serb army called general rose and threatened safety of his forces saying one more attack and i will shoot down aircraft cannot guarantee safety of unprofor and will attack unprofor and your headquarters burg p 147 making good on his threat from 12 april to 14 april mladic ordered his forces to surround 150 unprofor peacekeepers effectively taking them hostage mladic then telephoned general rose and told him that if nato did not stop its actions not one un soldier would leave alive beale p 25 some of unprofor hostages were from nato member states notably united kingdom and france who pushed for an immediate end to strikes out of fear for safety of their personnel in response to british and french concerns nato temporarily recalled its forces but on 15 april in response to increased serb attacks aircraft were again deployed to area bucknam p 137 as mladic had promised bosnian serb army around gorazde attempted to shoot down nato aircraft on 15 april 1994 a french dassault iv jet was hit by ground fire while conducting a reconnaissance mission in area jet was damaged but returned safely to its carrier on 16 april a british sea harrier from carrier hms ark deny flight afsouth fact sheets was called in by un forces to strike a tank after making several unsuccessful passes at target sea harrier was targeted by a bosnian serb shoulder launched surface to air missile and was subsequently shot down pilot ejected safely and was rescued but his plane was destroyed bucknam p 138 after harrier shootdown nato did not carry out any further strikes around gorazde and on 17 april mladic released most of hostages he had taken over next several days serbs agreed to and then broke several ceasefires in gorazde area in an effort to secure gorazde and to force serbs to honor agreements nato and un issued an ultimatum for bosnian serb forces to cease their attacks and withdraw their forces or face additional air strikes on 22 april serbs complied with ultimatum requiring a withdrawal of heavy weapons from a zone and all forces from a zone because of serb compliance nato ceased its operations around gorazde sarajevo in february 1994 when air strikes were originally threatened nato had created a heavy weapons exclusion zone around sarajevo and collected weapons at a number of sites on 5 august vrs seized several weapons from weapons collection site in clear violation of exclusion zone agreement during seizure serb forces injured a ukrainian unprofor peacekeeper in response to attack un once again requested nato air support two u s a 10 aircraft repeatedly strafed serb targets and serbs returned seized weapons to collection site bucknam p 163 on 22 september unprofor again requested nato air support in sarajevo area after serb forces attacked a french armored personnel carrier in response two british sepecat jaguar aircraft struck near a serb tank destroying it banja luka incident on 28 february 1994 a nato airborne early warning aircraft flying over hungary vectored two us f 16s to an area south of banja luka where six j 21 jastreb and two j 22 orao were flying back to their base after bombing military factory at novi travnik in blatant violation of non fly zone four serb aircraft were shot down and another crashed while trying to escape in low level flight this marked first combat mission in nato s history attack on bihac bombing of udbina and hostages in october and november 1994 during siege of bihac muslim croat federation launched a large offensive around town of bihac in far northwestern bosnia serbs soon launched a counterattack and in support of their operations launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former jna military airport in udbina south of bihac located in serbian krajina serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs although most of ordnance came from old unreliable stocks and failed to explode attacks were a clear violation of no fly zone and a challenge to nato beale p 28 nato immediately looked for ways to respond but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in croatian airspace and due to bihac s proximity to border serb aircraft could attack into bosnia then cross back into croatia before being intercepted as such nato was powerless to stop incursions in recognition of situation security council passed resolution 958 which allowed nato aircraft to operate in croatia on 21 november nato acted under its new authority with a strike on udbina airfield strike which involved 39 aircraft was largest combat operation in nato s history up to that time nonetheless it was criticized as a pinprick that did little real damage to serb capabilities only temporarily disabling runways nato forces deliberately refrained from attacking serb planes at airfield and only targeted runways and anti air capabilities nato expanding bosnia role strikes a serbian base in croatia following udbina strike nato continued to launch strikes in area and on 23 november after a nato reconnaissance plane was illuminated by radar of a surface to air missile sam system nato planes attacked sam sites at otoka and dvor with agm 88 harm anti radiation missiles bucknam pp 182 83 serbs reacted to these strikes by immediately seizing 250 unprofor hostages and a total of 500 by early december while hostages were treated fairly well some were used as human shields including three who were forced to lie on tarmac at bosnian serb airbase in banja luka beale p 29 after strikes at otoka and dvor bosnian serb forces continued to target nato aircraft with surface to air missiles while advancing against bihac enclave on 24 november serb forces fired radar guided missiles at two british tornado f3 aircraft next day serb forces fired on two nato f 16s bucknam pp 183 84 in response to this growing sam threat and unprofor hostages nato suspended flights in bosnian airspace on 2 december shortly after suspension of nato flights former us president jimmy carter personally negotiated a four month ceasefire in bosnia although there were some violations of this ceasefire most of parties in conflict heeded it nato ordered its planes back in air but due to diminished hostilities they did not engage in any significant operations for next several months beale p 32 reduced tensions resulting from carter ceasefire and cessation of nato air operations also led to release of most of unprofor hostages over next several weeks serbs release 55 canadians but renew attack on enclave bosnian serb leader parlays with carter promises peace moves carter undertakes bosnia peace initiative expansion of air campaign in 1995 an ef 111 flying over alps in support of deny flight in may 1995 thumb right although 1994 ended peacefully with carter ceasefire nato continued planning for new operations both nato and un officials believed that after ceasefire expired in march fighting would resume as such planners at balkans combined air operations center caoc began drawing up plans for new air operations by late december planners developed a plan called dead eye designed to eliminate serb sam capabilities so that nato could regain uncontested air superiority over next several months planning for dead eye gradually evolved into plan for operation deliberate force a massive bombing of serb targets that was eventually executed in august and september 1995 bucknam pp 204 205 bombing of pale and hostage crisis while nato was planning its new strategy ceasefire expired and as predicted fighting resumed as fighting gradually widened bosnian muslim forces launched a large scale offensive in area of sarajevo in response to attack bosnian serbs seized heavy weapons from a un guarded depot and began shelling targets beale p 33 as a retaliation for these actions un commander lt general rupert smith requested nato air strikes nato honored request on 25 and 26 may 1995 by bombing a serb ammunition dump at pale mission was carried out by usaf f 16s and spanish air force ef 18as hornet armed with laser guided bombs ripley p 23 serbs then seized 377 unprofor hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of targets in bosnia forcing nato to end its strikes bucknam p 215 facing a second hostage crisis general smith and other top un commanders began shifting strategies un began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations so that they would be harder to attack or take hostage more importantly gen rose established un rapid reaction force a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage taking and enforce peace agreements bucknam p 216 downing of scott o grady thumb left captains t o scott o grady and bob wright at a press conference after o grady s rescue after seizure of 377 hostages nato did not carry out further air strikes but it did continue regular air patrol operations in support of no fly zone on 2 june 1995 captain scott o grady of united states air force was sent on a routine no fly zone patrol in his f 16 while on patrol o grady s f 16 was shot down by a serb sa 6 surface to air missile system near mrkonjic grad o grady ejected safely but found himself trapped in serb controlled territory according to many us officials he may have been deliberately targeted so that serbs could take an american hostage bucknam p 218 after o grady was shot down tensions increased greatly between nato and bosnian serbs a number of us commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes however serbs still held majority of hostages seized after bombing of pale threat to hostages prevented nato from acting more forcefully and serbs released 121 hostages immediately after incident in an effort to cool tensions nonetheless situation remained explosive for next six days until o grady was rescued on 8 june by 3rd battalion 8th marines 2nd marine division ending calls for immediate offensive action shortly thereafter serbs released remaining hostages bucknam p 220 as a result of incident nato ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses sead deny flight shootdown may put usaf on offensive on 11 august

fear of another hostage crisis bucknam pp 246 247 on 10 july as fighting intensified dutch troops finally requested close air support from nato but due to communication problems in dual key system request was not authorized until next day bucknam p 248 on 11 july nato prepared for a large scale mission in srebrenica involving 60 aircraft at 2 30 pm first wave of assault two dutch f 16s bombed two serb tanks on outskirts of town two usaf f 16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece but they failed to find their target soon thereafter bosnian serb troops seized several dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if nato did not call off its attacks dutch commander reported this back to his government and dutch defense minister joris immediately telephoned nato operations center and ordered an end to attacks bucknam p 249 by end of day srebrenica had fallen to bosnian serb forces who began a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing that left roughly 7 000 men dead in wake of this tragedy many observers blamed nato for failing to use its airpower more forcefully david rohde a journalist later wrote that if nato close air support had been used earlier 7 079 missing might still be alive today rohde p 354 this feeling that nato could have prevented thousands of deaths by acting more strongly led to increased planning for operation deliberate force bucknam pp 250 252 london conference after events at srebrenica sixteen nations met at london conference which began on 21 july 1995 to consider new options for bosnia as a result of conference un secretary general boutros boutros ghali gave general bernard un military commander authority to request nato airstrikes without consulting civilian un officials beale p 34 north atlantic council nato

serbs admiral leighton smith nato commander recommended that nato launch retaliatory air strikes against serbs under plan established for operation deliberate force davis on 30 august 1995 nato officially launched operation deliberate force with large scale bombing of serb targets this bombing superseded operation deny flight s role for air strikes and close air support but deny flight remained an active operation still enforcing no fly zone over bosnia beale p 36 until 20 september 1995 when operation deliberate force ended role played by deny flight was minimal after suspension of operation deliberate force however several further operations were carried out under deny flight on 4 october 1995 deny flight aircraft fired harm missiles after being targeted by surface to air missiles on 8 october 1995 un requested close air support near tuzla due to bad weather conditions nato aircraft were unable to locate their targets but on 9 october in final combat engagement of deny

operation and on 16 december north atlantic council agreed to terminate operation deny flight effective 20 december on 21 december 1995 nato held a formal closure ceremony for deny flight in vicenza many of forces assigned to deny flight were transferred to operation decisive endeavor to provide support for new ifor peacekeepers in bosnia structure of forces throughout course of its operation deny flight was directed by allied forces southern europe afsouth in naples under command of commander in chief of allied forces southern europe at beginning of operation admiral jeremy boorda served as commanding officer he was replaced by admiral leighton w smith in 1994 smith and boorda however delegated day to day authority to allied air forces southern europe airsouth commanded by lieutenant general joseph w ashy until 1994 and then lieutenant general michael e ryan davis p 48 while airsouth maintained day to day command mission tasking and operational control were delegated to commander of nato 5th allied tactical air force 5ataf initially lt gen antonio p 63 and later lt gen andrea both of italian air force to simplify chain of command and coordinate activities nato established combined air operations center caoc in vicenza italy which assumed practical day to day control of deny flight and reported to commander of 5ataf each squadron participating in operation sent a liaison officer to caoc to ensure coordination initial director of caoc was lt gen james chambers of us air force in november 1994 major general hal replaced him bucknam p 198 in practice most tactical level decisions about deny flight were made by director of caoc and he had authority to order nato pilots to engage violators of no fly zone twelve nato countries provided forces to operation deny flight belgium canada denmark france germany italy netherlands norway spain turkey united kingdom and united states together these twelve states contributed a total of 4 500 personnel who were based at air bases in five countries france germany greece italy and united kingdom and on aircraft carriers in region eight of participating countries contributed a total of 239 aircraft to operation of which nearly half 108 came from united states within united states us navy and us marine corps provided most support for operation and together they flew 70 of all of air defense sorties flown during deny flight american aircraft also provided majority of airstrikes during conflict of 1 150 bombs dropped by nato forces 88 came from american aircraft impact and legacy operation deny flight lasted for 983 days and included 100 420 command structures in new nato p 39 carried out by 4 500 personnel from 12 nato countries it included first combat engagement in nato history banja luka incident and many of nato s first out of area operations as such deny flight represented a momentous act if only in symbolic terms in that alliance assumed a combat mission in a capacity and out of area beyond this symbolic effect deny flight had important consequences for nato military policy international relations and war in bosnia effect on military policy thumb left a us marine corps f a 18 prepares for a mission in bosnia in december 1995 as one of first major combat tests of nato airforces deny flight provided several important military lessons most importantly deny flight helped to prove effectiveness or drive development of several technologies for example during operation f a 18d hornet was proven to be a highly resourceful multirole platform for united states marine corps slick deny flight was also important in move towards precision guided munitions as nearly 70 of munitions dropped by nato during conflict were precision guided simmons versus only 8 during gulf war boot p 347 for royal navy deny flight led to a re evaluation of sea harrier and a number of upgrades to it in particular royal navy added paveway ii laser guided bomb to harrier giving it a precision capability and upgraded electronics aboard aircraft in response to necessities of combat in bosnia flexing joint muscle mixed air groups aboard carriers lessons of bosnia also led royal air force to deploy harrier gr7 aboard royal navy carriers for future operations in order to deliver more offensive force projection capability raf harriers could add teeth to rn carriers four nato aircraft shot down during operation deny flight also forced nato members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft including increased stealth capabilities deny flight also demonstrated necessity of better communications and integration among forces operating together and led to some calls for technical training of un personnel to work with nato military systems finally rules of engagement established under deny flight also played an important role in shaping rules of engagement for later nato operations other than war including operation joint endeavor and even nato operations in afghanistan spence effect on atlantic relationship operation deny flight and other nato operations during bosnian war resulted in significant tension within nato and atlantic relationship deny flight and other early operations forced allies to consider question of nato s military responsibility for territory outside of its traditional defense perimeter and it was one over which they were deeply divided moore pp 28 29 disagreements between united states and its european allies over when and how to use air power made intra alliance diplomacy more problematic during period foster p 15 many of these problems in relationship were result of concerns from european nations who had forces on ground in unprofor that might be taken hostage fact that united states pushed for air strikes without placing its own forces on ground in bosnia greatly exacerbated this problem foster p pp 149 150 deny flight also helped set path for future un nato relations throughout operation nato felt frustration of having its wings clipped by a parallel un authority foster p 17 while united nations officials worried about effect that nato air strikes would have on perceived neutrality of united nations allin p 25 frustration with dual key procedure of authorization for nato action also led nato officers to reject such an arrangement in future admiral leighton smith commander of nato s forces during deny flight expressed this sentiment quite bluntly saying don t ever have another dual key starr 1995 these difficulties in negotiating un nato relationship during deny flight were a major factor in decision to place later nato forces in balkans under sole control of nato chain of command allin p p 719 while many of these effects on un nato relations were negative deny flight also had positive implications during operation nato and un exchanged liaison officers for first time in their respective histories establishing a precedent for military cooperation between two communication and coordination failures during deny flight also instilled a desire for mutual understanding and common solutions between two organizations schulte p 28 this desire for cooperation was crucial to establishment of ifor and later un nato cooperation in bosnia and elsewhere effect on bosnian war deny flight also played a significant role in shaping war in bosnia although its exact impact is debated while richard holbrooke american special envoy for bosnia recognized operation deliberate force as a historic development in post cold war relations and as a crucial element in ending war in bosnia holbrooke p 102 actual impact of deny flight on course of conflict was more muted none of air strikes in deny flight were on scale of those in deliberate force and they did not significantly change balance of power notably however deny flight was successful in that it neutralised serbs advantage in fixed wing air power schulte p 21 deny flight also paved way for operation deliberate force according to robert e hunter then us ambassador to nato deny flight was crucial to process of building consensus support for increasingly robust use of airpower over bosnia which eventually culminated in operation deliberate force owen while material impact of deny flight was minimal it did have a significant political impact from very beginning according to michael beale operation s implied objective was to demonstrate un and nato determination to stabilize situation in bosnia so that a peaceful settlement could be achieved given many violations of deny flight by helicopters and frequent failure of coordination between nato and un it is uncertain whether deny flight accomplished this mission nonetheless nato s limited air strikes under deny flight demonstrated its determination to protect united nations personnel and bosnian civilians according to michael r gordon chief military correspondent for new york times this determination eventually held key to peace see also operation
