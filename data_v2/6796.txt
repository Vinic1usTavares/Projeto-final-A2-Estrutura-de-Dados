falkner s circle was a stone circle near village of avebury in south western english county of wiltshire built from twelve sarsen megaliths it measured 36 6m in diameter although only one of these stones remains standing ring was part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of britain ireland and brittany during late neolithic and early bronze age over a period between 3300 and 900 bce purpose of such monuments is unknown although archaeologists speculate that stones represented supernatural entities for circle s builders positioned in a dry valley circle was erected on southern end of a field that contained a range of natural sarsens it is possible that megaliths were erected very close to where they were naturally found site had previously seen human activity in mesolithic period and may have been symbolically meaningful for local communities for a long time before circle was created ring was located close to other late neolithic and early bronze age monuments such as west kennet avenue and avebury stone circle although its precise relationship to these is unclear extensive flint knapping took place at site during late neolithic or early bronze age archaeological evidence indicates that in iron age a hearth was placed on site and in post medieval period a number of stones were toppled and destroyed through burning most of stones in circle were lying prone on ground by seventeenth century which might explain why it was left undiscovered by antiquarians exploring area in that period like john aubrey and william stukeley earliest known report of site came from a mr falkner who discovered it in 1840 while riding in area due to intensification of agriculture all prone stones were removed thus destroying circle in either late nineteenth or twentieth century site was excavated in 2002 in an archaeological project led by mark gillings and joshua pollard location falkner s circle is located south east of avebury at bottom of a dry valley that runs from avebury to west kennet archaeologist aubrey burl described falkner s circle as being very close to avebury henge and stone circle monument it thus forms part of stonehenge avebury and associated sites unesco world heritage site remaining stone from circle is also a scheduled ancient monument under ancient monuments and archaeological areas act 1979 context while transition from early neolithic to late neolithic in fourth and third millennia bce saw much economic and technological continuity there was a considerable change in style of monuments erected particularly in what is now southern and eastern england by 3000 bce long barrows causewayed enclosures and cursuses that had predominated in early neolithic were no longer built and had been replaced by circular monuments of various kinds these include earthen henges timber circles and stone circles stone circles are found in most areas of britain where stone is available with exception of island s south eastern corner they are most densely concentrated in south western britain and on north eastern horn of scotland near aberdeen tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2 400 years from 3300 to 900 bce with major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1 300 bce thumb left falkner s circle is located near to avebury stone circle pictured largest known example of such a structure these stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during period immediately following their creation this suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence but may have been deliberately left as silent and empty monuments archaeologist mike parker pearson suggests that in neolithic britain stone was associated with dead and wood with living other archaeologists have suggested that stone might not represent ancestors but rather other supernatural entities such as deities in area of modern wiltshire various stone circles were erected best known of which are avebury and stonehenge all of other examples are ruined and in some cases have been destroyed as burl noted these examples have left behind only frustrating descriptions and vague positions most of known wiltshire examples were erected on low lying positions in landscape there are four smaller stone circles known from area surrounding avebury sanctuary on overton hill winterbourne bassett stone circle clatford stone circle and falkner s circle archaeologists initially suggested that a fifth example could be seen at bottom near village of west overton although further investigation has reinterpreted this as evidence for a late prehistoric hut circle or a medieval feature burl suggested that these smaller circles related to avebury in a manner akin to village churches within diocese of a cathedral description thumb right sole surviving stone from falkner s circle falkner s circle consisted of twelve stones with a diameter of 36 6m only one of these now survives others having been destroyed due to twentieth century expansion of intensive farming in local area this solitary stone has been incorporated into a hedge line located east of west kennet avenue surviving standing stone measures 1 28m high from ground level with a maximum basal width of 2 10m it is likely to stretch for at least another 0 5m below ground surface meaning that stone is probably 2m in total length its long axis is aligned on an east to west direction stone is covered in extensive lichen growth and top has several natural depressions grey sarsen stones used at falkner s circle were of same type used in avebury stone circle and in two avenues west kennet and connected to it falkner s circle is located at southern end of a natural scatter of sarsen stones this scatter was recorded by antiquarian william stukeley in eighteenth century although they were later removed by farmers because of this location on edge of sarsen scatter archaeologist mark gillings and his team proposed that circle s builders may have understood this as a liminal space that was worthy of if this is case gillings et al argued falkner s circle might have constituted a monument to stones as opposed to one for people it is possible that falkner s circle was created by erecting stones in location where they were naturally found in this scenario gillings et al noted it might have represented a hybrid construction that blurred division between nature and culture excavations carried out at site in 2002 revealed several worked flints of mesolithic middle stone age type at site including one and a broken tranchet axe gillings et al suggested that these mesolithic flints which are uncommon in region may indicate that this specific location had an enduring historical mythological significance for people from mesolithic right through to neolithic falkner s circle shares various characteristics with clatford stone circle in that both contained comparatively few stones were located in valleys and had a diameter akin to that of outer ring of sanctuary unlike sanctuary falkner s circle did not consist of a timber circle later replaced by a stone one relationship between falkner s circle and other aspects of built prehistoric landscape around avebury is not clear although it is inter visible with a large stretch of west kennet avenue it does not directly connect to latter from falkner s circle it is not possible to see avebury henge and stone circles due to gentle rise of land to north of it compared to many other built structures in area such as avebury henge hill and west kennet avenue it is diminutive gillings et al thus suggested that its significance for local people might have been fleeting based on his observations in 1840s antiquarian mr falkner suggested that there had once been twelve stones in circle 2002 excavation at site discovered five pits cut into chalky gravel which lay on an arc with a diameter of about spaced between 13 and 17m apart all were associated with pieces of fragmented burnt sarsen projecting this arc into a circle and considering location of five known stone holes would suggest that if stones were evenly spaced there would have been ten megaliths in circle not twelve as falkner had claimed from other surviving examples of stone circles it is nevertheless known that stones are not always spaced at even intervals throughout whole circle indicating that ring could have once contained twelve megaliths that excavation also recovered 1074 pieces of worked flint much of it from topsoil majority of this was flake of late neolithic or early bronze age character and suggested that flint knapping had taken place at that location three sherds of grooved ware were also recovered from site two of which belonged to same vessel gillings et al believed that falkner s circle was probably erected in late third or early second millennia bce later history iron age and post medieval activity 2002 excavation also revealed a pit at site of falkner s circle that contained both sarsen fragments which showed evidence of having fragmented under exposure to heat and a number of seeds these were radiocarbon dated revealing a date between 410 340 bce and 310 200 bce 95 4 probability placing this pit in middle iron age pit was likely a hearth base a spread of fire reddened clay and charcoal covering an area of circa 10m by 4m was interpreted as having been produced in post medieval period during burning and destruction of some of stones excavation also revealed more recent animal burrows in area of circle one of which contained remains of at least two chickens antiquarian and archaeological research thumb right falkner s illustration of circle first published in 1858 falkner s circle was not described by various seventeenth and eighteenth century antiquarians who explored and recorded prehistoric monuments around avebury such as john aubrey stukeley and colt hoare this was likely because circle was at this point largely hidden with all but one of stones lying prone and standing example concealed within adjacent hedgerow earliest known account of site came from 1840 when a mr falkner of devizes wrote an account of having come upon circle while out riding his account was not published at time but was included in an 1858 publication by william long in that report falkner was quoted as saying that alongside standing stone he had discovered two stones lying on ground and nine hollow places he rejected idea that there had once been a tumulus in centre of circle stating that ground was quite flat in that location falkner s circle was then included in an 1884 archaeological map of area by reverend a c smith suggesting that it was still extant at that time smith related coming upon site in late 1870s after which he began to investigate with long s assistance he probed earth around standing stone and then removed turf wherever he encountered a submerged stone in doing so he found 22 sarsen stones all of them of small size believing that they had once formed parts of stones in circle he related that while northern southern and eastern segments are tolerably well defined by this sarsen scatter he could find scarcely a single stone on what should be western segment to complete circle in august and september 2002 archaeologists mark gillings joshua pollard david wheatley and rick peterson led a four week archaeological investigation of circle as part of which they carried out both geophysical examination and excavation they cut two trenches into site one measuring 40m by 10m and other 5m by 5m they concluded that evidence that they found supported falkner s claims of a stone circle on site although acknowledged that
