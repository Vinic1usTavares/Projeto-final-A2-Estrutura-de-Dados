board film uses game of chess as a metaphor idea of wazir came to vidhu vinod chopra after badminton player syed modi was murdered on 28 july 1988 in lucknow however chopra has said that film is completely different from incident when chopra met his eventual co writer abhijat joshi in 1994 he told him about idea of setting a thriller around two chess players chopra described two characters as rakesh maria and viswanathan anand playing chess script was later written by them in four years between 2000 and 2004 it was supposed to be chopra s first hollywood film with dustin hoffman playing protagonist in 2005 their producer robert suddenly died and script was shelved chopra saw bejoy nambiar s 2013 film david he was particularly impressed by black and white portions of it chopra subsequently called nambiar and expressed a desire to work with director chopra had a cache of unfilmed scripts and nambiar selected chess one chopra and joshi then spent two years writing a hindi version of it both chopra and joshi consulted chess experts from america for film cinematography of film was done by sanu varghese who had previously worked with nambiar on david film s story was tweaked constantly during its seven month editing period both writers also served as editors this was first time since his 1989 picture parinda that chopra had edited a film joshi who edited for first time on wazir believes that a film is rewritten on editing table visual effects were used to hide bachchan s legs to make them look as if they ended below knees makers of film went through 40 to 50 wheelchairs to find one that would be comfortable for bachchan over long shoot working titles of film were do and ek aur ek do and it received its final title wazir in october 2014 based on character of that name in film casting at screening of lakshya 2004 chopra informed farhan akhtar about script of wazir and wanted his feedback on it ten years later in 2014 they met again and akhtar agreed to do film because as he later said revised script moved me to my core he went through intense training and put on eight kilograms of weight to play role of an anti terrorist squad officer he also changed his diet and met some of his friends who were ats officers for preparation he modeled his character in film on vishwas patil an inspector general of police from maharashtra akhtar agreeing for role puzzled chopra who recalls at that time javed akhtar farhan s father and i were engaged in a public verbal duel when i asked farhan what made him agree to take up role he said script is so good that i will bear with you chopra noted that while re writing film in hindi he and joshi realised protagonist can t be american we had to bring in our own sensibilities our cinema is more flamboyant so protagonist needed to be flamboyant too we thought of making chess master an indian and approached amitabh bachchan for it bachchan had read original script and remembered it when chopra came to him aditi rao hydari was cast after nambiar saw her pictures when she had walked ramp for a designer and chopra saw her dancing after this she went through three set of auditions dance acting and a screen test john abraham and neil nitin mukesh make extended cameo appearances in film filming principal photography commenced on 28 september 2014 in mumbai parts of film were also shot in delhi chopra claims that some of best lines in wazir are improvised on set including a joke about russian vodka and russian girls between bachchan and akhtar akhtar did his own stunts in film he completed his schedule in march 2015 at srinagar while bachchan filmed his remaining scenes following month visual effects amitabh bachchan s legs were removed below knee in film with use of visual effects to show him handicapped he wore black socks with marks on them during filming to aid in eventual creation of effects chopra was not happy with initial effects work on legs so he had changes made to improve

wrote wazir has a fair mix of songs that are situational and also that could find popularity over a period of time though one isn t quite hunting for any solid here music does work well in context of film r m vijayakar of india west summed up with in short three decent songs and three eminently forgettable songs makes for a mixed listening experience take it or skip it kapoor from rediff com

gave film 2 5 5 stars and wrote watching farhan akhtar and amitabh bachchan joust and manoeuver around each other is this film s high point srijana mitra das of times of india gave it 3 5 5 stars and opened with so wazir is a smart movie which could have been way smarter subhash k jha gave it 4 5 stars highlighted its deviously clever script and added in its 1 hour and 40 minutes of playing time wazir gives us no time to stop and ruminate sweta kaushal of hindustan times in a 3 5 review wrote that apart from smart storyline powerful performances are backbone of wazir and commended both lead and supporting actors baradwaj rangan characterized film as a decent relationship drama a silly thriller shubhra shetty saha of mid day praised bachchan s amazing emotional precision and said his performance was best thing about this film however he also decried film s lack of subtlety and ended with wazir is a good one time watch many critics felt film started well but failed to follow through ananya bhattacharya of india today felt that film had a taut gripping narrative until interval but stumble d in its second half according to rajeev masand of news18 com in a 2 5 5 star review film was a consistently watchable but frankly far fetched thriller that just isn t as smart as it ought to have been namrata joshi of hindu called film lacklustre despite starting off promisingly with slick production values and good performances to boot wazir unravels badly especially in second half as it heads towards climax raja sen of rediff com gave film 2 5 stars and characterized it as obvious he said that none of character motives in this film actually add up saibal chatterjee from ndtv wrote that wazir puts all its crucial cards on table far too quickly robbing itself of shock factor that would have made all difference between edge of seat suspense and tame by numbers thrills rachit gupta of filmfare in a 3 5 star review was also unhappy with film s predictability if you pay enough attention to first half you ll instantly guess how end will pan out so you re sitting in a thriller knowing what s coming up gupta added that climax was convenient and inane among overseas reviewers guardians mike mccahill gave film three stars out of five and described it as a finely poised bollywood abhinav of national in abu dhabi also gave it three stars and wrote that overall wazir
