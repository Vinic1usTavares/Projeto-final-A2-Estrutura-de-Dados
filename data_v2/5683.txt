kepler 4b initially known as koi 7 01 is an extrasolar planet first detected as a transit by kepler spacecraft its radius and mass are similar to that of neptune however due to its proximity to its host star it is substantially hotter than any planet in solar system planet s discovery was announced on january 4 2010 in washington d c along with four other planets that were initially detected by kepler spacecraft and subsequently confirmed by telescopes at w m keck observatory nomenclature and history kepler 4b was named because it was first planet discovered in orbit of its star kepler 4 star was in turn named for kepler mission a nasa satellite whose purpose is to discover earth like planets in a section of sky between constellations cygnus and lyra using transit method using this method kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star s brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it initially kepler 4b was detected as a transit event by kepler telescope and considered a kepler object of interest with designation koi 7 01 subsequent radial velocity measurements by high resolution echelle spectrometer on telescopes of w m keck observatory confirmed planetary nature of transit event and established a mass estimate for planet planet s existence was announced on january 4 2010 along with four other planets detected by kepler kepler 5b 6b 7b and 8b at 215th meeting of american astronomical society in washington d c host star kepler 4 is a star very similar to sun located about 1610 light years away in constellation of draco characteristics kepler 4b orbits its host star in 3 213 days at a distance of 0 046 au this places it almost 10 times closer to its star than mercury is to sun consequently kepler 4b is thought to be extremely hot with an equilibrium temperature greater than 1700 kelvins 2600 degf planet is estimated to be 25 times more massive than earth with a radius that is 4 times greater than earth this makes it similar to neptune in terms of size and mass but with a temperature that is not comparable to any planet in solar system venus hottest planet is only 735 kelvins kepler 4b s eccentricity was assumed to be 0 however an independent reanalysis of discovery data found a value of 0 25 0 12 and a later reanalysis of light curve discovered a secondary eclipse with depth 7 47 1 at a phase of about 0 7 thumb 300px a picture showing relative sizes of first five planets discovered by kepler kepler 4b is smallest of five highlighted in purple see also kepler 5b kepler 6b kepler 7b kepler 8b kepler 9b kepler 10b references external links http kepler nasa gov mission discoveries category exoplanets discovered in 2010 kepler 04b category giant planets category transiting exoplanets category draco constellation 4b
