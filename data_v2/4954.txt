his sensei instructor according to mifune in 1904 maeda lost to yoshitake yoshio by hane after defeating three adversaries in succession but in a following defeated eight adversaries in a row and was awarded rank of 4th dan mifune also states that maeda was one of most vigorous promoters of judo although not by teaching art instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike throwing them as if in real combat he reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters who would abandon him in favor of other professors prelude to kodokan s expansion in 1879 ulysses s grant former president of
