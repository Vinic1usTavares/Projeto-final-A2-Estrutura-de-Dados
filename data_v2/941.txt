architecture thumb gatehouse at harlech castle showing smaller corbelled towers at front harlech castle rests upon part of harlech dome a spur of rock almost high land falls away sharply on north and west and a ditch cut into rock protects remaining approaches to castle castle has a concentric design with one line of defences enclosed by another forming an inner and outer ward outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today harlech is built from local grey green sandstone with large regular blocks used for towers and irregular material possibly taken from ditch used for walls a softer yellow sandstone is used for decorative work in castle possibly quarried from around abbey near barmouth main entrance to castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between two easterly ditch bridge towers and main gatehouse little remains of bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to gatehouse replaces bridge a water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down to foot of cliffs in 13th century sea came up close to stairway allowing resupply by sea but today sea has retreated significantly making it more difficult to envisage concept in its original setting thumb 400px left plan of harlech castle gatehouse follows design sometimes termed tonbridge style that became popular during 13th century with two massive d shaped defensive towers flanking entrance passage into castle was guarded by three portcullises and at least two heavy doors gatehouse has two upper floors broken up into various rooms each floor has three large windows overlooking inner ward second floor has two additional grand windows on sides of gatehouse gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys use of these rooms has been subject of academic debate historian arnold taylor argued that first floor of gatehouse was used by constable as living accommodation with second floor used by senior visitors jeremy ashbee has since challenged this interpretation suggesting high status accommodation may instead have been located within inner ward and gatehouse used for other purposes inner ward is guarded by four large circular towers over time these acquired various names in 1343 clockwise from north east they were called le prisontour turris ultra le and le chapeltour but by 1564 they had been renamed debtors mortimer bronwen and armourer s towers respectively le prisontour incorporated a dungeon and le chapeltour may have contained an artillery workshop in 16th century several ranges of buildings were built around inner ward including a chapel kitchen service buildings a granary and a great hall battlements may originally have been built with triple finials in a similar fashion to conwy although little remains of these in modern era architecture of harlech has close links to that found in kingdom of savoy in same period these include semi circular door arches window styles corbelled towers and positioning of holes and are usually ascribed to influence of savoy architect master james links between harlech and savoy are not straightforward however as in some cases relevant savoy structures were built after james had left region similarity in architectural details may therefore be result of wider role played by savoy craftsmen and engineers on harlech project see also castles in great britain and
