kepler 10c is an exoplanet orbiting g type star kepler 10 located around 568 light years away in draco its discovery was announced by kepler in may 2011 although it had been seen as a planetary candidate since january 2011 when kepler 10b was discovered team confirmed observation using data from nasa s spitzer space telescope and a technique called blender that ruled out most false positives kepler 10c was third transiting planet to be confirmed statistically based on probability rather than actual observation after kepler 9d and kepler 11g kepler team considers statistical method that led to discovery of kepler 10c as what will be necessary to confirm many planets in kepler s field of view kepler 10c orbits its host star every forty five days at a quarter of average distance between sun and earth initial observations showed that it has a radius more than double that of earth and suggested a higher density suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5 20 ices by mass for comparison earth s oceans represent only 0 02 of our planet s mass with an additional amount potentially a few times this stored in mantle however in 2017 more careful analysis using both harps and hires data revealed that kepler 10c is not a large terrestrial planet but instead a typical volatile rich planet of about seven earth masses discovery and confirmation in january 2011 closely orbiting planet kepler 10b was confirmed in orbit of star kepler 10 after measurements of its transiting behavior where it crosses in front of kepler 10 periodically dimming it and a radial velocity effect detected in kepler 10 s spectrum provided information needed to prove that it was indeed a planet an additional longer period dimming was detected in kepler 10 s spectrum suggesting that a second planet existed in system however there remained possibility that this signal could have some other cause and that transit event was a false positive attempts to measure radial velocity effects of this object now named koi 072 02 were fruitless therefore to rule out false positive scenarios kepler team used a technique called blender application of blender was supplemented by use of irac instrument on spitzer space telescope which was used on august 30 and november 15 2010 to further define kepler 10 s light curve at point where koi 072 02 appeared to transit it it was found that transiting object did not produce a color an aspect that is characteristic of stars this suggested even further that koi 072 02 was a planet in addition irac instrument found no difference in transit signal when comparing star s light curve in infrared and in visible light stars that are aligned with kepler 10 might appear visibly similar but would appear different in infrared wiyn observatory s 3 5m telescope was used for speckle imaging on june 18 2010 in addition pharo camera on palomar observatory s 5m telescope was used for its adaptive optics capabilities these observations combined with observations of kepler 10 s spectrum taken from w m keck observatory ruled out possibility that a nearby star s light was corrupting observed spectrum of kepler 10 and creating results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in kepler 10 s orbit all of these possibilities with exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of kepler 10 were effectively ruled out even with this kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with kepler 10 as seen from earth such a star would probably not be a giant star with a greater degree of certainty established kepler team compared models formed using blender to photometric observations collected by kepler satellite blender technique allowed kepler team to rule out majority of alternatives including notably that of triple star systems blender then allowed kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars a binary system between a single star and a double star can resemble light curve of kepler 10 aforementioned follow up observations would have detected them all only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if curve is caused by interference from a background star or if it is indeed caused by orbit of a transiting planet comparisons of koi 072 02 to 1235 other kepler objects of interest in kepler s field of vision allowed astronomers to use models that led to confirmation of koi 072 02 as a planet with a high degree of certainty koi 072 02 was then renamed kepler 10c planet s confirmation was announced at boston meeting of american astronomical society on may 23 2011 kepler 10c was first kepler target to be observed using spitzer with hope of detecting a shallow transit dip in a light curve at time of kepler 10c s discovery spitzer was only facility capable of detecting shallow transits in kepler data to an extent at which data could be meaningfully analyzed planet was also third transiting planet that was validated through an analysis of statistical data rather than actual observation after planets kepler 9d and kepler 11g in kepler 10c s confirmation paper kepler team discussed how a large fraction of planets in kepler s field of view would be confirmed in this statistical manner host star kepler 10 is a g type star located 187 parsecs 608 light years from earth it is 0 895 solar masses and 1 056 solar radii making it slightly less massive than sun but approximately same size with an effective temperature of k kepler 10 is cooler than sun star is also metal poor and far older its metallicity is measured at fe h 0 15 29 less iron than in earth s sun kepler 10 has a measured age of approximately 10 6 billion years kepler 10 has an apparent magnitude of 11 2 which means that star is invisible to naked eye from perspective of an observer on earth characteristics kepler 10c is outermost of two known planets of kepler 10 completing one orbit of star every 45 days at a distance of 0 au inner planet kepler 10b is a rocky planet that orbits every 0 8 days at a distance of 0 au kepler 10c s equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 k almost four times hotter than jupiter s planet s orbital inclination is 89 65o or almost edge on with respect to earth and to kepler 10 transits have been observed at points where kepler 10c has crossed in front of its host star kepler 10c was originally thought to have a mass of 15 19 earth masses with a radius only 2 35 2 31 to 2 44 times that of earth and so a volume 12 15 times that of earth it was believed to be unlikely to contain significant amounts of hydrogen or helium gas since an or accreted hydrogen rich atmosphere would have been lost over 10 6 billion year lifetime of kepler 10 system instead composition was believed to be mainly rocky with a water fraction of 5 20 by mass bulk of this water was thought to be likely in form of high pressure hot ice phases however in july 2017 more careful analysis of harps n and hires data showed that kepler 10c was much less massive than originally thought instead around 7 37 6 18 to 8 69 with a mean density of 3 14 g cm3 instead of a primarily rocky composition more accurately determined mass of kepler 10c suggests a world made almost entirely of volatiles mainly water see also 55 cancri e kepler 10b kepler references
