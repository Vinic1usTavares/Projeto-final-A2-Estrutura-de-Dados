ulm campaign was a series of french and bavarian military maneuvers and battles to outflank and capture an austrian army in 1805 during war of third coalition it took place in vicinity of and inside swabian then bavarian city of ulm french grande armee led by napoleon bonaparte comprised 210 000 troops organized into seven corps and hoped to knock out austrian army in danube before russian reinforcements could arrive through rapid marching napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an austrian army of 23 000 under general mack on 20 october at ulm bringing total number of austrian prisoners in campaign to 60 000 campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in development of schlieffen plan in late 19th century richard brooks editor atlas of world military history p 156 it is a historical cliche to compare schlieffen plan with hannibal s tactical envelopment at cannae 216 bc schlieffen owed more to napoleon s strategic maneuver on ulm 1805 victory at ulm did not end war since a large russian army under kutuzov was still near vienna russians withdrew to northeast to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving austrian units french followed and captured vienna on 12 november on 2 december decisive french victory at austerlitz removed austria from war resulting treaty of pressburg in late december brought third coalition to an end and left napoleonic france as major power in central europe leading to war of fourth coalition with prussia and russia following year prelude europe had been by then embroiled in french revolutionary wars since 1792 after five years of war french republic subdued first coalition in 1797 a second coalition was formed in 1798 but this too was defeated by 1801 britain remained only opponent for new french consulate in march 1802 france and britain agreed to end hostilities under treaty of amiens for first time in ten years all of europe was at peace there were many problems between two sides and implementing agreements they had reached at amiens seemed to be a growing challenge britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and france was angry that british troops had not evacuated island of malta david chandler campaigns of napoleon p 304 tense situation only worsened when napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush haitian revolution chandler p 320 in may 1803 britain declared war on france third coalition in december 1804 an anglo swedish agreement led to creation of third coalition british prime minister william pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against france mutual suspicion between british and russians eased in face of several french political mistakes and by april 1805 two had signed a treaty of alliance chandler p 328 baltic was dominated by russia something britain wasn t comfortable with since it provided valuable commodities like timber tar and hemp crucial supplies to britain s empire britain supported ottoman empire against russian incursions towards mediterranean meanwhile french territorial rearrangements in germany occurred without russian consultation and napoleon s annexations in po valley increasingly strained relations between two having been defeated twice in recent memory by france and keen on revenge france had defeated austrian in war of first coalition 1792 1797 and war of second coalition 1798 1801 austria also joined coalition a few months later chandler p 331 french military preparations prior to formation of third coalition napoleon had assembled army of england an invasion force meant to strike at british isles around six camps at boulogne in northern france although they never set foot on british soil napoleon s troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation although boredom quickly set in among troops napoleon paid many visits to conduct lavish parades to maintain their morale chandler p 323 men at boulogne formed core for what napoleon would later call la grande armee great army at start french army had about 200 000 men organized into seven corps which were large field units each containing about 36 to 40 cannon each and capable of independent action until other corps could arrive chandler p 332 on top napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22 000 troopers organized into two cuirassier divisions four mounted dragoon divisions and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry all supported by 24 artillery pieces by 1805 la grande armee had grown to a force of 350 000 chandler p 333 was equipped and trained it possessed a competent officer class where almost all from sergeants to marshals had experience in recent revolutionary

ulm campaign lasted for nearly a month and saw french army under napoleon deliver blow after blow to confused austrians it culminated on 20 october with loss of an entire austrian army austrian plans and preparations general mack thought that austrian security relied on sealing off gaps through mountainous black forest area in southern germany that had witnessed much fighting during campaigns of french revolutionary wars mack believed that there would be no action in central germany mack decided to make city of ulm centerpiece of his defensive strategy which called for a containment of french until russians under kutuzov could arrive and alter odds against napoleon ulm was protected by heavily fortified michelsberg heights giving mack impression that city was virtually impregnable from outside attack fisher fremont barnes p 36 fatally aulic council decided to make northern italy main theater of operations for habsburgs archduke charles was assigned 95 000 troops and directed to cross adige river with mantua and milan as initial objectives david chandler campaigns of napoleon p 382 austrians based an army of 72 000 men on ulm nominally commanded by archduke ferdinand army s real authority was mack austrian strategy required that archduke john with 23 000 troops secure tyrol and provide link between his brother charles s army and his cousin ferdinand s army austrians also detached individual corps to serve with swedish in pomerania and british in naples though these were designed to confuse french and divert their resources french plans and preparations 260px thumb

september 210 000 troops of grande armee prepared to cross into germany and encircle austrians in both campaigns of 1796 and 1800 napoleon had envisaged danube theater as central focus of french efforts but in both instances italian theater became most important aulic council thought napoleon would strike in italy again napoleon had other intentions 210 000 french troops would be launched eastwards from camps of boulogne and would envelop general mack s exposed austrian army if it kept marching towards black forest meanwhile marshal murat would conduct cavalry screens across black forest to fool austrians into thinking that french were advancing on a direct west east axis main attack in germany would be supported by french assaults in other theaters marshal massena would confront charles in italy with 50 000 men of armee d italie st cyr would march to naples with 20 000 men and marshal brune would patrol boulogne with 30 000 troops against a possible british invasion

moving with scattered red lines french invasion in late september and early october caught austrians unprepared and severed their lines of communication on 22 september mack decided to hold iller line anchored on ulm in last three days of september french began furious marches that would place them at austrian rear mack believed that french would not violate prussian territory but when he heard that bernadotte s i corps had marched through prussian ansbach he made critical decision to stay and defend ulm rather than retreat to south which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving bulk of his forces frederick kagan end of old order p 389 napoleon had little accurate information about mack s intentions or maneuvers he knew that kienmayer s corps was sent to ingolstadt east of french positions but his agents greatly exaggerated its size kagan p 393 on 5 october napoleon ordered ney to join lannes soult and murat in concentrating and crossing danube at donauworth kagan p 395 french encirclement however was not deep enough to prevent kienmayer s escape french corps did not all arrive at same place they instead deployed on a long west east axis and early arrival of soult and davout at donauworth incited kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion napoleon gradually became more convinced that austrians were massed at ulm and ordered sizeable portions of french army to concentrate around donauworth on 6 october three french infantry and cavalry corps headed to donauworth to seal off mack s escape route kagan p 397 realizing danger of his position mack decided to go on offensive on 8 october he commanded army to concentrate around gunzburg and hoped to strike at napoleon s lines of communication mack instructed kienmayer to draw napoleon further east towards munich and augsburg napoleon did not seriously consider possibility that mack would cross danube and move away from his central base but he did realize that seizing bridges at gunzburg would yield a large strategic advantage kagan p 400 to accomplish this objective napoleon sent ney s corps to gunzburg completely unaware that bulk of austrian army was heading to same destination on 8 october however campaign witnessed its first serious battle at wertingen between auffenburg s troops and those of murat and lannes battle of wertingen right thumb 360px alt battle of gunzburg october 9 1805 battle of gunzburg 9 october 1805 for reasons not entirely clear on 7 october mack ordered franz xavier auffenburg to take his division of 5 000 infantry and 400 cavalry from gunzburg to wertingen in preparation for main austrian advance out of ulm kagan p 402 uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements auffenburg was in a dangerous position first french forces to arrive were murat s cavalry divisions louis klein s 1st dragoon division marc antoine de beaumont s 3rd dragoon division and nansouty s 1st cuirassier division they began to assault austrian positions and were soon joined by nicolas oudinot s grenadiers who were hoping to outflank austrians from northeast auffenburg attempted a retreat to southwest but he was not quick enough austrians lost nearly their entire force 1 000 to 2 000 of which were taken prisoner kagan p 404 battle of wertingen had been an easy french victory thumb left 260px alt map with blue scattered lines showing advance of french army to rear of austrians whose actions are shown with red scattered lines strategic situation from 7 to 9 october with mikhail kutuzov too far away to offer significant aid austrians find themselves in a precarious position action at wertingen convinced mack to operate on left north bank of danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on right bank this would require austrian army to cross to north at gunzburg on 8 october ney was operating under louis alexandre berthier s directions that called for a direct attack on ulm following day ney sent in jean pierre firmin malher s 3rd division to capture gunzburg bridges over danube in battle of gunzburg a column of this division ran into some tyrolean and captured 200 of them including their commander konstantin karl d aspre along with two cannons kagan p 408 austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around gunzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons malher s division conducted several heroic attacks against austrian positions but all failed mack then sent in ignaz gyulai with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair destroyed bridges but this force was charged and swept away by delayed french 59th infantry regiment kagan p 409 fierce fighting ensued and french finally managed to establish a foothold on right south bank of danube while battle of gunzburg was being fought ney sent louis henri loison s 2nd division to capture danube bridges at elchingen which were lightly defended by austrians having lost most of danube bridges mack marched his army back to ulm by 10 october ney s corps had made significant progress malher s 3rd division had crossed to right south bank loison s 2nd division held elchingen and pierre dupont de l etang s 1st division was heading towards ulm haslach jungingen and elchingen thumb left 260px alt map with scattered lines showing westward advance of french army strategic situation from 11 to 14 october french hurl themselves westwards to capture austrian army demoralized austrian army arrived at ulm in early hours of 10 october mack was deliberating his course of action and austrian army remained inactive at ulm until 11th meanwhile napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions he believed austrians were moving to east or southeast and that ulm was lightly guarded ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to berthier that ulm was in fact more heavily defended than french originally thought kagan p 412 during this time russian threat to east began to preoccupy napoleon so much that murat was given command of right wing of army consisting of ney s and lannes s corps kagan p 414 french were separated in two massive wings at this point forces of ney lannes and murat to west were containing mack while those of soult davout bernadotte and auguste marmont to east were charged with guarding against any possible russian and austrian incursions on 11 october ney made a renewed push on ulm 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to city along right bank of danube while dupont s division supported by one dragoon division was to march directly for ulm and seize entire city orders were hopeless because ney still did not know that entire austrian army was stationed at ulm 32nd infantry regiment in dupont s division marched from haslach towards ulm and ran into four austrian regiments holding 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks but austrians held firm and repulsed every one austrians flooded battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to ulm jungingen hoping to score a knockout blow against ney s corps by enveloping dupont s force dupont sensed what was happening and preempted austrians by launching a surprise attack on jungingen during which he took as prisoner at least 1 000 of austrians kagan p 415 renewed austrian attacks drove these forces back to haslach which french managed to hold dupont was eventually forced to fall back on albeck where he joined louis baraguey d hilliers s foot dragoons division effects of battle of haslach jungingen on napoleon s plans are not fully clear but emperor may have finally ascertained that majority of austrian army was concentrated at ulm kagan p 417 accordingly napoleon sent corps of soult and marmont towards iller meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with mack davout bernadotte and bavarians were still guarding region around munich napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture important bridges around ulm he also began shifting his forces to north of ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of city itself kagan p 420 these dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at elchingen on 14th as ney s forces advanced on albeck at this point in campaign austrian command staff was in full confusion ferdinand began to openly oppose mack s command style and decisions charging that latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left austrian army marching back and forth kagan p 421 on 13 october mack sent two columns out of ulm in preparation for a breakout to north one under johann sigismund riesch headed towards elchingen to secure bridge there and other under franz von werneck went north with most of heavy artillery fisher fremont barnes napoleonic wars rise and fall of an empire p 39 40 ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with dupont who was still north of danube ney led loison s division to south of elchingen on right bank of danube to begin attack

of heidenheim by night on 14th two french corps were stationed in vicinity of austrian encampments at michelsberg right outside of ulm david chandler campaigns of napoleon p 399 mack was now in a dangerous situation there was no longer any hope of escaping along north bank marmont and imperial guard were hovering at outskirts of ulm to south of river and soult was moving north from memmingen to prevent austrians escaping south to tyrol troubles continued with austrian command as ferdinand overrode objections of mack and ordered evacuation of all cavalry from ulm a total of 6 000 troopers chandler p 400 murat s pursuit was so effective however that only eleven squadrons joined werneck at heidenheim murat continued his harassment of werneck and forced him to surrender with 8 000 men at treuchtlingen on 19 october murat also took an entire austrian field park of 500 vehicles then swept on towards neustadt an der donau and captured 12 000 austrians chandler says but this cannot possibly be correct because it is 55 km to west of ulm on other hand treuchtlingen is a far better candidate since it is in expected direction that is 48 km northeast of neresheim and 91 km northeast of ulm chandler also names neustadt which could be either neustadt am der donau 148 km east of ulm or a mistake events at ulm were now reaching a conclusion on 15 october ney s troops successfully charged michelsberg encampments and on 16th french began to bombard ulm itself austrian morale was at a low point and mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue on 17 october napoleon s emissary segur signed a convention with mack in which austrians agreed to surrender on 25 october if no aid came by that date gradually however mack heard of capitulations at heidenheim and neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 october fifteen hundred troops from austrian garrison managed to escape but vast majority of austrian force marched out on 21 october

manoeuvre sur les a special type of strategic envelopment first used by napoleon in his italian campaign in 1796 maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in enemy s flank or rear chandler p 186 as enemy became more embroiled with pinning force flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal victory in ulm campaign murat s cavalry served as pinning force that fooled austrians into thinking main french attack would come from black forest as murat lulled austrians towards ulm

also this campaign opened most brilliant year of napoleon s career his army had been trained to perfection his plans were faultless historians often analyze campaign on a wide strategic level that does not include tactical confrontations even though these were common and relevant decisive victory at ulm is also believed to be a product of long training and preparation grande armee received at

corps might have three infantry divisions a light cavalry brigade for reconnaissance and reserve artillery batteries in addition to those attached to each division their increased size allowed them to fight without support for long periods of time as ney did and their durability permitted them to spread out and subsist by requisitioning local food french needed about one eighth transport used by contemporary armies giving them a level of mobility and flexibility unseen at that time invasions of south germany by marlborough or moreau covered a narrow front but grande armee invaded in 1805 on a front that was wide an action that took austrians by complete surprise and caused them to underestimate gravity of situation popular culture campaign is included in leo tolstoy s war and peace notes
