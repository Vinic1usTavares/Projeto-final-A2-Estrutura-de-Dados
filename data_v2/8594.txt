42 cm kurze marinekanone 14 l 12 light naval cannon or minenwerfer gerat m gerat popularly known by nickname big bertha was a german siege howitzer built by krupp ag and fielded by imperial german army from 1914 to 1918 m gerat had a calibre barrel making it one of largest artillery pieces ever fielded it was first designed in 1911 and entered production next year test firing began in early 1914 and gun was estimated to be finished by october when world war i broke out two available m gerat guns still prototypes were sent to liege and destroyed forts pontisse and loncin german soldiers bestowed gun with nickname big bertha which then spread through german newspapers to allies who used it as a nickname for all superheavy german artillery paris gun used in 1918 after all big had been removed from service has historically been confused for m gerat due to losses from faulty ammunition and allied counter battery artillery a smaller calibre gun called beta m gerat was built and fielded from 1916 until end of war it had a longer and heavier barrel that was mated to m gerat s carriage but was found to be less effective than base gun development and design thumb left alt a picture of gamma gerat predecessor to m gerat gamma gerat predecessor of m gerat quick advancement of artillery technology beginning in 1850s provoked an arms race between artillery and military architecture rifled artillery could now fire out of range of fortress guns so military architects began placing forts in rings around cities or in barriers to block approaching armies these forts were vulnerable to new artillery shells which could penetrate earth to destroy masonry underground in response star forts evolved into polygonal forts mostly underground and made of concrete with guns mounted in armoured rotating casemates combining rings and barriers france created a vast fortified zone on their border with germany while belgium began construction of national redoubt in 1888 german empire also fortified its borders but chief of general staff helmuth von moltke elder desired ability to break through franco belgian fortifications although german artillery had been effective during franco prussian war it had been allowed to stagnate by 1880s barrel diameter of german army s most powerful gun field howitzer was no longer adequate against fortresses moltke began requesting more powerful guns that same decade more powerful artillery became essential to his successor alfred von schlieffen who planned to quickly defeat france by sweeping through belgium in response to 1893 franco russian alliance to be able to reduce french and belgian fortresses artillery test commission apk formed a partnership with krupp ag in 1893 first result of this partnership was a mortar accepted into service four years later and designated kustenmorser l 8 or beta gerat to disguise its purpose as a siege gun tests in mid 1890s showed that beta gerat could not destroy french or belgian forts even with improved shells interest in a more powerful siege gun waned until russo japanese war during which japanese army used coastal guns brought from japan to end 11 month long siege of port arthur in 1906 helmuth von moltke younger became chief of general staff and instructed apk to study and improve performance of beta gerat apk recommended a more powerful gun perhaps as large as but germany army opted for a 30 5 cm howitzer beta gerat 09 and a gun design and testing for gamma gerat began in 1906 and lasted until 1911 although gamma gerat had destructive power general staff required and could outrange french and belgian fort guns it could only be emplaced near rail lines and took 24 hours to fully prepare as early as 1907 krupp began development of siege artillery transported by gun carriage testing resulted in a howitzer transportable over road and countryside but it was rejected by apk as was krupp s 30 5 cm model finally in autumn 1911 krupp and apk developed a wheeled 42 cm howitzer which was designated 42 cm kurze marinekanone 14 l 12 or minenwerfer gerat m gerat apk ordered its first m gerat in july 1912 and another in february 1913 tests of gun s mobility began in december 1913 and found that gasoline tractors were best for pulling m gerat test firing at one point observed personally by kaiser wilhelm ii began in february 1914 and krupp estimated that m gerat would be fully completed by october 1914 design and production m gerat weighed had a maximum range of and a maximum barrel elevation of 65deg gun stood tall long and wide while barrel itself was long m gerat was two thirds weight of gamma gerat but had 30 less range and was less accurate this reduction in weight was accomplished by shrinking gamma s barrel and thinning its walls while installing a simpler sliding wedge breech five wagons that a disassembled m gerat each designed to hold a specific load took up could not be pulled by horses or tractors as they weighed to pull wagons gas powered tractors were designed by that could move guns at under optimal circumstances to move across open country wagon wheels were fitted with articulations called to reduce their ground pressure when fully emplaced howitzer was stabilised by steel platforms under wheels and its spade driven into earth which could also turn gun spade would have to be pulled out of ground to traverse past its 4deg radius post prototype m gerat guns had a crew platform in front of blast shield a detachable breech and solid wheels apk ordered first m gerat in july 1912 delivered following december and a second in february 1913 another two guns were ordered before first world war on 31 july 1914 and then two more on 28 august and yet another pair on 11 november krupp built a total of 12 m gerat howitzers 30 5 cm beta m gerat designated schwere l 30 was developed in late 1917 to replace m gerat guns that had been rendered inoperable by premature detonation of shells to increase range of m gerat and lower likelihood of premature detonation apk selected a naval barrel to be mounted onto chassis of m gerat two large spring cylinders were added to front of gun to counterbalance new barrel which had to be carried in a new carriage weighing fully assembled beta m gerat weighed and had a maximum range of propellant used to achieve that range caused three of four beta m gerat guns to explode forcing their crews to limit its range by defeating purpose of longer l 30 barrel only four beta m gerat guns were modified from two m gerat guns and two gamma gerat guns a one to two month long process per gun but 12 l 30 barrels were built gerat siege artillery variants name calibre weight range rate of fire time to emplace hours m gerat big bertha 8 shells an hour 5 6 gamma gerat 24

armour piercing shell was designed to smash through concrete and metal armour but was largely ineffective against reinforced concrete high explosive shells were fitted with two charges and could be set to have no delay or a short or a long delay if set to no delay then shell burst on impact 42 cm high explosive shell craters could be as wide as and as deep as if set to a delayed detonation it could penetrate up to of earth finally intermediate or short shell weighed half as much as high explosive shell and was fitted with a ballistic tip for range and accuracy 42 cm shells were generally long weighed between and were propelled via primer loaded into gun in a brass casing siege artillery shells were produced in limited runs ensuring a gradient in their quality beginning in early 1916 german siege guns began to suffer premature detonations due to faulty ammunition as a result crews were required to disembark from gun before firing service history kurze marinekanone kmk batteries that formed with m gerat guns were 3 2 august 1914 5 june 1915 6 summer 1915 and 7 early 1916 battery 3 was split in half in april 1916 to form 10 with a single m gerat each four beta m gerat guns produced were fielded by kmk batteries 8 and 10 after their m gerat gun barrels had been destroyed by premature detonation when german army was reorganised in late 1918 only battery 5 had m gerat guns and schwere kustenmorser battery 3 was assigned remaining two beta m gerat guns western front thumb right alt photograph of ruins of fort de loncin ruins of fort de loncin 1914 by june 1914 prototype m gerat howitzers had returned to essen for final adjustments and would have been formed into a reserve artillery battery on completion in october on 2 august 1914 they were organised into kmk battery 3 and sent to western front with 240 men on 4 august german 1st army arrived near liege first target of schlieffen plan and began battle of liege although german troops entered city on 7 august its forts were firing upon road to be taken by 2nd army and had to be reduced heavy artillery began their attack on 8 august kmk battery 3 was first siege battery sent into battle to bombard fort de pontisse on 12 august which surrendered after two days battery next moved to fort de but fort surrendered as battery was emplacing kmk battery 3 relocated to fort de loncin where gerard leman directed defence of liege firing commenced on 15 august and lasted two hours as 25th shot fired struck a magazine destroying fort in ensuing explosion germans carried leman unconscious out of loncin and last two forts and flemalle capitulated on 16 august with liege captured 1st army continued northwest while 2nd and 3rd armies marched to namur whose forts were undermanned unmaintained and poorly stocked with ammunition 2nd army arrived on 20 august 1914 to open siege of namur but began their main attacks following day with 400 pieces of artillery kmk battery 3 fired upon fort de which was destroyed on 23 august by a magazine explosion battery shifted its fire to fort de already under attack by four austro hungarian skoda 30 5 cm guns and compelled its surrender with eastern forts occupied germans entered namur itself and remaining belgian forces evacuated from city thumb left alt photograph of a destroyed cupola at maubeuge fortress a ruined cupola at one of maubeuge forts 1914 following defeat of western allies at charleroi and at mons british expeditionary force withdrew past maubeuge their base of operations after arriving in france on 24 august 1914 advancing germans arrived at fortresses of maubeuge and laid siege to its garrison of 45 000 soldiers next day vii reserve corps were left behind main german armies to take city bombardment of forts began on 30 august with kmk battery 3 tasked with reducing fort sarts but it mistakenly shelled an interval fortification in front of sarts by 5 september a hole in fortress ring had been opened by german 21 cm guns but they had by now exhausted their ammunition supply to widen that gap siege guns then expended their remaining ammunition against forts and on 7 september and destroyed them in quick succession two remaining french forts surrendered that same day and germans occupied maubeuge on 8 september with maubeuge taken german siege guns were available for an attack on paris but germany s defeat at battle of marne blocked advance of 1st and 2nd armies and guns were instead sent to antwerp king albert i had ordered a general retreat to antwerp on 18 august and his army arrived in city two days later from antwerp albert made attacks on german flank on 24 25 august and 9 september prompting general alexander von of 1st army to send iii reserve corps to seize antwerp it arrived and partially surrounded antwerp from southwest on september 27 and bombardment began next day kmk battery 3 arrived on 30 september and opened fire on whose artillery narrowly missed battery fort was abandoned by its garrison on 2 october allowing kmk battery 3 to attack and destroy in a single day battery then moved to attack which was also destroyed within two days from 7 9 october belgian army fled from antwerp and city surrendered on 10 october early in 1916 all 42 cm guns were assigned to 5th army which amassed a total of 24 siege guns highest concentration of them during war battle of verdun was opened on 21 february 1916 with an intense nine hour long artillery barrage 42 cm guns were tasked with suppressing artillery of forts vaux douaumont and but were unable to penetrate concrete of modern fortresses on second day of battle both of kmk battery 7 s m gerat guns were destroyed by premature detonations and kmk batteries 5 and 6 both lost an m gerat each to same cause most of siege guns at verdun were moved north in july to participate in battle of somme and by september only m gerat units left in verdun were kmk batteries 3 and 6 in last two years of war kmk batteries that suffered losses of their big guns had them replaced with smaller calibre weapons those that remained primarily shelled field works and often had low survivability due to malfunctions or allied counter battery artillery kmk battery 10 lost one m gerat to a premature detonation and other to british warships near ostend in august 1917 and was rearmed with captured russian howitzers it and kmk battery 10 were given four beta m made during war in early 1918 for spring offensive kmk battery 8 was assigned to 6th army battery 6 to 2nd army and battery 3 to 18th army effect of siege guns was negligible for germany s final offensive in july 1918 kmk batteries 5 and 6 were reassigned to 7th army at marne while batteries 3 8 and 10 went to 1st army at reims batteries again had little to no effect and battery 10 became last german siege battery to fire on a fort fort de la in november 1918 kmk battery 5 surrendered its guns remaining two m gerat howitzers to american expeditionary force eastern

held forts x xa and xi against counterattack compelling russians to abandon przemysl german troops entered city on 3 june then took remaining forts two days later from 8 august kmk battery 6 supported reserve corps s attack on kaunas fortress by bombing kaunas s three westernmost forts although german siege artillery s shelling of kaunas was slow fortifications were outdated and were easily destroyed by 18 august kaunas was overrun by germans next month kmk battery 6 was moved to serbian front to support a crossing of danube by 11th army firing began on 6 october and germans crossed next day to take belgrade to south kmk batteries 3 and 5 participated in siege of novogeorgievsk which germans had surrounded on 10 august on 13 august kmk batteries 3 and 5 attacked with siege guns from north shelling forts xiv xv and xvi on 16 august german infantry stormed forts xv and xvi as artillery attacked them a single 42 cm shell struck german troops attacking fort xv resulting in heavy casualties but germans took forts russians abandoned outer ring on 18 august allowing germans to open a hole in inner ring and capture novogeorgievsk next day in response russians abandoned fortresses
