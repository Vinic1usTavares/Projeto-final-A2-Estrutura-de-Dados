kew lunatic asylum is a decommissioned psychiatric hospital located between princess street and yarra boulevard in kew a suburb of melbourne australia operational from 1871 to 1988 kew was one of largest asylums ever built in australia later known as willsmere complex of buildings were constructed between 1864 and 1872 to design of architects g w vivian and frederick kawerau of victorian public works to house growing number of lunatics inebriates and idiots in colony of victoria first purpose built asylum in colony of victoria kew was also larger and more expensive than its sister asylums at ararat and beechworth asylum s buildings are typical examples of italianate vic gov au places 622 style which was popular in victorian melbourne designed to be elegant beautiful yet substantial and to be viewed as a magnificent asylum for insane with aim of portraying melbourne as a civilised and benevolent city whilst avoiding jail like appearance of other asylums vpp1876 vol 3 p p 31 these aims were furthered by use of low ha ha walls and extensively landscaped grounds long considered of cultural and historic significance to melbourne kew asylum and its complex of buildings were registered on register of national estate in march 1978 despite initial grand plans and ideals kew asylum had a difficult and chequered history contributing to several p throughout its 117 years of operation including a royal commission zox overcrowding mismanagement lack of resources poor sanitation and disease s were common criticisms during asylum s first five decades out dated facilities and institutionalisation were criticisms of kew s later period kew continued to operate throughout 20th century as a hospital for insane mental hospital or psychiatric hospital treating acute long term and geriatric patients until it closed in december 1988 main building and surrounding grounds were sold by state government in 1980s and were redeveloped as residential properties site and planning thumb right 300px engraving of kew asylum circa 1880 buildings of yarra bend asylum are depicted in foreground during 1850s existing lunatic asylums of colony of victoria were overcrowded day p 30 yarra bend asylum while only six years old was considered p 22 and carlton lunatic asylum which was originally a gaol was in a state of disrepair as a result in 1854 government of colony of victoria commissioned a report proposing sites and designs for a new lunatic asylum contemporary educated opinion was that lunatic asylums should be built on a healthy site freely admitting light and air and drainage on a gentle eminence in a fertile and agreeable country in a report by new south wales inspector of asylums frederick norton manning stated that site chosen is of primary importance on it must depend comfort happiness and health of inmates p 166 thus a hilltop site across yarra river from yarra bend was recommended in a report by g w vivian of public works office vivian vol 4 p 949 vivian described site as a section of land about 400 acres in extent situated on river yarra about 4 miles from melbourne and 1 2 a mile to north of village of kew site selected is a fine slope elevated about 100 feet above level of river admitting of proper drainage and admirably adapted for ornamental grounds aspect chosen is south east and during summer months refreshing influence of sea breeze will be felt without being exposed to south west gales g w vivian report on proposed kew lunatic asylum idea that breezes or wind swept locations were healthy came from a wider victorian belief that associated disease with congestion and squalor and that of impure air caused epidemics area vivian recommended for asylum had originally been set aside for a village reserve walker p 4 locals from kew were upset by proposal and petitioned government to no avail of land in county of bourke parish of city of kew were permanently reserved as a site for lunatic asylum in government gazette of 1864 construction began in 1864 however was halted almost immediately with reports of inferior works on foundations an investigation followed and frederick kawerau resigned contractor samuel continued construction at kew using kawerau s designs they were derived from plans earlier outlined by vivian and were basically identical to kawerau s designs for ararat and beechworth though kew was much larger day p 29 and more expensive at a cost of 334 according to dr dick s assessment in 1884 kew asylum for buildings fittings boundary walls fencing and laying on services of gas and water cost 198 334 pounds compared to ararat ps 128 222 beechworth ps 166 403 zox vol 4 p 12 distinctive features thumb 350px skyline of kew asylum asylum complex is an example of e plan lunatic asylums based on model 1850s asylum in colney hatch england day p 32 which itself was based on 1830 design of hanwell asylum in london kew was also considered a barracks style asylum due to its perceived resemblance to stockades or gaols day p 37 buildings are constructed from oversize bricks made from local clay which was quarried on site bricks were then rendered with cement day p 34 central administration block is three storied with a mansard roof and cupola two storeyed ward wings extend to each side one for each sex each wing has a four storey mansard roofed tower which contained water tanks ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas many of which were retained when complex was redeveloped cass internally dormitories had ceilings and brightly coloured p 71 with beds aligned in neat rows floors were of timber principally so they could be scrubbed primary access to complex was from a tree lined drive from princess street now known as main drive culminating in an elliptical carriageway in front of main building a second drive now known as lower drive extended from princess street to rear gates of asylum this road was commonly used for deliveries to and from asylum via rear gatehouse while kew s plan and detail are similar to its sister asylums at ararat and beechworth kew asylum is much larger with front buildings and towers more impressive architecturally kew s distinctive towers and mansard roofs make it one of most prominent architectural landmarks in melbourne and is clearly visible on eastern skyline ha ha walls right 245px thumb cross section of a ha ha wall at kew asylum another distinctive feature of kew asylum and its sister asylums is use of a variation on ha ha walls around patients courtyards they consisted of a trench one side of which was vertical and faced with stone or bricks other side sloped and turfed from inside walls presented a tall face to patients deterring them from escaping while from outside walls looked low so as not to suggest imprisonment a journalist with argus described walls as an excellent arrangement as it enables patients to see outside world and does away with that gaol appearance and feeling inculcated by walls of old asylums james p 25 in day many of kew s ha ha walls were retained and remain intact unlike those at beechworth and ararat which were partially dismantled or trenches were filled in grounds and landscaping thumb 300px asylum grounds circa grounds of kew asylum were originally landscaped in tradition of an english country park this was consistent with victorian idea that pleasant or beautiful surroundings would help ease mental anguish of inmates connolly p 9 it has been proposed that initial plantings on site were supplied by baron ferdinand von mueller director of botanic gardens initially grounds were planted with many conifers and large growing trees oaks elms and moreton bay figs and trees indigenous to area river red gum yellow box and were retained in landscape in 1913 landscape gardener hugh linaker was employed to lay out grounds of mont park asylum as landscape gardener for state lunacy department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at other asylums in victoria including kew conifer plantings and oak avenues along main and lower drives were well established and of a mature size by 1940s conifers were widely planted from 1860s along with moreton bay figs and occasionally oaks oaks and elms were more widely planted from 1880s it is not known if linaker was responsible for oak avenues but it appears that many of conifers monterey pines canary island pines monterey cypress hoop pine bunya bunya pines and himalayan cedars predate linaker and oaks and elms may have been planted soon after his appointment use of bhutan cypress in landscape is almost certainly due to linaker as he favoured upright trees it is possible that two remnant monterey cypress along main drive and a monterey pine along lower drive are trees from an earlier planting scheme several trees and plants on grounds of kew asylum and kew cottages have been classified as of historical significance by victorian heritage council and national trust of australia victoria and have been protected during property s redevelopment walker p 5 p 30 p 36 in addition to asylum s ornamental gardens grounds featured vegetable gardens farms and recreational areas such as cricket ovals and bowling greens little evidence remains of these structures except that there is now a road that encircles former cricket oval patients many of kew s early patients were transferred from yarra bend asylum and carlton lunatic asylum and were housed in two main wings men in right wing women in left wards were dormitory style and were divided by patient type male female paying pauper manageable refractory area of women s wards was smaller due to laundries and drying courtyards being located on women s side of asylum day p 67 admission process thumb right 280px overview of building s layout female wards were accommodated in left hand wing males in right administration areas were in front building and centre wing small round buildings are privies under lunacy statute of 1867 lunacy acts from 1880 to 1928 and mental hygiene act of 1933 people could be admitted to asylum by a number of means at request of a friend relative or acquaintance with medical certificates written by two medical practitioners this method was amended by mental health act 1959 which stated a person could be admitted upon recommendation of a medical practitioner who had examined person as soon as possible after admission superintendent of hospital was required to examine patient and either approve recommended admission or discharge patient any lunatic person found wandering at large or not under proper care and control could be brought before two justices who could order person s removal to an asylum police were usually responsible for bringing person before two justices any prisoner of crown thought to be a lunatic could be removed from a jail to an asylum by order of chief secretary voluntary boarders were those who requested that they be admitted for a mutually agreed period of time from 1915 onwards until end of world war i there was little change in admission process at kew upon arriving a variable amount of data was collected on person being admitted these basic details included age sex marital status and former address or name of asylum jail transferred from other details requested included names of relatives or friends person s religion and occupation and whether others in family have ever been classified as insane other information recorded where available were dates of previous admissions form of mental disorder bodily condition satisfactory unsatisfactory feeble etc and duration of existing attack from approximately 1900 onwards photographs were usually taken on admission if person was very restless photograph was omitted day p 57 belongings such as books and clothes were often returned to friends or family day p 60 inmates were required to dress in institutional clothes this was useful in a number of ways as it assisted public in easily identifying escaped inmates reduced need to request clothes or money for clothes from inmate s family or their estate and minimised inmate conflict when inmates swapped or stole clothes from each other property and estates of people who were deemed to be insane were controlled and administered by master in equity also known as master in lunacy 59 diagnoses thumb right 300px entrance gates and gatehouse of kew asylum c 1880 gate house was demolished and gates moved to victoria park kew in 1930s or vol 2 p 6 2 to facilitate straightening of princess street diagnoses given to patients during kew s first fifty years were common ailments found in most lunatic asylums of pre era delusional insanity dementia epilepsy general paralysis paresis of insane idiocy inebriation melancholia puerperal mania some of these terms are still in use today however they may now have different meanings for example from examining notes on some of kew s early dementia patients it can be deduced that many were most likely suffering from what we now term severe depression catatonia or schizophrenia children at kew in early days of kew asylum distinction between lunatics and idiots or imbeciles was not made therefore many wards of state difficult children and children with intellectual disability were housed with adults at kew brothers p 145 by 1879 nearly 600 children representing a quarter of all inmates were accommodated in various institutions in victoria in 1880s government decided that a separate building should be built to accommodate child inmates zox commission recommended yarra bend asylum site as appropriate for buildings for imbecile children however a site between main building and entrance gates of kew was chosen and in 1885 a contract was let for erection of cottage units kew idiot ward kew cottages was opened in may 1887 idiot ward was initially considered a ward of kew lunatic asylum however later became known as a separate institution kew idiot asylum although idiot asylum only admitted children many of those children remained in residence at cottages as adults inebriates at kew under lunacy statute of 1867 master in lunacy was able commit inebriates to an asylum for any period up to twelve months inebriates who were able to pay lodging fees at private inebriate asylums were able to be housed in inebriate specific institutions such as northcote inebriate asylum paupers were placed in lunatic asylums after 1888 zox commission into asylums all private semi private inebriate asylums were abolished under provisions of inebriate asylums act 1888 northcote was taken over by government of victoria in 1890 and converted into a public inebriate retreat brightside and lara inebriate retreats were opened soon after and many alcoholics were moved out of lunatic asylums famous patients ambrose dyson political cartoonist and satirist died in kew asylum edward ellen de lacy evans picaresque

victorian cricketer one of founders of australian rules football oxford companion to australian history entry for thomas wills investigations and inquiries thumb right 180px woodcut from 1876 despite initial grand plans and ideals kew asylum had a difficult and chequered history resulting in several inquiries including a royal commission first inquiry occurred in 1876 only five years after kew opened another notable inquiry occurred in 1907 after a severe outbreak of typhoid fever which at time was thought to have been virtually eradicated in melbourne this inquiry in turn led to amendments to lunacy act improvements to kew and state s other asylums and planned construction of mont park asylum zox royal commission public outcry at treatment of insane in colony s lunatic asylums increased in 1870s fueled by articles and woodcuts in magazines and writings of vagabond in argus pratt officially known as royal commission on asylums for insane and inebriate 1884 1886 royal commission chaired by ephraim zox was required to inquire into and report upon state and condition of asylums for insane and inebriates both public and private royal commission made some sixty five recommendations in its final report a number of commission s recommendations were implemented prior to presentation of its final report others were implemented through lunacy amendment act 1888 and some recommendations were not implemented until proclamation of lunacy act 1903 in 1905 commission recommended that criminal patients be kept apart from other patients thus male criminally insane patients were moved to j ward of ararat asylum and female dangerous patients to sunbury asylum commission also recommended that inebriates and idiots be housed in asylums separate from insane which led to construction of kew idiot ward and various inebriate asylums zox commission further recommended increasing role of medical doctors at asylums and that medical men have sole and exclusive right to determine whether their fellow citizens are sane or insane medical expert therefore stands in position of witness jury and judge zox p 284 prior to and in some instances for a time after zox commission many superintendents at asylums did not have any training in insanity day p 82 changing names changing society thumb right 250px kew asylum circa 1885 1887 note brick ha ha walls adjoining front archways enclosing one of female courtyards during its 120 years of operation kew s title changed numerous times agency va 2840 this has been in response to society s changing views towards treatment and care of mentally ill persons improvements in treatment leading to better health outcomes and changes in victorian government s various health acts from its establishment until 1905 institution at kew was known as an asylum a title which emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a place where people could possibly be cured kew was also for a short period known as metropolitan lunatic asylum at kew possibly to differentiate it from its sister country asylums at ararat and beechworth during this period all people committed to asylum were termed inmates rather than patients again emphasising detention rather than cure lunacy act of 1903 changed title of all victorian asylums to hospitals for insane however this act didn t come into operation until march 1905 from this time onwards inmates began being referred to as patients mental hygiene act of 1933 again altered kew s title to kew mental hospital move from asylum to hospital and inmate to patient also reflected increased involvement of medical profession in management and treatment of mental illness after world war ii there was a period of significant change in treatment and prognosis for people with a mental illness drugs such as lithium carbonate discovered in 1948 by australian psychiatrist john cade and chlorpromazine discovered in 1950 s lead to improvements in treatment thus many people with a mental illness could in many cases be treated in hospital for a shorter period and return to community mental health act of 1959 designated hospitals providing short term diagnosis and accommodation as psychiatric hospitals therefore any institution could have a section designated as a mental hospital for long term or indefinite hospitalisation and a section designated as a psychiatric hospital for short term diagnosis and treatment of acute psychiatric illness in 1962 decision was made to no longer house acute or short term patients at kew and therefore it was formally proclaimed a mental hospital under mental health act of 1959 up until this time kew mental hospital was still colloquially known as kew asylum day p 35 in 1960s kew began to be known as willsmere however some authors state name change to willsmere was later in january 1982 three wards of kew mental hospital were proclaimed a psychiatric hospital under provisions of mental health act 1959 these wards were then known as willsmere unit and were established to receive and accommodate short term acute patients shrinking grounds when opened kew s extensive of grounds were intended to be used for farming agriculture and recreation for inmates however as treatment methods inmate profiles superintendents and societal factors changed use of grounds changed accordingly a large area of grounds between asylum main buildings and princess street was allocated to children s cottages in 1885 when children s cottages became a separate institution area surrounding cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use widening and straightening of princess street in 1939 resulted in demolishing of kew s gatehouses loss of land and relocation of main gates to victoria park kew construction of yarra boulevard during 1930s led to a section of asylum s river frontage being acquired by roads department in 1958 of northern section of asylum grounds were offered under a crown grant to talbot colony for epileptics later known as royal talbot now part of austin health hospital and training centre continue to operate on site to this day an area of kew s grounds adjacent to talbot colony was granted to guide dogs vol 2 p 4 23 for building of a guide dog breeding and training centre which opened in 1962 construction of eastern freeway in early 1970s also resulted in property loss for both royal talbot and kew asylum decommissioning and redevelopment thumb right willsmere residential development in june 1943 town clerk of city of kew w d birrell produced a report on immediate post war priorities for kew birrell strongly urged council to propose closure of kew asylum with grounds to be subdivided and laid out on modern town planning principles with some 700 to 800 homes according to birrell this would have been an ideal post war scheme as it would provide employment and much needed land for housing birrell s proposal was not new ever since establishment of asylum proposals for its closure and redevelopment had recurred every few years sanderson vol 2 p 4 23 birrell s plans did not eventuate as overcrowding at other mental hospitals throughout victoria necessitated kew s continued operation by 1986 willsmere hospital s bed numbers had been reduced to 430 three quarters of which were for psychogeriatric patients as a result of ongoing mental health reform then labor government of victoria commissioned willsmere project purpose of which was to plan for decommissioning hospital and develop services and facilities in community long term psychogeriatric patients were transferred to new psychogeriatric nursing homes in suburbs to a re opened ward of plenty psychiatric hospital in to refurbished tuberculosis sanatorium or to other psychiatric institutions acutely unwell patients that would have previously been admitted to willsmere were now sent to newly built units at hospital monash medical centre or peninsula hospital willsmere was finally closed in december 1988 and sold by government of victoria in late 1980s an extensive conservation analysis was completed in 1988 that recommended bulk of original buildings be conserved hospital complex was eventually developed by central equity into residential apartments willsmere residential development was officially opened on 27 october 1993 by premier jeff kennett remaining grasslands between eastern freeway and main hospital buildings including site of asylum s cricket field were developed as kew gardens residential estate kew gardens project was completed in 1995 buildings and grounds of kew cottages formerly grounds of kew asylum were redeveloped as main drive project by walker corporation walker one of conditions of development permit from historic buildings council required that a section of building be set aside and maintained as a museum that documented history of site this led to creation of an interpretive display in a section of old female paying patients ward development of an archive and resource collection consisting of few remaining records and artifacts left behind when central equity gained control of site from a v jennings archive and resource collection was created by australian science archives project asap at university of melbourne kew asylum museum archives page at australian science archives project published 25 february 1998 documented histories there are few documented or published histories of kew asylum majority of information available on asylum comes from kew s official records which are now held by public record office victoria some of early documents are open or part open to public for viewing such as admission books case notes registers and medical journals however majority of documents dating from 1915 onwards are closed due to sensitive nature of material they contain and possibility that first degree relatives may still be alive a number of photographs of kew asylum are kept by victorian mental health library at royal melbourne hospital state library of victoria also holds a number of early photographs of kew university of melbourne has a small number of theses on kew majority of which are short in length and are architecture based exception to this is cheryl day s unpublished phd thesis which is an ethnographic description of first fifty years of kew s existence while thesis was unpublished it is available in pdf form through university of melbourne library website university of melbourne library website some contemporary accounts of life in kew are available paul ward
