fieldfare turdus pilaris is a member of thrush family turdidae it breeds in woodland and scrub in northern europe and asia it is strongly migratory with many northern birds moving south during winter it is a very rare breeder in british isles but winters in large numbers in united kingdom southern europe north africa and middle east it is omnivorous eating a wide range of molluscs insects and earthworms in summer and berries grain and seeds in winter fieldfares often nest in small colonies possibly for protection from predators nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid chicks are fed by both parents and leave nest after a fortnight there may be two broods in southern parts of range but only one further north migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks often in company of redwings fieldfare is long with a grey crown neck and rump a plain brown back dark wings and tail and white underwings breast and flanks are heavily spotted breast has a reddish wash and rest of underparts are white sexes are similar in appearance but females are slightly more brown male has a simple chattering song and birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls etymology english common name fieldfare dates back to at least eleventh century old english word perhaps meant traveller through fields another version traces it back to for species was described by linnaeus in his systema naturae 1758 under its current scientific name name turdus pilaris comes from two separate latin words for thrush no subspecies are recognised taxonomy about 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in genus turdus characterised by rounded heads longish pointed wings and usually melodious songs although two european thrushes song thrush and mistle thrush are early offshoots from eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa fieldfare is descended from ancestors that had colonised caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there description fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate grey head nape and rump dark brown back blackish tail and boldly speckled breast in flight its white under wing coverts and axillaries are conspicuous harsh flight call tsak tsak is also distinctive forehead and crown of male are bluish grey and each feather has a central brownish black band lores and under eye regions are black and there are faint pale streaks above eyes ear coverts nape hind neck and rump are bluish grey usually with a white streak near shaft of each rump feather scapulars and mantle feathers are dark chestnut brown with dark central streaks and pale tips there are fourteen tail feathers each with a pointed tip outer two slightly shorter than others giving a rounded tail they are brownish black with inconspicuous darker bars visible in some lights outer edge of each tail feather is fringed with grey near base and outer pair of feathers have a narrow white border on inner edge chin throat and upper breast are creamy buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish black lower breast is creamy white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and belly is similarly creamy white with speckles restricted to uppermost parts primaries are brownish black with leading edge fringed grey and inner edge of outer feathers grey near base whereas inner feathers are fringed with brown near base secondaries are similar but fringed with chestnut brown on leading edge upper wing coverts are brownish black and similar to outer primaries in their margin colouration axillaries and under wing coverts are white and under tail coverts have dark greyish brown bases and margins and white centres and tips beak is strong with a slight curve and a notch near tip it is orange yellow in winter with upper mandible somewhat brownish and both mandible tips brownish black in summer both mandibles of male s beak are yellow irises are dark brown and legs and feet are brown average adult length is is and tarsal length female is very similar to male but upper parts are somewhat more brownish and feathers on crown have narrower black central stripes throat and breast are paler with fewer smaller markings beak is similar to male s winter beak juvenile are a duller colour than adults with pale coloured streaks on feathers that have dark streaks in adult young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in autumn call is mostly uttered in flight and is a harsh tsak tsak same sound but softer is made more conversationally when individuals gather in trees when angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of mistle thrush turdus male has a rather feeble song that he sings in breeding season it is a mixture of a few phrases like those of common blackbird turdus merula interspersed with whistles guttural squeaks and call notes this is sung on wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts distribution and habitat thumb left fieldfares in winter thumb left fieldfare in front of window fieldfare is a migratory species with a palearctic distribution it breeds in northern norway northern sweden finland belgium germany switzerland austria czech republic slovakia hungary poland and siberia as far east as transbaikal river and tian shan mountains in north west china its winter range extends through west and south europe to north africa though it is uncommon in mediterranean region eastern populations migrate to anatolia israel iran and northwest india and occasionally northeast india it is a vagrant to iceland greenland spitsbergen canary islands balearic islands madeira corsica sardinia sicily malta and cyprus flight of fieldfare is slow and direct it takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on it is highly gregarious quite shy and easily scared in winter and bold and noisy in breeding season when a group is in a tree they all tend to face in same direction keeping up a constant chatter when foraging on ground often in association with redwings group works its way up wind each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding when alarmed they fly off down wind and feeding group reforms elsewhere in woodland they do not skulk in undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes instead they perch in open on bushes and high branches they roost socially sometimes in overgrown hedges and but usually on ground common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes in young plantations on stubble and in furrows of ploughed fields habitat in summer fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch alder pine spruce and fir often near marshes moorland or other open ground it does not avoid vicinity of humans and can be seen in cultivated areas orchards parks and gardens it also inhabits open tundra and slopes of hills above tree line in winter groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country agricultural land orchards and open woodland they are nomadic wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects later in year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields thumb fieldfare eating worms migration thumb berries form an important part of winter diet migration southwards from breeding range starts in october but bulk of birds arrive in united kingdom in november some of these are still on passage and carry on into continental europe but others remain passage migrants return in april and they and resident migrants depart from united kingdom mostly by early may diet fieldfare is omnivorous animal food in diet includes snails and slugs earthworms spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae flies and grasshoppers when berries ripen in autumn these are taken in great number hawthorn holly rowan yew juniper dog rose cotoneaster and berberis are all relished later in winter windfall apples are eaten swedes attacked in field and grain and seeds eaten when these are exhausted or in particularly harsh weather birds may move to marshes or even foreshore where molluscs are to be found breeding thumb left eggs collection museum wiesbaden germany thumb left nest and chicks breeding season starts in may in poland but further north in scandinavia may not start until early july female fieldfare builds a cup shaped nest with no attempt at concealment location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow garden among rocks in a pile of logs in a hut or on ground fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of same species adults will defend nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses there are usually five to six eggs in a clutch but occasionally three four seven or eight eggs are laid eggs vary in size from to and are variable in colour many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of common blackbird others are bright blue with or without larger red brown splotches incubation starts before all eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days female does all or most of incubation chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them they are usually ready to leave nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in season especially in southern parts of breeding range status and conservation fieldfare has an extensive range estimated at 10 million square kilometres 3 8 million square miles and a large population including an estimated forty two to seventy two million individuals in europe there are thought to be up to twenty thousand individuals in russia and global population is estimated to be between forty four and ninety six million individuals population size appears to be stable and bird is not believed to approach thresholds for population decline criteria of iucn red list of threatened species i e declining more than 30 in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of least concern in united kingdom at extreme edge of fieldfare s breeding range only a handful of pairs breed it is therefore classified by rspb as a red list species as of january 2013 references external links ageing
