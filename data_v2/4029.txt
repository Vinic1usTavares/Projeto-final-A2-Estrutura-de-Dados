blyth power station also known as cambois power station refers to a pair of now demolished coal fired power stations which were located on northumberland coast in north east england two stations were built alongside each other on a site near cambois in northumberland on northern bank of river blyth between its tidal estuary and north sea stations took their name from town of blyth on opposite bank of estuary blyth a power station was built and opened first but had a smaller generating capacity than its sister station blyth b power station which was built to its west four years later power stations four large chimneys were a landmark of northumberland skyline for over 40 years a station s two chimneys each stood at b station s two chimneys were taller at each construction of b station began shortly after a station was completed stations were built during a period in which there were great advances in power station technology and in scale of production which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles blyth a had a generating capacity of 480 megawatts mw and b station 1 250 mw their combined capacity of 1 730 mw briefly made blyth power station largest electricity generation site in england until ferrybridge c power station came into full operation in 1966 stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300 000 homes a station first generated electricity in 1958 a year after creation of central electricity generating board and stations operated until 2001 they were operated by successors of cegb including national power following privatisation of uk s power industry after their closure in 2001 stations were demolished over course of two years ending with demolition of stations chimneys on 7 december 2003 as of 2009 site is still covered in debris from demolition rwe npower have proposed construction of a clean coal fired power station on site however as of november 2009 these plans have been postponed history background following second world war demand for electricity increased in united kingdom in north east england this led to construction of two new power stations at stella along with expansion of stations at dunston and billingham to meet demand for power quickly at blyth a larger and more efficient plant was planned consisting of six 100 megawatts mw generating units this increased to six 120 mw units before increasing again in final proposal for an a station consisting of four 120 mw units and a b station consisting of two 275 mw units and two 350 mw units this gave a and b stations generating capacities of 480 mw and 1 250 mw respectively blyth power stations were to be an experiment using a variety of generating set sizes at a time when engineers were trying to standardise power station plant and layout blyth was first in uk to use generating sets larger than then standard 30 mw and 60 mw station s location was chosen because of its position within super grid rather than to be near a load centre site chosen for construction of power stations was close to coal mining town of cambois ordnance survey maps as far back as 1860 show that before building work began land had been used as open farmland with fields of varying shapes and sizes construction permission for blyth a power station to be built was granted in february 1955 and its construction took place between 1955 and 1960 station s first unit went into operation in december 1958 and a station was fully operational by june 1960 its four 120 mw sets were first commissioned in britain of what became for a time that standardised size construction of b station began on 4 december 1961 its first unit was commissioned in december 1962 and rest of station was fully operational by september 1966 station had a total generating capacity of 1 730 mw highest of any site in uk until later in same year when ferrybridge c power station came into full operation blyth b was first power station in britain to have 275 mw sets installed its two 350 mw sets were an intermediate stage toward 500 mw standard so very few of 350 mw sets were ever commissioned in uk both of stations were designed by l j partners they were engineered by merz mclellan and built by cleveland bridge company design and specification large site was separated by bedlington cambois road with stations main buildings admin blocks and ash dock to south of road and coal storage area and railway sidings to north ground to south of this road consisted of a thick layer of boulder clay overlaying sandstone and coal main foundations of buildings were spread out giving a load of about per square foot each of stations featured large boiler houses turbine halls switch houses flue gas cleaning plant and a pair of concrete chimneys blyth a s chimneys stood at and blyth b s chimneys stood at major landmarks on south east northumberland skyline each chimney weighed approximately prominence and large scale of buildings in surrounding flat rural area was subject of much contemporary architectural debate blyth a s turbine hall was long by wide and high it was built from a reinforced concrete frame clad with brickwork it housed four 120 mw metropolitan vickers 3 000 rpm turbo generators each connected to a babcock wilcox boiler situated in boiler house each boiler and generator set operated independently with no connections to other sets coal fed into boilers was pulverised by a babcock wilcox pulveriser fed by a coal bunker with a capacity of each pulveriser was capable of pulverising of coal an hour sufficient to keep its associated boiler at full output boiler house was long by wide and high it was built from a steel frame with aluminium cladding a station s design was an unusual mix of styles brick construction of turbine hall was a style used more often in 1950s while aluminium and glass cladding boiler house was a construction style used more in 1960s a station housed two control rooms each of which served two generating sets and contained controls to operate boilers turbo generators and auxiliary plant a station s switchgear was provided by a reyrolle company blyth b s turbine hall was long by wide and high it housed two 275 mw and two 350 mw english electric 3 000 rpm turbo generators each connected to a clarke chapman co boiler situated in boiler house boiler house was long by wide and high coal fed into boilers was pulverised by a babcock wilcox pulveriser each pulveriser was capable of pulverising of coal an hour and two pulverisers fed each boiler both turbine hall and boiler house were built from a steel frame clad with aluminium and glazing roofs of b station s buildings were made from a lightweight aluminium decking b station s switchgear was provided by a reyrolle company and by m c switchgear volume of blyth b s main buildings represented kw of installed capacity while blyth a s building volume represented kw operations left thumb 200px a train of coal is delivered to station coal transportation stations burned a mix of bituminous and anthracite coal they consumed of coal per week and had a peak consumption of per week during winter they were well positioned to use coal from northumberland and county durham coal fields all of coal used in stations was brought to them via rail transport from uk coal stocks trains delivered coal to station using north blyth branch of blyth and tyne railway stations coal handling facility was fitted with a merry go round mgr coal delivery system in 1981 after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became british rail standard this system involved trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath train because of site space restrictions a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed so instead of being able to move continuously trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track locomotive would then uncouple and at opposite end before slowly moving over unloading track hopper and discharging coal and eventually leaving site towards end of station s operation coal was more frequently brought in by road all coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area to north of power stations this had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination coal was brought from storage area to station using a system of conveyor belts which travelled over bedlington cambois road separating two sites before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary cooling system water is essential to a thermal power station to create steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity water used in power station at blyth was extracted from blyth harbour tidal basin at ash dock once used in station hot water had to be cooled before it could be discharged condensers were used to convert steam from turbines back into water stations condensers were of twin two pass design and had a total cooling surface of condensed water was then extracted by two duty pumps water then passed through a drains cooler cooled waste water was discharged into sea off cambois beach below low tide level ash removal pulverised fuel ash pfa and furnace bottom ash fba were byproducts produced through burning of coal in station bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers at bottom of boilers by high pressure water jets it then travelled to ash settling ponds via for much of station s life station was served by a series of barges which took ash to dump out into north sea two barges provided this service over years sir fon and mva barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to east of stations however dumping in sea stopped in 1992 when international convention for prevention of pollution from ships prevented further dumping in north sea from then on fba was sold to construction industry while pfa was either dried for sale or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on site closure and demolition closure in 1989 blyth a won a place in guinness book of records by setting world record for total running hours in a plant of its size when all four generating units achieved 200 000 running hours with privatisation of uk s electricity supply industry in 1990 station passed into ownership of national power in 1991 two 275 mw units at blyth b units 5 6 were decommissioned on grounds of economy despite station having been modernised in early 1980s this decommissioning resulted in 260 job losses during 1990s station became one of uk s least efficient power stations in 1998 plans were announced to use station as a test bed for clean coal technology but plans did not come to fruition in 1999 then owners innogy plc decided to take blyth a out of operation while blyth b began operating only at times of peak demand because stations had become surplus to their generating needs from 1 april 2000 onwards station was taken out of service for summer months because of low demand for electricity at that time of year however staff were retained to maintain station innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for station to decide site s future they had been in talks with american based nrg energy over a ps410 million purchase of station along with power station in north lincolnshire there had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert station into a waste to energy plant however any plans to save station fell through and generation of electricity at station ceased on 31 january 2001 after 43 years of operating resulting in loss of 131 jobs at time of its closure blyth power station was oldest coal fired power station in britain station long outlived its life expectancy of 25 years length of time that station was in use is partly due to its value in national grid as a charge near to a major node in system shortly after its closure a joint proposal was made by british army and ministry of agriculture to burn carcasses of animals slaughtered during 2001 foot and mouth crisis in portable incinerators at station station was proposed because of its high chimneys but strong opposition from local residents and members of parliament along with proximity of over 100 000 people living within of site meant that proposal was quickly rejected demolition thumb right 200px demolition of station s chimneys demolition contract for station was won by london based company brown mason before demolition of stations main structures it was required that they be decommissioned this involved removal of hazardous materials and contaminants to keep in line with health safety at work regulations oils and chemicals were removed for re use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site along with bottled propane used for welding remaining coal in coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations in other parts of country landfill site where ash waste from station was dumped was asbestos used in stations was removed prior to demolition of stations structures stations were demolished between 2001 and 2003 smaller buildings and structures were first to be demolished one worker was killed during demolition work in may 2001 crushed underneath an electrical connection box which fell from a wall on 31 october 2001 ash silo which stood at ash dock was toppled using explosives to demolish stilts structure stood on silo was then dismantled by bulldozers all of smaller structures had been removed by july 2002 on 11 july 2002 a station s boiler house was demolished high coal conveyor belt was demolished on 6 february 2003 station s precipitators were demolished on 27 march and 17 april 2003 on 1 may 2003 b station s bunker bay building was demolished and on 22 may 2003 stations air heater was demolished a fire started at station on 17 june 2003 when a bunker caught fire after hot cutting equipment set fire to coke remnants all of larger structures had been demolished by july 2003 it was planned for stations chimneys to be demolished in october 2003 but that had to be postponed due to complexity of demolition however at noon on 7 december 2003 four chimneys each weighing were demolished using a total of of industrial explosive demolition is thought to have been biggest chimney demolition in 50 years present and future uses of site since innogy plc was taken over by rwe in 2002 site has been owned by rwe npower only substantial structures remaining are national grid and nedl substations these buildings will continue to remain and there are plans to extend national grid substation rest of power station site is unused brownfield land site of main station buildings is currently covered in crushed concrete left over from demolition process underground workings such as tunnels and culverts also still exist on site coal storage area to north has been and ash settling ponds have been filled with concrete some ash mounds are still situated to east of site clean coal power station in may 2007 npower announced plans to build a new ps2 billion clean coal power station on site proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800 mw advanced supercritical steam high efficiency coal fired units giving station a total generation capacity of 2 400 mw this was one of two new coal fired stations proposed by npower in uk site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to national grid its rail and port links and its position next to north sea which is useful for both cooling water and as a potential co2 storage site where co2 could be piped to oil and gas wells and saline aquifers thumb right proposed 2 400 mw clean coal power station station would have had an efficiency of 46 which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal fired power stations equates to a reduction in carbon dioxide co2 of 23 per unit of electricity generated station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems including selective catalytic reduction to remove nitrogen oxide and flue gas desulphurisation to remove sulphur dioxide station would also have been able to allow installation of carbon capture and storage ccs technology when it becomes technically and commercially viable there was also a possibility that station may have co fired biomass and heat as a combined heat and power plant coal was expected to be able to be delivered to station by rail as well as by ship to port of blyth station s coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply all of station s pulverised fuel ash pfa may have been sold to construction industry transported to which in dry dust tankers unsold pfa and furnace bottom ash would be taken to a landfill site by road fifteen hundred jobs would have been created during station s construction and more than 200 full time jobs would have been available once station was operating left thumb 200px gate house at entrance to now leveled site this building is now used as a drop in centre environmental assessment scoping report for proposed station was submitted to department of trade and industry in 2007 and application for development was to be made to secretary of state for business enterprise and regulatory reform once environmental impact assessment was completed a contract had already been signed with shaw group to design and engineer station if npower had been granted permission to build new station construction work would have begun in 2010 and station was expected to be fully commissioned by 2014 it would have been one of most efficient coal fired power stations of its size in uk blyth valley council said proposal did not fit with regeneration plans in area residents living in area voiced opinions that land should be redeveloped for other purposes rather than continue to be used as an industrial site mp for wansbeck denis murphy stated that although project would have benefits for area he still had concerns ronnie campbell mp for blyth valley claimed he would welcome development as long as it did not have an adverse effect on overall regeneration of area on 5 june 2008 npower reopened original gatehouse at entrance to power station s site to provide a drop in centre for public to find out more about proposed plans in august 2009 following a visit to cambois from minister of state for energy at department of energy and climate change joan ruddock it was revealed that government were determined to go ahead with four new coal fired power stations she stated that they had no scepticism about ccs technology with a competition having been started between big energy companies to create a viable form of technology set to end in 2014 however this meant station may not have been completed until 2020 despite this support rwe announced in november 2009 that they have postponed their plans for new power station they are not yet going make a formal planning application for plant saying that time is not right for such a huge investment dave carlton rwe s project manager has said that they see site as an important one both for rwe npower and in terms of uk s future power generation and so rwe npower have retained site for a possible future power station malcolm reid of people against new coal stations a group opposed to power station development said we would now like to see northumberland county council re designate cambois site for green clean technology to match what is happening at new and renewable energy centre narec in blyth it is a perfect area for a factory for offshore wind turbines and housing development if cambois is re designated then prospect of area being regenerated rises colossally wind turbine factory in april 2010 malcolm reid proposed station s site as a possible location for a ps80 million siemens wind turbine factory factory would create 700 jobs and up to 1 500 further jobs in supply chain if built he has said site would be perfect for factory because of its close proximity to narec and site s existing deep dock facilities factory is likely to be built either in blyth or on humberside social and cultural impact power stations had very few television and film appearances in 1991 site was used as a shooting location for sci fi horror film alien 3 various locations in north east of england were used in shooting film and power station provided location for some shots of planet surface during latter stages of stations demolition a documentary was made documentary was included in channel five television programme demolition squad despite small amount of media usage of power stations their four chimneys were still a strong landmark within south east northumberland landscape they could be seen from as far south as away at in newcastle upon tyne and over an stretch of coast from seaton sluice up to newbiggin by sea this is mostly because stations were constructed in a largely flat rural area in 1995 site was considered for scheduling by english heritage because of its national importance as a good example of a late 20th century power station it was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes from which came success in uk s electricity industry however by then station s buildings were in poor condition and it would have been financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation instead it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of station would be commissioned due to closure of blyth power stations along with power stations at dunston and stella in 1980s and 1990s respectively northern part of north east england has become heavily dependent upon national grid for electrical supply
