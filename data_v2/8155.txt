typhoon gerald known in philippines as typhoon neneng affected philippines taiwan and china during september 1987 a tropical depression developed on september 4 and within 24 hours intensified into a tropical storm after initially moving erratically within philippine sea gerald moved west northwest and then northwest while steadily deepening gerald obtained typhoon intensity on september 8 and following day attained maximum intensity shortly thereafter typhoon skirted southwestern taiwan which resulted in a steady weakening trend on september 10 gerald moved ashore north of hong kong near amoy gerald dissipated next day across philippines storm caused 4 48 million 1987 usd in damage but no deaths although system stayed offshore taiwan storm inflicted widespread flooding across island that took five lives there 5 000 families were left without power and damage exceeded 10 million although gerald weakened considerably prior to making landfall storm was still responsible for extensive damage in fujian province where 76 people perished and 31 others suffered injuries in neighboring zhejiang province 28 people were killed and 71 others sustained injuries across china 4 900 homes were destroyed and 122 fatalities were reported damage in country amounted to 120 million meteorological history typhoon gerald one of three typhoons to form from monsoon trough in early september 1987 originated from an area of low pressure that developed to east of philippines over south china sea joint typhoon warning center jtwc started tracking low at 06 00 utc on september 2 after convection persisted two and a half hours later agency issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa but almost immediately thereafter shower and thunderstorm activity rapidly diminished due to decreased poleward outflow and increased wind shear despite this japan meteorological agency jma started tracking system at 00 00 utc on september 3 eight hours later tcfa was cancelled although low initially exhibited features typical of a monsoon trough surface observations suggested that surface pressures in vicinity of low began to fall on september 4 consequently was re issued at 10 00 utc eight hours later dvorak intensity estimates for storm reached t2 0 prompting jtwc to upgrade system into a tropical depression although post storm analysis from agency indicated that system attained tropical depression status at 00 00 utc on september 4 and tropical storm intensity at 18 00 utc that day at 06 00 utc on september 5 jma followed suit and classified gerald as a tropical storm meanwhile philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa also monitored storm and assigned it with local name neneng jtwc initially expected gerald to re curve east of philippines however storm s circulation remained quite shallow and embedded within monsoon trough causing gerald to meander jma upgraded gerald into severe tropical storm during evening hours of september 5 after meandering offshore philippines during storm s formative stages gerald began to turn west northwest and then north northwest on september 7 subsequently jtwc revised its forecasts and called for gerald to track through luzon strait and eventually move into china gerald also started to intensify at a faster clip at 00 00 utc on september 7 jtwc reported that gerald reached typhoon intensity with jma doing same a mere 12 hours later as an eye first became evident on satellite imagery midday on september 8 jtwc increased intensity of typhoon to equal to category 3 intensity on united states based saffir simpson hurricane wind scale several hours later jtwc estimated that gerald reached its peak intensity of at same time jma indicated that gerald attained winds of its peak intensity and a minimum barometric pressure of while at peak intensity typhoon gerald exhibited an wide eye unusually large for a tropical cyclone that season shortly after its peak gerald began to interact with southwestern coast of taiwan this greatly reduced storm s low level inflow which resulted in considerable weakening late on september 9 gerald passed about south of southern tip of taiwan and early following morning tracked west of island of weakening trend persisted as typhoon entered formosa straits and at 00 00 utc on september 10 jma downgraded gerald into a severe tropical storm six hours later jtwc reported that gerald was no longer a typhoon late on september 10 gerald made landfall less than northeast of amoy at time of landfall jtwc estimated that gerald had weakened into a tropical depression and jma had stopped classifying storm altogether at 00 00 utc on september 11 jtwc ceased following storm as it was no longer identifiable by surface observations or via satellite imagery preparations impact and aftermath during its formative stages of typhoon 177 people or 32 families were either homeless or evacuated to shelters in philippines there damage totaled 4 48 million with 2 52 million from public infrastructure and 1 94 million from agriculture however there were no casualties although gerald did not make landfall in taiwan it came close enough to deliver heavy rains and strong winds to island five people were killed along eastern and southeastern coasts portion of taiwan roads were cut off due to falling debris and mudslides two young boys died due to flash flooding in capital of taipei a worker at a nuclear power plant in southern tip of island died due to head injuries suffered during storm two fishermen near hualien drowned due to storm surge during height of storm 5 000 households lost power overall five people were killed and damage exceeded 10 million typhoon gerald brought up to of rain to fujian province with cities of ningde fuzhou putian quanzhou xiamen receiving worst damage of storm throughout province 67 people were killed and 31 other people were injured many seriously while of crops were damaged most of casualties in province occurred due to collapsed homes in neighboring province of zhejiang 28 others died and 71 were injured there storm flooded of crops and destroyed 700 homes a highway tunnel in county collapsed burying at least 12 people six of whom were rescued most of district was also isolated from outside world due to flooding along qiantang river throughout province thousands of bridges dikes and communications equipment were destroyed nationwide 4 900 dwellings were demolished 102 people sustained injuries and 122 fatalities occurred damage in country amounted to 120 million further south storm came close enough to hong kong to require a no 1 hurricane signal for about 23 hours starting on september 9 citywide highest recorded wind gust of occurred at tate s cairn hong kong royal observatory also reported a minimum pressure of while cheung chau received of rain in a five day time span throughout hong kong there were no deaths or damages following storm chinese army was mobilized to provide food and supplies to an estimated 25 400 people that were left homeless see also typhoon hal 1985 notes references external links japan meteorological agency
