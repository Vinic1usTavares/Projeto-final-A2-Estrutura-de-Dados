southern end was extended to us 16 south of lowell by 1931 a section of northern extension was marked on maps through 1933 as under construction that section was cancelled in favor of another routing near mancelona a short bypass of six lakes added about a mile to length of roadway in 1936 m 131 concurrency was switched to a us 131 concurrency when latter was extended in 1939 this concurrency was shortened just before world war ii when michigan state highway department mshd rerouted us 131 along a new road between south boardman and kalkaska mshd completed a major rerouting of m 66 around 1944

which was turned back to local control another realignment in 1954 shifted m 66 to modern routing between m 43 concurrency termini removing m 43 m 66 from a section of m 50 in process final section gravel section of m 66 approximately in length was paved near nashville in 1957 m 32 was extended along northernmost section of m 66 in 1963 m 66 was extended southerly from assyria through battle

final section of m 78 s roadway given to m 66 extended it all way to state line resulting in a north south trans peninsular highway from lake michigan near charlevoix to indiana m 66 is only such highway to run length of lower peninsula extension allowed green arrow association to promote whole length of green arrow route with a single highway number next year m 66 was rerouted through battle creek to use completed i 194 freeway a 90deg turn in missaukee county was removed north of lake city in 1972 in late 1973 or early 1974 m 66 and m 72 were shifted around south side of kalkaska later
