tracheal intubation usually simply referred to as intubation is placement of a flexible plastic tube into trachea windpipe to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs it is frequently performed in critically injured ill or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of lungs including mechanical ventilation and to prevent possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction most widely used route is orotracheal in which an endotracheal tube is passed through mouth and vocal apparatus into trachea in a nasotracheal procedure an endotracheal tube is passed through nose and vocal apparatus into trachea other methods of intubation involve surgery and include cricothyrotomy used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances and tracheotomy used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated because it is an invasive and uncomfortable medical procedure intubation is usually performed after administration of general anesthesia and a neuromuscular blocking drug it can however be performed in awake patient with local or topical anesthesia or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional laryngoscope flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or video laryngoscope to identify vocal cords and pass tube between them into trachea instead of into esophagus other devices and techniques may be used alternatively after trachea has been intubated a balloon cuff is typically inflated just above far end of tube to help secure it in place to prevent leakage of respiratory gases and to protect tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid tube is then secured to face or neck and connected to a t piece anesthesia breathing circuit bag valve mask device or a mechanical ventilator once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and or protection of airway tracheal tube is removed this is referred to as extubation of trachea or in case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy for centuries tracheotomy was considered only reliable method for intubation of trachea however because only a minority of patients survived operation physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort on patients who were nearly dead it was not until late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology as well an appreciation of germ theory of disease had improved outcome of this operation to point that it could be considered an acceptable treatment option also at that time advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure airway by non surgical orotracheal route by mid 20th century tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of practices of critical care medicine emergency medicine and laryngology tracheal intubation can be associated with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of tissues of upper airway it can also be associated with potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical aspiration pneumonitis or unrecognized intubation of esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia because of this potential for difficulty or complications due to presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation alternative strategies for securing airway must always be readily available indications tracheal intubation is indicated in a variety of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway breathing and blood in these circumstances oxygen supplementation using a simple face mask is inadequate depressed level of consciousness perhaps most common indication for tracheal intubation is for placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered general anesthetic agents opioids and neuromuscular blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish respiratory drive although it is not only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia intubation of trachea provides most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration damage to brain such as from a massive stroke non penetrating head injury intoxication or poisoning may result in a depressed level of consciousness when this becomes severe to point of stupor or coma defined as a score on glasgow coma scale of less than 8 dynamic collapse of extrinsic muscles of airway can obstruct airway impeding free flow of air into lungs furthermore protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent tracheal intubation is often required to restore relative absence of blockage of airway and protect tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents hypoxemia intubation may be necessary for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of blood caused when their breathing is inadequate suspended apnea or when lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to blood such patients who may be awake and alert are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury multiple rib fractures severe pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or near drowning specifically intubation is considered if arterial partial pressure of oxygen pao2 is less than 60 millimeters of mercury mm hg while breathing an inspired o2 concentration of 50 or greater in patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide an arterial partial pressure of co2 paco2 greater than 45 mm hg in setting of acidemia would prompt intubation especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis regardless of laboratory values these guidelines are always interpreted in clinical context airway obstruction actual or impending airway obstruction is a common indication for intubation of trachea life threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in airway this is especially common in infants and toddlers severe blunt or penetrating injury to face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma or injury to larynx trachea or bronchi airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near airway or epiglottitis sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure airway manipulation of airway diagnostic or therapeutic manipulation of airway such as bronchoscopy laser therapy or stenting of bronchi may intermittently interfere with ability to breathe intubation may be necessary in such situations equipment laryngoscopes thumb left alt

with an assortment of macintosh blades laryngoscope handle with an assortment of macintosh blades large adult small adult child infant and newborn vast majority of tracheal intubations involve use of a viewing instrument of one type or another modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades which are either straight or curved this device is designed to allow laryngoscopist to directly view larynx due to widespread availability of such devices technique of blind intubation of trachea is rarely practiced today although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations such as natural or man made disasters in prehospital emergency setting digital intubation may be necessitated if patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible for example digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time decision to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on specific anatomical features of airway and partly on personal experience and preference of laryngoscopist macintosh blade is most widely used curved laryngoscope blade while miller blade is most popular style of straight blade both miller and macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 infant through 4 large adult there are many other styles of straight and curved blades with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging field of view and even ports for administration of oxygen these specialty blades are primarily designed for use by and otolaryngologists most commonly in operating room fiberoptic laryngoscopes have become increasingly available since 1990s in contrast to conventional laryngoscope these devices allow laryngoscopist to indirectly view larynx this provides a significant advantage in situations where operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize glottis and deal with otherwise difficult intubations video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic laryngoscopes that use a digital video camera sensor to allow operator to view glottis and larynx on a video monitor other noninvasive devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are laryngeal mask airway used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement and stylets thumb alt an endotracheal tube stylet an endotracheal tube stylet useful in facilitating orotracheal intubation an intubating stylet is a malleable metal wire designed to be inserted into endotracheal tube to make tube conform better to upper airway anatomy of specific individual this aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy just as with laryngoscope blades there are also several types of available stylets such as stylet which is specifically designed to follow 60deg blade angle of video laryngoscope eschmann tracheal tube introducer often incorrectly referred to as a gum elastic bougie is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation this flexible device is in length 15 french 5 mm diameter with a small hockey stick angle at far end unlike a traditional intubating stylet eschmann tracheal tube introducer is typically inserted directly into trachea and then used as a guide over which endotracheal tube can be passed in a manner analogous to seldinger technique as eschmann tracheal tube introducer is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet this technique is considered to be a relatively means of tracheal intubation tracheal tube exchanger is a hollow catheter in length that can be used for removal and replacement of tracheal tubes without need for laryngoscopy cook airway exchange catheter is another example of this type of catheter this device has a central lumen hollow channel through which oxygen can be administered airway exchange catheters are long hollow catheters which often have connectors for jet ventilation manual ventilation or oxygen insufflation it is also possible to connect catheter to a to perform respiratory monitoring lighted stylet is a device that employs principle of to facilitate blind orotracheal intubation an intubation technique in which laryngoscopist does not view glottis tracheal tubes thumb alt a cuffed endotracheal tube a cuffed endotracheal tube constructed of polyvinyl chloride thumb alt a carlens double lumen endotracheal tube a carlens double lumen endotracheal tube used for thoracic surgical operations such as vats a tracheal tube is a catheter that is inserted into trachea for primary purpose of establishing and maintaining a patent open and unobstructed airway tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in settings of general anesthesia critical care mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine many different types of tracheal tubes are available suited for different specific applications an endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through mouth orotracheal or nose nasotracheal it is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into airway of critically injured ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of lungs and to prevent possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen at other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into lungs and may also include a balloon referred to as a cuff tip of endotracheal tube is positioned above carina before trachea divides to each lung and sealed within trachea so that lungs can be ventilated equally a tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube this curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision tracheal tubes can be used to ensure adequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air or to administer other gases such as helium nitric oxide nitrous oxide xenon or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as or sevoflurane they may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as bronchodilators inhaled corticosteroids and drugs used in treating cardiac arrest such as atropine epinephrine lidocaine and vasopressin originally made from latex rubber most modern endotracheal tubes today are constructed of polyvinyl chloride tubes constructed of silicone rubber wire reinforced silicone rubber or stainless steel are also available for special applications for human use tubes range in size from in internal diameter size is chosen based on patient s body size with smaller sizes being used for infants and children most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents blood secretions and other fluids uncuffed tubes are also available though their use is limited mostly to children in small children cricoid cartilage is narrowest portion of airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation in addition to cuffed or uncuffed preformed endotracheal tubes are also available oral and nasal rae tubes named after inventors ring adair and elwyn are most widely used of preformed tubes there are a number of different types of double lumen endo bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels carlens white and robertshaw tubes these tubes are typically coaxial with two separate channels and two separate openings they incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in trachea and an endobronchial lumen distal tip of which is positioned 1 2 cm into right or left mainstem bronchus there is also tube which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker these tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs or either lung independently single lung ventilation allowing lung on operative side to collapse can be useful during thoracic surgery as it can facilitate surgeon s view and access to other relevant structures within thoracic cavity armored endotracheal tubes are cuffed wire reinforced silicone rubber tubes they are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes yet they are difficult to compress or kink this can make them useful for situations in which trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration or if neck is to remain flexed during surgery most armored tubes have a magill curve but preformed armored rae tubes are also available another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above inflatable cuff which can be used for suction of trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary other tubes such as cuf tube are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around airway methods to confirm tube placement thumb an endotracheal tube in good position on arrow marks tip thumb an endotracheal tube not deep enough arrow marks tip no single method for confirming tracheal tube placement has been shown to be 100 reliable accordingly use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be standard of care such methods include direct visualization as tip of tube passes through glottis or indirect visualization of tracheal tube within trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope with a properly positioned tracheal tube equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to chest with a stethoscope and no sound upon listening to area over stomach equal bilateral rise and fall of chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions a small amount of water vapor will also be evident within lumen of tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in tracheal tube at any time ideally at least one of methods utilized for confirming tracheal tube placement will be a measuring instrument waveform has emerged as gold standard for confirmation of tube placement within trachea other methods relying on instruments include use of a colorimetric end tidal carbon dioxide detector a self inflating esophageal bulb or an esophageal detection device distal tip of a properly positioned tracheal tube will be located in mid trachea roughly above bifurcation of carina this can be confirmed by chest x ray if it is inserted too far into trachea beyond carina tip of tracheal tube is likely to be within right main bronchus a situation often referred to as a right mainstem intubation in this situation left lung may be unable to participate in ventilation which can lead to decreased oxygen content due to ventilation perfusion mismatch special situations emergencies tracheal intubation in emergency setting can be difficult with fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood vomit or secretions in airway and poor patient cooperation because of this patients with massive facial injury complete upper airway obstruction severely diminished ventilation or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals success rates of only 83 87 have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in emergency department with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22 of patients these drawbacks limit use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations personnel experienced in direct laryngoscopy are not always immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation for this reason specialized devices have been designed to act as bridges to a definitive airway such devices include laryngeal mask airway cuffed oropharyngeal airway and esophageal tracheal combitube combitube other devices such as rigid stylets a blind technique and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets such as bullard scope upsher scope and can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks and none of them is effective under all circumstances rapid sequence induction and intubation thumb 400px alt laryngoscopes prepared in an emergency theatre laryngoscopes prepared for emergency anaesthesia rapid sequence induction and intubation rsi is a particular method of induction of general anesthesia commonly employed in emergency operations and other situations where patients are assumed to have a full stomach objective of rsi is to minimize possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during induction of general anesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation rsi traditionally involves lungs with a tightly fitting oxygen mask followed by sequential administration of an intravenous sleep inducing agent and a rapidly acting neuromuscular blocking drug such as or before intubation of trachea one important difference between rsi and routine tracheal intubation is that practitioner does not manually assist ventilation of lungs after onset of general anesthesia and cessation of breathing until trachea has been intubated and cuff has been inflated another key feature of rsi is application of manual cricoid pressure to cricoid cartilage often referred to as sellick maneuver prior to instrumentation of airway and intubation of trachea since introduction of rsi there has been controversy regarding virtually every aspect of this technique including choice of induction drug dose and method of administration avoidance of manual ventilation before tracheal intubation optimal position and whether head up head down or horizontal supine position is safest for induction of anesthesia in full stomach patients application of cricoid pressure sellick maneuver named for british anesthetist brian arthur sellick 1918 1996 who first described procedure in 1961 goal of cricoid pressure is to minimize possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents cricoid pressure has been widely used during rsi for nearly fifty years despite a lack of compelling evidence to support this practice initial article by sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high tidal volumes head down positioning and barbiturate anesthesia were rule beginning around 2000 a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions effectiveness of cricoid pressure application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace esophagus laterally instead of compressing it as described by sellick cricoid pressure may also compress glottis which can obstruct view of laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing airway cricoid pressure is often confused with burp backwards upwards pressure maneuver while both of these involve digital pressure to anterior aspect front of laryngeal apparatus purpose of latter is to improve view of glottis during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation rather than to prevent regurgitation both cricoid pressure and burp maneuver have potential to worsen laryngoscopy rsi may also be used in prehospital emergency situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent such as in extreme trauma this procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics flight paramedics often use rsi to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft is extremely difficult to perform due to environmental factors patient will be paralyzed and intubated on ground before transport by aircraft cricothyrotomy thumb 375px alt in cricothyrotomy incision or puncture is made through cricothyroid membrane in between thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage in cricothyrotomy incision or puncture is made through cricothyroid membrane in between thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage thumb alt cricothyrotomy kit cricothyrotomy kit a cricothyrotomy is an incision made through skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life threatening situations such as airway obstruction by a foreign body angioedema or massive facial trauma a cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy does not require manipulation of cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications easiest method to perform this technique is needle cricothyrotomy also referred to as a percutaneous dilational cricothyrotomy in which a large bore 12 14 gauge intravenous catheter is used to puncture cricothyroid membrane oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via jet insufflation however while needle cricothyrotomy may be life saving in extreme circumstances this technique is only intended to be a measure until a definitive airway can be established while needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation small diameter of cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide ventilation after one hour of oxygenation through a needle cricothyrotomy one can expect a paco2 of greater than 250 mm hg and an arterial ph of less than 6 72 despite an oxygen saturation of 98 or greater a more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy in which a endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision several manufacturers market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits which enable one to use either a wire guided percutaneous dilational seldinger technique or classic surgical technique to insert a catheter through cricothyroid membrane kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites as well as ambulances and other selected pre hospital settings tracheotomy thumb left alt diagram of a tracheostomy tube in trachea diagram of a tracheostomy tube in trachea 1 vocal folds 2 thyroid cartilage 3 cricoid cartilage 4 tracheal rings 5 balloon cuff tracheotomy consists of making an incision on front of neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in trachea resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted this tube allows a person to breathe without use of his nose or mouth opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively and both techniques are widely used in current practice in order to limit risk of damage to recurrent laryngeal nerves nerves that control voicebox tracheotomy is performed as high in trachea as possible if only one of these nerves is damaged patient s voice may be impaired if both of nerves are damaged patient will be unable to speak aphonia in acute setting indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy in chronic setting indications for tracheotomy include need for long term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions e g comatose patients or extensive surgery involving head and neck children thumb alt a premature infant intubated and requiring mechanical ventilation a premature infant weighing 990 grams 35 ounces intubated and requiring mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care unit there are significant differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient differences which are quite significant in infants gradually disappear as human body approaches a mature age and body mass index for infants and young children orotracheal intubation is easier than nasotracheal route nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding despite greater difficulty nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of tube as with adults there are a number of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children confirmation of proper position of tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients because airway of a child is narrow a small amount of glottic or tracheal swelling can produce critical obstruction inserting a tube that is too large relative to diameter of trachea can cause swelling conversely inserting a tube that is too small can result in inability to achieve effective positive pressure ventilation due to retrograde escape of gas through glottis and out mouth and nose often referred to as a leak around tube an excessive leak can usually be corrected by inserting a larger tube or a cuffed tube tip of a correctly positioned tracheal tube will be in mid trachea between on an chest radiograph correct diameter of tube is that which results in a small leak at a pressure of about of water appropriate inner diameter for endotracheal tube is estimated to be roughly same diameter as child s little finger appropriate length for endotracheal tube can be estimated by doubling distance from corner of child s mouth to ear canal for premature infants internal diameter is an appropriate size for tracheal tube for infants of normal gestational age internal diameter is an appropriate size for normally nourished children 1 year of age and older two formulae are used to estimate appropriate diameter and depth for tracheal intubation internal diameter of tube in mm is patient s age in years 16 4 while appropriate depth of insertion cm is 12 patient s age in years 2 newborns in newborns free flow oxygen used to be recommended during intubation however as there is no evidence of benefit 2011 nrp guidelines no longer do predicting difficulty thumb alt a child with a massive ameloblastoma of mandible tracheal intubation is anticipated to be difficult in this child with a massive ameloblastoma tracheal intubation is not a simple procedure and consequences of failure are grave therefore patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand this involves taking medical history of patient and performing a physical examination results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems proposed surgical procedure e g surgery involving head and neck or bariatric surgery may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation many individuals have unusual airway anatomy such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw or those who have tumors deep swelling due to injury or to allergy developmental abnormalities of jaw or excess fatty tissue of face and neck using conventional techniques intubation of trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients this is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing airway use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among preferred techniques in management of such cases however these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase maintain and repair when taking patient s medical history subject is questioned about any significant signs or symptoms such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing these may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within upper airway larynx or tracheobronchial tree a history of previous surgery e g previous cervical fusion injury radiation therapy or tumors involving head neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation previous experiences with tracheal intubation especially difficult intubation intubation for prolonged duration e g intensive care unit or prior tracheotomy are also noted a detailed physical examination of airway is important particularly range of motion of cervical spine subject should be able to tilt head back and then forward so that chin touches chest range of motion of jaw temporomandibular joint three of subject s fingers should be able to fit between upper and lower incisors size and shape of upper jaw and lower jaw looking especially for problems such as maxillary hypoplasia an underdeveloped upper jaw micrognathia an abnormally small jaw or misalignment of upper and lower jaw distance three of subject s fingers should be able to fit between adam s apple and chin size and shape of tongue and palate relative to size of mouth teeth especially noting presence of prominent maxillary incisors any loose or damaged teeth or crowns many classification systems have been developed in an effort to predict difficulty of tracheal intubation including cormack lehane classification system intubation difficulty scale ids and mallampati score mallampati score is drawn from observation that size of base of tongue influences difficulty of intubation it is determined by looking at anatomy of mouth and in particular visibility of base of palatine uvula pillars and soft palate although such medical scoring systems may aid in evaluation of patients no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate furthermore one study of experienced anesthesiologists on widely used cormack lehane classification system found they did not score same patients consistently over time and that only 25 could correctly define all four grades of widely used cormack lehane classification system under certain emergency circumstances e g severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury it may be impossible to fully utilize these physical examination and various classification systems to predict difficulty of tracheal intubation a recent cochrane systematic review examined sensitivity and specificity of various bedside tests commonly used for predicting difficulty in airway management in such cases alternative techniques of securing airway must be readily available complications tracheal intubation is generally considered best method for airway management under a wide variety of circumstances as it provides most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration however tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed four anatomic features must be present for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward adequate mouth opening full range of motion of temporomandibular joint sufficient pharyngeal space determined by examining back of mouth sufficient space distance between thyroid cartilage and chin space into which tongue must be displaced in order for to view glottis and adequate extension of cervical spine at atlanto occipital joint if any of these variables is in any way compromised intubation should be expected to be difficult minor complications are common after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube these are typically of short duration such as sore throat lacerations of lips or gums or other structures within upper airway chipped fractured or dislodged teeth and nasal injury other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat high blood pressure elevated intracranial and pressure and bronchospasm more serious complications include laryngospasm perforation of trachea or esophagus pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents or other foreign bodies fracture or dislocation of cervical spine temporomandibular joint or cartilages decreased oxygen content elevated arterial carbon dioxide and vocal cord weakness in addition to these complications tracheal intubation via nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing incidence of some of these complications though most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill on part of laryngoscopist complications may also be severe and long lasting or permanent such as vocal cord damage esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess bronchial intubation or nerve injury they may even be immediately life threatening such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema fluid in lungs aspiration unrecognized esophageal intubation or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of tracheal tube potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between trachea and nearby structures such as artery fistula or esophagus fistula other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity ventilator associated pneumonia and narrowing of glottis or trachea cuff pressure is monitored carefully in order to avoid complications from over inflation many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting blood supply to tracheal mucosa a 2000 spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10 15 and procedural mortality of 0 which is comparable to those of other series reported in literature from netherlands and united states inability to secure airway with subsequent failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content brain damage cardiovascular collapse and death when performed improperly associated complications e g unrecognized esophageal intubation may be rapidly fatal without adequate training and experience incidence of such complications is high case of andrew davis hughes from emerald isle nc is a widely known case in which patient was improperly intubated and due to lack of oxygen suffered severe brain damage and died for example among paramedics in several united states urban communities unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6 to 25 although not common where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate reported success rates are as low as 51 in one study nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in emergency room because of this recent editions of american heart association s guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation have de emphasized role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag valve mask ventilation laryngeal mask airway and combitube however recent higher quality studies have shown no survival or neurological benefit with endotracheal intubation over airway devices laryngeal mask or combitube one complication unintentional and unrecognized intubation of esophagus is both common as frequent as 25 in hands of inexperienced personnel and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome in such cases oxygen is inadvertently administered to stomach from where it cannot be taken up by circulatory system instead of lungs if this situation is not immediately identified and corrected death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia of 4 460 claims in american society of anesthesiologists asa closed claims project database 266 approximately 6 were for airway injury of these 266 cases 87 of injuries were temporary 5 were permanent or disabling and 8 resulted in death difficult intubation age older than 60 years and female gender were associated with claims for perforation of esophagus or pharynx early signs of perforation were present in only 51 of perforation claims whereas late sequelae occurred in 65 alternatives although it offers greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration tracheal intubation is not only means to maintain a patent airway alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include laryngeal mask airway i gel cuffed oropharyngeal airway continuous positive airway pressure mask nasal mask simple face mask and nasal cannula general anesthesia is often administered without tracheal intubation in selected cases where procedure is brief in duration or procedures where depth of anesthesia is not sufficient to cause significant compromise in ventilatory function even for longer duration or more invasive procedures a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating trachea provided that patients are carefully selected and risk benefit ratio is favorable i e risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than risks of intubating trachea airway management can be classified into closed or open techniques depending on system of ventilation used tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit several open techniques exist such as spontaneous ventilation apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used spontaneous ventilation has been traditionally performed with an inhalational agent i e gas induction or inhalational induction using or sevoflurane however it can also be performed using intravenous anaesthesia e g propofol ketamine or spontaneous respiration using intravenous anaesthesia and high flow nasal oxygen strive hi is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia it has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation history tracheotomy earliest known depiction of a tracheotomy is found on two egyptian tablets dating back to around 3600 bc 110 page ebers papyrus an egyptian medical papyrus which dates to roughly 1550 bc also makes reference to tracheotomy tracheotomy was described in rigveda a sanskrit text of ayurvedic medicine written around 2000 bc in ancient india sushruta samhita from around 400 bc is another text from indian subcontinent on ayurvedic medicine and surgery that mentions tracheotomy asclepiades of bithynia c 124 40 bc is often credited as being first physician to perform a non emergency tracheotomy galen of pergamon ad 129 199 clarified anatomy of trachea and was first to demonstrate that larynx generates voice in one of his experiments galen used bellows to inflate lungs of a dead animal ibn sina 980 1037 described use of tracheal intubation to facilitate breathing in 1025 in his 14 volume medical encyclopedia canon of medicine in 12th century medical textbook al ibn zuhr 1092 1162 also known as of al andalus provided a correct description of tracheotomy operation first detailed descriptions of tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration of animals were from andreas vesalius 1514 1564 of brussels in his landmark book published in 1543 de humani corporis fabrica he described an experiment in which he passed a reed into trachea of a dying animal whose thorax had been opened and maintained ventilation by blowing into reed intermittently antonio musa brassavola 1490 1554 of ferrara successfully treated a patient suffering from peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy brassavola published his account in 1546 this operation has been identified as first recorded successful tracheotomy despite many previous references to this operation towards end of 16th century hieronymus fabricius 1533 1619 described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings although he had never actually performed operation himself in 1620 french surgeon nicholas 1550 1624 published a report of four successful tracheotomies in 1714 anatomist georg 1671 1747 of university of rostock performed a tracheotomy on a drowning victim despite many recorded instances of its use since antiquity it was not until early 19th century that tracheotomy finally began to be recognized as a legitimate means of treating severe airway obstruction in 1852 french physician armand trousseau 1801 1867 presented a series of 169 tracheotomies to academie imperiale de medecine 158 of these were performed for treatment of croup and 11 were performed for chronic maladies of larynx between 1830 and 1855 more than 350 tracheotomies were performed in paris most of them at hopital des enfants a public hospital with an overall survival rate of only 20 25 this compares with 58 of 24 patients in trousseau s private practice who fared better due to greater postoperative care in 1871 german surgeon friedrich trendelenburg 1844 1924 published a paper describing first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for purpose of administration of general anesthesia in 1888 sir morell mackenzie 1837 1892 published a book discussing indications for tracheotomy in early 20th century tracheotomy became a life saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation in 1909 philadelphia laryngologist chevalier jackson 1865 1958 described a technique for tracheotomy that is used to this day laryngoscopy and non surgical techniques thumb alt laryngoscopist performing indirect laryngoscopy on a subject laryngoscopy from garcia 1884 in 1854 a spanish singing teacher named manuel garcia 1805 1906 became first man to view functioning glottis in a living human in 1858 french pediatrician eugene bouchut 1818 1891 developed a new technique for non surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria related in 1880 scottish surgeon william macewen 1848 1924 reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe as well as in setting of general anesthesia with chloroform in 1895 alfred kirstein 1863 1922 of berlin first described direct visualization of vocal cords using an he had modified for this purpose he called this device an in 1913 chevalier jackson was first to report a high rate of success for use of direct laryngoscopy as a means to intubate trachea jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope also in 1913 new york surgeon henry h janeway 1873 1921 published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed another pioneer in this field was sir ivan whiteside magill 1888 1986 who developed technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation magill forceps magill laryngoscope blade and several for administration of volatile anesthetic agents magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for magill sir robert reynolds macintosh 1897 1989 introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943 macintosh blade remains to this day most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation between 1945 and 1952 optical engineers built upon earlier work of rudolph schindler 1888 1968 developing first in 1964 optical fiber technology was applied to one of these early to produce first flexible fiberoptic initially used in upper gi endoscopy this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by peter murphy an english anesthetist in 1967 concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by and in 1978 using a central venous catheter by mid 1980s flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope had become an indispensable instrument within and anesthesia communities digital revolution of 21st century has brought newer technology to art and science of tracheal intubation several manufacturers have developed video laryngoscopes which employ digital technology such as cmos active pixel sensor cmos aps to generate a view of glottis so that trachea may be intubated see also intratracheal instillation notes references external links video of
