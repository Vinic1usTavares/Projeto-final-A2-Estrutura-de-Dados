syco related music acts sponsorship for first series was initially targeted at national lottery operator camelot group but eventually went with jackpotjoy owner gamesys and domino s pizza second series was sponsored by controversial loans site wonga com in week where first series of red or black aired itv gained a much larger audience share than it had in week directly previous where it had been beaten by bbc one on six out of seven nights despite this reviews of first series were universally negative and additional criticism was leveled at show when it was discovered that nathan hageman first winner of ps1m prize had a criminal record sun began a campaign calling for hageman to return money but he was eventually allowed to keep it it did however lead to itv dropping three other contestants from show with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record this was also a major factor in pre recording of series 2 production an initial pilot of show was ordered in 2003 by itv from production company fremantlemedia and was commissioned by claudia rosencrantz who was controller of entertainment at itv at time it was presented by brian conley but was not broadcast a series was not produced rosencrantz spoke of pilot in 2011 i didn t believe people would like to see someone win a vast sum of money with no skills at all involved second gambling is not a spectator sport you get an adrenaline rush from participating in it richard holloway who worked with fremantlemedia at time of producing pilot said it was a novel idea you could win a million pounds eventually i was surprised it didn t go to series rosencrantz left itv in 2006 and there has been a significant turnover in staff since pilot was originally put together show was launched by itv and syco at millennium hotel mayfair london on 3 may 2011 initial recruitment phase for contestants lasted until 13 may updated format was conceived by simon cowell who said that it was inspired by roulette and story of ashley revell who had bet his entire life savings on red in a roulette game in las vegas it is most expensive game show in history costing in region of ps15m at around ps1 5m per episode itv s director of entertainment and comedy elaine bedell was contacted by cowell this being simon this was at 1 30 am but even then it was quite a compelling idea when later talking about ps1m prize on offer each night cowell said it s expensive if you have to give away a million every night but we have insurance for that being a co production between syco tv and itv studios cowell began planning for international versions straight away saying i d love to take it around world i think concept works if it succeeds it will travel we ve got interest in america already some syco managed acts appeared on show including leona lewis on first episode domino s pizza was announced as primary sponsor of show in june 2011 in a deal worth ps1m it had previously been sponsor of britain s got talent

blatant overall moir described show overblown and immoral nonsense jonathan liew of daily telegraph requested that readers stopped watching show whilst describing it as so devoid of intellect that it actually sucks nearby intelligence into its vortex this is without exaggeration or embellishment an stupid television programme readers of com named it worst new game show of 2011 in their hall of shame poll on 26 october 2012 richard osman writing for guardian named red or black among four of uk tv s worst ever during airing of first show twitter users complained that finalist angel mckenzie had made it through as she was previously a housemate during big brother 10 in 2009 however mckenzie s appearance was overshadowed by stories relating to ps1 million winner nathan hageman as it was revealed that he had a criminal background it was initially reported that he had served a five year sentence for breaking into a man s house and assaulting him but it was later revealed by sun that he had in fact been convicted of attacking an ex girlfriend this led to newspaper and labour mp hazel blears calling for hageman to be stripped of his prize money itv had conducted a crb check on each finalist towards end of july over a month prior to first live show when later discussing incident simon cowell said i m not in a position to force anyone to do anything once he got through that s why he got money that s his own conscience what he decides to do with it following media frenzy about details of hageman s offence two contestants that had not yet appeared on show were removed by itv it was revealed that one had failed to disclose that he had a criminal record during application process while information on second contestant was withheld a third contestant was subsequently removed by itv each contestant was from a different night with first removed on programme aired 7 september however footage pre filmed revealed his identity one of three contestants removed ryan keating was later interviewed by people which revealed that he received a 12 month community order and ps50 fine in 2008 after he got into a drunken altercation with his wife he argued that he should not have been removed from show saying that he was honest with them from outset i ve been totally on level they ve stitched me up because they were scared of headlines but it s total double standards people for ethical treatment of animals peta an animal rights group complained after show was found to have spray painted a number of sheep red and black for a sheep herding round at roundhay park in leeds a peta representative told daily star subjecting these shy sensitive animals to long periods of restraint in order to spray them with potentially noxious chemicals will also be stressful and frightening
