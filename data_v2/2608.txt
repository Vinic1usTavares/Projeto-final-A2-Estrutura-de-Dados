thumb 250px mathematics in art albrecht durer s copper plate engraving melencolia i 1514 mathematical references include a compass for geometry a magic square and a truncated while measurement is indicated by scales and hourglass thumb 250px wireframe drawing of a vase as a solid of revolution by paolo uccello 15th century mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music dance painting architecture sculpture and textiles this article focuses however on mathematics in visual arts mathematics and art have a long historical relationship artists have used mathematics since 4th century bc when greek sculptor polykleitos wrote his canon prescribing proportions based on ratio 1 for ideal male nude persistent popular claims have been made for use of golden ratio in ancient art and architecture without reliable evidence in italian renaissance luca pacioli wrote influential treatise de divina proportione 1509 illustrated with woodcuts by leonardo da vinci on use of golden ratio in art another italian painter piero della francesca developed euclid s ideas on perspective in treatises such as de prospectiva pingendi and in his paintings engraver albrecht durer made many references to mathematics in his work melencolia i in modern times graphic artist m c escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry with help of mathematician h s m coxeter while de stijl movement led by theo van doesburg and piet mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting knitting cross stitch crochet embroidery weaving turkish and other carpet making as well as kilim in islamic art symmetries are evident in forms as varied as persian girih and moroccan zellige tilework mughal jali pierced stone screens and widespread muqarnas vaulting mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as linear perspective analysis of symmetry and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and mobius strip magnus wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra originally as models for teaching mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by rene magritte and in engravings by m c escher computer art often makes use of fractals including mandelbrot set and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata controversially artist david hockney has argued that artists from renaissance onwards made use of camera lucida to draw precise representations of scenes architect philip steadman similarly argued that vermeer used camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings other relationships include algorithmic analysis of artworks by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy finding that traditional batiks from different regions of java have distinct fractal dimensions and stimuli to mathematics research especially filippo brunelleschi s theory of perspective which eventually led to girard desargues s projective geometry a persistent view based ultimately on pythagorean notion of harmony in music holds that everything was arranged by number that god is geometer of world and that therefore world s geometry is sacred as seen in artworks such as william blake s ancient of days origins from ancient greece to renaissance polykleitos s canon and symmetria thumb upright 0 6 roman copy in marble of doryphoros originally a bronze by polykleitos polykleitos elder c 450 420 bc was a greek sculptor from school of argos and a contemporary of phidias his works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes according to philosopher and mathematician xenocrates polykleitos is ranked as one of most important sculptors of classical antiquity for his work on and statue of hera in of argos while his sculptures may not be as famous as those of phidias they are much admired in canon of polykleitos a treatise he wrote designed to document perfect anatomical proportions of male nude polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing human body polykleitos uses distal phalanx of little finger as basic module for determining proportions of human body polykleitos multiplies length of distal phalanx by square root of two to get distance of second phalanges and multiplies length again by to get length of third phalanges next he takes finger length and multiplies that by to get length of palm from base of finger to ulna this geometric series of measurements progresses until polykleitos has formed arm chest body and so on influence of canon of polykleitos is immense in classical greek roman and renaissance sculpture many sculptors following polykleitos s prescription while none of polykleitos s original works survive roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision some scholars argue that pythagorean thought influenced canon of polykleitos canon applies basic mathematical concepts of greek geometry such as ratio proportion and symmetria greek for harmonious proportions and turns it into a system capable of describing human form through a series of continuous geometric progressions perspective and proportion thumb brunelleschi s experiment with linear perspective in classical times rather than making distant figures smaller with linear perspective painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance in middle ages some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis muslim mathematician alhazen ibn al haytham described a theory of optics in his book of optics in 1021 but never applied it to art renaissance saw a rebirth of classical greek and roman culture and ideas among them study of mathematics to understand nature and arts two major motives drove artists in late middle ages and renaissance towards mathematics first painters needed to figure out how to depict three dimensional scenes on a two dimensional canvas second philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was true essence of physical world and that entire universe including arts could be explained in geometric terms rudiments of perspective arrived with giotto 1266 7 1337 who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine placement of distant lines in 1415 italian architect filippo brunelleschi and his friend leon battista alberti demonstrated geometrical method of applying perspective in florence using similar triangles as formulated by euclid to find apparent height of distant objects brunelleschi s own perspective paintings are lost but masaccio s painting of holy trinity shows his principles at work thumb left upright 1 2 paolo uccello made innovative use of perspective in battle of san romano c 1435 1460 italian painter paolo uccello 1397 1475 was fascinated by perspective as shown in his paintings of battle of san romano c 1435 1460 broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines painter piero della francesca c 1415 1492 exemplified this new shift in italian renaissance thinking he was an expert mathematician and geometer writing books on solid geometry and perspective including de prospectiva pingendi on perspective for painting d abaco abacus treatise and de on regular solids historian vasari in his lives of painters calls piero greatest geometer of his time or perhaps of any time piero s interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including polyptych of perugia san agostino altarpiece and flagellation of christ his work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including luca pacioli in his de divina proportione and leonardo da vinci piero studied classical mathematics and works of archimedes he was taught commercial arithmetic in abacus schools his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks perhaps including leonardo pisano fibonacci s 1202 liber abaci linear perspective was just being introduced into artistic world alberti explained in his 1435 de pictura light rays travel in straight lines from points in observed scene to eye forming a kind of pyramid with eye as vertex a painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross section of that pyramid in de prospectiva pingendi piero transforms his empirical observations of way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs his treatise starts in vein of euclid he defines point as tiniest thing that is possible for eye to comprehend he uses deductive logic to lead reader to perspective representation of a three dimensional body artist david hockney argued in his book secret knowledge rediscovering lost techniques of old masters that artists started using a camera lucida from 1420s resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism and that this practice was continued by major artists including ingres van eyck and caravaggio critics disagree on whether hockney was correct similarly architect philip steadman argued controversially that vermeer had used a different device camera obscura to help him create his distinctively observed paintings in 1509 luca pacioli c 1447 1517 published de divina proportione on mathematical and artistic proportion including in human face leonardo da vinci 1452 1519 illustrated text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under pacioli in 1490s leonardo s drawings are probably first illustrations of solids these such as rhombicuboctahedron were among first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other work discusses perspective in works of piero della francesca da forli and marco da vinci studied pacioli s summa from which he copied tables of proportions in mona lisa and last supper da vinci s work incorporated linear perspective with a vanishing point to provide apparent depth last supper is constructed in a tight ratio of 12 6 4 3 as is raphael s school of athens which includes pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios sacred to pythagoreans in vitruvian man leonardo expressed ideas of roman architect vitruvius innovatively showing male figure twice and centring him in both a circle and a square as early as 15th century curvilinear perspective found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions jan van eyck s 1434 arnolfini portrait contains a convex mirror with reflections of people in scene while parmigianino s self portrait in a convex mirror c 1523 1524 shows artist s largely undistorted face at centre with a strongly curved background and artist s hand around edge three dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art as in technical drawing by means other than perspective oblique projections including cavalier perspective used by french military artists to depict fortifications in 18th century were used continuously and ubiquitously by chinese artists from first or second centuries until 18th century chinese acquired technique from india which acquired it from ancient rome oblique projection is seen in japanese art such as in ukiyo e paintings of torii kiyonaga 1752 1815 golden ratio golden ratio roughly equal to 1 618 was known to euclid golden ratio has persistently been claimed in modern times to have been used in art and architecture by ancients in egypt greece and elsewhere without reliable evidence claim may derive from confusion with golden mean which to ancient greeks meant avoidance of excess in either direction not a ratio pyramidologists since nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for golden ratio in pyramid design parthenon a 5th century bc temple in athens has been claimed to use golden ratio in its facade and floor plan but these claims too are disproved by measurement great mosque of kairouan in tunisia has similarly been claimed to use golden ratio in its design but ratio does not appear in original parts of mosque historian of architecture frederik lund argued in 1919 that cathedral of chartres 12th century notre dame of laon 1157 1205 and notre dame de paris 1160 are designed according to golden ratio drawing regulator lines to make his case other scholars argue that until pacioli s work in 1509 golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects for example height and width of front of notre dame of laon have ratio 8 5 or 1 6 not 1 618 such fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from golden ratio after pacioli golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including leonardo s mona lisa another ratio only other number was named plastic number in 1928 by dutch architect hans van der laan originally named le nombre radiant in french its value is solution of cubic equation an irrational number which is approximately 1 325 according to architect richard this has characteristic ratios and which govern limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another van der laan used these ratios when designing 1967 st abbey church in netherlands planar symmetries thumb upright left powerful presence carpet with double medallion central anatolia konya turn of 16th 17th centuries alaeddin mosque planar symmetries have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as carpets lattices textiles and tilings many traditional rugs whether pile carpets or kilims are divided into a central field and a framing border both can have symmetries though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by weaver in kilims from anatolia motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical general layout too is usually present with arrangements such as stripes stripes alternating with rows of motifs and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm while border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group or turkish and central asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups weavers certainly had intention of symmetry without explicit knowledge of its mathematics mathematician and architectural theorist nikos salingaros suggests that powerful presence aesthetic effect of a great carpet such as best konya two medallion carpets of 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to theories of architect christopher alexander these techniques include making opposites couple opposing colour values differentiating areas geometrically whether by using complementary shapes or balancing directionality of sharp angles providing small scale complexity from knot level upwards and both small and large scale symmetry repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales with a ratio of about 2 7 from each level to next salingaros argues that all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of above ten rules and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules reprinted in elaborate lattices are found in indian jali work carved in marble to adorn tombs and palaces chinese lattices always with some symmetry exist in 14 of 17 wallpaper groups they often have mirror double mirror or rotational symmetry some have a central medallion and some have a border in a frieze group many chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by daniel s dye he identifies sichuan as centre of craft thumb upright girih tiles symmetries are prominent in textile arts including quilting knitting cross stitch crochet barbara florentine embroidery scribner second edition 1967 williams elsa s florentine canvas work van nostrand reinhold 1967 and weaving where they may be purely decorative or may be marks of status rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out as at 1619 sheikh lotfollah mosque in isfahan items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats made using or by can have a wide variety of and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically islamic art exploits symmetries in many of its artforms notably in girih tilings these are formed using a set of five tile shapes namely a regular decagon an elongated hexagon a bow tie a rhombus and a regular pentagon all sides of these tiles have same length and all their angles are multiples of 36deg p 5 radians offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries tiles are decorated with strapwork lines girih generally more visible than tile boundaries in 2007 physicists peter lu and paul steinhardt argued that girih resembled penrose tilings elaborate geometric zellige tilework is a distinctive element in moroccan architecture muqarnas vaults are three dimensional but were designed in two dimensions with drawings of geometrical cells polyhedra thumb first printed illustration of a rhombicuboctahedron by leonardo da vinci published in de divina proportione 1509 platonic solids and other polyhedra are a recurring theme in western art they are found for instance in a marble mosaic featuring small stellated dodecahedron attributed to paolo uccello in floor of san marco basilica in venice in leonardo da vinci s diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for luca pacioli s 1509 book divine proportion as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in jacopo de barbari s portrait of pacioli painted in 1495 in truncated polyhedron and various other mathematical objects in albrecht durer s engraving melencolia i and in salvador dali s painting last supper in which christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron albrecht durer 1471 1528 was a german renaissance printmaker who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book underweysung der messung education on measurement meant to teach subjects of linear perspective geometry in architecture platonic solids and regular polygons durer was likely influenced by works of luca pacioli and piero della francesca during his trips to italy while examples of perspective in underweysung der messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra durer is also first to introduce in text idea of polyhedral nets polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing durer published another influential book on human proportions called vier bucher von proportion four books on human proportion in 1528 thumb upright salvador dali s crucifixion corpus hypercubus 1954 depicts christ upon mathematical net of a hypercube oil on

a frustrated thinker sitting by a truncated triangular and a magic square these two objects and engraving as a whole have been subject of more modern interpretation than contents of almost any other print including a two volume book by peter klaus schuster and an influential discussion in erwin panofsky s monograph of durer salvador dali s corpus hypercubus depicts an unfolded three dimensional net for a hypercube also known as a tesseract unfolding of a tesseract into these eight cubes is analogous to unfolding sides of a cube into a cross shape of six squares here representing divine perspective with a four dimensional regular polyhedron fractal dimensions thumb batiks from surakarta java like this parang sword pattern have a fractal dimension between 1 2 and 1 5 traditional indonesian wax resist batik designs on cloth combine representational motifs such as floral and vegetal elements with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements including imprecision in applying wax resist and random variation introduced by cracking of wax batik designs have a fractal dimension between 1 and 2 varying in different regional styles for example batik of cirebon has a fractal

1 72 a complex relationship astronomer galileo galilei in his il saggiatore wrote that universe is written in language of mathematics and its characters are triangles circles and other geometric figures as translated in artists who strive and seek to study nature must first in galileo s view fully understand mathematics mathematicians conversely have sought to interpret and analyse art through lens of geometry and rationality mathematician felipe suggests that mathematics and especially geometry is a source of rules for rule driven artistic creation though not only one some of many strands of resulting complex relationship are described below thumb upright mathematician g h hardy defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty mathematics as an art mathematician jerry p king describes mathematics as an art stating that keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality and that beauty is motivating force for mathematical research king cites mathematician g h hardy s 1940 essay a mathematician s apology in it hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate namely euclid s proof there are infinitely many prime numbers and proof that square root of 2 is irrational king evaluates this last against hardy s criteria for mathematical elegance seriousness depth generality inevitability and economy king s italics and describes proof as aesthetically pleasing hungarian mathematician paul erdos agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered reasons beyond explanation why are numbers beautiful it s like asking why is beethoven s ninth symphony beautiful if you don t see why someone can t tell you i know numbers are beautiful mathematical tools for art mathematics can be discerned in many of arts such as music dance painting architecture and sculpture each of these is richly associated with mathematics among connections to visual arts mathematics can provide tools for artists such as rules of linear perspective as described by brook taylor and johann lambert or methods of descriptive geometry now applied in software modelling of solids dating back to albrecht durer and gaspard monge artists from luca pacioli in middle ages and leonardo da vinci and albrecht durer in renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in pursuit of their artistic work use of perspective began despite some embryonic usages in architecture of ancient greece with italian painters such as giotto in 13th century rules such as vanishing point were first formulated by brunelleschi in about 1413 his theory influencing leonardo and durer isaac newton s work on optical spectrum influenced goethe s theory of colours and in turn artists such as philipp otto runge j m w turner pre raphaelites and wassily kandinsky artists may also choose to analyse symmetry of a scene tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art or artists inspired by mathematics such as m c escher inspired by h s m coxeter and architect frank gehry who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way thumb by mikael hvidtfeldt christensen algorithmic art produced with software structure synth artist richard wright argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either as processes to simulate phenomena or as works of computer art he considers nature of mathematical thought observing that fractals were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to come to terms with cultural artifacts like art tension between objectivity and subjectivity their metaphorical meanings and character of representational systems he gives as instances an image from mandelbrot set an image generated by a cellular automaton algorithm and a computer rendered image and discusses with reference to turing test whether algorithmic products can be art s math and art an introduction to visual mathematics takes a similar approach looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings fractals and hyperbolic geometry some of first works of computer art were created by desmond paul henry s drawing machine 1 an analogue machine based on a bombsight computer and exhibited in 1962 in beddard 2015 machine was capable of creating complex abstract asymmetrical curvilinear but repetitive line drawings in beddard 2015 more recently hamid has created shapes suggestive of real world objects such as fish and birds using formulae that are successively varied to draw families of curves or angled lines artists such as mikael hvidtfeldt christensen create works of generative or algorithmic art by writing scripts for a software system such as structure synth artist effectively directs system to apply a desired combination of mathematical operations to a chosen set of data this includes a link to from mathematics to art thumb upright proto cubism pablo picasso s 1907 painting les demoiselles d avignon uses a fourth dimension projection to show a figure both full face and in profile mathematician and theoretical physicist henri poincare s science and hypothesis was widely read by cubists including pablo picasso and jean metzinger poincare viewed euclidean geometry as just one of many possible geometric configurations rather than as an absolute objective truth possible existence of a fourth dimension inspired artists to question classical renaissance perspective non euclidean geometry became a valid alternative concept that painting could be expressed mathematically in colour and form contributed to cubism art movement that led to abstract art metzinger in 1910 wrote that picasso lays out a free mobile perspective from which that ingenious mathematician maurice princet has deduced a whole geometry in later metzinger wrote in his memoirs maurice princet joined us often it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics as an aesthetician that he invoked n dimensional he loved to get artists interested in new views on space that had been opened up by schlegel and some others he succeeded at that in impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes some of these have inspired artists such as man ray marcel duchamp and max ernst and following man ray hiroshi sugimoto thumb upright left enneper surfaces as dadaism man ray s 1934 objet mathematique man ray photographed some of mathematical models in institut henri poincare in paris including objet mathematique mathematical object he noted that this represented enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature derived from pseudo sphere this mathematical foundation was important to him as it allowed him to deny that object was abstract instead claiming that it was as real as urinal that duchamp made into a work of art man ray admitted that object s enneper surface formula meant nothing to me but forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature he used his photographs of mathematical models as figures in his series he did on shakespeare s plays such as his 1934 painting antony and cleopatra art reporter jonathan keats writing in argues that man ray photographed elliptic and conic points in same sensual light as his pictures of kiki de montparnasse and ingeniously repurposes cool calculations of mathematics to reveal topology of desire twentieth century sculptors such as henry moore barbara hepworth and naum gabo took inspiration from mathematical models moore wrote of his 1938 stringed mother and child undoubtedly source of my stringed figures was science museum i was fascinated by mathematical models i saw there it wasn t scientific study of these models but ability to look through strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me thumb upright 0 4 theo van doesburg s six moments in development of plane to space 1926 or 1929 artists theo van doesburg and piet mondrian founded de stijl movement which they wanted to establish a visual vocabulary elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles sometimes also with circles de stijl artists worked in painting furniture interior design and architecture after breakup of de stijl van doesburg founded avant garde art movement describing his 1929 1930 arithmetic composition a series of four black squares on diagonal of a squared background as a structure that can be controlled a definite surface without chance elements or individual caprice yet not lacking in spirit not lacking universal and not empty as there is everything which fits internal rhythm art critic gladys fabre observes that two progressions are at work in painting namely growing black squares and alternating backgrounds mathematics of tessellation polyhedra shaping of space and self reference provided graphic artist m c escher 1898 1972 with a lifetime s worth of materials for his woodcuts in alhambra sketch escher showed that art can be created with polygons or regular shapes such as triangles squares and hexagons escher used irregular polygons when tiling plane and often used reflections glide reflections and translations to obtain further patterns many of his works contain impossible constructions made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions but are pleasant to human sight escher s ascending and descending is based on impossible staircase created by medical scientist lionel penrose and his son mathematician roger penrose some of escher s many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with mathematician h s m coxeter on hyperbolic geometry escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra which appear many times in his work platonic solids cubes and are especially prominent in order and chaos and four regular solids these stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts viewing angle and conformation of and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks stewart coffin makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods george w hart works on theory of polyhedra and objects inspired by them magnus wenninger makes especially beautiful models of complex stellated polyhedra distorted perspectives of have been explored in art since sixteenth century when hans holbein younger incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ambassadors many artists since then including escher have make use of anamorphic tricks mathematics of topology has inspired several artists in modern times sculptor john robinson 1935 2007 created works such as gordian knot and bands of friendship displaying knot theory in polished bronze other works by robinson explore topology of genesis is based on rings a set of three circles no two of which link but in which whole structure cannot be taken apart without breaking sculptor ferguson creates complex surfaces and other topological objects his works are visual representations of mathematical objects eightfold way is based on projective special linear group psl 2 7 a finite group of 168 elements sculptor bathsheba grossman similarly bases her work on mathematical structures a liberal arts inquiry project examines connections between mathematics and art through mobius strip origami and panorama photography mathematical objects including lorenz manifold and hyperbolic plane have been crafted using fiber arts including crochet american weaver ada dietz wrote a 1949 monograph algebraic expressions in handwoven textiles defining weaving patterns based on expansion of multivariate polynomials mathematician demonstrated features of hyperbolic plane by crocheting in 2001 this led margaret and christine wertheim to crochet a coral reef consisting of many marine animals such as nudibranchs whose shapes are based on hyperbolic planes mathematician j c p miller used rule 90 cellular automaton to design tapestries depicting both trees

cardinal stefaneschi holding up triptych as an offering giorgio chirico s metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 great metaphysical interior explore question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings art can exemplify logical paradoxes as in some paintings by surrealist rene magritte which can be read as semiotic jokes about confusion between levels in la condition humaine 1933 magritte depicts an easel on real canvas seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by real curtains in painting similarly escher s print gallery 1956 is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which recursively contains picture and so ad infinitum magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 mental arithmetic as if they were children s building blocks but house sized guardian observed that eerie image prophesied modernism s usurpation of cosy traditional forms but also plays with human tendency to seek patterns in nature thumb diagram of apparent paradox embodied in m c escher s 1956 lithograph print gallery as discussed by douglas hofstadter in his 1980 book godel escher bach salvador dali s last painting swallow s tail 1983 was part of a series inspired by rene thom s catastrophe theory spanish painter and sculptor pablo palazuelo 1916 2007 focused on investigation of form he developed a style that he described as geometry of life and geometry of all nature consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring in works such as angular i and palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations artist adrian gray practises stone balancing exploiting friction and centre of gravity to create striking and seemingly impossible compositions thumb upright lithograph print gallery by m c escher 1956 artists however do not necessarily take geometry literally as douglas hofstadter writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought godel escher bach by way of among other things mathematics of art difference between an escher drawing and non euclidean geometry is that in latter comprehensible interpretations can be found for undefined terms resulting in a comprehensible total system whereas for former end result is not reconcilable with one s conception of world no matter how long one stares at pictures hofstadter discusses seemingly paradoxical lithograph print gallery by m c escher it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of seaside town there being a strange loop or tangled hierarchy to levels of reality in image artist himself hofstadter observes is not seen his reality and his relation to lithograph are not paradoxical image s central void has also attracted interest of mathematicians bart de smit and hendrik who propose that it could contain a droste effect copy of itself rotated and shrunk this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by hofstadter analysis of art history algorithmic analysis of images of artworks for example using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy can reveal information about art such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded help to tell a copy from an original or distinguish brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices thumb upright max ernst making lissajous figures new york 1942 jackson pollock s drip painting style has a definite fractal dimension among artists who may have influenced pollock s controlled chaos max ernst painted lissajous figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas computer scientist neil dodgson investigated whether bridget riley s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically concluding that while separation distance could provide some characterisation and global entropy worked on some paintings failed as riley s patterns were irregular local entropy worked best and correlated well with description given by art critic robert american mathematician george birkhoff s 1933 aesthetic measure proposes a quantitative metric of aesthetic quality of an artwork it does not attempt to measure connotations of a work such as what a painting might mean but is limited to elements of order of a polygonal figure birkhoff first combines as a sum five such elements whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry whether there is optical equilibrium how many rotational symmetries it has how wallpaper like figure is and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together this metric o takes a value between 3 and 7 second metric c counts elements of figure which for a polygon is number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object s beauty as o c this can be interpreted as a balance between pleasure looking at object gives and amount of effort needed to take it in birkhoff s proposal has been criticized in various ways not least for trying to put beauty in a formula but he never claimed to have done that stimuli to mathematical research art has sometimes stimulated development of mathematics as when brunelleschi s theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to work of brook taylor and johann heinrich lambert on mathematical foundations of perspective drawing and ultimately to mathematics of projective geometry of girard desargues and jean victor poncelet japanese paper folding art of origami has been reworked mathematically by tomoko fuse using modules congruent pieces of paper such as squares and making them into polyhedra or tilings paper folding was used in 1893 by t sundara rao in his geometric exercises in paper folding to demonstrate geometrical proofs mathematics of paper folding has been explored in maekawa s theorem kawasaki s theorem and axioms illusion to op art thumb upright fraser spiral illusion named for sir james fraser who discovered it in 1908 optical illusions such as fraser spiral strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception creating what art historian ernst gombrich called a baffling trick black and white ropes that appear to form spirals are in fact concentric circles mid twentieth century op art or optical art style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in work of artists such as bridget riley spyros and victor sacred geometry a strand of art from ancient greece onwards sees god as geometer of world and world s geometry therefore as sacred belief that god created universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins plutarch attributed belief to plato writing that plato said god continually liber 8 2 this image has influenced western thought ever since platonic concept derived in its turn from a pythagorean notion of harmony in music where notes were spaced in perfect proportions corresponding to lengths of lyre s strings indeed pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by number in same way in platonic thought regular or platonic solids dictate proportions found in nature and in art a mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in old testament when he established heavens i was there when he set a compass upon face of deep proverbs 8 27 showing god drawing out universe with a pair of compasses in 1596 mathematical astronomer johannes kepler modelled universe as a set of nested platonic solids determining relative sizes of orbits of planets william blake s ancient of
