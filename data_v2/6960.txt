though dent was forced to return home due to ill health leaving fox and donkin to attempt climb along with two swiss guides their initial plan was to climb a glacier on northern slopes of mountain and then make their final ascent on western side however a rock wall on western slopes prevented this and they changed their plans to attack mountain from east they planned to meet up with their outfitter to south east of mountain but after they missed that meeting a message was sent back to dent reporting climbers missing times reported on 6 october that donkin and fox along with their guides had suffered a mountaineering accident that had led to almost certain loss of four lives multiple searches were carried out including one on direct order of tsar alexander iii but no evidence was found russians did recover items from climbers base camp including fox s diary russian authorities possibly for political reasons claimed that climbing party may have probably strayed into georgia and may have been murdered by local population who had rebelled against russians not long before in 1889 dent and douglas led an expedition to search area although they were unable to find any remains they did discover a bivouac at around on pass between two glaciers they recovered a number of personal items from camp but found that light climbing gear rope ice axes and a camera were missing search party concluded that donkin and fox had continued their climb intending to return to bivouac but had fallen while navigating a narrow ridge higher up mountain such a fall would have been thousands of feet and winter snow would have covered climbers bodies so despite conducting a search of valley floor no bodies were recovered for purposes of his will fox s death was recorded as being on or since
