midazolam marketed under trade name versed among others is a benzodiazepine medication used for anesthesia procedural sedation trouble sleeping and severe agitation it works by inducing sleepiness decreasing anxiety and causing a loss of ability to create new memories it is also useful for treatment of seizures midazolam can be given by mouth intravenously or injection into a muscle by spraying into nose or through cheek when given intravenously it typically begins working within five minutes when injected into a muscle it can take fifteen minutes to begin working effects last for between one and six hours side effects can include a decrease in efforts to breathe low blood pressure and sleepiness tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long term use paradoxical effects such as increased activity can occur especially in children and older people there is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during breastfeeding it belongs to benzodiazepine class of drugs and works by increasing activity of gaba neurotransmitter in brain midazolam was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1982 it is on world health organization s list of essential medicines most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system midazolam is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive wholesale cost in developing world of a vial is about us 0 35 in many countries it is a controlled substance medical uses seizures midazolam is sometimes used for acute management of seizures long term use for management of epilepsy is not recommended due to significant risk of tolerance which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective and significant side effect of sedation a benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be given in cheek or in nose for acute seizures including status epilepticus midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained and has advantages of being water soluble having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from propylene glycol vehicle which occurs with other benzodiazepines drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures due to short half life of midazolam in over 50 of people treated as well as treatment failure in 14 18 of people with refractory status epilepticus tolerance develops rapidly to anticonvulsant effect and dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects with prolonged use tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and elimination half life may increase up to days there is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in emergency control of seizures procedural sedation intravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation often in combination with an opioid such as fentanyl for sedation for induction of general anesthesia and for sedation of people who are ventilated in critical care units midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory impairing effect it is most popular benzodiazepine in intensive care unit icu because of its short elimination half life combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion however for long term sedation lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in icu for sedation such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation midazolam is sometimes used in neonatal intensive care units when used additional caution is required in newborns midazolam should not be used for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis and possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome as well as neurological complications bolus injections should be avoided due to increased risk of cardiovascular depression as well as neurological complications midazolam is also sometimes used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation although morphine is preferred owing to its better safety profile for this indication agitation midazolam in combination with an antipsychotic drug is indicated for acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with aggressive or out of control behaviour end of life care in final stages of end of life care midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation myoclonus restlessness or anxiety in last hours or days of life at higher doses during last weeks of life midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments but need for this is rare i n their last 24 hours 31 had low doses of medication to control distress from agitation or restlessness remaining 4 required higher doses contraindications benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in elderly during pregnancy in children in alcohol or other drug dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders additional caution is required in critically ill patients as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur kidney or liver impairments may slow down elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects contraindications include hypersensitivity acute narrow angle glaucoma shock hypotension or head injury most are relative contraindications side effects thumb alt two 10 ml bottles labeled midazolam bottle on left has a label in red and says 1 mg ml one on right is in green and says 5 mg ml both bottles have much fine print injectable midazolam in 1 and 5 mg ml strengths side effects of midazolam in elderly are listed above people experiencing amnesia as a side effect of midazolam are generally unaware their memory is impaired unless they had previously known it as a side effect long term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with long lasting deficits of memory and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines it is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines including a worsening of seizures children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects paradoxical reactions are particularly associated with intravenous administration after nighttime administration of midazolam residual hangover effects such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into next day this may impair ability of users to drive safely and may increase risk of falls and hip fractures sedation respiratory depression and hypotension due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance and an increase in heart rate can occur if intravenous midazolam is given too quickly hypotension may occur a midazolam infusion syndrome may result from high doses and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam and may lead to an increase in length of ventilatory support needed in susceptible individuals midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction a well documented complication with benzodiazepines when this occurs individual may experience anxiety involuntary movements aggressive or violent behavior uncontrollable crying or verbalization and other similar effects this seems to be related to altered state of consciousness or disinhibition produced by drug paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by patient due to amnesia producing properties of drug in extreme situations flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse effects of midazolam antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol have also been used for this purpose midazolam is known to cause respiratory depression in healthy humans 0 15 mg kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression which is postulated to be a central nervous system cns effect when midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely although incidence of respiratory depression arrest is low 0 1 0 5 when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses concomitant use with cns acting drugs mainly analgesic opiates may increase possibility of hypotension respiratory depression respiratory arrest and death even at therapeutic doses potential drug interactions involving at least one cns depressant were observed for 84 of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil therefore efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration are expected to have a substantial impact on safe use of this drug pregnancy and breastfeeding midazolam when taken during third trimester of pregnancy may cause risk to neonate including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome with possible symptoms including hypotonia apnoeic spells cyanosis and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress symptoms of hypotonia and neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability tremor and gastrointestinal upset diarrhea or vomiting breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended elderly additional caution is required in elderly as they are more sensitive to pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines metabolise them more slowly and are more prone to adverse effects including drowsiness amnesia especially anterograde amnesia ataxia hangover effects confusion and falls tolerance dependence and withdrawal a benzodiazepine dependence occurs in about one third of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when dose is reduced too rapidly midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome in a matter of days risk factors for dependence include dependent personality use of a benzodiazepine that is short acting high potency and long term use of benzodiazepines withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person s underlying condition gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects tolerance and resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down regulation and gabaa receptor alterations in gene expression which causes long term changes in function of gabaergic neuronal system chronic users of benzodiazepine medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam due to tolerance to benzodiazepines prolonged infusions with midazolam results in development of tolerance if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur therefore preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn and sometimes continued tapering of dose with an oral long acting benzodiazepine such as dipotassium when signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended withdrawal symptoms can include irritability abnormal reflexes tremors hypertonicity delirium and seizures nausea vomiting diarrhea tachycardia hypertension and in those with significant dependence sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal overdose a midazolam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires immediate attention of medical personnel benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life threatening with proper medical support however toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other cns depressants such as alcohol opioids or tricyclic antidepressants toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously treatment is supportive activated charcoal can be used within an hour of overdose antidote for an overdose of midazolam or any other benzodiazepine is flumazenil while effective in reversing effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals symptoms of midazolam overdose can include ataxia dysarthria nystagmus slurred speech somnolence difficulty staying awake mental confusion hypotension respiratory arrest vasomotor collapse impaired motor functions impaired reflexes impaired coordination impaired balance dizziness coma death detection in body fluids concentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite 1 hydroxymidazolam glucuronide may be measured in plasma serum or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving drug therapeutically to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half life for both parent drug and its active metabolite with accumulation of these two substances in bloodstream and appearance of adverse depressant effects interactions protease inhibitors sertraline grapefruit fluoxetine erythromycin clarithromycin inhibit metabolism of midazolam leading to a prolonged action st john s wort phenytoin enhance metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action sedating antidepressants antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital phenytoin and carbamazepine sedative antihistamines opioids antipsychotics and alcohol enhance sedative effects of midazolam midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome p450 3a4 atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam st john s wort decreases blood levels of midazolam grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3a4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations pharmacology midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine in adults with an elimination half life of 1 5 2 5 hours in elderly as well as young children and adolescents elimination half life is longer midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite hydroxymidazolam age related deficits renal and liver status affect factors of midazolam as well as its active metabolite however active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam midazolam is poorly absorbed orally with only 50 percent of drug reaching bloodstream midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome p450 cyp enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on gaba receptors midazolam does not activate gaba receptors directly but as with other benzodiazepines it enhances effect of neurotransmitter gaba on gaba receptors frequency of cl channel opening resulting in neural inhibition almost all of properties can be explained by actions of benzodiazepines on gaba receptors this results in following pharmacological properties being produced sedation induction of sleep reduction in anxiety anterograde amnesia muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects history midazolam is among about 35 benzodiazepines currently used medically and was synthesized in 1975 by walser and fryer at hoffmann laroche inc in united states armin walser rodney i fryer louis benjamin 1 5 alpha 1 4 benzodiazepines us patent issued to hoffmann laroche aug 28 1979 owing to its water solubility it was found to be less likely to cause than similar drugs anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in late 1970s but not until 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus it is most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine in acute medicine midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam because it is shorter lasting is more potent and causes less pain at injection site midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility in 2018 it was revealed cia considered using midazolam as a truth serum on terrorist suspects in project medication

of midazolam sold under trade name buccolam buccolam was approved for treatment of prolonged acute convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age this was first application of a paediatric use marketing authorisation use in executions thumb oklahoma state penitentiary site of state of oklahoma s execution chamber drug has been introduced for use in executions by lethal injection in certain jurisdictions in united states in combination with other drugs it was introduced to replace pentobarbital after latter s manufacturer disallowed that drug s use for executions midazolam has been used as part of a three drug cocktail with vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride in florida and oklahoma prisons midazolam has also been used along with in a two drug protocol in ohio and arizona ohio used midazolam in execution of dennis mcguire in january 2014 it took mcguire 24 minutes to die after procedure started and he gasped and appeared to be choking during that time leading to questions about dosing and timing of drug administration as well as choice of drugs in october 2016 u s state of ohio announced that it would resume executions in january 2017 using midazolam vecuronium bromide potassium chloride cocktail but this was blocked by a federal judge on 25 july 2017 ronald phillips was executed with a three drug cocktail including midazolam after supreme court refused to grant a stay prior to this last execution in ohio had been that of dennis mcguire murderer gary otte s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his ohio execution arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when other drugs are administered he died without incident in about 14 minutes on september 13 2017 state of nevada is also known to use midazolam in execution procedures in july 2018 one of manufacturers accused state officials of obtaining medication under false pretenses this resulted in first time a drug company successfully though temporarily halted an execution a previous attempt in 2017 to halt an execution in state of arizona by another drug manufacturer was not successful midazolam acts as a sedative to render condemned prisoner unconscious at which time vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered stopping prisoner s breathing and heart respectively florida used midazolam to execute william happ in october 2013 usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate clayton lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when state of oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three drug lethal injection cocktail using 100 mg of midazolam prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead of a heart attack 40 minutes after execution began an observing doctor stated that lockett s vein had ruptured it is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before execution was cancelled in v gross attorneys for three oklahoma inmates argued that midazolam could not achieve level of unconsciousness required for surgery meaning severe pain and suffering was likely they argued that midazolam was cruel and unusual punishment and thus contrary to eighth amendment to united states constitution in june 2015 u s supreme court ruled they failed to prove that midazolam was cruel and unusual when compared to known available alternatives execution of ronald bert smith in alabama on december 8 2016 went awry soon after midazolam was administered again putting effectiveness of drug in question on april 24 2017 arkansas carried out a double execution of jack jones 52 and marcel williams 46 state of arkansas attempted to execute eight people before its supply of midazolam expired on april 30 2017 two of them were granted a stay of execution and another t lee 51 was executed
