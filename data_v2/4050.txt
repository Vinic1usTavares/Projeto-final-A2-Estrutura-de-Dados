cleanup efforts in 2002 ground was broken on construction of a new 7 world trade center building located just to north of main world trade center site since it was not part of site master plan rebuilding of 7 world trade center was allowed to proceed without delay but silverstein and con edison recognized that rebuilding of tower would have to be consistent with master plan anyway it called for reopening several streets that had been eliminated in original complex so new 7 world trade center was designed so greenwich street which had been blocked by original 7 world trade center could be continuous through new complex a temporary path station at world trade center opened in pending replacement by a permanent station designed by santiago calatrava planning in months following attacks architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding site outgoing mayor giuliani advocated for a soaring memorial to be only thing at world trade center site during his final speech as mayor meanwhile larry silverstein wanted to construct a new world trade center as soon as possible insurance documents for his lease on old world trade center had not been finalized at time of attacks so he could not receive insurance benefits from attacks unless he rebuilt all office space that had been destroyed george pataki then governor of new york controlled port authority alongside governor of new jersey and so was entitled to make final decision regarding site he wished to balance desires of people like giuliani who did not want any future development on site with those of people like silverstein who wanted a new world trade center as soon as possible in january 2002 new york city art dealer max solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects which were put on exhibit in his art gallery in chelsea with world trade center site numerous stakeholders were involved including silverstein and port authority in addition victims families people in surrounding neighborhoods and others wanted input in november 2001 governor pataki established lower manhattan development corporation lmdc as an official commission to oversee rebuilding process in order to bypass approval of new york state assembly pataki left out sheldon silver state assemblyman for area from decision making process regarding lmdc lmdc coordinated federal assistance in rebuilding process and was tasked with working with port authority larry silverstein and whoever was selected as site s architects corporation also handled communication with local community businesses city of new york and relatives of victims of september 11 attacks a 16 member board of directors half appointed by governor and half by mayor of new york governed lmdc lmdc had questionable legal status regarding restoration of world trade center site because port authority owned most of property and larry silverstein had legal right to redevelop world trade center however lmdc in an april 2002 articulation of its principles for action asserted its role in revitalizing lower manhattan in april 2002 lmdc sent out requests for proposals to redesign world trade center site to 24 manhattan architecture firms but then soon withdrew them following month lmdc selected beyer blinder belle as planner for redesign of world trade center site new 7 world trade center which was not part of new plan began construction on may 7 2002 on july 16 2002 beyer blinder belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning world trade center site roughly 5 000 new yorkers that submitted feedback deemed all six designs to be poor so announced a new international open design study in an august 2002 press release lmdc announced a design study for world trade center site following month lmdc along with new york new visions a coalition of 21 architecture engineering planning landscape architecture and design organizations announced seven semifinalists these architecture firms were then invited to compete to be master plan architect for world trade center foster and partners norman foster studio daniel libeskind daniel libeskind meier eisenman gwathmey holl peter eisenman

consultant and was invited to participate as seventh semifinalist seven semifinalists presented their entries to public on december 18 2002 at winter garden of world financial center due to large public interest ny1 broadcast presentations on live tv in following weeks skidmore owings merrill withdrew its entry from competition days before announcement of two finalists in february 2003 larry silverstein wrote to lmdc chair john whitehead to express his disapproval of all of semifinalists designs as twin towers insurance money recipient silverstein claimed that he had sole right to decide what would be built he announced that he had already picked skidmore owings merrill as his master planner for site on february 1 2003 lmdc selected two finalists think team and studio daniel libeskind and planned on picking a single winner by end of month rafael vinoly of think team and studio daniel libeskind presented their designs to lmdc which selected former design earlier same day however roland betts a member of lmdc had called a meeting and corporation had agreed to vote for think design before hearing final presentations governor pataki who had originally commissioned lmdc intervened and overruled lmdc s decision on february 27 2003 studio daniel libeskind officially won competition to be master planner for world trade center redesign libeskind s original proposal titled memory foundations underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with larry silverstein as well as from skidmore owings merrill whom silverstein hired plan was anchored by one world trade center and featured a memorial and a number of other office towers out of world trade center site memorial competition a design by michael arad and peter walker titled reflecting absence was selected in though libeskind designed site individual buildings have been designed by different architects while not all of liebeskind s ideas were incorporated into final design his design and public support it garnered did solidify principle that original footprints of twin towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes as a result liebeskind s lawyers at new york firm of wachtell lipton embarked on multi year negotiation process to frame a master plan for rebuilding first step in this process completed in 2003 was swap in which silverstein gave up his rights to footprints of twin towers so that they could become a memorial and in exchange received right to build five new office towers around memorial swap and ensuing negotiations which lasted for many years have been referred to as most complex real estate transaction in human history because of complexity of issues involved many stakeholders and difficulty of reaching consensus controversy and criticism there was much debate regarding future of ground zero following destruction of world trade center disagreement and controversy regarding who owned property and what would be built there hindered construction at site for several years many wanted twin towers to be rebuilt but at a taller height than before project for new twin towers was called twin towers ii which was led by an informal organization called twin towers alliance others did not want anything built there at all or wanted entire site to become a memorial finally a master plan was agreed upon which would feature a memorial and museum where original twin towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it social center of old world trade center included a spectacular restaurant on 107th floor called windows on world and its greatest bar in world these were tourist attractions in their own right and a social gathering spot for people who worked in towers this restaurant also housed one of most prestigious wine schools in united states called windows on world wine school run by wine personality kevin zraly despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt port authority scrapped plans to rebuild these wtc attractions which has outraged some observers an episode of cbs s 60 minutes in 2010 focused on lack of progress at ground zero particularly on lack of completion dates for a majority of buildings main tower one world trade center s having undergone three different designs and delays and monetary expense involved investor larry silverstein said port authority s estimated completion date for entire site was 2037 thirty five years after work started although billions of dollars had already been spent on project he said ground zero is still a hole in ground during an interview for episode larry silverstein said i am most frustrated person in world i m seventy eight years of age i want to see this thing done in my lifetime one world trade center itself was met with criticism early in its planning and construction stages original design which was asymmetrical significantly shorter and called for an off center spire was met with much disapproval causing a new one to be devised a key feature of final design fortified windowless base was also denounced as looking dreary and unwelcoming to alleviate this problem designers decided to clad it with prismatic glass panels name change from freedom tower to one world trade center was met with some criticism then governor of new york george pataki stated in 2003 that t he freedom tower isn t going to be one world trade center it s going to be freedom tower rebuilding early construction and final planning thumb alt large construction side with cranes and two recessed square areas construction of

which delayed start of construction of entire complex by two years new plans for world trade center transportation hub which involved doubling number of support columns pushed back construction timeline in original plan construction of national september 11 memorial museum would have begun after transportation hub had been completed because roof of transportation hub provided foundation on
