in last minutes of series finale dreams come true performing backing vocals for i lived with rest of glee cast for re dedication of auditorium development casting and creation thumb dianna agron pictured plays quinn quinn is portrayed by actress dianna agron in casting glee series creator ryan murphy sought out actors who could identify with rush of starring in theatrical roles instead of using traditional network casting calls he spent three months on broadway looking for unknown actors agron was last primary actor to be cast having won role only days before pilot began filming agron auditioned for glee coming from a background in dancing and acting she has been taking dance classes since age of three appeared in many music theatre productions and has appeared in television roles for csi ny and heroes agron said in a 2009 interview pertaining to her casting session i nearly bailed on my audition for show i was so nervous with her wholesome good looks agron certainly looked part but producers wondered if she appeared too innocent agron said in an interview they told me to come back with straight hair and to dress sexier later that week i started work agron auditioned with frank sinatra s fly me to moon glee producers said we really lucked out in finding agron to play quinn in december 2010 ryan murphy announced that cast of glee would be replaced at end of third season to coincide with their graduation murphy said every year we re going to populate a new group there s nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot he also revealed that some of original cast will leave as early as 2012 i think you have to be true to fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers lives although four graduating seniors were confirmed in january 2012 as returning in fourth season rachel finn kurt and santana there had been no announcement regarding quinn or any other seniors as of end of february 2012 as of may 2012 murphy stated that all graduating seniors will come back for season 4 but not all will be doing all 22 episodes characterization quinn is described by agron as rachel berry s lea michele enemy and terrible meanest girl agron said that her favorite part of quinn is that she s smart but she s also human and through her tough exterior she s often a little girl lost com s lauren waterman has described her as being lovable but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee agron commented yes there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn t be fair if those stereotypes didn t exist a little bit but co creator ryan murphy has a way of taking everything and turning it upside down that s great thing about this show and these characters nobody is one note which is amazing quinn was originally conceived as antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader a departure from agron s actual high school experience agron said in an interview with hitfix i definitely wasn t cool in high school i really wasn t i did belong to many of clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did musical theater route so i had friends in all areas but i certainly did not know what to wear did not know how to do my hair all those things she added i think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school sometimes with teens writers or directors anybody short changes them and makes them be simple simple individuals you re either jock or popular kid or nerd they don t show those shades everybody has those shades to them this show it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all experiences that you probably actually go through in high school quinn s role as head cheerleader is central to understanding her character agron said that she had never had any prior cheer experience before pilot if i had been a cheerleader i would ve ended up on crutches she told emmy magazine in an interview with hitfix she said i have new respect for craft because i slightly hurt myself during pilot coming down from one of stunts it s better now i didn t tear something in my knee but i strained it knees are very sensitive i ve learned it s crazy because i ve been dancing since i was three on my toes and all these things and you should never say this but i ve never injured myself ever i d seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things you shouldn t say that though because every day is an opportunity to fall hurt yourself so that was my experience reception critical response thumb right quinn agron

for vanity fair was positive about scripting of quinn character in second season premiere now that pregnancy storyline was over and was happy to see return of evil quinn joel kelly of tv squad criticized decision to pair quinn with finn again in valentine s day oriented episode he saw it as a regression of characters and commented yes it feels like glee classic because series started with two of them together but both of them have changed quinn more so than finn and having them dating again seems like they re going back to days when quinn was icy lead cheerio and finn was nice but dumb
