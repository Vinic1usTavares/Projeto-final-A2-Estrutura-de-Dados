kikuuiki mixing airspace stylized as kikuuiki is fourth studio album by japanese band sakanaction it was released on march 17 2010 through victor entertainment in january album was preceded by single aruku around which was met with greatest commercial success for band since their debut reaching number three on oricon s singles chart album was nominated as one of finalists for cd shop awards and was lauded by critics for its cohesive sound and literary lyrics at time of release it was their most commercially successful release since their debut reaching number three in japan sakanaction spent most of 2009 experimenting on album s single aruku around followed by two months of recording in january and february 2010 most of final recording stages were spent on song me ga aku aiiro a seven minute rock opera used as a promotional single during its release album saw a new recording approach for band where members worked more spontaneously and synchronized album was influenced by commercial success of aruku around and was written as a response to song background and development after recording two studio albums in sapporo band moved to tokyo in spring 2009 to further their musical potential their first album produced in tokyo shin shiro 2009 saw a new approach for band where vocalist ichiro yamaguchi asked other members of sakanaction to arrange songs individually instead of together led by singles sen to rei and native dancer album became their most commercially successful in their career peaking at number eight on oricon s album chart despite this yamaguchi was disappointed with sales and was not sure why album stalled at 30 000 copies sold after release of album in january 2009 sakanaction performed a two month tour of japan sakanaquarium 2009 this was followed by appearances at many summer music festivals including sweet love shower nano mugen fes rock in japan and rising sun rock festival on june 13 2009 sakanaction performed at version 21 1 a newly created rock event by sakanaction and rock bands ogre you asshole and telephones to showcase rock music of 2010s on october 10 sakanaction performed their first overseas concert x sound festival in south korea yamaguchi had started collecting ideas for kikuuiki in february 2009 less than a month after release of shin shiro band spent most of 2009 experimenting on song aruku around and performed song at their summer festival appearances at rock in japan and rising sun rock festival to see how audience would react to song s different approach after aruku around was released as a single in january 2010 it became a commercial and critical success it reached number three on oricon s single charts and was praised for its strong arrangement and yamaguchi s poetic lyrics single s success surprised band who never considered it could become as popular as it did writing and production thumb album was primarily recorded in shinjuku tokyo in january and february 2010 album was primarily recorded at freedom studio in shinjuku tokyo with secondary recording sessions held at sound arts avaco creative studio and galva studio all in tokyo as well as studio wakefield in tama ku kawasaki recording sessions for aruku around were held in 2009 while bulk of album was recorded in january and february 2010 recording sessions finished on february 16 a month before album s release date writing process took longer than expected and band had to postpone album four times from their intended finishing date mostly due to complexities of recording seven minute long song me ga aku aiiro kikuuiki album sessions were influenced by commercial success of aruku around where band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make and what sort of music they should present to their new audience for audience to understand what songs sakanaction create other than aruku around style ones band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to aruku around and instead wanted to express to their listeners breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together yamaguchi felt that it was important to not release a second similar song immediately after aruku around as he saw that music consumers in 2010s were acting as critics on their own or twitter accounts for these people he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of band he felt this was important for growing sakanaction as a band to break cycle of a musical act becoming popular then continuing to release same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them even before single s success band planned to feature songs on album that would go against listeners expectations of what sakanaction was as a band on other hand band attempted to keep a commercial sound same goal of shin shiro or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted this led band trying to create pop art music blending art with commercialism creation process for kikuuiki was different to that of shin shiro where each member worked alongside yamaguchi in a two person meeting and later working on songs together as a band for kikuuiki yamaguchi recorded each song s demo then in a meeting band would discuss song s feel and emotions listing everything on a white board yamaguchi would then leave other four band members to work on song together while he worked on their next song afterwards he would return to studio and make suggestions on their progress on first song this meant that yamaguchi had less input on kikuuiki than on band s previous albums which made him feel more like band s producer lessened input made yamaguchi feel that he had come to trust each member s musical abilities much more than before on previous albums members needed to compromise or give up on ideas that they had however on kikuuiki they found that they understood each other much better this led to members expressing themselves more such as drummer keiichi ejima who showcased his taste in rock music strongly in sound he created for album many songs were still being created when they were recording unlike previous albums where songs were entirely finished before recording final take this meant that many spontaneous ideas were included on album an example of this was band wanted to add a chorus they collected together all people who happened to be in studio at time including their musical director spontaneous process led to song klee written about paintings of swiss german painter paul klee to be recorded in a single take similarly song coelacanth to boku was inspired by atmosphere of yamaguchi s room as album was being created instead of featuring repeating sounds on album sakanaction decided to carefully consider how each sound effect effected song and included very few repeating sounds album s title is a word coined by yamaguchi it is related to term a term describing brackish water around river heads where fresh water and salt water mix together yamaguchi replaced character referring to water with character referring to sky applying concept to mixing air instead this phrase is used to represent album s theme mixing this idea related to how each member had completely different music tastes but somehow were able to create music together similarly it related to idea of how sakanaction as a band mixed rock club and folk music but were able to blend different tastes to find an equilibrium that a wide range of people would like band created song me ga aku aiiro as a song that would represent album s theme in a single song album s introduction a mix of recordings taken by yamaguchi on his iphone at recording studio was similarly created to match this theme album was influenced by changing mediums people listen to music in 2000s and 2010s how people used their cellphones or youtube to discover new music yamaguchi wanted to create songs that were difficult to evaluate by listening to just a sample of song seven minute long me ga aku aiiro in particular was written with such music consumers in mind band also felt influenced by city of tokyo after living in city for a year and a half and deciding to call it their permanent home retrospectively yamaguchi saw shin shiro as depicting band as they had arrived in tokyo while kikuuiki showed versions of themselves that they had discovered by living in tokyo after recording shin shiro band had many opportunities to meet other bands that performed similar music to them because they were now based in tokyo in particular yamaguchi felt influenced by yusuke koide of base ball bear impressed that koide s lyrics managed to express himself as himself despite their fictional nature yamaguchi wrote his first fiction song because of this omotesando nijuroku ji as a challenge for himself and to match mixing theme of kikuuiki yamaguchi took further inspiration from showa period in japan during its asset price bubble when writing omotesando nijuroku ji song ushio was one of first compositions written for album yamaguchi decided to place it as first song on album as he felt it was similar to material found on shin shiro as a way to show off what sort of band sakanaction were up until release of aruku around song mixed a heavy lyrical theme of whether personal philosophies arise from a person s community or from within themselves with a psychedelic avant garde pop sound yamaguchi found kikuuiki recording sessions exhausting as if he had used all of his energy in writing process in an interview with rockin on japan in 2011 yamaguchi felt that people who became fans during this period became s core fanbase because of this many of sakanaction s concert set lists continue to feature songs from kikuuiki for these people cover artwork album s artwork was created by kamikene and daisuke ishizaka of it features two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue in order to create a color close to indigo bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink that regularly occurs in japanese printing while deep blue was taken naturally isolating a color taken from a photo of sky just before dawn center of artwork features kikuuiki typography as well as a logo of two overlapping circles mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent kikuuikis theme of mixing points promotion and release kikuuiki s release was announced in mid january

album s music was catchy and that its success was expected due to its high quality entertainment media kulture called kikuuiki album that established sakanaction s current style yuji tanaka of cdjournal felt album was more cohesive than their previous works praising band s skill progression and yamaguchi s lyrics which he described as literary style and cynical he was struck by heroic march after album s introduction in song ushio which made him feel suddenly intoxicated like being in ocean takayuki endoh of skream similarly believed album showed growth in band although their previous releases incorporated dance and rock music endoh felt that music on kikuuiki had struck a better harmony between two and had simultaneously become more rock and dance oriented he praised album s poppy floating feeling highly literary lyrics and romantic electro sound feeling that band was unique in music industry koji dejima of bounce felt that album was ingenious in way that it created a feeling of being out of place due to its arrangements melodies and lyrics he praised album s varied sound and fact that band always spoke with their own words despite this variety of sound he noted aruku around s strong dance music sound and likened klee to songs of police and omotesando nijuroku ji to music of 1970s american band television rolling stone japan gave album four stars out of five praising yamaguchi s literary and original lyrics and how human music sounded despite its electronic sound kaori komatsu of rockin on japan felt that yamaguchi s lyrics created an interesting feeling of unease and had a deep flavor she noted that yamaguchi s lyrics often described everyday life and his mental space layered on top of each other in impressionist scenes she felt that band s sound had become more ambitious in their genre crossovers especially inclusions of ambient music and dub elements and that songs had a sense of city much stronger since they had moved to tokyo tanaka of cdjournal noted similar qualities in songs yes no and ashita kara which to him expressed loneliness of city life album s lead single aruku around was well received by music critics cdjournal reviewers gave single its star of recommendation calling it a killer tune where pleasure of living in moment and prudence is balanced they noted song s retro sound like nostalgic dance music and felt that band s decision to move to tokyo two years ago was reflected in song kenji sasaki of skream felt that song had a gentle electronica feel praising 1980s style synths aggressive sound and unique poetic sentiment of yamaguchi s he also praised emotions song gave him mixing pain and exhilaration tomoki takahashi of rockin on japan felt greatest strength of song was how its lyrical content jarred with its high spirited words and explosive hybrid beat he noted that instead of talking about pleasures of dance floor yamaguchi s lyrics were introspective discussing loneliness pain and longing takahashi praised brave fanfare like synth based leading melody and tight and earth shaking four on floor beat track listing personnel personnel details were sourced from kikuuikis liner notes booklet
