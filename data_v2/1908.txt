fatal injuries in this way scarlet becomes spectrum s top asset in its fight against mysterons captain scarlet andersons eighth of ten puppet series was preceded by thunderbirds and followed by joe 90 and secret service in terms of visual aesthetic it represents a departure from thunderbirds in its use of non caricatured puppets sculpted to realistic body proportions repeated several times in uk it has generated tie ins from toy cars and dolls to audio plays and original novels as well as comic strips in century 21 s weekly comic tv century 21 compared to thunderbirds and earlier anderson series captain scarlet is generally considered darker in tone and less suited to child audiences due to its violent content and themes of alien aggression and interplanetary war change in puppet design has divided critical opinion while wisdom in making protagonist indestructible has also been questioned sangster and condon 2005 p 166 however series has been praised for its use of a multinational multi ethnic puppet cast and depiction of a utopian future earth a computer animated reboot series gerry anderson s new captain scarlet was first broadcast in 2005 plot series begins in 2068 in first

a harmless surveillance device for a weapon city s inhabitants mysterons are sentient computers that form a collective consciousness they are remnants of original mysteron race beings from another galaxy that maintained their colony on mars for 3 500 years before abandoning planet at turn of 20th century mysteron computers use their power of reversing matter to rebuild their city before vowing revenge for humans unwarranted aggression reversing matter also called retro metabolism episode 2 enables mysterons to re create people and objects as facsimiles that they can control this ability is used to wage a war of nerves against earth whereby mysterons issue threats against specific targets from world leaders and military installations to cities and continents and then destroy and reconstruct whatever instruments are needed be they human or object to carry out their plans presence of mysterons is indicated by two circles of green light that trail scenes of destruction and reconstruction although mysterons are able to influence events from mars their actions on earth are usually performed by their replicated intermediaries zero x mission leader captain black becomes aliens primary agent when they seize control of his mind transformation of captain black from human to mysteron is indicated by a paling of his complexion combined with a deepening of his voice to

fictional universe of captain scarlet power from many individual nations has been vested in a world government which is headed by an elected world president and possesses its own military and security forces spectrum is a unified operation formed to provide greater efficiency than these separate bodies as it is unobstructed by interdepartmental red tape bentley 2001 p 43 as their first act of retaliation bentley 2001 p 44 original scarlet is killed in a road accident engineered by mysterons and replaced with a double under their control however after reconstruction is shot by spectrum s captain blue and falls to his death from a tower he returns to life with consciousness of original scarlet restored and is thereafter free of mysteron influence in series mysteron reconstructions that are killed are usually permanently destroyed one exception is scarlet who recovers from injuries that would normally be fatal character s biography in complete book of captain scarlet states that mysterons intended their double of scarlet to be indestructible unlike their other reconstructions bentley 2001 p 44 in original script for mysterons scarlet is resurrected with aid of an advanced computer bentley p 15 in finished episode he returns to life of his own accord and there is no explanation as to how he regains his human personality however audio play introducing captain scarlet suggests that this is restored by computer as in pilot script bentley 2001 p 94 scarlet s new body possesses two extraordinary abilities he is able to sense other mysteron reconstructions nearby and if injured or killed returns to full health through retro metabolism now able to use suicidally reckless tactics to thwart mysteron plots scarlet repeatedly sacrifices himself in knowledge that whatever his injuries he will return to face mysterons again over course of series it is discovered that mysteron reconstructions are particularly vulnerable to electricity and can be detected by x rays to which they are resistant episode 8 consequently spectrum develops two anti mysteron devices mysteron gun dialogue in spectrum strikes back states that mysteron gun is only gun that kills a mysteron gun does not appear in any other episodes although a similar weapon electro ray rifle appears in audio play captain scarlet versus captain black in episodes preceding and following spectrum

production thumb gerry anderson series creator alt photograph depicts an elderly man whose gaze is directed to right of camera when talks to find an american broadcaster for thunderbirds fell through in july 1966 production on series second season ended with completion of just six episodes at behest of lew grade apf s financer at distributor itc bentley 2001 p 13 having overseen apf s work since creation of supercar in 1960 and gone on to buy company during production of fireball xl5 grade was keen for andersons programmes to be broadcast in lucrative american market and believed that a fresh concept stood a better chance of attracting bidders than a second season of thunderbirds as a result of cancellation gerry anderson was forced to come up with an idea for a new supermarionation series he had once been inspired by thought of creating a live action police drama in which hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through series and replaced by a new lead character bentley 2001 p 14 now giving fresh consideration to this idea anderson realised that a major selling point for his new series could be a character who is killed at end of each episode and resurrected by start of next this coupled with contemporary theories about possibility of life on mars bentley 2001 p 5 led to idea of an interplanetary war between earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called upon to defend humanity after further thought anderson decided that scarlet would be a suitably unusual name for this organisation s indestructible agent while his partner in field could be blue from this anderson reasoned that all personnel should have colour codenames and that organisation should be called spectrum noting that white light is composed of and can be broken down into colours of spectrum he named spectrum s leader white intrigued by oft heard phrase life as we know it anderson wanted to set his alien villains apart from conventional extraterrestrials of 1960s tv and cinema he therefore worked from a basis of life as we don t know it and made mysterons a collective of sentient computers rather than a race of organic beings although this is not explicitly stated in series itself intention was that original mysteron race came from another galaxy having established a base on mars in distant past they fled planet centuries later leaving their computers behind them anderson s recollections of second world war provided inspiration for a number of design aspects for example he remembered that during battle of britain raf pilots had found it difficult to counter german attacks because having to take off from ground meant that it took a long time to intercept enemy he therefore made spectrum s headquarters cloudbase an airborne aircraft carrier mysteron rings were inspired by an advertisement for oxo products which featured brand name sliding over a frying pan and a woman s body writing settling on mysterons as series working title bentley 2001 p 15 anderson and his wife sylvia wrote a pilot script in august 1966 bentley 2001 p 7 this differed significantly from final draft of first episode initially it was decided that mysteron duplicate of captain scarlet would be resurrected by means of an advanced computer instead of reviving naturally and that thereafter he would no longer be truly human but a mechanical man akin to an android another aim later also dropped was for each episode to feature a guest star puppet voiced by a well known actor consequently character of world president that appears in first episode was originally intended to be voiced by patrick mcgoohan bentley 2001 p 17 archer p 38 with anderson serving mainly as executive producer majority of writing input was supplied by tony barwick who had previously written for thunderbirds bentley 2001 p 31 originally captain scarlet s script editor barwick went on to pen 18 of its 32 episodes himself besides often making substantial revisions to other writers work discussing his approach to scriptwriting in a 1986 interview barwick compared premise and characters of captain scarlet to those of thunderbirds for example likening spectrum to international rescue and character of captain black to hood earlier series recurring villain filming thumb dinky toys version of spectrum pursuit vehicle spv spectrum s main armoured fighting vehicle century 21 special effects unit had refined its scale model driving mechanisms so that miniature vehicles of captain scarlet could produce realistic inertial dips alt photograph depicts a scale toy replica of an armoured tank like vehicle that is metallic blue in colour with five wheels on each side filming on first episode mysterons began on 2 january 1967 after two months of pre production bentley 2001 p 22 budget for 32 episode series was set at ps1 5 million approximately ps million in at an average cost of ps46 000 per episode or ps2 000 per minute it was most expensive anderson production to date bentley 2008 p 119 a month before anderson and his team had dropped name ap films since company co founder arthur was no longer working with anderson and renamed their company century 21 productions by time captain scarlet entered production many of directors on earlier anderson series such as alan pattillo david elliott and david lane had either left apf or were committed to production of thunderbird 6 second thunderbirds feature film although lane desmond saunders and brian burgess were able to reprise directorial duties from thunderbirds andersons were forced to promote some of junior production personnel to replace outgoing directors to this end alan perry and ken turner were promoted from camera operator and art departments bentley 2001 p 32 other new directors were drafted in from outside apf these were peter anderson leo eaton and robert lynn last of whom had been an assistant director on 1958 hammer films dracula and revenge of frankenstein stirling road on slough trading trading estate principal photography and editing had served as andersons production base since making of stingray in 1964 bentley 2001 p 12 to speed up production on earlier supermarionation series episodes had been filmed simultaneously in pairs on separate sound stages a practice that continued for captain scarlet some filming coincided with production of thunderbird 6 which was recorded on a different stage editing rooms post production offices and a preview theatre were housed in a separate building on estate crew also worked with standard telecommunication laboratories in harlow telecommunication laboratories electronic collaboration on technical aspects of production bentley 2001 p 57 a third unit headed by derek meddings and his assistant mike trim handled special effects and miniatures and was tasked with creating all permanent sets and models such as cloudbase interiors and scaled down spectrum pursuit vehicles a design innovation for captain scarlet meant that noses of scale model vehicles would dip when stopped to imitate sudden application of brakes and subsequent deceleration on a real life vehicle cloudbase model which was long proved too heavy to be held up with strings and was instead supported by a metal pole archer p 23 bentley 2001 p 21 to create mysteron rings crew used advice of producer reg hill who suggested that a transparency be made that could be panned across sets using a slide projector by time series started airing in september 1967 principal photography had been completed on first 20 episodes bentley 2001 p 41 puppet shots for each episode usually took two weeks or 11 working days to film bentley 2001 p 34 shooting was originally scheduled to last eight months but ultimately ran into late october due to demands of thunderbird 6 shoot although production on next supermarionation series joe 90 began in november bentley 2001 p 114 final episodes of captain scarlet were not completed until early 1968 music thumb spectrum leitmotif associated with cloudbase and organisation in general alt image depicts musical notation of a fast paced motif consisting of crotchets and quavers thumb four note motif used to illustrate presence of mysterons captain scarlet s variation below emphasises character s mysteron past alt image depicts musical notation of two similar motifs consisting of four notes one featuring only and other only crotchets music for captain scarlet was composed by barry gray who had scored all prior supermarionation series opening theme titled mysterons was rendered electronically and accompanied by a staccato drum beat to introduce lead character of captain scarlet bentley 2001 p 40 this seven note beat was also used to link scenes within episodes as well as cut to advertisement breaks where it was accompanied by a zooming image of spectrum logo archer and hearn p 156 on subject of beat anderson recalled when i went to recording session i heard drum beat he had come up with and i thought christ is this all he could produce looking back on it however i can see that what he came up with worked very well ending theme captain scarlet underwent significant change after completion of first 14 episodes first version had been mostly instrumental with words captain scarlet sung in time to staccato drum beat followed by a vocoded repetition supplied by gray himself this was later revised as a song performed by a london based pop group spectrum who had been assembled by rca victor as an imitation of monkees and happened to share their name with organisation that appears in captain scarlet archer and hearn p 157 as well as theme music gray scored incidental music for 18 episodes of captain scarlet between march and december 1967 musical accompaniment for remaining 14 episodes was achieved by re using these tracks as well as music from earlier anderson series such as thunderbirds in composing incidental music gray made extensive use of two contrasting yet similar themes to illustrate spectrum and mysterons in their notes for soundtrack release ralph titterton and tim mallett suggest that music has a military feel that favours percussion brass and wind instruments contrasting with orchestral nature of thunderbirds score with exception of four note mysteron motif gray generally restricted his use of electronic synthesisers to space sequences preferring traditional instruments for earth bound action captain scarlet s motif heard in incidental music and both versions of ending theme is a melodic variation on mysteron theme emphasising scarlet s mysteron past awarding soundtrack release a rating of four stars out of five bruce eder of website allmusic describes collection of theme and incidental music as a strange mix of otherworldly music of spheres late 50s early 60s space age pop british invasion beat scottish folk inspired tunes kids style mickey mouse scoring martial music light jazz and light classical he singles out both cocktail music from episode model spy and a piano piece from inquisition performed by gray himself for particular praise in his bbc online review peter marsh suggests that music s dark tone reflects series presentation of realistic puppets and death frightening alien villains and no laughs noting that dissonant vibraphone chords shimmer under hovering tremulous strings contrasted with urgent militaristic drums and pulsing brass driving action ever onto its climax and no doubt a big explosion in october 2015 fanderson released a 3 disc soundtrack set exclusively for club members it contains music either written for or used in all but three episodes heart of new york and treble cross contain no original music and cue recordings for traitor are lost captain scarlet soundtrack releases puppets thumb thumbtime 30 changes to supermarionation design made puppet movement more stilted than before to make a puppet walk an operator would hold legs while camera filmed from waist up to keep human hand out of view this clip from episode attack on cloudbase features an interruption in shot when captains scarlet and blue pass through a doorway to speak to captain magenta as puppets head wires made it impossible to film such entrances in a continuous shot through characters of scarlet and colonel white whose english accents are demonstrated here marcus hearn and simon archer argue that captain scarlet leaves a different impression on audience compared to thunderbirds alt video clip from attack on cloudbase demonstrating difficulties in inducing realistic movement in puppet characters of captain scarlet whenever a character is required to move camera assumes a close up shot to conceal hand of operator manipulating puppet shot is interrupted when captains scarlet and blue pass through a doorway as it was impossible to film this action in one motion supermarionation a technique by which movements of puppets mouths were electronically synchronised with pre recorded dialogue was first used during production of four feather falls in 1960 in all series prior to captain scarlet a puppet s head had been disproportionately large compared to rest of its body as head contained solenoid that formed key element of lip synch mechanism scaling body up to match head was not possible as this would have made puppets difficult to operate and required enlarging all puppet sets archer and hearn p 151 gerry anderson was frustrated with this caricatured look and wanted design of puppets to more accurately reflect human physiology thus before captain scarlet entered production reg hill and john and bassett p 203 created a new type of puppet with solenoid built into chest to allow realistically sized heads costume designer on captain scarlet was sylvia anderson who took inspiration from work of french fashion designer pierre cardin in particular his 1966 cosmonaut collection in designing spectrum uniforms bentley 2001 p 19 after being sculpted in plasticine puppet heads were moulded on a silicone rubber base and finished in fibreglass at heights ranging from approximately one third life size next generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors bentley 2001 p 18 in earlier series puppets eyes had been disproportionately large for captain scarlet they were made more realistic by fixing prints of real human eyes to puppets eyeballs scaled down from photographs of eyes of production staff archer p 55 as before main characters were given interchangeable heads showing a range of expressions these included smiler and blinker heads as episodes of captain scarlet were to be filmed in pairs on separate stages expressionless heads were made in duplicate drake and bassett p 266 increased realism of puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced this ironically made design less lifelike than anderson had hoped suddenly all movements had to be as realistic as puppets and that made it difficult for puppeteers to animate them to minimise amount of movement required puppets were made to stand on moving walkways or sit at moving desks for example colonel white s desk is able to rotate and lieutenant green operates cloudbase computer from a sliding chair puppeteer jan king commented under control puppets described by king had no wires and were manipulated from waist one advantage of this method was that a puppet could pass through a doorway without necessitating a break in shot for shots of characters sitting in aircraft cockpits variations of under control design were made comprising only a head and torso these were operated using levers and wires located underneath set appearance of captain scarlet has been compared to that of francis matthews who voiced character cary grant and roger moore archer p 86 ed bishop thought that captain blue was modelled on him but sculptor terry curtis said that he used himself as template and simply added a blond wig when he learnt that bishop was to voice character curtis a james bond fan based captain grey on sean 2006 august p 206 and destiny angel on ursula andress archer p 81 connery s co star in dr no 1962 lieutenant green was modelled on voice actor cy grant rhapsody angel on jean shrimpton archer p 88 melody angel on eartha kitt and harmony angel on tsai chin archer p 93 prior to captain scarlet supporting characters had been sculpted in clay for each new episode guest parts in captain scarlet however were filled by a permanent repertory company of over 50 puppets made to same standards of workmanship as main characters called revamp puppets or simply revamps these puppets appeared on an episode by episode basis altered for each new role by changing their hairstyles and hair colours both main character and revamp puppets from captain scarlet appeared in final two supermarionation series joe 90 and secret service characters and voice casting regular real names except those of scarlet and blue are used in television episodes instead they originate from licensed associated media such as bentley s complete book of captain scarlet all real names and nationalities in voice cast list originate from character biographies in complete book of captain scarlet 2001 by chris bentley pp 44 51 mysterons and a flashback sequence in dangerous rendezvous captain black s human voice is provided by jeremy wilkin lieutenant morgan lian shin captain scarlet had largest regular puppet cast of any supermarionation production drake and bassett p 232 whereas earlier series had focused on futuristic technology in captain scarlet emphasis shifted to characters as with re designed puppets voice parts became less caricatured and more realistic drake and bassett p 240 simon archer and marcus hearn suggest that proliferation of english accented voices in transition from thunderbirds to captain scarlet altered sound of supermarionation and its impression on viewer archer and hearn p 169 francis matthews who supplied voice of captain scarlet had turned down offers to voice characters in thunderbirds bentley 2001 p 23 according to matthews gerry anderson went to great lengths to cast him because he was impressed by an imitation of cary grant that matthews had once used in a radio programme and indeed actor based scarlet s tones on grant s mid atlantic accent archer p 43 anderson however stated in his biography that grant impression was matthews choice at audition and that while it was not voice that had been intended for scarlet production was happy to use it archer and hearn p 153 matthews co star in film dracula prince of darkness 1966 had been charles tingwell who was chosen to voice cloudbase medical officer dr fawn tingwell who had provided voices for series two of thunderbirds as well as feature film thunderbirds are go had been recommended by fellow australian ray barrett a regular voice artiste on stingray and thunderbirds bentley 2001 p 29 due to stage commitments tingwell left production after 12 episodes departing at same time was paul maxwell voice of captain grey and previously steve zodiac in fireball xl5 who left series to take up role of steve tanner in coronation street due to departures of tingwell and maxwell for remaining episodes fawn and grey appeared in a non speaking capacity only although guest characters voiced by tingwell and maxwell occasionally appeared in flashbacks to earlier episodes cy grant chosen for role of lieutenant green lieutenant is generally pronounced in british manner by all but american characters in series colonel white s assistant and cloudbase computer operator was known to andersons for singing topical on current affairs programme tonight grant s casting influenced that of ed bishop as captain blue as bishop remembered in a 1995 interview it was just that a girl in my agent s office happened to be on ball she represented this black actor by name of cy grant and gerry and sylvia wanted to use him and girl said oh by way mr anderson we ve just taken on a new young american actor shows you how long ago it was a new american actor name of edward bishop and we know how much you like american voices would you like to meet him as well he said okay send him out so i went out and auditioned and got job donald gray who had found himself typecast after performing lead role in detective series saber of london was having to resort to voice work to sustain his acting career bentley 2001 p 25 he was selected for three regular roles colonel white captain black and mysterons after black is taken over by mysterons in first episode he speaks with aliens voice for gray s portrayals of black and mysterons his voice was electronically deepened by recording his lines at high speed and then playing them back at normal speed to produce a haunting effect voice of captain ochre was provided by jeremy wilkin who had voiced virgil tracy in thunderbirds series two captain magenta meanwhile was voiced by gary files a relative newcomer to century 21 who had supplied guest voices for second thunderbirds film thunderbird 6 liz morgan was also new to anderson productions and voiced destiny angel leader of angel squadron and one of her subordinates rhapsody angel sylvia anderson voice of lady penelope in thunderbirds took role of melody angel while canadian actress janna hill voiced symphony harmony was initially voiced by morgan who supplied character s lines in five episodes about a third of way through dialogue recording sessions role was transferred to chinese actress lian shin la riviere p 159 bentley 2001 p 27 who voiced harmony in only one episode launching but received cast billing in 20 supporting character voices were performed by anderson files hill maxwell morgan tingwell and wilkin completing credited cast were david healy and martin king shane rimmer previously heard as scott tracy in thunderbirds made a number of uncredited vocal contributions besides writing for series neil mccallum voiced guest characters in four episodes but was also uncredited after captain scarlet six members of voice cast would continue their association with century 21 healy voiced shane weston in joe 90 and files voiced matthew harding in secret service wilkin morgan and king all had various supporting roles in these two series bishop later appeared in lead role of commander ed straker in ufo andersons first live action series dialogue recording character dialogue was recorded once a fortnight at up to four episodes a session at anvil films recording films recording studio voice recording in denham buckinghamshire bentley 2001 p 30 all actors were paid 15 guineas ps15 15 shillings per episode plus repeat fees regardless of size of their contributions bentley 2001 p 24 they were not given opportunity to tour century 21 studios in slough until their work was finished and therefore had no visualisation of their characters during recording sessions this was to regret of morgan we all said that we wished we had seen puppets before doing dialogue as it would have been helpful to have something physical to base voices on i knew that destiny was french and that rhapsody had to be frightfully but that was about it title sequences and end credits thumb spectrum logo appears at both start and end of each episode s advertisement break all captain scarlet episodes with exception of first have two title sequences first of these incorporating title card and main production credits is set in a run down alleyway and presented from point of view of an unseen assassin who turns a corner only to meet his death at gun barrel of captain scarlet seven letter words captain scarlet gradually appear in time with seven strikes of series signature drum beat composed by barry gray this sequence is intended to demonstrate scarlet s indestructibility bullets from assassin s machine gun having no effect on captain drake and bassett p 244 it is accompanied by a voice over from ed bishop that states a number of variations have been used in first episode bishop s voice over runs a rarely used alternative version runs later prints feature an additional voice over by donald gray that warns audience la riviere p 163 this served both to establish background to series and warn younger viewers not to endanger themselves by copying scarlet s actions cull 2006 august p 200 it was used either in isolation or after alternative one man voice over from bishop beginning with second episode primary title sequence leads into a teaser that is in turn followed by a secondary title sequence as mysterons announce their latest threat against earth mysteron eyes pass over main characters in various environments to demonstrate aliens omnipresence at same time characters codenames appear on screen mysterons invariably begin their threat with words this is voice of mysterons we know that you can hear us earthmen closing credits were originally intended to feature images of printed circuit boards and other electronic components to reflect andersons early conception of scarlet as a mechanical man in finished sequence credits are superimposed over a series of paintings that depict scarlet in various moments of peril in earlier episodes these are accompanied by instrumental version of captain scarlet theme music closing credits of later episodes feature a lyrical version sung by spectrum paintings were created by comic artist ron embleton who would later illustrate adult comic strips oh wicked wanda and sweet chastity for penthouse magazine bentley 2001 p 102 in 2005 animation art gallery in london released limited edition prints of paintings signed by francis matthews in japan original opening titles were replaced with a montage of action clips taken from various episodes accompanied by a song performed by children this version is included in special features of captain scarlet dvd box set broadcasts captain scarlet had its official uk premiere on 29 september 1967 on atv midlands first episode mysterons was seen by an estimated 450 000 viewers a number considered promising bentley 2001 p 118 exactly five months

drake and bassett p 282 uk repeat runs varied among regions granada htv and tyne tees continued to air series into 1972 drake and bassett p 283 while midlands repeated it four times in colour between 1969 and 1974 in other areas like yorkshire it was not repeated at all in mid 1980s itv network broadcast series on saturday mornings as well as in segmented form as part of night network drake and bassett p 286 captain scarlet was subsequently purchased by bbc which launched series first nationwide network run on bbc2 in october 1993 bentley 2001 p 122 bbc2 premiere of mysterons drew an audience of four million channel s third largest audience of week bbc two repeated series in digitally remastered form in autumn of 2001 bentley 2001 p 125 after september 11 attacks episode order was re arranged second episode winged assassin in which mysterons destroy an airliner and re create it as a weapon and third big ben strikes again in which london is threatened by a hi jacked nuclear device were postponed due to perceived similarities between storylines and real world events in week after attacks distributor carlton communications briefly took down captain scarlet pages on its website reception although thunderbirds had run for two series lew grade s unexpected cancellation of that production had led gerry anderson to assume that there was no possibility of captain scarlet lasting more than one drake and bassett p 280 in anderson s words i didn t expect it to continue i simply went to lew and asked what s next thing you want us to do archer and hearn p 166 captain scarlet is generally viewed as being much darker in tone compared to earlier anderson series as andrew billen noted in new statesman in 2005 whereas thunderbirds was about rescuing people scarlet was about damnation soul of a resurrected man being fought for between captain scarlet and equally indestructible captain black it was anderson s gothic period horror of mysterons has also been recognised in 2003 depiction of aliens ranked 82nd in channel 4 s list show 100 greatest scary moments simon wickes of website tv century 21 argues that series sober writing is ultimately due to realism of new accurately proportioned puppets and that this aesthetic change also accounts for increased realism of scale model effects commentators have drawn parallels between captain scarlet and cold war media historian nicholas j cull interprets war of nerves between earth and mars as a reflection of strained international relations during 1960s and likens enemy within scenario of martians taking over humans to plots of films like invasion of body snatchers 1956 mark bould states that captain scarlet seemed in tune with a decade of civil disobedience and anti imperialist guerrilla wars a view echoed by rebecca of university of edinburgh who writes that it is one of a number of tv series that exploited fears of 1960s america by presenting civil disobedience and potentially negative impact of new technologies since 2001 comparisons have also been made to september 11 attacks and ensuing war on terror to others captain scarlet remains a camp classic according to bould it is one of several anderson productions that depict a utopian future benefiting from world government high technology ethnic diversity and a generally positive sense of americanisation they articulate commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity bould p 219 he also writes that captain scarlet espouses euro cool consumerism world government is a recurring concept in supermarionation series and was inspired by gerry anderson s thoughts on subject at time i had all sorts of fancy ideas about future we had united nations and i imagined that world would come together and there would be a world government cull 2006 p 121 on depiction of technology peter wright notes qualified that captain scarlet shares with thunderbirds series has drawn criticism for its camerawork which some commentators regard as being too static due to crew s inability to move puppets convincingly return to 25 minute episodes coming after thunderbirds 50 minute format has been blamed for a perceived lack of subplots and drop in overall quality of storytelling peel p 246 concerns have also been raised about series approach to character development in a 1986 interview script editor tony barwick described captain scarlet as hard nosed stuff that lacked humour adding it was all for american market and to that extent there was no deep characterisation characters all balanced one against other by contrast jeff evans author of penguin tv companion describes characters as more detailed than before noting that they were given private lives and real identities and were furnished with other biographical data writer john peel views captain scarlet as inferior to thunderbirds arguing that while century 21 s special effects had improved it was to detriment of scriptwriting he compares this to relative failure of film indiana jones and temple of doom following success of its precursor raiders of lost ark anderson made same mistake that george lucas made assuming that if effects were praised in thunderbirds public wanted a show with more effects peel p 245 peel also finds fault with character of scarlet himself arguing that use of an indestructible hero made episode endings too predictable he also suggests that scarlet who often risks his safety to foil mysteron plots served as a poor role model to impressionable child viewers regarded as a cult series by some captain scarlet came 33rd in a 2007 radio times poll to find greatest science fiction series of all time despite concerns that it is not a true children s programme due to its dark tone and level of violence it was ranked 51st in channel 4 s 2001 list show 100 greatest kids tv shows comparing captain scarlet to its immediate precursor gerry anderson s verdict was clear nothing was as successful as thunderbirds captain scarlet and mysterons was very successful but once you ve had a smash hit everything tends to look less successful in comparison puppets on sylvia anderson s costume design bould writes positively of century 21 s commitment to fashion and directs particular praise at design of angel uniforms bould p 220 new puppet design has been praised by vincent terrace and criticised by others certain members of production staff believed that new marionettes lacked charm of previous generation due to natural body proportions that were now being used episode director david lane recalls that when he first saw prototype it was as if there was a little dead person in box because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd sculptor john brown remembers putting prototype next to lady penelope puppet from thunderbirds and gauging his colleagues response when they saw it some people were horrified by difference some didn t like it some did some have argued that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design sculptor terry curtis recalls fellow sculptor john called new puppet design ridiculous archer and hearn p 152 criticising attempts to make puppets appear more lifelike because we always try to do with puppets what you can t do with humans he suggested that transition from caricature to realism was at expense of marionettes character and personality arguing that if puppet appears completely natural audience no longer has to use its imagination gerry anderson stated that he pushed for a new design to satisfy audience viewing it not as a case of moving to a new technique but more a case of incorporating new ideas with existing methods evans praises new puppets describing them as perfect in proportion and commending re location of electronic circuitry from heads to bodies comparing it to thunderbirds peel sums up captain scarlet as better puppets bigger action and a huge step backwards in stories peel p 244 he supports new puppet design contending that increased realism would not have put off an audience familiar with earlier design race gender and symbolism during its 1993 bbc re run captain scarlet became subject of a debate about black and white dualism for its use of codenames black for villainous captain black and white for benevolent head of spectrum colonel white la riviere p 160 defending series against claims of racism and political incorrectness gerry anderson pointed out that heroic characters include lieutenant green melody angel and harmony angel all of whom are of african or asian background green is only male black character to have a significant role in any of anderson series archer p in academic publications diversity of characters in terms of both race and gender has been viewed highly bould praises beautiful multi ethnic female angel fighter pilots and secondary roles played by capable women in a 2003 interview anderson noted effort made to feature ethnic minorities i think people who make television programmes have a responsibility particularly when children are watching avidly and you know their minds can be affected almost irreversibly as they grow up we were very conscious of introducing different ethnic backgrounds cull 2006 p 127 guyanese actor cy grant who voiced green believed that captain scarlet had both positive multicultural value and an allegorical nature he argued that series implied christian symbolism with colonel white as god captain black as devil and scarlet himself as christ allegory extended to cloudbase which symbolised heaven and was guarded by a fleet of fighters codenamed angels grant viewed green as an african trickster hero on dualism he argued darkness of mysterons is most easily seen as psychological rift struggle of good and evil of western world as personified by colonel white and his team dark and light are but aspects of each other incidentally green is colour of nature that can heal that rift other media thumb spectrum patrol car by dinky toys alt photograph depicts a scale toy replica of a futuristic car that is deep red in colour and incorporates an angular bonnet and roof
