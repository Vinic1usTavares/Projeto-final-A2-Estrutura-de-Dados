out of deep anguish i call to you 38 is a church cantata by johann sebastian bach he composed chorale cantata in leipzig in 1724 for 21st sunday after trinity and first performed it on 29 october 1724 cantata is part of bach s second cantata cycle which focused on lutheran hymns chorale cantata is based on martin luther s penitential hymn a paraphrase of psalm 130 luther s first and last stanza are used unchanged former treated as a chorale fantasia latter as a four part closing chorale an unknown librettist paraphrased three inner stanzas as two sets of recitatives and arias bach scored cantata for four vocal soloists a four part choir and a baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones two oboes strings and continuo cantata is unusual in its use of chorale tune not only in outer movements but as material for motifs in recitative and aria once even taking chorale melody as a continuo line in keeping with spirit of 200 year old hymn which paraphrases old testament bach used motet style in outer movements with all instruments especially four trombones enforcing vocal lines history and text bach composed this chorale cantata in leipzig in 1724 written for 21st sunday after trinity it was part of his second annual cycle of cantatas which was planned as a cycle of chorale cantatas based on prominent lutheran hymns for all occasions of liturgical year prescribed readings for sunday were from paul s epistle to ephesians take unto you whole armour of god and from gospel of john healing of nobleman s son cantata is based on martin luther s hymn a paraphrase of psalm 130 it was in bach s time required hymn for sunday luther wrote about psalm that it was coming from a text of chorale is unchanged for first and last movements an unknown poet paraphrased other three stanzas of chorale for movements 2 to 5 in a recitative which bach set for soprano librettist added to luther s text what hofmann calls essentially a free extension of its ideological content bach led first performance of cantata on 29 october 1724 music structure and scoring bach structured cantata in six movements text and tune of hymn are retained in outer choral movements a chorale fantasia and a four part closing chorale which frame two sets of recitative and aria bach scored work for four vocal soloists soprano alto tenor bass a four part choir and a baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones tb two oboes ob two violins vl viola va and basso continuo this is one of three bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts soprano alto tenor and bass others being ach gott vom himmel sieh darein bwv 2 and ich hatte viel bekummernis bwv 21 instruments play colla parte with voices in outer movements in style of bach s motets in following table of movements scoring follows neue bach ausgabe keys and time signatures are taken from alfred durr using symbol for common time 4 4 continuo playing throughout is not shown movements in this cantata bach used chorale melody not only in opening chorale fantasia and closing chorale but also in inner movements he built an aria theme from parts of melody as in movement 3 used melody as a continuo line movement 4 and took motifs from melody american musicologist eric chafe suggests that entire cantata is also based on a design that descends tonally for first five movements and rises again in closing chorale exploiting textual theme of destruction followed by restoration 1 opening movement is a chorale fantasia out of deep anguish i call to you on hymn tune in phrygian mode it combines structure of a motet with chromatic and dissonant harmonies as in his motets and chorale cantata ach gott vom himmel sieh darein bwv 2 bach uses old style of scoring with all instruments doubling vocal parts bach scholar klaus hofmann notes that bach s use of older musical style may reflect bach pointing back at source luther s paraphrase of a text from old testament lower voices begin each line with imitation on melody to come which is then presented in long notes by soprano as a cantus firmus musicologist julian mincham interprets imitative counterpoint as a portrayal of individual cries of distress which coalesce to form a combined human clamour john eliot gardiner who conducted bach cantata pilgrimage in 2000 compares style to both heinrich schutz and anton bruckner observing that although using means of older masters bach push es frontiers of this motet movement almost out of stylistic reach through abrupt chromatic twists to this tune in phrygian mode 2 like fantasia alto recitative in jesus grace alone is stylistically archaic bach scholar alfred durr describes secco recitative as plain but forcefully declaimed mincham notes that its semi chaotic form may reflect tumult of evil and sin movement maintains a archaic modal feel but with a continuo line that seems to lack coherence one normally expects from a bach bass 3 tenor aria i hear in midst of my sorrows is expressive with a prominent syncopated rhythmic motif which runs throughout movement tenor line is part of a four part texture with oboes and continuo oboes play continuously interwoven chromatic lines luther intended contrasting ideas of psalm to represent contradictory and disharmonious things for hope and despair are opposites and wrote in his song that we must hope in despair because hope which forms new man grows in midst of fear that cuts down old adam 4 a soprano recitative alas that my faith is yet so weak adopts a modified version of chorale melody as continuo line gardiner notes uncompromising way of changing normal order soprano usually singing a chorale cantus firmus firm song to continuo expresses weakness and insecurity here marked a battuta while firm foundation is chorale in bass to which text of stanza three therefore i will hope in god could be imagined gardiner points out a detail word zeichen sign is given expressive symbolic expression a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word formed by all three signs one sharp f sharp one flat e flat and one natural c as eric chafe concludes 5 trio aria when my troubles like chains compares to a trio as part of cantata du friedefurst herr jesu christ bwv 116 composed three weeks earlier then expressing alas we confess our sins this is one of only three trios in this cantata cycle in this movement despair like chains fetters one misfortune to next is contrasted to shall my saviour free me suddenly from it all presented as akin to morning following night bach expresses despair by a descending sequential ritornello based on circle of fifths through minor keys d g c f finally reaching b flat major whereas dawning of faith is illustrated with an upward motion mincham characterizes ritornello as comfortably conventional in contrast with convoluted theme hofmann notes operatic quality of movement when for example on words so that everything suddenly releases me polyphony suddenly resolves to homophony 6 four part setting of closing chorale although sins among us are many begins with a dissonant chord interpreted by hofmann as a last cry of anguish in an almost romantic manner gardiner comments with all voices given full orchestral doubling again those four trombones this chorale is impressive terrifying in its lutheran zeal mincham notes setting s enigmatic final cadence which leaves us with a sense that human
