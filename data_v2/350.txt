mike boxleiter in 2007 where they worked on dinowaurs and other small adobe flash games trained as an artist wohlwend worked mainly on visual assets as mikengreg they released solipskier 2010 ios whose success let two take a more experimental approach with gasketball which did not fare as well at same time wohlwend collaborated with asher vollmer to make puzzlejuice and with adam saltsman to make hundreds based on wohlwend s first game design he later released threes with vollmer in 2014 to critical acclaim his later games touchtone and tumbleseed were also products of collaborations wohlwend was named among forbes 2014 30 under 30 in games industry career thumb animation of app icons designed by wohlwend wohlwend studied graphic design at iowa state university and graduated in 2008 he has described his aesthetic as simple and elegant and has said about his practice that he is not good at character design and that he prefers to work with vector file formats in adobe illustrator so that images can work at all resolutions wohlwend also feels that creativity is a skill that is cultivated and not inborn he has been influenced by his lifelong experience playing video games and his favorite game is baldur s gate ii shadows of amn his writings on lifestyle required for indie development have been noted by games journalists wohlwend was named among forbes 2014 30 under 30 in games industry intuition and mikengreg wohlwend met mike boxleiter in an experimental video game development class they took together at iowa state university wohlwend had attempted to help boxleiter with a project but quit after drawing a few aliens they met again as coworkers at university s virtual reality application center during boxleiter s final year of college upon discovering their close interests they began to work on an adobe flash game named dinowaurs while they completed college so as to make money while they worked on game they founded intuition games at university s research park around may 2007 they decided to stay in ames iowa due to its financial feasibility and local connections but two other team members friends from iowa state lived farther away they saw flash games as an easy entry point into full time self employment but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as wiiware thumb left upright boxleiter in their development process boxleiter and wohlwend both proposed and worked on each other s ideas and would drop ideas they found unexciting wohlwend said they often argued over aspects of their games which he found normal and natural their labor as a team was divided in that wohlwend always did art and boxleiter programming as reflective of their skills at time pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as left brain right brain and saw majority of their joint work as editing aside from business aspects they were grateful to have creative freedom to do their own work wohlwend appreciated benefits of not doing contract work but struggled with relative isolation of having few colleagues a low salary and job instability he disagreed with cinematic action games he saw to be popular at time and hoped to contribute more compelling ideas to young industry they thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental boxleiter and wohlwend worked long hours when making flash games which they found exciting and unsustainable at intuition they worked on games such as dinowaurs gray fig 8 and and participated in at least six game jams as of april 2010 they had created 10 games together intuition s first game dinowaurs is a flash based strategy and action game where two players compete as dinosaurs to seize most cavemen settlements so as to upgrade their own capacity and eventually kill other dinosaur it features online matchmaking concept came from one of boxleiter s unfinished projects and another intuition member s drawing of a stegosaurus with a jetpack team was funded then new flash site kongregate by november 2007 as one of first five games for kongregate platform it was finished in two years for a 2009 release indiegames com reported mixed reviews from players their later games would only take a few months each in comparison they abandoned use of design documents after dinowaurs and instead chose to refine and experiment in process intuition released effing hail and gray around april 2009 players in action game effing hail control hail and wind to destroy most buildings and midair objects within a time limit game was published through kongregate in gray players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in crowd game was featured at indiecade in 2009 in case of fig 8 wohlwend thought of idea based on a college art project in project wohlwend followed a bike trail in snow metaphorically related it to tribulations of romantic relationship and made an art installation involving a bike spray painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on floor concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea whereupon boxleiter added game mechanics to visuals in their next game liferaft player character is a young woman set to escape a post apocalyptic sci fi test chamber with core gameplay that revolves around a bionic commando style grappling hook wohlwend used a 16 bit era graphics style they sought crowdfunding from kickstarter but later canceled and put project on hiatus in october 2009 in march 2010 and under moniker mikengreg boxleiter and wohlwend s 4fourths was selected for s gamma iv showcase based on showcase s one button game theme four players control two spaceships using one button apiece to cooperatively destroy enemy ships it was michael rose of com favorite game of gamma iv selections was later displayed at 2010 game developers conference and in brandon boyer s 2011 wild rumpus event mikengreg announced liferaft zero and solipskier in november 2010 former is a prequel teaser to liferaft a game of trial based challenges with wall jumping and grappling wherein girl clones attempt to swing and jump around test chambers to reach and ring a bell wohlwend and boxleiter made shorter version to limit scope creep of overall project indiegames com named flash game their third best browser platformer of year their other game 4fourths was put on hiatus for lack of resources they were interested in making games outside flash market solipskier thumb wohlwend s solipskier high score run their first game as mikengreg was sport inspired solipskier where player s finger draws ground for on screen skier to pass through a level filled with gates tunnels and walls it was designed as a flash game which set limitations for its mechanics game concept came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling and was revised in fits of creativity they paired parallax scrolling with speed and began to prototype wohlwend saved skier s character design for last since he felt it was his weakest area mikengreg then decided to develop for ios in addition to flash and to release both versions simultaneously it was released simultaneously for kongregate flash and ios on august 29 2010 solipskier became their first game to receive public appreciation ios version made around 70 000 in its first two months as compared to 15 000 from flash release which gave them enough stability to branch out into non flash platforms gasketball thumb left 150px gasketball icon riding earnings from solipskier mikengreg continued to pay themselves their same salary but now had means to try new ideas wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six fairly polished prototypes over development of their next game gasketball they were able to live on 20 25 000 a year each in iowa for next two years while working on new game wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations such as puzzlejuice with asher vollmer but shared his income with boxleiter even though solipskier was successful duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like team meat and thus felt like their external pressure was low instead their pressure was internal wohlwend said he worked 100 hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living off of solipskier funds in making gasketball boxleiter and wohlwend felt that their game quality had improved continually but found idea of a million person audience daunting wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate solipskier success when they ran out of money boxleiter borrowed money from his parents and eventually they both went homeless living off of couches of friends gasketball was released for ipad on august 9 2012 they had decided to release game as an ethically non coercive free to play game with a free base game and in app purchases for extended content not as many players paid for content as expected this was due in part to players difficulty in finding purchase function game had been downloaded 200 000 times in its august 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near top of an itunes top downloads ranking though it did not break top 200 grossing chart puzzlejuice wohlwend began to collaborate with asher vollmer when vollmer reached out to wohlwend for aesthetic advice on a game he was designing puzzlejuice game has been compared to a cross between boggle tetris and tile matching where blocks fall from top of screen that players turn into letters and rearrange into words wohlwend and vollmer communicated through entire development process via a 365 message email chain vollmer served as game s programmer wohlwend as artist and jimmy hinson as composer puzzlejuice was selected for pax 10 a spotlighted group of indie games in july 2012 it was released as a universal app for iphone and ipad on january 19 2012 hundreds upon finishing his role as artist on solipskier wohlwend wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game he developed hundreds from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing he found this to be a good core game concept and based game around patience and persistence game s style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school where wohlwend composed in black white and red so as to focus on composition rather than color while wohlwend s design style is simple and elegant game s minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming code was brute forced and written in a single file he finished hundreds as a flash game in 2010 but when flash sites were not interested in purchasing it wohlwend chose to open source code partly with intent to spur non coders to try coding as he had this version is available online at newgrounds at a lull in between projects programmer eric johnson of semi secret software found open source code and ported game to ipad in a weekend before notifying wohlwend at time wohlwend did not have an ios device to test port and had to purchase an ipad johnson s ipad version spurred wohlwend to consider how hundreds would work with multitouch and cooperative play and semi secret s adam saltsman to consider a hundreds collaborative ios release project was intended to be a quick level expansion but quickly surpassed its several month estimate wohlwend and saltsman extended game s mechanics with new circles and puzzles and many of their implemented ideas were later removed wohlwend was happy with final result and credited game s emergent interaction qualities to saltsman they built on each other s level designs though wohlwend said that saltsman made basically all levels new team enjoyed working with each other in hundreds players touch circles to make them grow without overlapping there are 100 puzzles that increase in complexity flash version was much simpler in design and added circles onscreen as game progressed ios version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes and was released on january 7 2013 for iphone and ipad and later for android it was nominated for several independent games festival awards and atlantic critic ian bogost wrote that game functioned like a design object a feat unique for video game medium ridiculous fishing wohlwend produced art for vlambeer s ridiculous fishing four person designer jan willem and marketer rami ismail alongside ios developer zach described by games journalists as an indie supergroup and a dream team in ridiculous fishing player uses motion and touch controls to catch fish and consequently shoot them out of sky for cash game is known for its developers battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company team worked separately and sporadically with little progress as disheartened by their cloned game predicament until an august 2012 road trip home across united states from penny arcade expo in seattle to new york city convinced team to set a deadline they scrapped 90 percent of their work and wohlwend moved to new york city to live with gage and work 14 hour days during final weeks last parts of ridiculous fishing assembled smoothly and it was released march 14 2013 for ios and later that year for android it was well received at launch with near universal perfect scores and won both a 2013 apple design award and apple s iphone game of year while ign s justin davis thought game s levels could have been more differentiated in theme and art style he found almost cubist design absolutely gorgeous welsh of eurogamer agreed that wohlwend s art was achingly cool and reflected a retro and minimalist indie gaming trend without overpowering gameplay threes wohlwend vollmer and hinson of puzzlejuice collaborated again on threes a game where player slides numbered tiles on a four by four grid to combine addends and multiples of three its development began before ridiculous fishing march 2013 release vollmer presented an idea similar to final product in its simplicity pair tiles as multiples of three first prototype was written in a single night vollmer and wohlwend spent at least half a year of game s 14 month development iterating on this main idea early threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism pair felt that game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players wohlwend sent vollmer designs with themes such as sushi chess broccoli and cheese soup and hydrogen atoms which confused their test audiences they received a wake up call from fellow game designer zach gage who encouraged them to return from their foray into complexity final game returned to its original theme of numbers speaking in retrospect wohlwend said game always wanted to be simple he noted that players think math upon seeing game s numbers though game is more about spatial relationships and just happens to have a number theme when returning to fundamental and original game tiles as multiples of developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions theme of individual tile personalities extended to final version as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired for example 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch of development process wohlwend called it tough and frustrating and sometimes hard to see if it was worth it it was released for ios on february 6 2014 and later ported to android with an xbox one version announced as in development game received what video game review score aggregator metacritic described as universal acclaim eurogamer and toucharcade awarded game perfect scores with latter calling threes about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game re code reported that it dominated chart in following weeks and became one of 25 highest grossing apps on app store it later won a 2014 apple design award touchtone after gasketball 2012 release boxleiter and wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in victoria british columbia game did not fare as expected so boxleiter used two day jam to create core mirror reflection mechanics of what would become touchtone though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize remainder of game in touchtone player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein player swipes screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination mikengreg felt that their first theme of light prisms and audio signal too closely mimicked a hacking minigame from a bigger aaa game like bioshock or system shock but eventually paired concept with a satirical edward snowden theme following mid 2013 global surveillance disclosures their original efforts were jocular but their concept became more serious as story and political message grew deeper boxleiter wrote most of script and together with wohlwend would conference after each chapter for coherency mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles which they felt would spoil game and player s capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty they called this philosophy derek yu of school of game design touchtone was released on march 19 2015 for ios review aggregator metacritic characterized its reviews as generally favorable tumbleseed thumb upright 6 left wohlwend and tumbleseed development team wohlwend s friend benedict fritz developed a prototype of a mechanical arcade game from a bar that they frequented in chicago when wohlwend saw video of ice cold beer online they began work on an open world dungeon crawl version of game which became tumbleseed they also worked through a cards against humanity game incubation program in 2015 and several other indie developers based in chicago joined production based on project s loose collaboratory nature metro called game s pedigree as indie as indie gaming gets with announcement of nintendo switch development team sought to become a flagship demonstration of console s hd rumble feature in which player feels in game textures through controller s fine tuned vibrations they cold called nintendo and began work together in june 2016 prior to switch s announcement tumbleseed was released on may 2 2017 on nintendo switch macos playstation 4 and windows platforms developers credited game s tepid critical reception and associated stigma of intense difficulty for game s slow sales while wohlwend hoped that a post release patch would resolve some of these issues he did not expect game to recoup its costs though team was proud of their product see also wohlwend s postmortem of development process june 22 2017 notes and
