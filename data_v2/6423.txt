northern england also known as north of england or simply north is northern part of england considered as a single cultural area it extends from scottish border in north to near river trent in south although precise definitions of its southern extent vary northern england approximately comprises three statistical regions north east north west and yorkshire and humber these have a combined population of around 14 9 million as of 2011 census and an area of 37 331 km2 14 414 sq mi northern england contains much of england s national parkland but also has large areas of urbanisation including conurbations of greater manchester merseyside teesside tyneside wearside and south and west yorkshire region has been controlled by many groups from brigantes largest brythonic kingdom of great britain to romans to anglo saxons and danes after norman conquest in 1066 harrying of north brought destruction area experienced anglo scottish border fighting until personal union of england and scotland under stuarts with some parts changing hands between england and scotland many times many of innovations of industrial revolution began in northern england and its cities were crucibles of many of political changes that accompanied this social upheaval from trade unionism to manchester capitalism in late 19th and early 20th centuries economy of north was dominated by heavy industry such as weaving shipbuilding steel making and mining deindustrialisation that followed in second half of 20th century hit northern england hard and many towns remain deprived compared with those in southern england urban renewal projects and transition to a service economy have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of northern england but a definite north south divide remains both in economy and culture of england centuries of migration invasion and labour have shaped northern culture and region retains distinctive dialects music and cuisine definitions for government and statistical purposes northern england is defined as area covered by three statistical regions of north east england north west england and yorkshire and humber this area consists of ceremonial counties of cheshire cumbria county durham east riding of yorkshire greater manchester lancashire merseyside northumberland north yorkshire south yorkshire tyne and wear and west yorkshire plus unitary authority areas of north lincolnshire and north east lincolnshire this definition will be used in this article except when otherwise stated thumb left northern england as defined along

taken to comprise cumberland northumberland westmorland county durham lancashire and yorkshire often supplemented by cheshire or are drawn without reference to human borders using geographic features such as river mersey and river trent isle of man is occasionally included in definitions of north for example by survey of english dialects and bbc north west although it is politically and culturally distinct from england some areas of derbyshire lincolnshire nottinghamshire and staffordshire have northern characteristics and include satellites of northern cities towns in high peak borough of derbyshire are included in greater manchester built up area as villages and hamlets there such as tintwistle crowden and woodhead were formerly in cheshire before local government boundary changes in 1974 due to their close proximity to city of manchester and before this borough was considered to be part of greater manchester statutory city region more recently chesterfield north east derbyshire bolsover and derbyshire dales districts have joined with districts of south yorkshire to form sheffield city region along with district of nottinghamshire although for all other purposes these districts still remain in their respective east midlands counties geographer danny dorling includes most of west midlands and part of east midlands in his definition of north claiming that ideas of a midlands region add more confusion than light conversely more restrictive definitions also exist typically based on extent of historical northumbria which exclude cheshire and lincolnshire personal definitions of north vary greatly and are sometimes passionately debated when asked to draw a dividing line between north and south southerners tend to draw this line further south than northerners do from southern perspective northern england is sometimes defined jokingly as area north of watford gap between northampton and leicester a definition which would include much of midlands various cities and towns have been described as or promoted themselves as gateway to north including crewe stoke on trent and sheffield for some in northernmost reaches of england north starts somewhere in north yorkshire around river tees yorkshire poet simon armitage suggests thirsk northallerton or richmond and does not include cities like manchester and leeds nor majority of yorkshire northern england is not a homogenous unit and some have entirely rejected idea that north exists as a coherent entity claiming that considerable cultural differences across area overwhelm any similarities geography thumb

which stretches from tyne gap to peak district other uplands in north include lake district with england s highest mountains cheviot hills adjoining border with scotland and north york moors near north sea coastline geography of north has been heavily shaped by ice sheets of pleistocene era which often reached as far south as midlands glaciers carved deep craggy valleys in central uplands and when they melted deposited large quantities of fluvio glacial material in lowland areas like cheshire and solway plains on eastern side of pennines a former glacial lake forms levels a large area of fenland which drains into humber and which is very fertile and productive farmland thumb left alt lush hills beyond a long narrow lake scafell pike england s highest peak alongside wastwater its

treeless areas in europe and to combat this government plans to plant over 50 million trees in a new northern forest across region thumb right alt a satellite photo of british isles at night urban sprawl in southern pennines and north east coast is clearly visible in night time imagery dense urban areas have emerged along coasts and rivers and they run almost contiguously into each other in places needs of trade and industry have produced an almost continuous thread of urbanisation from wirral peninsula to doncaster taking in cities of liverpool manchester leeds and sheffield with a population of at least 7 6 million uniquely for such a large urban belt in europe these cities are all recent most of them started as scattered villages with no shared identity before industrial revolution on east coast trade fuelled growth of major ports such as kingston upon hull and newcastle upon tyne and riverside conurbations of teesside tyneside and wearside became largest towns in north east northern england is now heavily urbanised analysis by northern way in 2006 found that 90 of population of north lived in one of its city regions liverpool central lancashire manchester sheffield leeds hull and humber ports tees valley and tyne and wear as of 2011 census 86 of northern population lived in urban areas as defined by office for national statistics compared to 82 for england as a whole natural resources peat is found in thick plentiful layers across pennines and scottish borders and there are many large coalfields including great northern lancashire and south yorkshire coalfields millstone grit a distinctive coarse grained rock used to make millstones is widespread in pennines and variety of other rock types is reflected in architecture of region such as bright red sandstone seen in buildings in chester cream buff and distinctive purple sandstone these sandstones also mean that apart from east coast most of northern england has very soft water and this has influenced not just industry but even blends of tea enjoyed in region rich deposits of iron ore are found in cumbria and north east and fluorspar and baryte are also plentiful in northern parts of pennines salt mining in cheshire has a long history and both remaining rock salt mines in great britain are in north winsford mine in cheshire and mine in north yorkshire which also produces half of uk s potash climate thumb left alt women rushing to get out of rain although manchester has a reputation as a rainy city it is far from wettest in north upright 1 1 northern england has a cool wet oceanic climate with small areas of subpolar oceanic climate in uplands calculated using data from org averaged across entire region northern england is cooler wetter and cloudier than england as a whole and contains both england s coldest point cross fell and its rainiest point fell its temperature range and sunshine duration is similar to uk average and it sees substantially less rain than scotland or wales these averages disguise considerable variation across region due chiefly to upland regions and adjacent seas prevailing winds across british isles are westerlies bringing moisture from atlantic ocean this means that west coast frequently receives strong winds and heavy rainfall while east coast lies in a rain shadow behind pennines as a result teesside and northumbrian coast are driest regions in north with around of rain per year while parts of lake district receive over lowland regions in more southern parts of northern england such as cheshire and south yorkshire are warmest with average maximum july temperatures of over while highest points in pennines and lake district reach only area has a reputation for cloud and fog especially along its east coast which experiences a distinctive sea fog known as fret although clean air act 1956 and decline of heavy industry have seen sunshine duration increase in urban areas in recent years language and dialect english thumb right vowel sound in sun across england all of northern england as well as part of midlands is included inside u alt a map of england with showing how different regions pronounce sun english spoken today in north has been shaped by area s history and some dialects retain features inherited from old norse and local celtic languages dialects spoken in north include cumbrian geordie tyneside mancunian manchester northumbrian northumberland former mining communities of northumberland county durham scouse liverpool and tyke yorkshire linguists have attempted to define a northern dialect area corresponding to area north of a line that begins at humber estuary and runs up river wharfe and across to river lune in north lancashire this area corresponds roughly to of old english northumbrian dialect although linguistic elements that defined this area in past such as use of doon instead of down and substitution of an ang sound in words that end ong lang instead of long are now prevalent only in more northern parts of region as speech has changed there is little consensus on what defines a northern accent or dialect northern english accents have not undergone trap bath split and a common to distinguish them from southern ones is northern use of short a near open front vowel in words such as bath and castle on opposite border most northern english accents can be distinguished from scottish accents because they are non rhotic although a few rhotic lancashire accents remain other features common to many northern english accents are absence of foot strut split so put and putt are and t to r rule that leads to pronunciation of t as a rhotic consonant in phrases like get up definite article is often missed out of a sentence for example put kettle on becomes put kettle on when preceded by function word to ie are you going to pub sound is used often written as t same question would be spoken as are you going t pub it is erroneously thought that t is an abbreviation of however it is in fact an abbreviation of to this error is often promulgated by southern comedians pronouns thou and thee survive in some northern english dialects although these are dying out outside very rural areas and many dialects have an informal second person plural pronoun either ye common in north east or common in areas with historical irish communities many dialects use me as a possessive me car and some treat us likewise us cars or use alternative wor wor cars possessive pronouns are also used to mark names of relatives in speech for example a relative called joan would be referred to as our joan in conversation with urbanisation distinctive urban accents have arisen which often differ greatly from historical accents of surrounding rural areas and sometimes share features with southern english accents northern english dialects remain an important part of culture of region and desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as scouse and geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas other languages there are no recognised minority languages in northern england although northumbrian language society campaigns to have northumbrian dialect recognised as a separate language traces of now extinct brythonic celtic languages from region survive in some rural areas in yan tan counting systems traditionally used by shepherds contact between english and immigrant languages has given rise to new accents and dialects for instance variety of english spoken by poles in manchester is distinct both from typical polish accented english and from mancunian at a local level diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in country as a whole have strongholds in northern towns bradford for instance has largest proportion of pashto speakers while manchester has most cantonese speakers history prehistoric north thumb right upright 0 8 monolith

then saw a golden age in cultural scholarly and monastic activity centred on lindisfarne and aided by irish monks north west of england retains vestiges of a celtic culture and had its own celtic language cumbric spoken predominately in cumbria until around 12th century parts of north and east of england were subject to danish control danelaw during viking era but northern part of old anglo saxon kingdom of northumbria remained under anglo saxon control under vikings monasteries were largely wiped out and discovery of grave goods in northern churchyards suggests that norse funeral rites

northern lancashire and county durham region was gripped by famine and much of northern england was deserted chroniclers at time reported a hundred thousand deaths modern estimates place total somewhere in tens of thousands out of a population of two million when domesday book was compiled in 1086 much of northern england was still recorded as wasteland although this may have been in part

reverted to english control in 1157 establishing for most part modern england scotland border region also saw violence during great raid of 1322 when robert bruce invaded and raided whole of northern england there was also wars of roses including decisive battle of wakefield although modern day conception of war as a conflict between lancashire and yorkshire is anachronistic lancastrians recruited from across northern england including yorkshire while yorkists drew most of their power from southern england wales and ireland anglo scottish wars also touched region and in just 400 years berwick upon tweed now northernmost town in england changed hands more than a dozen times wars also saw thousands of scots settle south of border chiefly in border counties and yorkshire early modern era after english reformation north saw several catholic uprisings including lincolnshire rising bigod s rebellion in cumberland and westmorland and largest of all yorkshire based pilgrimage of grace all against henry viii his daughter elizabeth i faced another catholic rebellion rising of north region would become centre of recusancy as prominent catholic families in cumbria lancashire and yorkshire refused to convert to protestantism royal power over region was exercised through council of north at king s manor york which was founded in 1484 by richard iii council existed intermittently for next two centuries its final incarnation was created in aftermath of pilgrimage of grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice northern england was a focal point for fighting during wars of three kingdoms border counties were invaded by scotland in second bishops war and at 1640 treaty of ripon king charles i was forced to temporarily cede northumberland and county durham to scots and pay to keep scottish armies there to raise enough funds and ratify final peace treaty charles had to call what became long parliament beginning process that led to first english civil war in 1641 long parliament abolished council of north for perceived abuses during personal rule period by time war broke out in 1642 king charles had moved his court to york and

industrial world heritage sites in north alt a large mill above a weir on a wide river at beginning of industrial revolution northern england had plentiful coal and water power while poor agriculture in uplands meant that labour in area was cheap mining and milling which had been practiced on a small scale in area for generations began to grow and centralise boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres although success of northern fabric mills has no single clear source readily available coal and

catholic riots and protestant orange orders proliferated across northern england chiefly in lancashire but also elsewhere in north by 1881 there were 374 orange organisations in lancashire 71 in north east and 42 in yorkshire from further afield northern england saw immigration from european countries such as germany italy poland russia and scandinavia some immigrants were well to do industrialists seeking to do business in booming industrial cities some were escaping poverty some were servants or slaves some were sailors who chose to settle in port towns some were jews fleeing pogroms on continent and some were migrants originally stranded at liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to united states or to colonies of british empire at same time hundreds of thousands from

more than double that at 5 5 but in 1937 during great depression outer british unemployment rate was 16 1 and southern rate was less than half that at 7 1 weakening economy and interwar unemployment caused several episodes of social unrest in region including 1926 general strike and jarrow march great depression highlighted weakness of northern england s specialised economy as world trade declined demand for ships steel coal and textiles all fell for most part northern factories were still using nineteenth century technology and were not able to keep up with advances in industries such as motors chemicals and electricals while expansion of electric grid removed north s advantages in terms of power generation and meant it was now more economic to build new factories in midlands or south industrial concentration in northern england made it a major target for luftwaffe attacks during second world war blitz of 1940 1941 saw major raids on barrow in furness hull leeds manchester merseyside newcastle and sheffield with thousands killed and significant damage to cities liverpool a vital port for supplies from north america was especially hard hit city was most bombed in uk outside london with around 4 000 deaths across merseyside and most of city centre destroyed rebuilding that followed and simultaneous slum clearance that saw whole neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt transformed faces of northern cities immigration from new commonwealth especially pakistan and bangladesh starting in 1950s reshaped northern england once more and there are now significant populations from indian subcontinent in towns and cities such as bradford leeds preston and sheffield deindustrialisation continued and unemployment gradually increased during 1970s but accelerated during government of margaret thatcher who chose not to encourage growth in north if it risked growth in south era saw 1984 85 miners strike which brought hardship for many northern mining towns northern metropolitan county councils which were labour strongholds often with very left wing leadership such as militant dominated liverpool and so called people s republic of south yorkshire had high profile conflicts with national government increasing awareness of north south divide strengthened distinct northern english identity which despite regeneration in some of major cities remains to this day region saw several ira attacks during troubles including m62 coach bombing warrington bomb attacks and 1992 and 1996 manchester bombings latter was largest bomb detonation in great britain since end of second world war and damaged or destroyed much of central manchester attack led to manchester s ageing infrastructure being rebuilt and modernised sparking regeneration of city and making

lancaster form n8 research partnership there is a significant attainment gap between northern and southern schools and pupils in three northern regions are less likely than national average to achieve five higher tier gcses although this may be down to economic disadvantages faced by northern pupils rather than an actual difference in school quality northern students are under represented at oxbridge where three times as many places go to southerners as to northerners and other southern universities while southerners are under represented at leading northern universities such as sheffield

of 2017 is northern powerhouse north has also been a significant recipient of european union structural funds between 2007 and 2013 eu funds created around 70 000 jobs in region and majority of northern powerhouse funding comes from european regional development fund and european investment bank loss of these funds following brexit combined with potential reductions in exports to eu has been identified as a threat to northern growth public sector public sector is a major employer in northern england between 2000 and 2008 majority of new jobs created in northern england were for government and its suppliers and contractors all three northern regions have public sector employment above national average and north east has highest level in england with 20 2 of workforce in public sector as of 2016 down from 23 4 a decade earlier austerity programme under government of david cameron saw significant cuts to public services and reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses

sheep with thick stringy wool in a field there are of farmland in northern england rough pennine terrain means that most of northern england is unsuited for growing crops like scotland northern farming was traditionally dominated by oats which grow better than wheat in poor soil today mix of cereals and vegetables grown is similar to that of uk as a whole but only a minority of land is arable only 32 of northern farmland is primarily used for growing crops compared to 49 for england as a whole conversely 57 of land is given over to rearing livestock and 33 of england s cattle 43 of its pigs and 46 of its sheep and lambs are reared in north only part of region that is predominantly given over to crops is land around humber estuary where well drained fens result in excellent quality land lowland cheshire plain is mostly given over to dairy farming while in pennines and grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally heather moorland in pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 august glorious twelfth until 10 december every year number of grouse moors in northern england is a major threat to

important industry for northern coastal towns major fishing ports include fleetwood grimsby hull and whitby at its height grimsby was largest fishing port in world but northern fishing industry suffered greatly from a series of events in second half of twentieth century cod wars with iceland and establishment of exclusive economic zone ended british access to rich north atlantic fishing grounds while north sea was badly overfished and european common fisheries policy put strict quotas on catches to protect almost depleted stocks grimsby is now transitioning to processing of imported
