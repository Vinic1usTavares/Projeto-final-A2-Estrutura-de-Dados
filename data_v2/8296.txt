battle of olive grove of kountouras took place in summer of 1205 in messenia in peloponnese peninsula between frankish crusaders and local greeks resulting in a victory of frankish knights and collapse of local resistance in 1204 constantinople capital city of byzantine empire was taken by crusaders of fourth crusade and republic of venice this led to collapse of byzantine empire and establishment of latin empire meanwhile a crusader force of between 500 and 700 knights under command of william of champlitte and geoffrey i of villehardouin advanced into peloponnese to deal with byzantine resistance in olive grove of kountouras in messenia they confronted an army of around 5 000 peloponnesian greeks under command of a certain michael in ensuing battle crusaders emerged victorious forcing byzantines to retreat and crushing resistance in peloponnese this battle paved way for foundation of principality of achaea background army of fourth crusade conquered constantinople on 12 april 1204 one of main leaders of crusade boniface of montferrat having lost opportunity to become emperor went on to found kingdom of thessalonica that autumn william of champlitte followed him to thessalonica but then continued south until he reached morea peloponnese there he was joined by geoffrey i of villehardouin who had sailed to modon on his way back from palestine there geoffrey of villehardouin had entered service of a local greek magnate his rivals and had gained impression that country was easy to take when magnate died his son broke off alliance with him but villehardouin learning that crusaders under boniface were besieging greek magnate leo sgouros in nauplia and acrocorinth in northwest set out to seek his aid boniface sought to retain him in his own service but villehardouin teamed up with his fellow champlitte whom he enticed with tales of richness of land and with a pledge to recognize him as his lord boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers champlitte and villehardouin set out together to conquer morea towns of patras and fell without struggle and at latter champlitte received homage of local magnates and people of skorta and from there franks moved south along coast accompanied by a fleet easily taking fortress of which they repaired and garrisoned they bypassed strong fortress of arkadia kyparissia and passing through navarino arrived at modon they repaired fortress walls long ago torn down by venetians to stop its use as a pirate base and assaulted nearby fort of coron which fell after a single day and town of kalamata which surrendered battle right thumb 280px map of peloponnese in middle ages at no point romans of laconia and arcadia under leadership of a certain trump tried to stop frankenstein at olive grove of kountouras in northeastern messenia modern scholars have traditionally identified this michael with michael i komnenos doukas founder of despotate of epirus but this identification has been questioned more recently by raymond joseph loenertz as fragile nature of his control over epirus would have made a departure to aid moreote greeks a major and unlikely gamble events of conquest are narrated by two sources various versions of chronicle of morea and on conquest of constantinople by crusader geoffrey of villehardouin uncle of geoffrey i according to chronicle franks had between 500 and 700 men while greeks had 4 000 mounted and on foot elder villehardouin states that army of michael who is not mentioned by chronicle numbered 5 000 men and that of franks 500 two sources also differ in exact chronology of events with chronicle placing battle after frankish capture of kalamata and elder villehardouin after seizure of modon in any case despite being outnumbered franks after a march of a single day confronted greeks and won battle no details for which are given exact location of olive grove of kountouras in messenia is unknown greek version of chronicle records apart from owner s name kountouras or variant form a location name kepeskianous kepeskianous while a variant form is recorded as kapsikia kapsikia efforts have been made to identify locality with some linking it with modern village of west of mantinea in arcadia but this is too far from reported area of battle based on sources and furthermore olive trees do not grow in region in geoffrey s own account battle is described thus so william of champlitte and geoffry of villehardouin nephew departed from host and took with them about a hundred knights and a great number of mounted sergeants and entered into land of morea and rode onwards till they came to city of modon michael heard that they were in land with so few people and he collected together a great number of people a number that was marvellous and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners and in his hand and when they heard tell that he was coming they refortified modon where defences had long since been pulled down and there left their baggage and lesser folk then they rode out a day s march and ordered their array with as many people as they had but odds seemed too great for they had no more than five hundred men mounted whereas on other part there were well over five thousand but events happen as god pleases for our people fought with greeks and discomfited and conquered them and greeks lost very heavily while those on our side gained horses and arms enough and other goods in very great plenty and so returned very happy and very joyously to city of modon in greek version of chronicle of morea battle is described in verses 1720 1738 original greek text is from to tou edition by p athens 1940 they heard and they learned that franks had come and that they walked through villages and took gains of war and they said and they thought they had been harmed over there they were drawn they call it kepeskianous where they name it olive grove of kountouras they were four thousand on foot and mounted franks though when they learned it from romans since they were together with them and they knew place there they drew them they came and they found them and war they gave franks and romans romans was name that byzantine greeks were using to describe themselves cf names of greeks and franks were not on foot and mounted but just seven hundred that many they thought eagerly did romans start war because they saw them few but later they were sorry why shall i tell you a lot and what do we care war they won then those franks they slaughtered them all a few did escape that was only war romans made during time that franks won morea aftermath battle of olive grove of kountouras was decisive for conquest of peloponnese by franks as it represented last general effort of local greeks to resist eminent historian of frankish greece william miller likened battle to a hastings of morea writing that fate of morea like that of saxon england was decided by a single pitched battle after their victory crusaders rested for a while in rich plain of messenia champlitte called a council of war to determine their future strategy and sent fleet which until then had accompanied them home in late 1205 or 1206 crusaders went on to capture arkadia whose siege lasted for some time as well as fortress of whose resistance was led by celebrated warrior by this time entire northern and western of peninsula was under rule of champlitte northwest belonged to duchy of athens under suzerainty of boniface of montferrat although leo sgouros and his men still held out in their two fortresses and laconia and mountains of and remained still unsubdued nevertheless first stage of frankish conquest was complete and in a letter to pope innocent iii on 19 november 1205 champlitte claimed for himself title princeps totius provincie establishing a new state principality of achaea references sources category 1205
