rounded character who is one of strongest fighters in game he also lays claim to a variety of healing magics and has fairly average statistical growth kiefer is a prince of estard and presumptive heir to throne far from anticipating his elevation to kingship however kiefer seems to resent his royal blood and is a source of endless worry and frustration to his family and advisors kiefer for his part spends much of his time in search of excitement and adventure and has found a kindred spirit in hero whom he considers his closest friend kiefer is incredibly strong with a high physical attack

accompanies them on their adventuring even if she sometimes has to pressure them into letting her tag along maribel is primarily a magic user with low starting physical statistics and an early lack of powerful weapons available for her use it takes a good deal of time before she can do anything approaching amount of physical damage inflicted by some of other characters on other hand maribel has access to a variety of damaging attack spells relatively early on she is forced to leave party when her father falls ill but unlike kiefer she can rejoin them later on known as ruff in 3ds english

his diminutive size he can easily become as powerful as hero melvin and aira through mastery of class system known as mervyn in 3ds english translation a skilled paladin of generations past melvin fought on side of god against demon lord many years ago melvin excelled at his work and distinguished himself in both skill and honor as such melvin was petrified in stone by god so that should need arise he could be reawakened to once again take up fight against evil party finds melvin who joins their adventure although his age and unfamiliarity with present day often leave other characters

aira is lead ritual dancer of deja tribe an ancient race of people charged with stewardship of a temple necessary in act of calling forth god raised and trained at swordsmanship aira is a more than capable fighter as well but for all her skills aira harbors a secret from her past that weighs heavily upon her soul aira is a powerful fighter and magic user although capable of doing both significant physical and significant magical damage aira stands in contrast to melvin in that her magic skills tend to lag slightly behind her physical statistics development and release dragon quest

faith in long term viability of nintendo 64 line enix cited larger potential market and lower cost of manufacturing cds as reasons for change of platform by 2000 dragon quest vii was predicted to be so successful in japan that it would create a 50 billion yen effect on japanese economy said research firm dragon quest vii would go on to be released on august 26 2000 and sold 4 06 million games in japan alone becoming one of highest selling games of all time game was delayed numerous times before its actual release work on game was extended because development staff wanted to perfect game due to high expectations from fans and because team only consisted of about 35 people before its release it was ranked as most wanted game in japan and square knowing about dragon quest vii s release moved final fantasy ix to come out on a later date horii stated in an interview that team focused more on puzzle solving than game s story being first game in series to include 3d graphics team was also initially reluctant to include cg movies and cinematics due to letters written to enix by fans fearing that doing so would change overall feeling of series english language localization of dragon warrior vii began directly after game s japanese release enix of america was tasked with translating over 70 000 pages of text via 20 translators and 5 copy editors no effort was made to edit or censor context of japanese script weeks prior to game s us release enix released new information about game s different mechanics on their website weekly to introduce players to game paul handelman president of enix america commented on game that all talk this month about new systems with latest technological wizardry doesn t diminish fact that at end of day compelling game play is what it s all

unique backgrounds and enemies that have individual attack characteristics remake was originally not intended for a release outside of japan in part due to sheer cost and time needed to localize game s substantial content after numerous letters from core dragon quest fans in france as well as square enix and nintendo executives decision was made to release 3ds port worldwide in november 2015 nintendo direct it was shown that dragon quest vii would be coming outside japan in 2016 with new subtitle fragments of forgotten past international release of 3ds remake contained a completely

game com also pointed out that in order to play game player needs patience of a rock game informer even went as far as to say that four million japanese can be wrong referring to game s immense popularity in japan because of game s delay in being developed its release was after playstation 2 s release which created some negative feedback particularly about game s graphics ign commented on this calling game a game that makes only a bare minimum of concessions to advancing technology but more than makes up for this with its deep gameplay massive quest and sheer variety gamespot called graphics not good and warned readers that if most rewarding things they got out of final fantasy vii were full motion video interludes you definitely won t be wowed by anything you see in dragon
