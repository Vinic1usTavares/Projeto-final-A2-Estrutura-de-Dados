tropical storm cristobal was a relatively weak tropical cyclone that meandered in western atlantic ocean prior to being absorbed into a frontal zone third named storm of 2002 atlantic hurricane season cristobal developed on august 5 near coast of south carolina from same trough that spawned tropical storm bertha storm tracked slowly southeastward in early portion of its duration and initially remained disorganized cristobal attained peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h and lost characteristics of a tropical cyclone on august 8 remnants brought moderate precipitation to bermuda and in combination with a high pressure system storm caused three drownings on long island from rip currents meteorological history a trough extended from northern gulf of mexico to western atlantic ocean in early august trough remained nearly stationary spawning tropical storm bertha in gulf of mexico and a tropical disturbance off coast of south carolina weak low pressure area off south carolina drifted southward with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on august 4 by 1800 utc on august 5 system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as tropical depression three while located about 175 miles 280 km h east southeast of charleston south carolina upon becoming a tropical depression cyclone maintained outer rainbands and fair outflow it tracked southeastward around northeastern periphery of an anticyclone over florida by august 6 convection had diminished as outflow became restricted due to northeasterly wind shear with a relatively dry environment most of convection was confined to southern semicircle of depression despite circulation becoming elongated in southwesterly flow of a southward moving cold front a hurricane hunters flight late on august 6 reported that depression intensified into tropical storm cristobal about 315 miles 505 km east of jacksonville florida tropical storm cristobal initially continued tracking southeastward with its circulation reforming closer to thunderstorms during each increase in convection on august 7 storm turned eastward due to influence of a large approaching mid to upper level frontal zone as convection organized further cristobal intensified somewhat and attained peak winds of 50 mph 85 km h on august 8 increased dry air weakened convection and caused cristobal to accelerate east northeastward low level circulation interacted with approaching frontal zone and by 0000 utc on august 9 tropical storm cristobal was absorbed by cold front about 350 miles 560 km southeast of cape hatteras north carolina remnants continued northeastward passing near newfoundland on august 10 before weakening near greenland on august 14 impact as a tropical cyclone cristobal had minimal effect to any land masses its remnants brought unsettled conditions to bermuda including a 45 mph 72 km h wind gust at bermuda international airport combination of moisture from cristobal and a cold front produced 2 78 inches 71 mm in a 24 hour period interaction between remnants of cristobal and a high pressure system over mid atlantic states produced rip currents and 4 foot 1 2 m waves along south shore of long island new york three people drowned from rip currents two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with storm vessel with sign reported sustained winds of 47 mph 76 km h from west southwest on august 7 see also other storms of same name list of bermuda hurricanes list of new york hurricanes references cristobal cristobal 2002 cristobal 2002 cristobal 2002
