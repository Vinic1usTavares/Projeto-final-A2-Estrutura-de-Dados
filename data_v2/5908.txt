personal he had not attended a shania concert nor seen television special and was surprised by singer s stage presence he believed that video would make singer s naysayers realize shania s vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd bjorke concluded up live in chicago is a dynamic dvd experience that is sure to please fans for years to come chris jones of bbc noted band s differed from most country bands and wanted a more country influenced sound however jones complimented singer s incorporation of audience naming it her inimitable style he added that video was far from a sterile experience because of live setting and crowd ambiance however he suspected shania s photocopy perfect vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post production work overall you know exactly what you re getting with shania and for her fans this is bound to be a very good thing indeed bobby reed of chicago sun times believed shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality noting she never mentioned her relocation to switzerland or her then new son he complimented band s strong yet rote efforts of bringing dense production to life however he claimed shania s vocal delivery was at times frail reed also noted absence of guest stars in contrast to her two previous concert specials and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave concert a country fair vibe mark guarino of arlington heights daily herald believed concert was evidently tailored for television and that shania played proper host he continued as night wore on shania tried different ways with varying degrees of success to make magnitude of such a large event work for small screen her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things but it often backfired commercial performance on week ending december 13 2003 up live in chicago debuted at number three on billboards top music video sales chart two weeks later it reached its peak at number two
