thumb right cover of a book containing virginia and kentucky resolutions along with report of 1800 and other supporting documents this edition was produced by editor jonathan elliot in 1832 at height of nullification crisis these documents formed philosophical foundation for nullification movement report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by james madison arguing for sovereignty of individual states under united states constitution and against alien and sedition acts report is also known as virginia report of 1800 report of 1799 madison s report or report on alien and sedition acts adopted by virginia general assembly in january 1800 report amends arguments from 1798 virginia resolutions and attempts to resolve contemporary criticisms against resolutions report was last important explication of constitution produced before 1817 bonus bill veto message by madison who has come to be regarded as father of constitution see e g brant s subtitle father of constitution arguments made in resolutions and report were later used frequently during nullification crisis of 1832 when south carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within state madison rejected concept of nullification and notion that his arguments supported such a practice whether madison s theory of republicanism really supported nullification movement and more broadly whether ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period are main questions surrounding report in modern literature background madison a member of democratic republican party was elected to democratic republican dominated virginia general assembly from orange county in 1799 a major item on his agenda was defense of general assembly s 1798 virginia resolutions of which madison had been draftsman madison initially decided to run for office mainly to counteract strength of prominent federalist patrick henry who was set to be elected to house however henry died over summer leaving democratic republicans free to pursue their plans with no substantial opposition madison 303 resolutions usually discussed together with thomas jefferson s contemporaneous kentucky resolutions were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by federalist dominated national government most significant of these were alien and sedition acts four laws that allowed president to deport aliens at will required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against government or its officials democratic republicans were outraged by legislation and madison and jefferson drafted highly critical resolutions adopted in response by virginia and kentucky state legislatures virginia and kentucky resolutions had in year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures seven states formally responded to virginia and kentucky by rejecting seven states that transmitted formal rejections were delaware massachusetts new york connecticut rhode island new hampshire and vermont see and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval maryland pennsylvania and new jersey passed resolutions that disapproved kentucky and virginia resolutions but these states did not transmit formal responses to kentucky and virginia with other four states taking no action no other state endorsed resolutions reason for criticism was that general assembly led in effort by state sovereignty advocate john taylor of caroline had put a state sovereignty spin on virginia resolutions of 1798 despite madison s hopes these replies contended that supreme court of united states had ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional and that alien and sedition acts were constitutional and necessary madison 303 at least six states responded to virginia and kentucky resolutions by stating that power to declare a law unconstitutional rested in federal judiciary not states for example vermont s resolution stated it belongs not to state legislatures to decide on constitutionality of laws made by general government this power being exclusively vested in judiciary courts of union other states taking position that constitutionality of federal laws is a question for federal courts not states were new york massachusetts rhode island new hampshire and pennsylvania governor of delaware also took this position federalists accused democratic republicans of seeking disunion even contemplating violence koch and ammon 163 at time some leading virginia democratic republican figures such as rep william branch giles in public and taylor in private actually were contemplating disunion and virginia general assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in richmond so there was some truth to charge jefferson leader of democratic republican party and then vice president wrote to madison in august 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for principles expressed in virginia and kentucky resolutions of 1798 commonly referred to as principles of 98 in response to this letter madison visited jefferson at monticello during first week of september madison 304 their discussion was important in that it persuaded jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from union which is expressed at end of excerpt above at very least virginia or kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified federalist attacks against secessionist tendencies of democratic republicans madison won over jefferson who shortly thereafter wrote to wilson cary nicholas that from this position i retreat readily not only in deference to madison s judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations so these when they occur will be cause enough of themselves letter from jefferson to w c nicholas of september 5 1799 quoted in brant 467 adrienne koch and harry ammon examining jefferson s later writing conclude that madison had a significant role in softening jefferson s more extreme views koch and ammon 167 thumb right james madison author of report and 4th president of united states jefferson hoped for further involvement with production of report and planned to visit madison at montpelier on his way to philadelphia national capital for winter session of united states congress however james monroe who would become governor of virginia before end of year visited jefferson at monticello and cautioned him against meeting with madison since another meeting between two of most important democratic republican leaders would provoke significant public comment koch and ammon 169 170 task of writing virginia report was left solely to madison jefferson underlined importance of this work in a november 26 letter to madison in which he identified protestations against violations of true principles of our constitution as one of four primary elements of democratic republican party plan letter from jefferson to madison of november 26 1799 quoted in koch and ammon 170 production and passage assembly session began in early december once at richmond madison began drafting report madison 303 though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery brant 467 on december 23 madison moved for creation of a special seven member committee with himself as chairman to respond to certain answers from several of states relative to communications made by virginia legislature at their last session committee members were madison john taylor william branch giles george keith taylor john wise john mercer and william daniel madison 296 304 next day christmas eve committee produced a first version of report neither this version nor any of madison s drafts survive measure came before house of delegates lower house of general assembly on january 2 though certain to pass due to democratic republican majority which had recently been solidified by election of a democratic republican clerk and speaker of house report was debated for five days main point of contention was meaning of third of virginia resolutions this resolution had been principal target of federalist attack on resolutions gutzman 582 particularly at issue was sense in which states were parties to federal compact report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when virginians claimed that states were parties to federal constitution referent of word state was sovereign people of particular state thus to say that state of virginia ratified constitution was to say that sovereign people of virginia ratified constitution amended report passed house of delegates on january 7 by a margin of 60 to 40 at some point in next two weeks it passed senate by a margin of 15 to 6 madison 305 report was received warmly by virginia democratic republicans general assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in state but there was not much public response to report and it appears to have had relatively little impact on presidential election of 1800 which was nevertheless a major victory for democratic republicans and a repudiation of federalist policies parties outside virginia seemed uninterested in rehashing of 1798 resolutions and in other states there was very little public comment jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to democratic republican members of congress departing for their home states and when they failed to arrive he entreated monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce despite jefferson s approval of and attempt to distribute madison s work national reaction was tepid koch and ammon 171 madison 306 though it had little impact on immediate election madison s report clarified legal argument against acts and for states rights in general particularly in its advancement of tenth amendment rather than ninth as main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy lash 183 184 argument general purpose of report was affirmation and expansion of principles expressed in virginia resolutions first major goal of resolutions was to bring about repeal of alien and sedition acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through state legislatures madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that acts violated constitution laying into acts in his report madison described many breaches of constitutional limits alien act granted president unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens democratic republicans did not oppose alien enemies act which permitted deportation of enemy aliens and is still in force contrary to sedition act federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack beyond protection it accorded to every citizen indeed such special intervention against press was expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to constitution madison 341 as well madison attacked federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional to remedy defects revealed by passage of alien and sedition acts madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech madison writes that ability to prosecute speech amounts to a protection of those who administer government if they should at any time deserve contempt or hatred of people against being exposed to it madison 344 freedom of press was necessary because chequered as it is with abuses world is indebted to press for all triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression madison 338 report supported a strict interpretation of first amendment while federalists interpreted amendment as limiting power of congress over press but implying that such power existed madison argued that first amendment wholly prohibited congress from any interference with press more generally report made argument in favor of sovereignty of individual states for which it is best known basic message was that states were ultimate parties constituting federal compact and that therefore individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether compact had been broken by usurpation of power this doctrine is known as compact theory it was presence of this argument in resolutions that had allowed federalists to paint democratic republicans as leaning toward secession in amended report line is moderated with an emphasis that it is states as political societies of people and therefore one reads in not state legislatures alone which possess this power either formulation would help democratic republican cause by refuting finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by congress and federal judiciary both of which were dominated by federalists in defense of virginia democratic republicans and resolutions madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with compact theory virginia resolutions and report of 1800 themselves were simply protests which states were surely entitled to produce madison indicated that a declaration of unconstitutionality would be an expression of opinion with no legal force madison 348 it is worth noting that at this period americans still followed a british understanding in which laws could be unconstitutional without being illegal virginia s declaration that alien and sedition acts were unconstitutional did not necessarily signify a belief that acts were without effect purpose of such a declaration said madison was to mobilize public opinion madison indicated that power to make binding constitutional determinations remained in federal courts it has been said that it belongs to judiciary of united states and not state legislatures to declare meaning of federal constitution t he declarations of citizens or state legislature whether affirming or denying constitutionality of measures of federal government are expressions of opinion unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection expositions of judiciary on other hand are carried into immediate effect by force former may lead to a change in legislative expression of general will possibly to a change in opinion of judiciary latter enforces general will whilst that will and that opinion continue unchanged madison argued that a state after declaring a federal law unconstitutional could take action by communicating with other states attempting to enlist their support petitioning congress to repeal law in question introducing amendments to constitution in congress or calling a constitutional convention madison did not assert that states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable by eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion madison tried to make clear that democratic republicans were not moving toward disunion analysis report was regarded in early 19th century as among more important expressions of democratic republican principles spencer roane described it as magna charta on which republicans settled down after great struggle in year 1799 powell 695 henry clay said on floor of house of representatives that it was from report of 1800 above other documents that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation powell 696 h jefferson powell a modern jurist identifies three persistent themes of democratic republican constitutionalism which emerged from resolutions and report 1 a textual approach to constitution 2 compact theory and 3 that caution not trust should characterize our approach to those who hold political power powell 705 706 in more recent years main practical interest in report has been its absolutist understanding of first amendment multiple supreme court decisions have cited case as evidence of framers ideas on free speech in 1957 roth v united states opinion by william brennan madison s report is cited as evidence that fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to development and well being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth roth v united states 354 u s 476 1957 other cases to cite report for a similar purpose include thornhill v alabama 1940 thornhill v alabama 310 u s 88 1940 and

rights with regard to federalism and republicanism according to kevin gutzman report together with kentucky and virginia resolutions forms a foundation for radical southern states rights tradition gutzman 571 however madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported constitutional interpretation advanced by pro nullification southerners report of 1800 madison argued did not say government was a compact of individual states as pro nullification elements suggested rather report of 1800 described a compact of people in each of states acting in their highest sovereign capacity gibson 319 quote is from drew mccoy last of fathers james madison republican legacy cambridge cambridge university press 1989 p 134 state governments themselves no less than federal judiciary possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance madison thought resolutions and report were consistent with this principle while ordinance of nullification was not
