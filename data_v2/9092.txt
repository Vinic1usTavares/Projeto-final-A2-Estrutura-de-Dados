yugoslavia and establishment of ustase led axis puppet state known as independent state of croatia ndh it was first act of mass murder committed by ustase upon coming to power and presaged a wider ustase perpetrated campaign of genocide against serbs in ndh that lasted until end of war ustase used mysterious deaths of two of their local followers as a pretext for killings victims were drawn from gudovac and its surroundings on 28 april most were arrested under guise that they were rebels loyal to ousted yugoslav government they were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 ustase guards five of prisoners managed to survive initial volley and crawled away to safety ustase forced gudovac s surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for victims and pour quicklime on bodies to speed up decomposition following day relatives of one of victims informed germans of what had transpired germans ordered a partial exhumation of mass grave and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested mladen lorkovic a senior ustase official used his influence to have detained men released and promised german ambassador siegfried kasche that croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation no investigation took place an ossuary and a mausoleum were erected on site of massacre in 1955 as was a monument by sculptor vojin bakic in 1991 amid inter ethnic violence during croatian war of independence monument and mausoleum were destroyed by croatian nationalists as was another one of bakic s works bjelovarac man from bjelovar ruins of ossuary

condition that only pro yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it marginalized far right and far left parties thrived ustase a croatian fascist movement emerged as most extreme of these movement was driven by a deep hatred of serbs in 1932 ustase launched so called velebit uprising attacking a police station in lika police responded harshly to attack and harassed local population

pressure as her neighbours became aligned with axis powers in april 1939 italy opened a second frontier with yugoslavia when it invaded and occupied neighbouring albania at outbreak of world war ii yugoslav government declared its neutrality between september and november 1940 hungary and romania joined tripartite pact and italy invaded greece from that time yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by axis powers and their satellites and her neutral stance toward war came under tremendous pressure in late february 1941 bulgaria joined pact next day german troops entered bulgaria from romania closing ring around yugoslavia intending to secure his southern flank for impending attack on soviet union adolf hitler began placing heavy pressure on yugoslavia to join axis on 25 march 1941 after some delay yugoslav government conditionally signed pact two days later a group of pro western serbian nationalist air force officers deposed prince paul in a bloodless coup d etat conspirators declared 17 year old prince peter of age and brought to power a government of national unity led by general dusan simovic coup enraged hitler even if yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty he stated she must be considered a foe and destroyed as quickly as possible he then ordered invasion of yugoslavia which commenced on 6 april 1941 fall of bjelovar thumb left vkj personnel

overwhelmed by combined german italian and hungarian assault much of its equipment was obsolete its military strategy was outdated and its soldiers were ill disciplined and poorly trained to make matters worse many of vkj s croat personnel refused to fight germans whom they considered liberators from serb oppression this attitude was shared by many soldiers of 40th infantry division slavonska s largely croat 108th regiment which was stationed in veliki regiment had been mobilized in bjelovar and on 7 april was marching towards virovitica to take up positions when its croat members revolted and arrested serb officers and soldiers led by captain ivan mrak regiment disarmed a yugoslav gendarmerie post in garesnica and began marching back to bjelovar alongside a band of ustase rebels under hans following morning elements of 108th regiment entered bjelovar and clashed with local gendarmerie sustaining losses of two killed and three wounded at about noon regiment joined up with elements of 42nd infantry regiment and other units of 40th infantry division at around same time julije makanec croat mayor of bjelovar joined ustase official ivan sestak and hss representative franjo hegedus in demanding that vkj surrender town to rebels when 4th army s commander general petar nedeljkovic learned of rebel approach he ordered local gendarmerie commander to maintain order but was advised that this would not be possible as local croat conscripts would not report for duty fourth army headquarters reported rebels presence to headquarters of 1st army group which requested that hss leader vladko macek intervene with rebels macek agreed to send an emissary to 108th infantry regiment urging them to obey their officers to no avail later in day two trucks of rebels arrived at 4th army headquarters in bjelovar with intention of killing staff headquarters guard force prevented this but operations staff immediately withdrew from bjelovar to popovaca after issuing several unanswered ultimatums around 8 000 rebels attacked bjelovar assisted by croat fifth columnists within town bjelovar surrendered and many yugoslav officers and soldiers were captured by germans and ustase rebels local croats welcomed revolt with great enthusiasm when nedeljkovic heard of bjelovar s capture he called makanec and threatened to bomb city if vkj prisoners were not immediately released detained officers from 4th army headquarters and 108th infantry regiment were then sent to zagreb at about 16 00 nedeljkovic informed ban of croatia ivan subasic of revolt but subasic was powerless to influence events at about 18 00 makanec proclaimed that bjelovar was part of an independent croatian state this was only significant pro ustase revolt in croatia and bosnia herzegovina prior to 10 april ustase propaganda celebrated it as an uprising of croatian people against april war claiming it showed that croats wholeheartedly supported yugoslavia s destruction creation of ndh thumb right 250px official proclamation of independent state of croatia 10 april 1941 on 10 april senior ustase commander slavko kvaternik proclaimed establishment of independent state of croatia hrvatska ndh declaration came exactly one week before vkj s unconditional surrender to axis powers leader of ustase ante pavelic was in rome at time and made arrangements to travel to karlovac just west of zagreb he arrived in karlovac on 13 april accompanied by 250 400 of his followers pavelic reached zagreb on 15 april having granted territorial cessions to italy at croatia s expense and promised germans he had no intention of pursuing a foreign policy independent of berlin that same day germany and italy extended diplomatic recognition to ndh pavelic was declared poglavnik leader of ustase led croatian state which combined territory of much of present day croatia all of present day bosnia and herzegovina and parts of present day serbia pavelic and his followers intended to create an ethnically pure croatia through mass murder and deportation of serbs jews and other non croats only about fifty percent of ndh s 6 2 million inhabitants were croat nearly two million serbs about one third of ndh s total population now found themselves within borders of newly formed state in addition serb majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of ndh s total landmass croatian state cannot exist if 1 8 million serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful serbian state at our backs croatia s future foreign minister mladen lorkovic explained therefore we are trying to make serbs disappear from our regions dido kvaternik a senior ustase official was entrusted with cleansing bjelovar and its surroundings younger kvaternik recalled when we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when pavelic decided that i should take over implementation of measures against serbs and jews i obeyed immediately and without hesitation because i knew that this question had to be resolved for future of croatian people and state and that someone had to make sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out pavelic s orders for extermination of non croats in and around bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained prelude immediately after seizing bjelovar ustase set about strengthening their hold of city josip verhas an ethnic german was appointed acting head of bjelovar district duro was appointed ustase representative to bjelovar district and hans was named ustase commissioner for bjelovar county was appointed chief of police he immediately decreed that all of bjelovar s serbs had to wear a red armband with word serb written in both croatian and german ivan a public notary was appointed acting commander of bjelovar armoury and set about reorganizing local ustase formations mrak who had distinguished himself as one of leaders of 108th regiment s revolt was tasked with overseeing city centre between 9 and 14 april groups of soldiers from disbanded 108th regiment roamed bjelovar countryside looking for a way home serb officers that had refused to surrender raided croat homes hoping to find food money and civilian clothing that would make it easier for them to pass through german and ustase checkpoints in some villages croat peasants disarmed defeated vkj units and plundered their warehouses some of these peasants especially those in gudovac entered local units known as readiness battalions on 10 april germans reached bjelovar and set up a series of command posts but left ustase in de facto control of city ustase were wary of danger posed by serb peasantry many had been in vkj at time of invasion and had simply discarded their military fatigues and taken their rifles home miso sabolek a local ustase commander reported bjelovar and its surroundings are besieged by serbs who are killing and looting homes in villages of gudovac and forest in mid april sabolek reported that he had sent 35 gunmen to quell violence around bjelovar his superiors in zagreb ordered him to take any measures necessary to restore order in district ustase searched dozens of serb homes hoping to find illegal weapons this was followed by arresting of undesired elements mostly members of communist party of yugoslavia partija jugoslavije kpj disarming of serbs is vital to securing future of young croatian state wrote edmund german plenipotentiary general in ndh julius eker local kpj chairman was arrested on 12 april on 16 april slavko kvaternik announced that serb peasants in ndh had eight days to hand their weapons over to ustase another influential communist milan bakic was arrested in bjelovar on 20 april on 22 april ustase arrested most of town s remaining kpj members communist organizers such as stevo sabic franko winter and sandor kiraly were arrested on 24 april by 25 april several hundred known or suspected anti fascists had been arrested by ustase some were spared death and given prison sentences but most were executed without trial that same day an ustase patrol discovered 80 rifles and several machine guns in home of a local kpj member forty rifles and two machine guns were found in home of another local communist alarmed by prospect of an armed rebellion in bjelovar and surrounding countryside kvaternik selected a broad area in and around town where serbs were to be cleansed for every croat killed he said we must execute 100 serbs disarming and arresting of vkj personnel by ustase was accompanied by numerous incidents in which about 20 armed vkj troops and serb civilians were killed kvaternik feared that these deaths would only increase likelihood of an armed revolt and became even more wary when he heard rumours that bjelovar s serbs were planning an uprising to coincide with feast day of st george on 6 may interior minister andrija arrived in bjelovar after hearing such rumours at a meeting with verhas and his lieutenants he stated that serious action would have to be taken to send a message to enemies of ustase and ndh on 26 april kvaternik and his closest assistant ivica organized mass arrest of 530 serb villagers from grubisno polje thirty ustase took part in arrests detainees were transported to danica camp near koprivnica and from there taken to ustase camps at gospic pag island jasenovac and stara gradiska where most were killed timeline arrests on 25 april ustase arrested a serb named milan radovanovic when he stopped by bjelovar police station to hand over his rifle he had fought with vkj at time of invasion and spent two weeks hiding in forests before returning to his home in prgomelje his relatively late return prevented him from handing over his rifle before ustase deadline on 24 april on morning of 26 april as radovanovic and another serb prisoner were being escorted from county jail by two ustase guards two unidentified gunmen opened fire on detainees and guards a skirmish ensued and radovanovic and one of guards were killed second guard was wounded that afternoon a croatian home guard or was killed by a stray bullet in his yard while on leave kvaternik immediately blamed deaths on serb agitators in their internal documents ustase attributed deaths to local chetniks a claim that has never been proven some historians have hypothesized that attack on county jail and death of home guard were false flag attacks intended to rally croats against local serbs this allegation has also never been proven upon hearing news of attack at county jail kvaternik ordered arrest of 200 serb peasants from gudovac and neighbouring villages of veliko and malo prgomelje tuk and arrests occurred in early morning hours of 28 april action was personally supervised by kvaternik and carried out by members of local croatian peasant guard which had been turned into a quasi military unit under command of martin cikos whom journalist slavko goldstein describes as a sworn pre war ustasa most of more prominent or wealthy inhabitants of gudovac were arrested including teachers businessmen and serbian orthodox priests their sole crime goldstein writes was that they were of orthodox faith and perhaps a little more prosperous than their neighbours shortly before killings verhas cikos and local ustase officials rudolf nikola and mirko pavlesic held a meeting where it was decided that prisoners would be killed killings thumb right 250px bodies of victims exhumed by german investigators 30 april 1941 prisoners were taken to gudovac municipal building and held there for a time they were told that they would be taken to bjelovar for interrogation instead they were ordered to march in opposite direction towards a field beside river where an open air market was held each week prisoners left gudovac just before sunset supervised by as many as 70 armed guards many of prisoners sensed fate that awaited them but were unable to escape according to one post war testimony cikos was upset uneasy and in no mood to talk as prisoners were being marched out of gudovac he pulled one of his serb neighbours from group and told him to get lost before ordering remaining 200 detainees to line up against a wall kvaternik appeared before group and asked if it contained any croats four stepped forward and offered their identification papers three were permitted to return to their homes upon having their identities verified but fourth was sent back among serbs because he was a communist kvaternik cikos and several newly appointed ustase officers supervised march according to survivors guards hurtled insults at prisoners and forced them to sing ustase songs and chant long live pavelic long live kvaternik prisoners reached field just after sunset and were ordered to line up in ranks and make a left face guards then raised their rifles and opened fire some executioners hesitated before firing conscious that their friends and neighbours were about to be killed and many of victims were initially struck in legs some of wounded cursed ustase and others cried in agony kvaternik observed massacre from a distance of about accompanied by hans verhas and pavlesic pavlesic was dissatisfied with speed of killings and shouted at cikos telling him to finish job cikos s men then went about looking for survivors and anyone that moved five prisoners escaped before cikos s men could kill them and fled to a nearby forest killings were first act of mass murder committed by ustase upon coming to power estimates of number of victims vary marko attila hoare a historian specializing in balkans puts figure at 184 killed journalist tim judah writes that there were 187 fatalities other historians such as ivo goldstein and mark mention 196 deaths aftermath reaction thumb left 180px ustase official mladen lorkovic secured release of those arrested in connection to massacre kvaternik and ustase never attempted to conceal killings which were deliberately carried out in a relatively public space so as to cause terror among serb population local croats were fully aware of what had transpired following massacre ustase forced gudovac s remaining inhabitants to dig a mass grave and cover remains of victims with quicklime to speed up decomposition once dead had been buried villagers were permitted to return to their homes news of massacre quickly spread through bjelovar following day wife and daughter of one of victims visited a german command post reported massacre and led two german officers to mass grave officers informed their superiors of what had taken place and complained of disorder in their area of responsibility their superiors demanded a partial exhumation of gravesite ordered that exhumed corpses be photographed and requested an investigation as well as arrest and punishment of those responsible on orders of a local german commander 40 suspected perpetrators were arrested on evening of 29 april their weapons were seized and they were temporarily detained in bjelovar high school same evening lorkovic requested an urgent meeting with german ambassador siegfried kasche according to kasche lorkovic told him that eleven croats had been killed by serbs and that a massacre of 192 men from gudovac and its surroundings was carried out in retaliation according to goldstein figure of eleven dead croats was made up by lorkovic in order to justify massacre historian zeljko claims that vkj marched into several hamlets on 11 april and summarily executed eleven croats that had refused to report for mobilization several days earlier goldstein posits that 25 of 27 croats whose deaths ustase attributed to serb agitators prior to massacre had perished in combat operations during rebellion of 108th regiment michele f levy a historian specializing in holocaust agrees that there had been no mass killing of croats leading up to massacre historians philip cooke and ben shepherd write that massacre occurred before any organized serb resistance had commenced lorkovic maintained that massacre in gudovac was an internal political issue under jurisdiction of croatian government and requested that suspected perpetrators be handed over to ustase he promised kasche that zagreb would carry out a full investigation kasche accepted lorkovic s proposal likely at urging of his superiors ustase detained at bjelovar high school were released and their weapons returned to them promised investigation never took place legacy thumb right upright replica of bjelovarac man from bjelovar 2010 national archive in bjelovar contains extensive documentation of massacre including a list of victims compiled by ustase officials in may 1941 in which many prisoners are described as being shot as chetniks a statement describes fright of serb population and distress of local croats hss party leadership distanced itself from massacre and condemned actions of ustase as did majority of local hss activists many of whom ended up joining partisans according to some sources even makanec tried to distance himself from killings and allegedly protested to appropriate authorities in zagreb he went on to become croatian minister of education in 1943 and served in this capacity until may 1945 he was arrested by partisans following month and subsequently executed lorkovic was implicated in a conspiracy to overthrow ndh government in mid 1944 arrested and executed in last weeks of war at pavelic s behest kvaternik survived war and destruction of ndh fled to argentina with his family and was killed in a car accident in 1962 pavelic also fled to argentina survived an assassination attempt by yugoslav government agents in buenos aires in 1957 and died of his wounds in madrid two years later ustase killings of serbs continued throughout war and concentration camps were established to detain serbs jews gypsies anti fascist croats and others opposed to pavelic s regime contemporary german accounts place number of serbs killed by ustase at about 350 000 according to united states holocaust memorial museum between 320 000 and 340 000 serbs were killed by ustase over course of war most modern historians agree that ustase killed over 300 000 serbs or about 17 percent of all serbs living in ndh at nuremberg trials these killings were judged to have constituted genocide an ossuary and a mausoleum were built on site of massacre in 1955 a monument called gudovac before firing squad by serb sculptor vojin bakic was erected on same spot in 1991 amid inter ethnic violence caused by breakup of yugoslavia and yugoslav wars monument and mausoleum were destroyed by croatian nationalists also destroyed was one of bakic s most famous monuments bjelovarac man from bjelovar bakic had dedicated monument to his brothers who were killed by ustase what remained of ossuary was removed by local authorities in 2002 that year residents signed a petition to have a replica of bjelovarac erected at same spot local government promised to supply half amount needed to restore monument in 2005 croatian ministry of culture advised petitioners to apply for a tender in order to pay other half restored monument was
