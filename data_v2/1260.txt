missing existing serials received several vhs and dvd releases as well as tie in novels serials episode is missing production conception in december 1962 bbc television s controller of programmes donald baverstock informed head of drama sydney newman of a gap in schedule on saturday evenings between sports showcase grandstand and pop music programme juke box jury baverstock figured that programme should appeal to three audiences children who had previously been accustomed to timeslot teenage audience of juke box jury and adult sports fan audience of grandstand newman decided that a science fiction programme should fill gap head of serials donald wilson and writer c e webber contributed heavily to formatting of programme and co wrote programme s first format document with newman latter conceived idea of a time machine larger on inside than outside as well as central character of mysterious doctor and show s name doctor who production was initiated several months later and handed to producer verity lambert and story editor david whitaker to oversee after a brief period when show had been handled by a caretaker producer rex tucker casting and characters william hartnell portrayed first incarnation of doctor referred to as dr who in this season role was originally offered to hugh david leslie french cyril cusack alan webb and geoffrey bayldon david cusack and webb turned down role as they were reluctant to work on a series while bayldon wished to avoid another old man role lambert and director waris hussein invited william hartnell to play role hartnell accepted role after several discussions viewing it as an opportunity to take his career in a new direction hartnell had always wished to play an older character in his work but failed to do so becoming typecast as a tough actor due to his roles in carry on sergeant 1958 and army game 1957 61 although portrayed as grumpy and antagonistic in early episodes doctor warms to his companions as show progresses doctor s granddaughter susan foreman was portrayed by carole ann ford a 23 year old who typically played younger roles lambert was originally in talks with actress jacqueline lenya for role and several actresses auditioned for part including christa bergmann anne castaldini maureen crombie heather fleming camilla hasse waveney lee anna palk and anneke wills ford felt that character of susan deteriorated throughout series although show s initial pitch depicted susan as a strange alien creature she often played damsel in distress role panicking at minor events susan s school teachers ian chesterton and barbara wright were played by william russell and jacqueline hill respectively russell was only actor considered by lambert for role of chesterton while sally home phyllida law and penelope lee were considered for barbara lambert chose hill her friend for role writing three particular story types were envisioned for show history of past technology in future and alternatives of present historical stories were intended to educate viewers about significant events in history such as aztec civilisation and french revolution futuristic episodes took a more subtle approach to educating viewers such as theme of pacifism in daleks programme was originally intended to open with a serial entitled giants written by webber but was scrapped by june 1963 as technical requirements of storyline which involved leading characters being drastically reduced in size were beyond technical capabilities and story itself lacked necessary impact for an opener due to lack of scripts ready for production untitled second serial from coburn was moved to first in running order order change necessitated rewriting opening episode of coburn s script to include some introductory elements of webber s script for first episode of giants as a result webber received a co writer s credit for an unearthly child on internal bbc documentation coburn also made several significant original contributions to opening episode most notably that doctor s time machine should resemble a police box an idea he conceived after seeing a real police box while walking near his office second serial of doctor who was always planned to be futuristic due to historical nature of first comedy writer terry nation had written a 26 page outline for a story entitled survivors at his home influenced by threat of racial extermination by nazis and concerns of advanced warfare as well as taking influences from h g wells novel time machine 1895 newman and wilson were unhappy with serial having wanted to avoid featuring bug eyed monsters however with no other scripts prepared they were forced to accept serial for production due to other sudden commitments nation quickly wrote scripts for serial at rate of one per day nation also wrote show s fifth serial keys of marinus to replace dr who and hidden planet by malcolm hulke which was deemed problematic and required rewrites nation and whitaker decided to base serial around a series of mini adventures each with a different setting and cast nation was intrigued by idea of tardis crew searching for parts of a puzzle nation was also set to write show s eighth serial doctor who and red fort a seven part story set during indian rebellion of 1857 but other commitments prevented him from doing so newman suggested writer john lucarotti to production team during show s early development lucarotti who had recently worked on 18 part radio serial three journeys of marco polo 1955 penned a seven part serial about italian merchant and explorer marco polo titled dr who and a journey to cathay later known as marco polo serial was moved from its placement in running order to accommodate edge of destruction lucarotti was approached to write aztecs while marco polo was in production having lived in mexico lucarotti was fascinated by aztec civilisation and their obsession with human sacrifice show s eighth serial reign of terror is also a historical story though writer dennis spooner was initially interested in writing a science fiction story whitaker gave spooner four possible historical subjects and he ultimately selected french revolution show s third serial edge of destruction was written as a filler in case show was not renewed beyond 13 episodes since serial had no budget and minimal resources whitaker took opportunity to develop an idea conceived during show s formative weeks a character driven story exploring facets of tardis he wrote script in two days drawing upon influences of ghost stories and haunted houses peter r newman wrote show s sixth serial sensorites inspired by 1950s films set during world war ii that explore notion of soldiers who continued to fight after war filming an unearthly child was provisionally scheduled to begin recording on 5 july but was delayed to 19 july production was later deferred for a further two weeks while scripts were prepared show s pilot recording was

mostly silver and grey with blue balls protruding from skirt doctor whos first season received generally positive responses for an unearthly child variety felt that script suffered from a glibness of characterisations which didn t carry burden of belief but praised effective camerawork noting that show will impress if it decides to establish a firm base in realism mary crozier of guardian was unimpressed by first serial stating that it has fallen off badly soon after getting underway conversely marjorie norris of television today commented that if show keeps up high standard of first two episodes it will capture a much wider audience following serial daleks was widely praised described by daily mirrors richard sear as splendid children s stuff serial s villains daleks became a cultural phenomenon and have been closely associated with show since edge of destruction was criticised at a bbc programme review board meeting in february 1964 by controller of television programmes stuart hood who felt that serial s sequences in which susan uses scissors as a weapon digressed from code of violence in programmes lambert apologised for scenes marco polo was positively received philip purser of sunday telegraph noted that mark eden impersonated marco polo with sartorial dash but felt that main characters were poorly written describing barbara as a persistent drip keys of marinus was criticised by bob leeson of daily worker who felt that fifth episode of serial was show s low point noting that introduction of a trial scene represented a rushed script following serial aztecs received high praise and is retrospectively seen as one of show s greatest stories television todays bill edmunds praised serial s villains but felt that barbara should have a chance to look beautiful instead of worried and leeson of daily worker felt that serial had charm applauding painstaking attempts for historical accuracy and noting a much tighter plot than previous serials reign of terror was criticised for its historical inaccuracies described by daily workers stewart lane as a half baked royalist adventure retrospective reviews of season are positive kimberley piece of geek girl authority felt that while season started slowly it managed to find its footing and developed quickly into a popular ratings favorite found that most serials are memorable though many feature repetitive and silly storytelling richard gray of reel bits praised imagination and perseverance of show s producers reviewing first serial in 2008 radio times reviewer patrick mulkern praised casting of hartnell moody direction and thrilling race back to tardis for daleks mulkern praised strength of nation s scripts particularly first three cliffhangers but felt that urgency and claustrophobia dissipate towards end describing final battle as a disappointingly limp affair reviewing edge of destruction mulkern described david whitaker as a master of dialogue characterisation and atmosphere but felt he struggled with plot logic as evidenced by fast return switch explanation mark braxton of radio times praised marco polo stating that historical landscape was rarely mapped with such poetry and elegance though noted inconsistencies in foreign characters accents mulkern wrote that standards slip appreciably in keys of marinus and arnold t blumberg of ign described serial as a cliched premise handled poorly and with no spark at all apart from hartnell s late hour rally christopher bahn of a v club described aztecs as a classical tragedy infused with just enough hope toward end to keep it from being unbearably bleak and ian berriman of sfx described serial as jacqueline hill s finest hour dvd talk s john sinnott considered sensorites well constructed with impressive set design and an expanded role for susan but felt that there was nothing special about serial mulkern wrote positively of humour and hartnell s increased role in reign of terror but felt that susan was at her
