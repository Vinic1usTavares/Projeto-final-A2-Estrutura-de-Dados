respectively it follows lustrous immortal humanoid life forms who are embodiments of gemstones who defend themselves against lunarians who seek to harvest their bodies for decorations phos is youngest of lustrous and is given task to assemble a natural history since they are too brittle to fight orange created series with 3d animation as a base a decision made partially due to difficulty in depicting translucent gemstones using hand drawn animation yoichi nishikawa s concept art greatly influenced kyogoku s vision for series with several shots directly based on nishikawa s art while manga is more ambiguous and subtle anime had to be clear on a single viewing so phos was given more close up shots and repeated lines to give them a larger presence and more easily identifiable goals as kyogoku was used to writing teenaged characters with clear motives and desires he initially had problems with portraying phos but his image of character solidified after hearing tomoyo kurosawa s performance as them series was well received by critics frequently called among best of season and a turning point for cg anime and convincing skeptics that an action series could be well done outside of a 2d production writing was also positively received with critics calling characters and world likable and intriguing it received several awards and nominations for awards including for its visuals animation and cg premise land of lustrous is set in far future in a land inhabited by an immortal life form called lustrous who are embodiment of gemstones twenty eight lustrous are led by their teacher kongo and fight to defend themselves against lunarians who appear every few days seeking to harvest lustrous bodies for decorations nicknamed phos currently 300 years old is youngest of

nightwatch cinnabar who is poisonous and thus dangerous even to other lustrous and therefore lives in isolation finding this sad phos decides to find cinnabar a better job voice cast 84 carli a coates production land of lustrous was produced at computer graphics cg animation studio orange and adapts haruko ichikawa s 2012 manga of same name covering little over its first four volumes series had katsuhiro takei and kiyotaka waki as production staff and was directed by takahiko kyogoku with toshiya ono in charge of series scripts eiji serving as cg chief director kenji fujita being director of photography and with imai in charge of editing asako nishida designed characters while yoichi nishikawa created concept art and osamu mikasa painted color key art sound team included composer yoshiaki fujisawa and sound director yukio nagasaki opening theme no nami was performed by and ending theme kirameku hamabe by yuiko ohara project started in 2015 while kyogoku was working on anime series gate and was approached by katsuhiro takei from toho to work on an adaptation of land of lustrous manga kyogoku had always wanted to create a work based on cg animation with complimenting 2d animation rather than more common use of a 2d base with complimenting 3d and both kyogoku and takei thought that that style would fit land of lustrous takei wanted orange to work on project from start despite trusting their abilities due to staff s previous experience with action in rebuild of evangelion films kyogoku was initially worried about them handling full production due to low number of staff members but studio expanded from 50 to 100 staff members during production although voice recording for anime productions typically is done after animation is finished it was done prior to cg creation for land of lustrous after animatics were created kyogoku was happy with casting saying that kurosawa embraced her role and became phos acting out lines physically and that supporting cast helped support spontaneity of phos s character kyogoku also specifically noted being happy with casting nakata as kongo as they had worked together before and as he loved nakata s acting describing nakata as a gentleman he thought he was perfectly suited for role and said that a too charming or sultry voice would not have worked for character storytelling after reading manga for first time kyogoku thought that it would be difficult to surpass manga by simply copying what was shown in each panel according to him appeal of manga was its ambiguity and subtlety saying that there is more room for subtle portrayal in a manga since reader can re read it whereas an anime aired on television needs to be clearer on a single viewing because of this they made protagonist clearer by giving phos more close up shots and having them repeat certain important lines leading to them appearing to have a larger presence in story and have more easily identifiable goals ono helped in this by breaking down difficult portions of manga s story into scenes kyogoku and ichikawa discussed story development and kyogoku was asked to leave it uncertain whether phos s changes during story are good or not and to portray change as starting with their meeting with cinnabar as ichikawa saw those two elements as foundation of land of lustrous she partook in story development meetings and discussed how to achieve right balance between exploring subjects in detail and prompting questions such as what true nature of lunarians is due to how not everything could have been explained in twelve episodes although she told kyogoku about events in not yet published manga chapters she asked him to avoid incorporating elements from future chapters he saw his role as consisting of him organizing manga material and was happy with how much of manga s story they were able to adapt with anime covering all parts he wanted to include translation initially kyogoku had some issues with how to portray phos as he was used to working with teenaged characters with obvious desires and motives whereas phos lacks resolve and is resigned to their frustration due to having spent 300 years doing nothing not being too serious about their emotions even when angry his image of phos solidified after hearing kurosawa s performance saying that her acting had right level of ambiguity for character visuals thumb nishikawa s concept art top greatly influenced kyogoku s vision for series and several shots were directly based on his pieces alt a piece of concept art and a shot from anime series both depicting a character from behind standing in grass with a sword looking at a black rorschach like pattern in sky decision to create series using cg came in part from how beauty of gemstones was seen as part of series appeal and how it would have been difficult to depict their translucency using hand drawn animation whereas cg enabled this kyogoku had from beginning envisioned characters as figures with clear moving parts as land of lustrous was orange s first anime project as main production studio they spent a lot of time adjusting to it from types of cg productions they were used to balancing how detailed cg work should be and figuring out how to achieve kyogoku s vision for visual treatment of characters while kyogoku was happy with final versions of episodes he said that it took much longer to create than had series been created using 2d animation saying that first storyboards were not finished until june 2016 and that first produced cuts took months to create although it started to go more smoothly once first were finished nishikawa became involved in production as waki nominated him for role as concept artist although nishikawa had not been familiar with source material previously his wife was a fan of manga and he thought that he could be able to express himself through background artwork due to how manga does not use a lot of backgrounds his concepts greatly influenced kyogoku s vision for what he wanted to accomplish with series with kyogoku specifically citing a piece showing a cel shaded phos with photo realistic hair behind cg grass as influential many shots featured in show were directly based on nishikawa s pieces including framing and shading used he used triadic color schemes for his pieces noting that large amount of open spaces in anime meant that visuals would look flat if color work was done incorrectly as kyogoku had worked with nishida in past and she was a fan of land of lustrous manga it was an easy decision to appoint her as character designer she designed a lot of reference artwork for character proportions and facial expressions creating a wide range of expressions despite kyogoku being unspecific in instructions this helped production a lot as comedic sequences demanded a lot of different expressions and exaggerated faces translating 2d character designs into 3d models was a very simple process due to how characters all have about same bodily proportions allowing artists to mostly focus on characters faces and hair due to orange s technical experience there were not a lot of technical problems with production although there were sometimes difficulties in reproducing intended colors from concept art in 3d renderings cinnabar was also a difficult character to animate due to their subtle character acting and their finely detailed hair and how they are surrounded by mercury orange had a lot of freedom in creating action sequences as kyogoku gave mostly vague directions for them such as what general camera movement to use to guide 3d animation 2d guide animation was produced one animator working on these was norio matsumoto known for his work on action sequences in naruto anime series release land of

for cg anime particularly phos s animation in combination with kurosawa s voice performance anime news network and japanese publication animate times enjoyed prominent action sequences in series and otaku usa liked how those sequences took advantage of cg production making use of dynamic camerawork that would not have been as feasible in a fully 2d production they also liked implementation of supplementary 2d elements such as facial animations and close up and how they were integrated into larger 3d production art direction was similarly well received and was described as a good conversion of both original manga s atmosphere and of nishikawa s concept art otaku usa liked lustrous character designs but particularly liked how lunarians were designed and arranged like serene divine and inscrutable buddhist procession which helped in making them menacing series won vfx japan awards 2018 excellence and best awards in television anime cg category and was nominated for 2017 cg world
