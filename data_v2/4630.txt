ficus rubiginosa commonly known as rusty fig or port jackson fig damun in dharug language is a species of flowering plant native to eastern australia in genus ficus beginning as a seedling that grows on other plants hemiepiphyte or rocks lithophyte f rubiginosa matures into a tree high and nearly as wide with a yellow brown buttressed trunk leaves are oval and glossy green and measure from long and wide fruits are small round and yellow and can ripen and turn red at any time of year peaking in spring and summer like all figs fruit is in form of a syconium an inverted inflorescence with flowers lining an internal cavity f rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by fig wasp species pleistodontes imperialis which may comprise four syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp some of which induce galls while others parasitise pollinator wasps and at least two species of nematode many species of bird including pigeons parrots and various passerines eat fruit ranging along australian east coast from queensland to bega in southern new south wales including port jackson area leading to its alternative name f rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops it is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces and when potted is well suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai taxonomy left thumb ficus rubiginosa figs syconia and rusty undersides of leaves ficus rubiginosa was described by french botanist rene louiche desfontaines in 1804 from a type specimen whose locality is documented simply as new holland in searching for type specimen australian botanist dale dixon found one from herbarium of desfontaines at florence herbarium and one from herbarium of etienne pierre ventenat at geneva as ventenat had used desfontaines name dixon selected florence specimen to be type in 2001 specific epithet rubiginosa related to rusty coloration of undersides of leaves indeed rusty fig is an alternate common name others include illawarra fig and port jackson fig it was known as damun tam mun to eora and darug inhabitants of sydney basin in 1806 german botanist carl ludwig willdenow gave it botanical name ficus australis in species plantarum but this is a nomen as species already had a validly published name italian botanist guglielmo broke up genus ficus in 1844 placing species in genus urostigma as u in 1862 dutch botanist friedrich anton wilhelm miquel described urostigma leichhardtii from material collected from cape cleveland queensland noting it had affinities to f rubiginosa in 1867 he placed urostigma as a subgenus in reunited ficus which resulted in taxon becoming ficus leichhardtii miquel also described ficus leichhardtii variety angustata from whitsunday island later classified as f by czech botanist karel domin queensland state botanist frederick manson bailey described ficus macrophylla variety pubescens in 1911 from queensland domin later renaming it ficus all these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from and hence reclassified as f rubiginosa by dixon in 2001 in a study published in 2008 nina ronsted and colleagues analysed dna sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase region in first molecular analysis of section malvanthera they found f rubiginosa to be most closely related to rainforest species f watkinsiana and two rock growing lithophytic species of arid northern australia f and f they classified these species in a new series in subsection platypodeae relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction group radiated into rainforest or into arid australia joseph maiden described variety lucida in 1902 and bailey described variety glabrescens in 1913 both had diagnosed their varieties on basis of their hairlessness maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair while bailey described his as nearly glabrous hairless as bailey s description more closely matched dixon s findings that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless dixon retained bailey s name and reclassified it as ficus rubiginosa forma glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in lack of hairs on new growth from nominate form description thumb left variegated foliage of a cultivar a spreading densely shading tree when mature f rubiginosa may reach or more in height although it rarely exceeds in sydney region trunk is buttressed and can reach in diameter bark is yellow brown it can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte or high lithophyte alternately arranged on stems ovate egg shaped obovate reverse egg shaped or oval shaped leaves are anywhere from long and wide on long petioles stalks that join leaves to stems they are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs there are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off midvein at an angle of 41 5 84 0deg while distinct basal veins run off midvein at an angle of 18 5 78 9deg as with all figs fruit fig is actually an inverted inflorescence compound flower known as a syconium with tiny flowers arising from fig s inner surface into a hollow cavity f rubiginosa is monoecious both male and female flowers are found on same plant and in fact in same fruit although they mature at different times often growing in pairs figs are yellow initially and measure across ripening to red in colour they are tipped with a small nipple and on a stalk fruits ripen throughout year although more so in spring and summer some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at same time it closely resembles its relative moreton bay fig f macrophylla having similar ranges in wild they are often confused smaller leaves shorter fruit stalks and rusty colour of undersides of leaves of f rubiginosa are easiest distinguishing features it is also confused with small leaved fig f obliqua syconia of which are smaller measuring 4 12 mm long and 4 11 mm in diameter compared with 7 17 mm long and 8 17 mm diameter for f rubiginosa distribution and habitat thumb right lithophytic ficus rubiginosa growing on sandstone at new south wales ficus range spans entire eastern coastline of australia from top of cape york peninsula in north queensland to vicinity of bega on south coast of new south wales range extends westwards to porcupine gorge national park in queensland and far western plains in new south wales f rubiginosa f rubiginosa and f rubiginosa f glabrescens are found over most of range though latter does not occur south past new south wales queensland border region lithophytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants f rubiginosa is found in rainforest rainforest margins gullies riverbank habitat vine thickets and rocky hillsides it is found on limestone outcrops in kanangra boyd national park fig seedlings often grow from cracks in stone where seeds have been lodged in locations such as cliffs and rock faces in natural environments or in brickwork on buildings and elsewhere in urban environment soils it grows on are often well drained and low in nutrients they are derived from sandstone quartzite and basalt in sydney region f rubiginosa grows from sea level to 1000 m 3500 ft altitude in areas with an average yearly rainfall of f rubiginosa is largely sympatric with f obliqua though its range extends further west into dryer regions than latter species outside its native range f rubiginosa has naturalised to some degree in urban melbourne and adelaide in australia as well as new zealand hawaii and california and mediterranean europe f rubiginosa has been planted widely in malta since early 1990s but has not been observed to fruit ecology fruit is consumed by many bird species including rose crowned fruit dove ptilinopus regina wompoo fruit dove p magnificus wonga pigeon melanoleuca topknot pigeon lopholaimus antarcticus pacific koel orientalis australasian swamphen porphyrio melanotus australian king parrot alisterus scapularis australasian figbird sphecotheres vieilloti green catbird ailuroedus crassirostris regent bowerbird sericulus chrysocephalus satin bowerbird ptilonorhynchus violaceus and pied currawong strepera graculina as well as mammalian grey headed flying fox pteropus poliocephalus and spectacled flying fox pteropus it is one of several plant species used as food by endangered s fig parrot many fruits drop onto ground around tree though others are dispersed by animals that eat them thrips species gynaikothrips australis feeds on underside of new leaves of f rubiginosa as well as f obliqua and f macrophylla as plant cells die nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results and leaves become distorted and curl over thrips begin feeding when tree has flushes of new growth and live for around six weeks at other times thrips reside on old leaves without feeding species pupates sheltered in bark thrips remain in galls at night wander about in daytime and return in evening possibly to different galls about tree psyllids have almost defoliated trees in royal botanic gardens in sydney in spring reproduction and life span f rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated in a symbiotic relationship with pleistodontes imperialis a species of fig wasp biologist eleanor haine and colleagues analysed dna of wasp across fig s range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term p imperialis species complex they diverge to a greater degree than some distinct wasp species yet form a monophyletic group this indicates that wasp lineages have split without a change of host fertilised female wasps enter receptive fig syconium through a tiny hole at crown ostiole they crawl around interior of fig pollinating some of female flowers before laying eggs inside some of flowers and dying after several weeks development in their galls male wasps emerge before females they chew holes in galls containing females and fertilise them through hole they have just chewed males return later to mated females and enlarge mating holes to enable females to emerge some males then chew their way through syconium wall which allows females to disperse after collecting pollen from now fully developed male flowers females then have a short time 48 hours to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen a field study in brisbane found that f rubiginosa trees often bore both male and female phase syconia at same time which could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through winter showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species f rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than other members of genus p imperialis crossed waters between australia and new zealand some time between 1960 and 1972 and seedlings of previously infertile trees of f rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls and on other trees particularly in parks and gardens around auckland they have been recorded as far south as napier p imperialis has been transported to hawaii california and israel where it has been observed to pollinate its host they can live to 100 years or more and have been known to resprout after bushfire bearing fruit within three years other life in syconia as with many other ficus species community of wasps inside figs of f rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator wasps these develop deep inside syconium presumably protected there from parasites also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species which do not pollinate fig at least fourteen species have been recorded of which four two each belonging to genera sycoscapter and philotrypesis are common while others are rare investigation of f rubiginosa syconia found that fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer to wall of syconium wasps of genera sycoscapter and philotrypesis are parasitic and are around same size as pollinator species their larvae are thought to feed on larvae of pollinator wasp male sycoscapter and philotrypesis wasps fight other males of same species when they encounter each other in a f rubiginosa fig several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter immature figs before other wasps and induce galls which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in fig later an example of this is minerva a metallic green wasp species nematodes of genus schistonchus are found in syconia and pollinator wasps of many species of fig with f rubiginosa hosting two species they appear to be less species specific than wasps s altermacrophylla is generally associated with f rubiginosa though it has been recorded on several other fig species cultivation thumb right as bonsai auburn botanic gardens ficus rubiginosa was first cultivated in united kingdom in 1789 where it is grown in glasshouses it is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern australia in north island of new zealand and also in hawaii and california where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas it is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses not as prodigious as other figs f rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas such as lining car parks or suburban streets however surface roots can be large and intrusive and thin bark readily damaged when struck tolerant of acid or alkaline soils it is hardy to us hardiness zones 10b and 11 reaching 10 m 35 ft high in 30 years planting trees 8 12 m 30 40 ft apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves leaving a mess underfoot in a brief description william guilfoyle recorded a variegated fig from new south wales 12 15 ft high in 1911 as f rubiginosa variety variegata a variegated form is in cultivation on australia s east coast and in united states it is a chimera lacking in chlorophyll in second layer of leaf meristem leaves have an irregular central green patch along midvein with irregular yellow and green elsewhere leaves that grow in winter generally have larger green patches than those that do in summer chimera is unstable and branches of all green growth appear sporadically despite relatively large size of leaves it is popular for bonsai work as it is highly forgiving to work with and hard to kill leaves reduce readily by leaf pruning in early summer described as best tree for a beginner to work with it is one of most frequently used native species in australia its bark remains smooth and does not attain a rugged aged appearance known as little ruby a narrow leaved form with its origins somewhere north of sydney is also seen in cultivation f rubiginosa is also suited for use as a in low medium or brightly lit spaces although a variegated form requires brighter light it has gained royal horticultural society s award of garden merit it is easily propagated by cuttings or aerial layering light coloured wood is soft and brittle lightweight it has some value in making of such items as toys and small boxes see also ficus macrophylla notes references external links rubiginosa
