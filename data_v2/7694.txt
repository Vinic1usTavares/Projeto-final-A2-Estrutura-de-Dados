niagara falls suspension bridge stood from 1855 to 1897 across niagara river and was world s first working railway suspension bridge it spanned and stood downstream of niagara falls where it connected niagara falls ontario to niagara falls new york trains used upper of its two decks while pedestrians and carriages used lower bridge was idea of canadian politicians and it was built by an american company and a canadian company it was most commonly called suspension bridge although other names included niagara railway suspension bridge niagara suspension bridge and its official american name of international suspension bridge bridge was part of canadian politician william hamilton merritt s vision to promote trade within his country and with its neighbor united states many argued that a suspension bridge could not support safe passage of trains including bridge builders nonetheless bridge companies hired charles ellet jr who laid a line by a kite across chasm and built a temporary suspension bridge in 1848 ellet left project after a financial dispute with bridge companies who hired john augustus roebling to complete project by 1854 his bridge was nearly complete and lower deck was opened for pedestrian and carriage travel on march 18 1855 a fully laden passenger train officially opened completed bridge suspension bridge was a border crossing between canada and united states and it played significant roles in histories of niagara region and two countries three railway lines crossed over bridge connecting cities on both sides of border great western railway new york central railroad and new york and erie rail road differed in track gauge bridge used a triple gauge system to conserve space overlapping two tracks on top of each other and using a rail of each to form third track railroads brought a large influx of trade and tourists into region around niagara falls in time leading to american civil war underground railroad helped slaves in united states escape across suspension bridge to freedom in canada after war bridge became a symbol of inspiration to americans encouraging them to rebuild their country and pushing them to quickly industrialize their nation bridge s success proved that a railway suspension bridge could be safe and operational its wooden structures began to decay and were replaced with stronger steel and iron versions by 1886 heavier trains required it to be replaced by steel arch bridge later renamed whirlpool rapids bridge on august 27 1897 conception and construction in mid 19th century hinterlands of north american east coast opened up rapidly in canada entrepreneur and politician william hamilton merritt helped establish several trade routes especially in dredged waterways between lake cities he also envisioned a u s and canadian rail network to connect atlantic coast with new territories in west and this led to a railway suspension bridge across niagara river below falls left thumb upright alt a white haired man in a suit and bowtie faces right william hamilton merritt was chief proponent for suspension bridge merritt s vision for niagara suspension bridge was conceived at niagara river itself in summer 1844 while taking a picnic on river shores near what was then town of clifton merritt read a letter from his sons to his wife younger merritts were touring europe and visited town of fribourg switzerland amazed by freiburg suspension bridge they wrote to their parents describing wonders of bridge in eloquent terms their writing had a profound effect on their parents and elder merritts wondered if such a suspension bridge could be built across niagara merritt was driven to realize that vision and he approached relevant authorities including queen of england for permission to start construction of suspension bridge his efforts were rewarded in 1846 state of new york and government of canada approved charters to form niagara falls international bridge company and niagara falls suspension bridge company respectively in years before first bridge was built over niagara river river was crossed entirely by boats powered by steam engines vessels ferried people and carriages across raging river at calmer points of water one of these vessels was maid of mist first tourist boat to ply waters of niagara river named after a local legend steamer began service in 1846 launching from a point below horseshoe falls it up to base of falls offering a close up view of natural wonder to its passengers before moving to opposite shore site for suspension bridge was half a mile 0 8 km from maid of mists landings selection of bridge site was based more on aesthetics than technical ease it was narrowest point of gorge across and deep that allowed a full view of falls from american side after bridge companies were founded they invited engineers to submit plans and cost estimates for a suspension bridge that carried a railway invitation was met with skepticism among engineering community at that time there was not a suspension bridge that could allow a train to pass over it safely while europeans were erecting suspension bridges by hundreds americans mostly ignored them out of safety concerns in 1831 sir samuel brown s broughton suspension bridge in britain had collapsed under marching feet of a troop of soldiers sending those on its deck into river irwell furthermore many american bridges had collapsed without experiencing weight and pressure equivalent to railroad traffic and american engineers feared that any railway bridge would likely fail especially a suspension bridge four engineers responded edward serrell samuel keefer charles ellet jr and john augustus roebling all submitted designs for a suspension bridge at time of bidding ellet and roebling were acknowledged as masters of suspension bridge building in america roebling submitted two designs a conservative single deck suspension bridge and a double decked version both with meticulous calculations and drawings instead of relying solely on submissions charles ellet jr took a proactive approach when he got wind of project in 1845 he wrote to charles b stuart chief engineer of great western railway boldly proclaiming that he could build a bridge for any likely purpose across niagara after charters had been obtained ellet helped stuart to sell bridge companies stock and offered to buy us 30 000 worth of stock himself his efforts earned him 190 000 bridge contract on november 9 1847 charles ellet jr s temporary bridge thumb upright alt side profile of a man who has his hair

charles ellet jr scraped through odd jobs but saved enough money to finance an education at ecole nationale des ponts et chaussees in france after attending four months of lectures he toured europe before returning to united states as only native born american with european education in engineering ellet announced his ambitions to build suspension bridges in his country of birth by proposing to span potomac river with one his proposal was ignored few were willing to heed a young inexperienced and impetuous engineer to gain experience ellet started to work on railroads and canals and later became chief engineer on james river and kanawha canal project he further improved his reputation by contributing articles about suspension bridges to respected engineering journals such as american railroad journal eventually ellet built his first suspension bridge over schuylkill river pennsylvania in 1842 ellet had looks of an actor which were complemented by his entertaining oratorical skills he took advantage of these characteristics and used showmanship and dramatics to market his proposals these skills helped to win him attention and raise his profile both in public and within industry however his also ruffled feathers of people which caused conflicts nonetheless his capability to promote himself had won him contracts for suspension bridge and later wheeling suspension bridge wheeling contract was won in july 1847 while ellet s plan for niagara suspension bridge was still in its initial stages of construction ellet s initial design for bridge at niagara placed all forms of transportation on a single deck railway track was in middle of deck sandwiched between carriageways and footpaths on outer sides moreover trains would not go over bridge their cars would be disconnected from heavy locomotives and pulled across bridge by horses cables or lighter engines before work could begin ellet faced problem of all suspension bridge construction getting a line across gap ellet s brainstorming sessions with his men raised several ideas that could enable a line to be suspended across gorge these included firing cannonballs with line attached towing it across river with a steamer and tying it to a rocket that would then be launched across gorge ultimately bridge engineer chose an idea inspired by benjamin franklin s experiment with a kite it was similar to 15th century inventor leonardo da vinci s plan to span a gap ellet also took opportunity to generate publicity for his project organizing a kite flying contest he offered 5 to any boy who flew a kite across gorge and secured kite string to other side youths from nearby towns flocked in to participate unlike other boys who flew their kites from united states side of gorge 16 year old homan walsh crossed river by a ferry upstream and walked to canadian side of bridge site to launch his kite he almost succeeded on his first attempt his kite flew across but crashed just short of shore after resting several days at a friend s house walsh finally got his kite across gorge and secured its line to a tree thumb left alt a basket made of iron bars sit among artefacts such as plaques portrait collages and cannon basket in which charles ellet crossed niagara gorge is on display at buffalo historical society charles ellet and his team tied a heavier line to kite string and pulled joined lines across they pulled successive heavier and stronger lines across until final bridge cable thick was hanging across gorge cable was suspended between two wooden towers tall and attached to an iron basket ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across gorge saving time that would otherwise have been spent on land and ferry travel through media coverage and word of mouth many people knew of ellet s efforts and flocked to site to watch construction on march 13 1848 system was completed and team planned to test it by pulling empty basket across they hit a snag when basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead pulling back basket ellet decided to assure watching crowd that system was workable he stepped into basket and it moved towards opposite shore when ellet reached problematic spot he spotted issue basket s rollers could not pass over a portion of cable that had been accidentally flattened during construction he fixed problem and proceeded to cross to canadian side and back becoming first person to cross gorge although bridge companies had prohibited ellet from collecting tolls he charged each person 1 00 for chance to observe first hand engineering wonder of bridging niagara on some days basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across gorge continuing his construction ellet built two footbridges and joined them together to form an wide suspension bridge he intended to use this temporary bridge as a scaffold for construction of permanent railway bridge on july 29 1848 bridge builder inaugurated span in his typical manner standing in his horse buggy like a gladiator in his chariot ellet sped across bridge which had railings for only a third of its length at that time his stunt garnered further publicity for bridge and toll collected from span proved lucrative 5 000 was collected in less than a year since its official opening on august 1 1848 disputes arose between bridge companies and ellet over their shares of money and their relations turned bitter companies charged that ellet was late in his schedule and withheld payment ellet retaliated by mounting cannons at bridge to claim ownership over it in end matter went to court bridge companies paid 10 000 to charles ellet and he left project to work full time on wheeling suspension bridge niagara suspension bridge project was in hiatus for three years before bridge companies engaged another renowned civil engineer john augustus roebling to complete it delay caused roebling to miss out on honor of building first permanent bridge to span niagara serrell completed lewiston suspension bridge in 1851 roebling would however achieve other honors in building his niagara railway suspension bridge john augustus roebling s

born in prussia later a part of germany john augustus roebling obtained his first conditional engineering degree at erfurt in 1824 he attended two semesters of lessons at berlin s and worked for prussian government constructing military roads tired of bureaucracy he resigned his position and left for united states in 1830 arriving with his brother in philadelphia on august 6 1831 instead of continuing an engineering profession he took up farming for a living after five years he married a tailor s daughter and had eight children with her over next decade he found agrarian work unsatisfactory and in 1837 after death of his brother and birth of his first child he returned to engineering roebling first signed on as a surveyor for beaver river canal system launching his career with a string of canal and railroad projects aside from writing articles in engineering journals roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them john a roebling company was first wire rope manufacturer in united states gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering roebling finally got to build suspension bridges his first bridge was allegheny suspension aqueduct in pittsburgh structure completed in 1845 was first suspension aqueduct in world and first large american suspension bridge that had multiple spans furthermore it was first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques roebling s own invention earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating main cables at a factory transporting them to bridge site and then stretching heavy cables over gap to erect them over bridge roebling during his experiments with wire ropes conceived and patented a new construction method for these main cables a long line traveler rope formed a loop around two horizontal wheels one on each side of gorge a lightweight wheel traveling wheel was attached to this line and a wire threaded around this wheel like a belt in a mechanical system traveler rope and its wheel moved across gap as horizontal wheels turned pulling wire along traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of same wire running above and under traveling wheel across gap at a time lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands which were later compressed together into main cables supporting themselves and later proportional weight of bridge as they were formed method became standard for suspension bridge construction and remained unchanged for many years in 20th century suspension bridges were still built with this pulley winding system albeit with more sophisticated equipment thumb upright left alt a man in a suit and bowtie looks to front his hairline has receded to top of his head and he sports a short beard and mustache john augustus roebling built several prominent suspension bridges in united states earning him esteem of engineering community roebling was a contrasting character to charles ellet whereas ellet embellished his proposals with fanciful words and deeds roebling presented papers filled with meticulous calculations and drawings elder engineer was stern and driven to achieve taking a scientific approach to all interests rarely did he show emotions in his dealings even to his closest associates however he dared to confront his detractors and make bold about his work he openly called european suspension bridges including american suspension bridges built with european techniques weak and occasionally sniped at ellet s and stephenson s works he announced that his brooklyn bridge when completed will not only be greatest bridge in existence but it will be greatest engineering work of this continent and of age roebling s history with ellet started before bidding for niagara suspension bridge early in their careers during bidding for schuylkill suspension bridge project ellet had written a proposal that was published in american railroad journal mistakenly believing ellet had won contract roebling wrote to offer his congratulations and requested to be ellet s assistant he received a formal reply without any reference to his request and his subsequent letter was ignored when roebling learned that a contractor had won bid he successfully applied to be contractor s chief engineer ellet however persisted with his tactics and snatched project away from contractor he promoted himself to bridge company and offered to accept land instead of cash as payment from then on ellet and roebling became rivals vying with each other for suspension bridge projects in north america roebling learned from their rivalry his losses to ellet showed him that he needed to promote himself and gain backers to effectively secure contracts he desired when roebling was called to niagara suspension bridge project in 1851 he had six suspension structures to his name he found ellet s final plan to be impractical bridge would have been too heavy and expensive roebling had another design in mind double deck bridge he had proposed earlier during bidding lower deck level with edge of chasm would convey passengers and carriages and upper deck above would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non stop albeit at a speed of roebling reasoned that decks and sufficient trusses would form a rigid tube making bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge theory was similar to that of tubular bridge but implemented at a lower cost engineering community was critical of roebling s project robert stephenson builder of tubular britannia bridge was among those shortlisted to complete niagara suspension bridge before roebling s selection stephenson had submitted a design for a tubular bridge and in 1859 he built a large and expensive tubular bridge for grand trunk railway at montreal quebec bridge builder then said in derision of roebling s suspension railway if your bridge succeeds mine is a magnificent blunder in face of criticism roebling completed project in four years using ellet s bridge as scaffolding railway deck was stress tested by crossing of steam engine london at a speed of on march 8 1855 ten days later upper deck of bridge was officially opened lower deck had been opened to public a year earlier as first commercial passenger train trundled over bridge two countries were finally connected by railroad across niagara river successful crossings of these and later trains made roebling s suspension bridge first working suspension railway bridge in history engineering thumb upright alt three railway lines

train and engineer on suspension bridge before 1886 roebling s bridge was supported by two limestone towers on each side of gorge these egyptian style towers stood tall on american shore and tall on canadian shore with their foundations in earth limestone structures could support up to 12 million pounds 5 4 million kg four thick main cables held up bridge two cables ran through iron saddles at top of each tower each cable comprised 3 059 wires that were spun with roebling s patented technique used in his allegheny suspension aqueduct ends of each cable were secured to cast iron plates sunk deep in bedrock support lines hung down from iron clamps that encircled main cables and held up decks deep trusses never before seen on a large suspension bridge lined sides of bridge and joined two decks so that structure looked like a cage trussed sides and upper and lower decks which spanned formed a hollow straight beam reinforcing rigidity of bridge suspension bridge was further stiffened by guy wires which ran from its upper deck to top of its towers criticism of suspension bridges was growing after wheeling suspension bridge collapsed under strong winds in 1854 to address these concerns roebling added more guy wires to secure lower deck to shores below roebling s efforts ensured that his suspension bridge remained standing while other suspension bridges across niagara river collapsed because of strong winds although he was not first engineer to appreciate need for a suspension bridge to be sufficiently rigid or to implement methods to do so roebling was first to understand principles behind methods and combine them in building of a suspension bridge roebling proved that despite popular opinion properly built suspension bridges can safely support passage of heavy railway traffic his combination of stiffening methods created first modern suspension bridge such was rigidity of suspension bridge that it withstood shockwave caused by nearby fall of a mass of rock in 1863 force of impact manifested itself as a wave rippling through decks of bridge from american side to canadian side and back from united states new york and erie rail road s canandaigua and niagara falls railroad and new york central railroad s buffalo and niagara falls railroad crossed over bridge and reached into ontario similarly great western railway in canada extended its network from canada into new york at time of bridge s opening three railroads were of different gauges on new york central on great western and on erie instead of accommodating three railways side by side on a single wide deck bridge saved space by overlapping tracks over each other this method used only four rails one pair formed track for one railway and other pair formed another one rail from each pair would then form final track in first year of bridge s operation an average of 30 trains trundled across it each day five years later 45 trains passed over structure daily roebling mandated that trains be limited to a maximum speed of to ensure absolute safety he was confident bridge could handle faster train traffic but he preferred a safe operation in his tests bridge supported a train bending under weight this was within maximum load of specified in design of bridge figure was a conservative estimate cables and guy wires could support and travel journalist alfred j commented that it was normal to see trains pass over bridge without danger bridge shook whenever a train trundled over it although this had no effect on its integrity when frequency of passing trains was high trembling was noticeable to travelers on lower deck and proved uncomfortable to some writer mark twain noted you drive over to suspension bridge and divide your misery between chances of smashing down two hundred feet into river below and chances of having a railway train overhead smashing down onto you either possibility is taken by itself but mixed together they amount in aggregate to positive unhappiness despite such commentaries thousands of people crossed over bridge safely every day thumb upright left alt a square opening forms entrance to bridge s lower level vertical wooden supports line level flagstones pave

deep trusses that helped reinforce bridge s rigidity are visible american engineers regard suspension bridge as a major achievement of efficiency in a fledgling country where resources material and financial were limited they had to make do with whatever was available this goal was espoused by american society of civil engineers which opined that is best engineering not which makes most splendid or even most perfect work but that which makes a work that answers purpose well at least cost roebling had built a bridge that rivaled grander bridges of leading european nations at a much lower cost his suspension bridge used only one sixth material of stephenson s brittania bridge but was twice as long and had a capacity that exceeded tubular bridge moreover expenditure on roebling s suspension bridge was 400 000 whereas a tubular bridge of equivalent length and load bearing capability would have cost 4 million roebling s success established him as master of suspension bridges inclined guy wires that stretched from top of towers to roadway of suspension bridge became signature of his future works although suspension bridge proved that suspension system could be safely used to carry railroads no more suspension railway bridges were built outbreak of american civil war diverted attention from such civil engineering ventures and by time attention was paid to building bridges again cantilever bridges were in vogue for railway bridges regardless suspension bridge s success made it a model for suspension railway bridges when city of quebec called for a structure to span st lawrence river in 1850 it looked to suspension bridge for inspiration seventeen years later british journal engineering called for a suspension railway to bridge straits of messina and also referred to roebling s bridge lastly charles b stuart opened his 1871 work on history of american engineering lives and works of civil and military engineering in america with an illustration of bridge legacy as a border crossing between two large growing countries suspension bridge had throngs of travelers passing over it furthermore it was intersection of three major railroads coupled with its vicinity to a natural wonder niagara falls bridge brought a lot of railroad traffic into region once it was opened towns at ends of bridge benefited greatly from this heavy movement of people and goods village of suspension bridge united states grew quickly within a few years after opening of bridge acquiring shops factories and a hotel its tourism and commerce soon rivaled town of niagara falls new york eventually village was merged into town in 1892 similarly clifton on canadian end of bridge was integrated into town of niagara falls ontario two niagara falls cities boasted commerce that surpassed neighboring settlements around time of its official opening bridge was one of busiest points of trade on united states canada border carrying 12 million of transitory goods and 2 million of bonded materials into canada to handle large amount of goods exchanged over border lewiston customs house primary customs for niagara region was relocated to niagara suspension bridge in 1863 thumb alt a

to some when there was overcast weather on whole suspension bridge was considered as an attraction that must be seen by visitors to niagara falls in paintings and prints of bridge suspension bridge became focus pushing falls into background unlike paintings of falls that capture viewer s eye with their majestic views of natural wonder pictures of bridge impressed viewers with utilitarian design of structure by 1897 inbound trains to niagara falls brought 276 900 visitors during months of may to august a streetcar system was established in 1882 to handle increasing cross border pedestrian traffic initially pulled by horses trolleys were converted to run on electricity in 1892 suspension bridge was pride and symbol of great western railway which touted it as only route via niagara falls

travelers on suspension bridge witnessed several death defying stunts performed across niagara gorge on june 30 1859 they saw charles blondin s feat of becoming first man to cross chasm on a tightrope in mid crossing blondin sat down on rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from deck of maid of mist below in his later tightrope acts at same spot acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion one time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid crossing another time he carried his manager harry colcord on his back while giving colcord a piggyback ride blondin stopped five times on tightrope to rest and recover his strength each time colcord gingerly got off blondin s back and stood on tightrope climbing back on after acrobat had enough rest blondin s success inspired other acrobats such as william leonard hunt great farini samuel dixon clifford and signorina maria spelterini to emulate and try to surpass his acts at same spot signorina only woman to walk across niagara on a tightrope once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles another group of people in america had their own risky crossings over niagara gorge as they fled over border into canada they were enslaved african americans who sought freedom by escaping to a country that declared liberation of any slave who entered it bridge was part of underground railroad a network of routes designed to smuggle slaves in united states to freedom in canada before american civil war fleeing slaves had only four main routes into canada of which one was crossing niagara river enslaved people who escaped along niagara route had help from several quarters state of new york generally favored granting freedom to enslaved people this attitude emboldened african american workers in niagara who frequently helped slaves flee to canada before suspension bridge was completed fugitives either crossed raging river on a boat or risked their lives by swimming at calmer points of river suspension bridge made escape across river easier and safer although there was still risk to avoid getting caught and sent back to their owners enslaved people had to sneak across on foot or hide aboard trains and antislavery activist harriet tubman guided fugitives at night and bribed custom officials to turn a blind eye as a result many slaves crossed suspension bridge to freedom before united states was engulfed in civil war when american civil war ended and united states turned its focus toward rebuilding roebling started building his brooklyn bridge as monumental task could affect naval navigation it required state approval and government wanted a thorough review of engineer s credentials hence a bridge party was organized comprising roebling and his son as well as their fellow bridge engineers generals businessmen and high society figures party toured country to review four bridges roebling had built before civil war final item on their itinerary was roebling s niagara suspension bridge at dinner to commemorate end of bridge tour civil war veteran general henry warner slocum gave a toast and called suspension bridge a symbol of inspiration for united states in its rebuilding efforts this sentiment was shared by guests and was expressed at later dinners across united states achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in face of overwhelming adversity constant put downs by professional community american and european gave united states a sense of pride nationalism rose as country lauded bridge completion of bridge that had been deemed impossible by western world gave americans who had lesser technical accomplishments than europe at that time a trophy that stood above any other suspension bridge became american symbol to brave toughest of challenges and do impossible pushing their drive for industrialization even harder charles w woodman specifically drew attention to suspension bridge in his 1865 address to united states senate for approval to build a rail system to transport a ship out of water and up around niagara falls maintenance and replacement thumb alt towers made of steel beams hold up cables that suspend a bridge suspension bridge in 1886 after its wooden components had been replaced with steel budget concerns forced roebling to build suspension bridge primarily with wood cost of casting components out of iron and transporting them way out west was exorbitant organic material decayed and rotted because of moisture present around niagara falls as industrialization of united states moved forward rapidly introduction of bessemer process greatly lowered cost of more durable steel and iron by 1880 suspension bridge s wooden trusses beams and flooring were replaced with steel wire cables were not replaced their cores were still in pristine condition outer layer of wires in cables was however lightly corroded and had to be replaced due to severe deterioration limestone towers were replaced in 1886 with steel framed versions these renovations increased bridge s strength and helped it handle heavier loads for a few more years thumb bridge with enclosed elevator towers charles bierstadt photographer weight of trains in north america had greatly increased by mid 1890s larger and more powerful locomotives were required to pull cars that handled an increasing number of passengers and goods compared to locomotives crossing bridge in 1850s locomotives were common engines 40 years later weight of these trains exceeded specifications of suspension bridge and bridge companies took opportunity to review and request replacement of bridge civil engineer l buck who had been hired to maintain suspension bridge was selected to design replacement bridge he settled for a bridge of arch design at that time arch bridges were new models for railway bridges and were more cost efficient than suspension bridges buck built new bridge around and below suspension bridge replacing it a piece at a time his plan allowed bridge traffic train and pedestrian to continue without disruption by august 27 1897 last pieces of suspension bridge were dismantled leaving lower steel arch bridge later renamed whirlpool rapids bridge in its stead on inspection cores of cables that formerly held up suspension bridge were found to be as sound as on day bridge was built notes and references notes
