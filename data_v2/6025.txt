battle of rejaf or battle of was fought on 17 february 1897 between belgian led forces of congo free state and mahdist rebels in south sudan battle resulted in a congolese victory and permanent expulsion of mahdists from lado enclave as well as establishment of a belgian outpost along nile king leopold ii belgian king and ruler of congo free state acquired lado enclave in south sudan from britain in 1894 as part of a territory exchange which gave british a strip of land along eastern congo for belgian access to navigable nile however territory was overrun with mahdist rebels who had established their stronghold at town of rejaf which occupied a valuable position for trade along nile river after a wave of new funding from belgian government in 1895 king leopold ordered an expedition to be led into lado enclave to expel mahdists and fortify rejaf as a strategic military and trading outpost belgian expedition led by commandant louis napoleon chaltin reached position after a month long advance north east towards mahdist stronghold rebels numbering two thousand had established a two mile line across a range of hills giving their numerically superior forces a tactical advantage over chaltin s eight hundred men after a failed flanking maneuver by mahdists chaltin s forces stormed heights and dislodged rebel defenders congolese companies pursued retreating mahdists back towards town of rejaf where a final defense was made and similarly defeated victory achieved at relatively little cost cleared lado enclave of mahdist rebels and secured rejaf as a belgian base for future operations in surrounding territories and along nile rejaf became seat of government within lado enclave and remained thus when british eventually reclaimed territory in 1910 origins left thumb 250x250px map of lado enclave with rejaf visible along nile in 1894 king leopold ii and great britain signed 1894 anglo congolese treaty which resulted in exchange of a long strip of land on eastern side of congo for lado enclave leased to king leopold ii for duration of his reign dodwell 1929 p 283 this aided british in pursuing cape to cairo railway as well as preventing french from achieving an east west line by putting belgians in their path with lado enclave king leopold gained direct access to rejaf last outpost on navigable nile roger louis 2006 p 68 although outbreak of mahdist war 1881 1899 had disrupted trade up and down nile river leopold hoped to gain rejaf in preparation for its reopening once mahdist threat had been addressed since 1888 when mahdist rebels forced evacuation of then governor emin pasha lado enclave had been occupied by rebels under leadership of emir arabi dafalla rejaf was their strongest fortified position in area and it was there arabi dafalla stationed his equipment and soldiers leslie hill 1967 p 58 pakenham 1992 p 525 6 establishment of mahdist sudan had provided context for european powers to commence invasion and colonization of sudan in which king leopold desperately wanted to take part in order to expand his congolese empire 2003 p 39 however a direct military campaign into area was not an option leopold would not have been able to get permission from either french or british according to rules laid out in 1884 berlin conference especially considering both nations were looking to annex sudan themselves king leopold ii therefore decided to disguise his campaign into sudan as an expeditionary force sent to reclaim lado enclave from mahdists although he intended to give his commanders covert orders to continue their advance far past boundaries of belgian territory first to fashoda and then on to khartoum ascherson 2001 p 222 after receiving a new loan of 6 5 million francs from belgian government in 1895 leopold ordered preparations to be made for execution of his plan expedition was split into two parts first group composed of around eight hundred colonial troops and led by commandant louis napoleon chaltin was to take main road towards rejaf and engage rebels openly richard fox bourne 1903 p 238 second under belgian war hero baron dhanis was a much larger force of over three thousand men mostly natives from tetela ethnic group and was to take a treacherous path through jungle to north ascherson 2001 p 223 both expeditions left for lado enclave in december 1896

column mutinied against their officers in february 1897 richard fox bourne 1903 p 230 mutiny broke out in advance guard which had been pushed hardest of those in expedition but soon spread to main army where massively outnumbered belgian officers were detained by their men and killed dhanis himself escaped massacre by hiding in forest although his brother was among those killed now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout immediate area terrorizing northern congo and causing great consternation among belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep peace alt azande chief thumb azande chief bafuka this left chaltin s expedition as spearhead for leopold s northern campaign and commandant continued his mission despite grave loss of dhanis forces chaltin had in his column eight companies each containing one hundred congolese soldiers led by a belgian lieutenant richard fox bourne 1903 p 231 he was accompanied by a contingent of five hundred azande under chiefs renzi and bafuka de 1956 p 10 expedition reached nile on 14 february 1897 where a small party of mahdists from rejaf exchanged fire with chaltin s scouts charles de kavanagh boulger 1898 p 216 after two days of waiting for supply train and rear guard to arrive a mahdist force approached belgian camp in evening of 16 february and prepared to attack chaltin ordered his artillery to fire at mahdists causing assembled rebels to flee under barrage next day at six o clock in morning chaltin took to offensive and began to advance on rejaf battle chaltin s column advanced north with nile river protecting his right flank and azande cavalry contingent on his left at seven o clock belgian scouts sighted two thousand strong mahdist force assembled along a two mile line that spanned a range of hills between nile and a parallel river there was one clear path through hills which was especially well defended commandant chaltin brought forward five companies for attack leaving his remaining three in reserve mahdists immediately opened fire upon free state force who remained in cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from mahdist line for half an hour mahdists continued to fire at chaltin s companies to little effect their shots passing harmlessly above rocks meanwhile free state soldiers moved a krupp gun into position which under sergeant fired several shells into mahdists ranks charles de kavanagh boulger 1898 p 219 left alt krupp 75mm field gun thumb krupp 75mm field gun after wasting their ammunition in this preliminary action mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against belgians mahdists right flank situated along river parallel to nile advanced rapidly trying to pin chaltin with his back to river chaltin who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own replied to threat by ordering sudden advance of his reserve companies move checked advancing mahdists avoiding unfavorable position and causing rebels to falter sensing that victory was near chaltin ordered azande to charge mahdists to separate advanced right wing from rest of line charge was successful and now considerably damaged mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by free state soldiers chaltin s main companies then attacked pressing mahdist defenses as they forced their way into hills three of companies attacked well defended path through hills while two others charged hilltops after a fierce contest for heights demoralized and weakened mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to north towards rejaf leaving ammunition and weapons action was finished by eight thirty that morning charles de kavanagh boulger 1898 p 220 mahdists withdrew to fortified town of rejaf while chaltin s column marched in pursuit for seventeen miles until occupied town was sighted at about one thirty in afternoon a battery of artillery pieces fired on belgians as they came within range but effect was negligible as belgians approached a hidden force of mahdists emerged from a ravine near bank of nile and attacked chaltin s flank commandant realized threat in time and repulsed attack without much loss chaltin s companies then turned to begin attack on town for several hours chaltin s companies pushed through streets and houses of rejaf forcing mahdists back until by seven o clock they had been nearly expelled entirely wellington wack 1905 p 201 only citadel remained occupied but by dawn next morning remaining mahdist forces retreated leaving behind their weapons and munitions charles de kavanagh boulger 1898 p 221 aftermath although concrete casualty numbers are unavailable for either side sources agree that belgian congolese losses were relatively light while several hundred mahdist soldiers were killed in two actions commandant chaltin recovered three cannons over seven hundred rifles and a considerable supply of provisions from mahdist post at rejaf charles de kavanagh boulger 1925 p 29 three thousand congolese regulars were garrisoned at town and a gunboat was brought up nile to defend its ports after securing rejaf chaltin and his column marched to northernmost point of lado enclave in order to establish a belgian presence in area and prevent mahdist reentry a serious assault on post at rejaf occurred in june 1898 when mahdists forced their way through free state defenses before being finally defeated near town h 2016 p 28 emir who had commanded mahdist army at rejaf arabi dafalla withdrew with what remained of his army northwest into mahdist sudan he was ridiculed by his superiors for defeat at rejaf and he later surrendered his army to sultan ali dinar of darfur after a failed attack on a french outpost in 1902 as for king leopold ii s original designs for turning expedition into a campaign into sudan mutiny of baron dhanis column had severely reduced expedition s fighting power and made such a campaign impossible instead leopold s conquest of lado enclave pleased british government at least initially which welcomed any aid in their ongoing war with mahdist sudan but frequent raids outside of lado territory by belgian forces based in rejaf caused alarm and suspicion among british and french officials wary of leopold s imperial ambitions richard fox bourne 1903 p 232 in 1910 following death of belgian king in december 1909 british authorities reclaimed lado enclave as per anglo congolese treaty signed in 1894 and added territory to anglo egyptian sudan references sources category battles of mahdist war category 19th century in africa category african
