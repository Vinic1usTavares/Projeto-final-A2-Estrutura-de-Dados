thumb right zeta device at harwell united kingdom toroidal confinement tube is roughly centred larger device on right encircling tube is magnet used to induce pinch current zeta short for zero energy thermonuclear assembly was a major experiment in early history of fusion power research based on pinch plasma confinement technique and built at atomic energy research establishment in united kingdom zeta was larger and more powerful than any fusion machine in world at that time its goal was to produce large numbers of fusion reactions although it was not large enough to produce net energy zeta went into operation in august 1957 and by end of month it was giving off bursts of about a million neutrons per pulse measurements suggested fuel was reaching between 1 and 5 million kelvins a temperature that would produce nuclear fusion reactions explaining quantities of neutrons being seen early results were leaked to press in september 1957 and following january an extensive review was released front page articles in newspapers around world announced it as a breakthrough towards unlimited energy a scientific advance for britain greater than recently launched sputnik had been for soviet union us and soviet experiments had also given off similar neutron bursts at temperatures that were not high enough for fusion this led lyman spitzer to express his scepticism of results but his comments were dismissed by uk observers as jingoism further experiments on zeta showed that original temperature measurements were misleading bulk temperature was too low for fusion reactions to create number of neutrons being seen claim that zeta had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn an embarrassing event that cast a chill over entire fusion establishment neutrons were later explained as being product of instabilities in fuel these instabilities appeared inherent to any similar design and work on basic pinch concept as a road to fusion power ended by 1961 in spite of zeta s failure to achieve fusion device went on to have a long experimental lifetime and produced numerous important advances in field in one line of development use of lasers to more accurately measure temperature was tested on zeta and was later used to confirm results of soviet tokamak approach in another while examining zeta test runs it was noticed that plasma self stabilised after power was turned off this has led to modern reversed field pinch concept more generally studies of instabilities in zeta have led to several important theoretical advances that form basis of modern plasma theory conceptual development basic understanding of nuclear fusion was developed during 1920s as physicists explored new science of quantum mechanics george gamow s 1928 exploration of quantum tunnelling demonstrated that nuclear reactions could take place at lower energies than classical theory predicted using this theory in 1929 fritz and robert atkinson demonstrated that expected reaction rates in core of sun supported arthur eddington s 1920 suggestion that sun is powered by fusion in 1934 mark oliphant paul harteck and ernest rutherford were first to achieve fusion on earth using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium lithium or other elements this allowed them to measure nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions and determined that deuterium deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions peaking at about 100 000 electronvolts 100 kev this energy corresponds to average energy of particles in a gas heated to thousands of millions of kelvins materials heated beyond a few tens of thousands of kelvins dissociate into their electrons and nuclei producing a gas like state of matter known as plasma in any gas particles have a wide range of energies normally following maxwell boltzmann statistics in such a mixture a small number of particles will have much higher energy than bulk this leads to an interesting possibility even at temperatures well below 100 000 ev some particles will randomly have enough energy to undergo fusion those reactions release huge amounts of energy if that energy can be captured back into plasma it can heat other particles to that energy as well making reaction self sustaining in 1944 enrico fermi calculated this would occur at about 50 000 000 k confinement thumb a modern induction lamp is a low temperature version of a toroidal plasma tube at these temperatures plasma can hit tube walls without harm further confinement is not needed taking advantage of this possibility requires fuel plasma to be held together long enough that these random reactions have time to occur like any hot gas plasma has an internal pressure and thus tends to expand according to ideal gas law for a fusion reactor problem is keeping plasma contained against this pressure any known substance would melt at these temperatures a plasma is electrically conductive and is subject to electric and magnetic fields in a magnetic field electrons and nuclei orbit magnetic field lines a simple confinement system is a plasma filled tube placed inside open core of a solenoid plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to walls of tube as well as move along it towards ends solenoid creates a magnetic field running down centre of tube which particles will orbit preventing their motion towards sides unfortunately this arrangement does not confine plasma along length of tube and plasma is free to flow out ends obvious solution to this problem is to bend tube around into a torus a ring or doughnut shape motion towards sides remains constrained as before and while particles remain free to move along lines in this case they will simply circulate around long axis of tube but as fermi pointed out when solenoid is bent into a ring electrical windings would be closer together on inside than outside this would lead to an uneven field across tube and fuel will slowly drift out of centre some additional force needs to counteract this drift providing long term confinement pinch concept thumb upright 0 5 this lightning rod was crushed when a large current passed through it studying this phenomenon led to discovery of pinch effect a potential solution to confinement problem had been detailed in 1934 by willard harrison bennett any electrical current creates a magnetic field and due to lorentz force this causes an inward directed force this was first noticed in lightning rods bennett showed that same effect would cause a current to self focus a plasma into a thin column a second paper by tonks in 1937 considered issue again introducing name pinch effect it was followed by a paper by tonks and william allis applying a pinch current in a plasma can be used to counteract expansion and confine plasma a simple way to do this is to put plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end like a fluorescent lamp this arrangement still produces no confinement along length of tube so plasma flows onto electrodes rapidly eroding them this is not a problem for a purely experimental machine and there are ways to reduce rate another solution is to place a magnet next to tube when magnetic field changes fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in plasma major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within tube so it can be formed into a torus and allow plasma to circulate freely toroidal pinch concept as a route to fusion was explored in uk during mid 1940s especially by george paget thomson of imperial college london with formation of atomic energy research establishment aere at harwell oxfordshire in 1945 thomson repeatedly petitioned director john cockcroft for funds to develop an experimental machine these requests were turned down at time there was no obvious military use so concept was left unclassified this allowed thomson and moses blackman to file a patent on idea in 1946 describing a device using just enough pinch current to and briefly confine plasma while being heated by a microwave source that would also continually drive current as a practical device there is an additional requirement that reaction conditions last long enough to burn a reasonable amount of fuel in original thomson and blackman design it was job of microwave injection to drive electrons to maintain current and produce pinches that lasted on order of one minute allowing plasma to reach 500 million k current in plasma also heated it if current was also used as heat source only limit to heating was power of pulse this led to a new reactor design where system operated in brief but very powerful pulses such a machine would demand a very large power supply first machines in 1947 cockcroft arranged a meeting of several harwell physicists to study thomson s latest concepts including harwell s director of theoretical physics klaus fuchs thomson s concepts were poorly received especially by fuchs when this presentation also failed to gain funding thomson passed along his concepts to two graduate students at imperial stan cousins and alan ware he added a report on a type of toroidal particle accelerator known as wirbelrohr whirl tube designed in germany by max wirbelrohr consisted of a transformer with a torus shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil similar in concept to toroidal pinch devices later that year ware built a small machine out of old radar equipment and was able to induce powerful currents when they did plasma gave off flashes of light but he could not devise a way to measure temperature of plasma thomson continued to pressure government to allow him to build a full scale device using his considerable political currency to argue for creation of a dedicated experimental station at associated electrical industries aei lab that had recently been constructed at aldermaston ware discussed experiments with anyone who was interested including jim tuck of clarendon laboratory at oxford university while working at los alamos during war tuck and stanislaw ulam had built an unsuccessful colliding beam fusion system similar to rutherford s pioneering experiment tuck was joined by australian peter thonemann who had worked on fusion theory and two arranged funding through clarendon to build a small device like one at imperial but before this work started tuck was offered a job in us eventually returning to los alamos thonemann continued working on idea and began a rigorous programme to explore basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field starting with linear tubes and mercury gas he found that current tended to expand outward through plasma until it touched walls of container see skin effect he countered this with addition of small electromagnets outside tube which pushed back against current and kept it centred by 1949 he had moved on from glass tubes to a larger copper torus in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma frederick lindemann and cockcroft visited and were duly impressed cockcroft asked herbert skinner to review concepts which he did in april 1948 he was sceptical of thomson s ideas for creating a current in plasma and thought thonemann s ideas seemed more likely to work he also pointed out that behaviour of plasmas in a magnetic field was not well understood and that it is useless to do much further planning before this doubt is resolved meanwhile at los alamos tuck acquainted us researchers with british efforts in early 1951 lyman spitzer introduced his stellarator concept and was shopping idea around nuclear establishment looking for funding tuck was sceptical of spitzer s enthusiasm and felt his development programme was incredibly ambitious he proposed a much less aggressive programme based on pinch both men presented their ideas in washington in may 1951 which resulted in atomic energy commission giving spitzer us 50 000 tuck convinced norris bradbury director of los alamos to give him us 50 000 from discretionary budget using it to build perhapsatron early results thumb right a photograph of kink instability in an early experiment at aldermaston dark rectangle on right is induction magnet in 1950 fuchs admitted to passing uk and us atomic secrets to ussr as fusion devices generated high energy neutrons which could be used to enrich nuclear fuel for bombs uk immediately classified all their fusion research this meant teams could no longer work in open environment of universities imperial team under ware moved to aei labs at aldermaston and oxford team under thonemann moved to harwell by early 1952 there were numerous pinch devices in operation cousins and ware had built several follow on machines under name sceptre and harwell team had built a series of ever larger machines known as mark i through mark iv in us tuck built his perhapsatron in january 1952 it was later learned that fuchs had passed uk work to soviets and that they had started a fusion programme as well it was clear to all of these groups that something was seriously wrong in pinch machines as current was applied plasma column inside vacuum tube would become unstable and break up ruining compression further work identified two types of instabilities nicknamed kink and sausage in kink normally toroidal plasma would bend to sides eventually touching edges of vessel in sausage plasma would neck down at locations along plasma column to form a pattern similar to a link of sausages investigations demonstrated both were caused by same underlying mechanism when pinch current was applied any area of gas that had a slightly higher density would create a slightly stronger magnetic field and collapse faster than surrounding gas this caused localised area to have higher density which created an even stronger pinch and a runaway reaction would follow quick collapse in a single area would cause whole column to break up stabilised pinch thumb to test basic concept of stabilised pinch additional magnets were added to earlier mark 2 torus seen here as wires wound around vacuum chamber early studies of phenomenon suggested one solution to problem was to increase compression rate in this approach compression would be started and stopped so rapidly that bulk of plasma would not have time to move instead a shock wave created by this rapid compression would be responsible for compressing majority of plasma this approach became known as fast pinch los alamos team working on columbus linear machine designed an updated version to test this theory others started looking for ways to stabilise plasma during compression and by 1953 two concepts had come to fore one solution was to wrap vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal if plasma column began to move current in plasma would induce a magnetic field in sheet one that due to lenz s law would push back against plasma this was most effective against large slow movements like entire plasma torus drifting within chamber second solution used additional electromagnets wrapped around vacuum tube magnetic fields from these magnets mixed with pinch field created by current in plasma result was that paths of particles within plasma tube were no longer purely circular around torus but twisted like stripes on a barber s pole in us this concept was known as giving plasma a backbone suppressing small scale localised instabilities calculations showed that this stabilised pinch would dramatically improve confinement times and older concepts suddenly seemed obsolete marshall rosenbluth recently arrived at los alamos began a detailed theoretical study of pinch concept with his wife arianna and richard garwin he developed motor theory or m theory published in 1954 theory predicted that heating effect of electric current was greatly increased with power of electric field this suggested that fast pinch concept would be more likely to succeed as it was easier to produce larger currents in these devices when he incorporated idea of stabilising magnets into theory a second phenomenon appeared for a particular and narrow set of conditions based on physical size of reactor power of stabilising magnets and amount of pinch toroidal machines appeared to be naturally stable zeta begins construction 250px thumb upright elizabeth ii guided by ukaea research director john cockcroft visits zeta fusion reactor while it is under construction main induction magnet dominates left side of image toroidal vacuum chamber has not yet been installed us researchers planned to test both fast pinch and stabilised pinch by modifying their existing small scale machines in uk thomson once again pressed for funding for a larger machine this time he was much more warmly received and initial funding of ps200 000 was provided in late 1954 design work continued during 1955 and in july project was named zeta term zero energy was already widely used in industry to refer to small research reactors like zeep which had a role similar to zeta s goal of producing reactions while releasing no net energy zeta design was finalised in early 1956 metropolitan vickers was hired to build machine which included a 150 tonne pulse transformer largest built in britain to that point a serious issue arose when required high strength steels needed for electrical components were in short supply but a strike in us electrical industry caused a sudden glut of material resolving problem zeta was largest and most powerful fusion device in world at time of its construction its aluminium torus had an internal bore of and a major radius of over three times size of any machine built to date it was also most powerful design incorporating an induction magnet that was designed to induce currents up to 100 000 amperes amps into plasma later amendments to design increased this to 200 000 amps it included both types of stabilisation its aluminium walls acted as metal shield and a series of secondary magnets ringed torus windows placed in gaps between toroidal magnets allowed direct inspection of plasma in july 1954 aere was reorganised into united kingdom atomic energy authority ukaea modifications to harwell s hangar 7 in order to house machine began that year despite its advanced design price tag was modest about us 1 million by late 1956 it was clear that zeta was going to come online in mid 1957 beating model c stellarator and newest versions of perhapsatron and columbus because these projects were secret based on little information available press concluded they were versions of same conceptual device and that british were far ahead in race to produce a working machine soviet visit and push to declassify thumb khrushchev roughly centred bald kurchatov to right bearded and bulganin to right white haired visited harwell on 26 april 1956 cockcroft stands across from them in glasses while a presenter points to mockups of various materials being tested in newly opened dido reactor from 1953 us had increasingly concentrated on fast pinch concept some of these machines had produced neutrons and these were initially associated with fusion there was so much excitement that several other researchers quickly entered field as well among these was stirling colgate but his experiments quickly led him to conclude that fusion was not taking place according to spitzer resistivity temperature of plasma could be determined from current flowing through it when colgate performed calculation temperatures in plasma were far below requirements for fusion this being case some other effect had to be creating neutrons further work demonstrated that these were result of instabilities in fuel localised areas of high magnetic field acted as tiny particle accelerators causing reactions that ejected neutrons modifications attempting to reduce these instabilities failed to improve situation and by 1956 fast pinch concept had largely been abandoned us labs began turning their attention to stabilised pinch concept but by this time zeta was almost complete and us was well behind in 1956 while planning a well publicised state visit by nikita khrushchev and nikolai bulganin to uk harwell researchers received an offer from soviet scientist igor kurchatov to give a talk they were surprised when he began his talk on possibility of producing thermonuclear reactions in a gaseous discharge kurchatov s speech revealed soviet efforts to produce fast pinch devices similar to american designs and their problems with instabilities in plasmas kurchatov noted that they had also seen neutrons being released and had initially believed them to be from fusion but as they examined numbers it became clear plasma was not hot enough and they concluded neutrons were from other interactions kurchatov s speech made it apparent that three countries were all working on same basic concepts and had all encountered same sorts of problems cockcroft missed kurchatov s visit because he had left for us to press for declassification of fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort there was a widespread belief on both sides of atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress now that it was known soviets were at same basic development level and that they were interested in talking about it publicly us and uk began considering releasing much of their information as well this developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at second atoms for peace conference in geneva in september 1958 in june 1957 uk and us finalised their agreement to release data to each other sometime prior to conference which both uk and us planned on attending in force final terms were reached on 27 november 1957 opening projects to mutual inspection and calling for a wide public release of all data in january 1958 promising results thumb a shot using deuterium is being prepared at operator s station reactor can be seen through window zeta started operation in mid august 1957 initially with hydrogen these runs demonstrated that zeta was not suffering from same stability problems that earlier pinch machines had seen and their plasmas were lasting for milliseconds up from microseconds a full three orders of magnitude improvement length of pulses allowed plasma temperature to be measured using spectrographic means although light emitted was broadband doppler shifting of spectral lines of slight impurities in gas oxygen in particular led to calculable temperatures even in early experimental runs team started introducing deuterium gas into mix and began increasing current to 200 000 amps on evening of 30 august machine produced huge numbers of neutrons on order of one million per experimental pulse or shot an effort to duplicate results and eliminate possible measurement failure followed much depended on temperature of plasma if temperature was low neutrons would not be fusion related spectrographic measurements suggested plasma temperatures between 1 and 5 million k at those temperatures predicted rate of fusion was within a factor of two of number of neutrons being seen it appeared that zeta had reached long sought goal of producing small numbers of fusion reactions as it was designed to do us efforts had suffered a string of minor technical setbacks that delayed their experiments by about a year both new perhapsatron s 3 and columbus ii did not start operating until around same time as zeta in spite of being much smaller experiments nevertheless as these experiments came online in mid 1957 they too began generating neutrons by september both these machines and a new design dcx at oak ridge national laboratory appeared so promising that edward gardner reported that prestige politics thumb zeta as seen from above in late 1957 news was too good to keep bottled up tantalising leaks started appearing in september in october thonemann cockcroft and william p thompson hinted that interesting results would be following in november a ukaea spokesman noted indications are that fusion has been achieved based on these hints financial times dedicated an entire two column article to issue between then and early 1958 british press published an average of two articles a week on zeta even us papers picked up story on 17 november new york times reported on hints of success although british and us had agreed to release their data in full at this point overall director of us program lewis strauss decided to hold back release tuck argued that field looked so promising that it would be premature to release any data before researchers knew that fusion was definitely taking place strauss agreed and announced that they would withhold their data for a period to check their results as matter became better known in press on 26 november publication issue was raised in house of commons responding to a question by opposition leader of house announced results publicly while explaining delay in publication due to uk us agreement uk press interpreted this differently claiming that us was dragging its feet because it was unable to replicate british results things came to a head on 12 december when a former member of parliament anthony nutting wrote a new york herald tribune article claiming article resulted in a flurry of activity in macmillan administration having originally planned to release their results at a scheduled meeting of royal society there was great concern over whether to invite americans and soviets especially as they believed americans would be greatly upset if soviets arrived but just as upset if they were not invited and event was all british affair eventually led to ukaea making a public announcement that us was not holding back zeta results but this infuriated local press which continued to claim us was delaying to allow them to catch up early concerns thumb close up of zeta

pinch current in plasma when information sharing agreement was signed in november a further benefit was realised teams from various labs were allowed to visit each other us team including stirling colgate lyman spitzer jim tuck and arthur edward ruark all visited zeta and concluded there was a major probability neutrons were from fusion on his return to us spitzer calculated that something was wrong with zeta results he noticed that apparent temperature 5 million k would not have time to develop during short firing times zeta did not discharge enough energy into plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly if temperature was increasing at relatively slow rate his calculations suggested fusion would not be taking place early in reaction and could not be adding energy that might make up difference spitzer suspected temperature reading was not accurate since it was temperature reading that suggested neutrons were from fusion if temperature was lower it implied neutrons were non fusion in origin colgate had reached similar conclusions in early 1958 he harold furth and john ferguson started an extensive study of results from all known pinch machines instead of inferring temperature from neutron energy they used conductivity of plasma itself based on well understood relationships between temperature and conductivity they concluded that machines were producing temperatures perhaps what neutrons were suggesting nowhere near hot enough to explain number of neutrons being produced regardless of their energy by this time latest versions of us pinch devices perhapsatron s 3 and columbus s 4 were producing neutrons of their own fusion research world reached a high point in january results from pinch experiments in us and uk both announced that neutrons were being released and that fusion had apparently been achieved misgivings of spitzer and colgate were ignored public release worldwide interest thumb a team of reporters asks cockcroft centre questions about zeta it was during this interview that cockcroft offered his assessment that he was 90 sure neutrons seen from device were caused by fusion thumb bas pease centre and bob carruthers right are interviewed by bbc in front of zeta reactor thumb zeta release was front page news around world long planned release of fusion data was announced to public in mid january considerable material from uk s zeta and sceptre devices was released in depth in 25 january 1958 edition of nature which also included results from los alamos perhapsatron s 3 columbus ii and columbus s 2 uk press was livid observer wrote that admiral strauss tactics have soured what should be an exciting announcement of scientific progress so that it has become a sordid episode of prestige politics results were typical of normally sober scientific language and although neutrons were noted there were no strong claims as to their source day before release cockcroft overall director at harwell called a press conference to introduce british press to results some indication of importance of event can be seen in presence of a bbc television field crew a rare occurrence at that time he began by introducing fusion programme and zeta machine and then noted reporters at meeting were not satisfied with this assessment and continued to press cockcroft on neutron issue after being asked several times he eventually stated that in his opinion he was 90 percent certain they were from fusion this was unwise a statement of opinion from a nobel prize winner was taken as a statement of fact next day sunday newspapers were covered with news that fusion had been achieved in zeta often with claims about how uk was now far in lead in fusion research cockcroft further hyped results on television following release stating to britain this discovery is greater than russian sputnik as planned us also released a large batch of results from their smaller pinch machines many of them were also giving off neutrons although zeta was stabilised for much longer periods and generating more neutrons by a factor of about 1000 when questioned about success in uk strauss denied that us was behind in fusion race when reporting on releases new york times chose to focus on los alamos columbus ii only mentioning zeta later in article and then concluded two countries were neck and neck other reports from us generally gave equal support to both programmes newspapers from rest of world were more favourable to uk radio moscow went so far to publicly congratulate uk while failing to mention us results at all as zeta continued to generate positive results plans were made to build a follow on machine new design was announced in may zeta ii would be a significantly larger us 14 million machine whose explicit goal would be to reach 100 million k and generate net power this announcement gathered praise even in us new york times ran a story about new version machines similar to zeta were being announced around world osaka university announced their pinch machine was even more successful than zeta aldermaston team announced positive results from their sceptre machine costing only us 28 000 and a new reactor was built in uppsala university that was presented publicly later that year institute in leningrad began construction of a smaller version of zeta although still larger than most known as alpha further scepticism retraction of claims spitzer had already concluded that known theory suggested that zeta was nowhere near temperatures team was claiming and as part of publicity surrounding release of work suggested that some unknown mechanism would appear to be involved other researchers in us notably furth and colgate were far more critical telling anyone who would listen that results were bunk in soviet union lev artsimovich rushed to have nature article translated and after reading it declared bullshit cockcroft had stated that they were receiving too few neutrons from device to measure their spectrum or their direction failing to do so meant they could not eliminate possibility that neutrons were being released due to electrical effects in plasma sorts of reactions that kurchatov had pointed out earlier such measurements would have been easy to make in same converted hangar that housed zeta was harwell effort run by basil rose this project had built a sensitive high pressure diffusion cloud chamber as cyclotron s main detector rose was convinced it would be able to directly measure neutron energies and trajectories in a series of experiments he showed that neutrons had a high directionality at odds with a fusion origin which would be expected to be randomly directed to further demonstrate this he had machine run backwards with electric current running in opposite direction this demonstrated a clear difference in number of neutrons and their energy which suggested they were a result of electrical current itself not fusion reactions inside plasma this was followed by similar experiments on perhapsatron and columbus demonstrating same problems issue was a new form of instability microinstabilities or mhd instabilities that were caused by wave like signals in plasma these had been predicted but whereas kink was on scale of entire plasma and could be easily seen in photographs these microinstabilities were too small and rapidly moving to easily detect and had simply not been noticed before but like kink when these instabilities developed areas of enormous electrical potential developed rapidly accelerating protons in area these sometimes collided with neutrons in plasma or container walls ejecting them through neutron spallation these were same sorts of instabilities seen in earlier machines and precisely problem cockcroft had mentioned during press releases but in zeta they were much more powerful and neutrons appeared to be fusion related until further work demonstrated their nature promise of stabilised pinch disappeared cockcroft was forced to publish a humiliating retraction on 16 may 1958 claiming it is doing exactly job we expected it would do and is functioning exactly way we hoped it would le monde raised issue to a front page headline in june noting contrary to what was announced six months ago at harwell british experts confirm that thermonuclear energy has not been domesticated event cast a chill over entire field it was not only british who looked foolish every other country involved in fusion research had been quick to jump on bandwagon harwell in turmoil zeta soldiers on beginning in 1955 cockcroft had pressed for establishment of a new site for construction of multiple prototype power producing fission reactors this was strongly opposed by christopher hinton and a furious debate broke out within ukaea over issue cockcroft eventually won debate and in late 1958 ukaea formed aee winfrith in dorset where they eventually built several experimental reactor designs cockcroft had also pressed for zeta ii reactor to be housed at new site he argued that winfrith would be better suited to build large reactor and unclassified site would better suit now unclassified research this led to what has been described as as close to a rebellion that individualistic scientists at harwell could possibly mount thonemann made it clear he was not interested in moving to dorset and suggested that several other high ranking members would also quit rather than move he then went on sabbatical to princeton university for a year entire affair was a major strain on basil schonland who took over research division when cockcroft left in october 1959 to become master of newly formed churchill college cambridge while this was taking place original zeta ii proposal had been growing ever larger eventually specifying currents as powerful as joint european torus that was built years later as it seemed this was beyond state of art project was eventually cancelled in february 1959 a new proposal soon took its place intermediate current stability experiment icse icse was designed to take advantage of further stabilising effects noticed in m theory which suggested that very fast pinches would cause current to flow only in outer layer of plasma which should be much more stable over time this machine grew to be about same size as zeta icse had a 6 m major diameter and 1 m minor diameter powered by a bank of capacitors storing 10 mj at 100 kv harwell was as unsuited to icse as it was for zeta ii so schonland approached government with idea of a new site for fusion research located close to harwell he was surprised to find they were happy with idea as this would limit employment at harwell further study demonstrated that cost of building a new site was offset by savings in keeping site near harwell at winfrith travel costs between sites would be considerable in may 1959 ukaea purchased rnas culham about from harwell icse construction began later that year starting with a one acre building to house it known as d 1 meanwhile work continued on zeta to better understand what was causing new forms of instabilities new diagnostic techniques demonstrated that electron energies were very low on order of 10 ev approximately 100 000 k while ion temperatures were somewhat higher at 100 ev both of these pointed to a rapid loss of energy in plasma which in turn suggested fuel was turbulent and escaping confinement to hit walls of chamber where it rapidly cooled a full presentation of results was made at salzburg conference in 1961 where soviet delegation presented very similar results on their zeta clone alpha source of this turbulence was not clearly identified at that time but team suggested it was due to current driven resistive modes if one did not use simplifying assumption that plasma had no macroscopic resistance new instabilities would naturally appear when new head of ukaea william penney heard that icse design was also based on resistance free assumption he cancelled project in august 1960 parts for partially assembled reactor were scavenged by other teams thonemann had returned by this point and found much to disagree with on icse he demanded to be allowed to set up a new fusion group to remain at harwell on zeta zeta remained largest toroidal machine in world for some time and went on to have a productive career for just over a decade but in spite of its later successes zeta was always known as an example of british folly thomson scattering and tokamaks thumb mike forrest operates a hand built laser that is part of a thomson scattering system used to measure temperatures in zeta this became a major diagnostic technique in fusion field used to this day zeta s failure was due to limited information using best available measurements zeta was returning several signals that suggested neutrons were due to fusion original temperature measures were made by examining doppler shifting of spectral lines of atoms in plasma inaccuracy of measurement and spurious results caused by electron impacts with container led to misleading measurements based on impurities not plasma itself over next decade zeta was used continuously in an effort to develop better diagnostic tools to resolve these problems this work eventually developed a method that is used to this day introduction of lasers provided a new solution through a british discovery known as thomson scattering lasers have extremely accurate and stable frequency control and light they emit interacts strongly with free electrons a laser shone into plasma will be reflected off electrons and during this process will be doppler shifted by electrons movement speed of electrons is a function of their temperature so by comparing frequency before and after collisions temperature of electrons could be measured with an extremely high degree of accuracy by reversing system temperature of ions could also be directly measured through 1960s zeta was not only experiment to suffer from unexpected performance problems problems with plasma diffusion across magnetic fields plagued both magnetic mirror and stellarator programs at rates that classical theory could not address adding more fields did not appear to correct problems in any of existing designs work slowed dramatically as teams around world tried to better understand physics of plasmas in their devices and schluter were first to make a significant advance suggesting that much larger and more powerful machines would be needed to correct these problems an attitude of pessimism took root across entire field in 1968 a meeting of fusion researchers took place in novosibirsk where to everyone s astonishment soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was even close to matching latest of their designs t 3 was producing electron energies of 1000 ev compared to about 10 ev in zeta this corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million k although soviet team was highly respected results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem like one that had occurred with zeta spitzer once again expressed his scepticism rather strongly sparking off an acrimonious debate with artsimovich soviets were equally concerned about this and even though it was height of cold war artsimovich invited ukaea to bring their laser system to kurchatov institute and independently measure performance artsimovich had previously called their system brilliant team became known as culham five performing a series of measurements in late 1968 and early 1969 resulting paper was published in november 1969 and convinced fusion research field that tokamak was indeed reaching levels of performance soviets claimed result was a veritable stampede of tokamak construction around world and it remains most studied device in fusion field tokamaks are toroidal pinch machines key difference is relative strengths of fields in stabilised pinch machines most of magnetic field in plasma was generated by current induced in it strength of external stabilisation fields was much lower and only penetrated into outer layers of plasma mass tokamak reversed this external magnets were much more powerful and plasma current greatly reduced in comparison artsimovich put it this way this difference is today part of a general concept known as safety factor denoted q it has to be greater than one to maintain stability during a discharge in zeta it was about a zeta type machine could reach this q but would require enormously powerful external magnets to match fields from currents tokamak approach resolved this by using less pinch current this made system stable but meant current could no longer be used to heat plasma tokamak designs require some form of external heating reversed field pinch in 1965 newly opened culham laboratory hosted what had become a periodic meeting of international fusion researchers of all work presented only two papers on stabilised pinch were present both on zeta spitzer did not mention them during opening comments normally pulse of electricity sent into zeta formed a current pulse with a shape similar to a poisson distribution ramping up quickly then trailing off one of papers noted that plasma stability reached a maximum just after current began to taper off and then lasted longer than current pulse itself this phenomenon was dubbed quiescence three years later in 1968 international meeting was being held in novosibirsk where soviet results with t 3 tokamak were first released this overshadowed a paper by robinson and king that had examined quiescence period and determined it was due to original toroidal magnetic field reversing itself creating a more stable configuration john bryan taylor took up issue and began a detailed theoretical study of concept publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on topic he demonstrated that as magnetic field that generated pinch was relaxing it interacted with pre existing stabilising fields creating a self stable magnetic field phenomenon was driven by system s desire to preserve magnetic helicity which suggested a number of ways to improve confinement time although stabilising force was lower than force available in pinch it lasted considerably longer it appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach lawson criterion from a different direction using extended confinement times rather than increased density this was similar to stellarator approach in concept and although it would have lower field strength than those machines energy needed to maintain confinement was much lower today this approach is known as reversed field pinch rfp and has been a field of continued study taylor s study of relaxation into reversed state led to his development of a broader theoretical understanding of role of magnetic helicity and minimum energy states greatly advancing understanding of plasma dynamics minimum energy state known as taylor state is particularly important in understanding of new fusion approaches in compact toroid class taylor went on to study ballooning transformation a problem that was occurring in latest high performance toroidal machines as large scale waveforms formed in plasma his work in fusion research won him 1999 james clerk maxwell prize in plasma physics demolition culham officially opened in 1965 and various teams began leaving former sites through this period a team kept zeta operational until september 1968 hangar 7 which housed zeta and other machines was demolished during financial year 2005 2006 notes references citations
