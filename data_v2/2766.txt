then by john dudley 1st earl of warwick 1550 1553 who from 1551 was duke of northumberland edward s reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion an expensive war with scotland at first successful ended with military withdrawal from scotland and boulogne sur mer in exchange for peace transformation of church of england into a recognisably protestant body also occurred under edward who took great interest in religious matters although his father henryviii had severed link between church and rome henryviii had never permitted renunciation of catholic doctrine or ceremony it was during edward s reign that protestantism was established for first time in england with reforms that included abolition of clerical celibacy and mass and imposition of compulsory services in english in february 1553 at age 15 edward fell ill when his sickness was discovered to be terminal he and his council drew up a devise for succession to prevent country s return to catholicism edward named his first cousin once removed lady jane grey as his heir excluding his half sisters mary and elizabeth this decision was disputed following edward s death and jane was deposed by mary nine days after becoming queen during her reign mary reversed edward s protestant reforms which nonetheless became basis of elizabethan religious settlement of

tradition that edward vi was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians e g at age of four he fell ill with a life threatening quartan fever a fever recurring about every four days today usually associated with malaria but despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight he enjoyed generally good health until last six months of his life edward was also ill in 1550 and of measles and smallpox in 1552 edward was initially placed in care of margaret bryan lady mistress of prince s household she was succeeded by blanche herbert lady troy until age of six edward was brought up as he put it later in his chronicle among women formal royal household established around edward was at first under sir william sidney and later sir richard page stepfather of edward seymour s wife anne stanhope henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son s household stressing that edward was this whole realm s most precious jewel visitors described prince who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts including his own troupe of minstrels as a contented child from age of six edward began his formal education under richard cox and john cheke concentrating as he recalled himself on learning of tongues of scripture of philosophy and all liberal sciences for example he read biblical texts cato aesop s fables and vives s which were written for his sister mary he received tuition from elizabeth s tutor roger ascham and jean learning french spanish and italian in addition he is known to have studied geometry and learned to play musical instruments including lute and he collected globes and maps and according to coinage historian c e challis developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence edward s religious education is assumed to have favoured reforming agenda his religious establishment was probably chosen by archbishop thomas cranmer a leading reformer both cox and cheke were reformed catholics or and later became marian exiles by 1549 edward had written a treatise on pope as antichrist and was making informed notes on theological controversies many aspects of edward s religion were essentially catholic in his early years including celebration of mass and reverence for images and relics of saints left thumb badge of prince edward from john leland s cambriae 1543 both edward s sisters were attentive to their

you most he wrote to her in 1546 in 1543 henry invited his children to spend christmas with him signalling his reconciliation with his daughters whom he had previously and disinherited following spring he restored them to their place in succession with a third succession act which also provided for a regency council during edward s minority mary and elizabeth remained technically illegitimate succeeding to crown due to henry s nomination they could lose their rights for example by marrying without consent of privy council this unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to influence of henry s new wife catherine parr of whom edward soon became fond he called her his most dear mother and in september 1546 wrote to her i received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them other children were brought to play with edward including granddaughter of edward s chamberlain sir william sidney who in adulthood recalled prince as a marvellous sweet child of very mild and generous condition edward was educated with sons of nobles appointed to attend upon him in what was a form of miniature court among these barnaby fitzpatrick son of an irish peer became a close and

conservative privy councillors were removed from centre of power stephen gardiner was refused access to henry during his last months thomas howard 3rd duke of norfolk found himself accused of treason day before king s death his vast estates were seized making them available for redistribution and he spent whole of edward s reign in tower of london other historians have argued that gardiner s exclusion was based on non religious matters that norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion that conservatives remained on council and that radicalism of such men as sir anthony denny who

edward seymour 1st earl of hertford new king s uncle who became lord protector of realm governor of king s person and duke of somerset in fact henry viii s will did not provide for appointment of a protector it entrusted government of realm during his son s minority to a regency council that would rule collectively by majority decision with like and equal charge existence of a council of executors alongside privy council was rationalised in march when two became one incorporating executors and most of their appointed assistants and adding thomas seymour who had protested at his exclusion from power nevertheless a few days after henry s death on 4 february executors chose to invest almost regal power in edward seymour now duke of somerset thirteen out of sixteen others being absent agreed to his appointment as protector which they justified as their joint decision by virtue of authority of henry s will somerset may have done a deal with some of executors who almost all received hand outs he is known to have done so with william paget private secretary to henry viii in 1549 paget was to remind seymour remember what you promised me in gallery at westminster before breath was out of body of king that dead is remember what you promised immediately after devising with me concerning place which you now occupy and that was to follow mine advice in all your proceedings more than any other man s quoted in and to have secured support of sir anthony browne of privy chamber somerset s appointment was in keeping with historical precedent uncles of king had been made protector in 1422 and 1483 during minorities of henry vi and edward v though not also governor of king s person as seymour s brother thomas who coveted role for himself pointed out and his eligibility for role was reinforced by his military successes in scotland and france in march 1547 he secured letters patent from king edward granting him almost monarchical right to appoint members to privy council himself and to consult them only when he wished in 1549 william paget described him as king in all but name in words of historian geoffrey elton from that moment his autocratic system was complete he proceeded to rule largely by proclamation calling on privy council to do little more than rubber stamp his decisions somerset s takeover of power was smooth and efficient imperial ambassador francois van der delft reported that he governs everything absolutely with paget operating as his secretary though he predicted trouble from john dudley viscount lisle who had recently been raised to earl of warwick in share out of honours in fact in early weeks of his protectorate somerset was challenged only by chancellor thomas wriothesley whom earldom of southampton had evidently failed to buy off and by his own brother wriothesley a religious conservative objected to somerset s assumption of monarchical power over council he then found himself abruptly dismissed from chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates thomas seymour somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother thomas seymour who has been described as a worm in bud as king edward s uncle thomas seymour demanded governorship of king s person and a greater share of power somerset tried to buy his brother off with a barony an appointment to lord and a seat on privy council but thomas was bent on scheming for power he began smuggling pocket money to king edward telling him that somerset held purse strings too tight making him a beggarly king he also urged him to throw off protector within two years and bear rule as other kings do but edward schooled to defer to council failed to co operate in spring of 1547 using edward s support to circumvent somerset s opposition thomas seymour secretly married henry viii s widow catherine parr whose protestant household included 11 year old lady jane grey and 13 year old lady elizabeth in summer 1548 a pregnant catherine parr discovered thomas seymour embracing lady elizabeth as a result elizabeth was removed from catherine parr s household and transferred to sir anthony denny s that september catherine parr died shortly after childbirth and thomas seymour promptly resumed his attentions to elizabeth by letter planning to marry her elizabeth was receptive but like edward unready to agree to anything unless permitted by council in january 1549 council had thomas seymour arrested on various charges including embezzlement at bristol mint king edward whom seymour was accused of planning to marry to lady jane grey himself testified about pocket money lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial so seymour was condemned instead by an act of attainder and beheaded on 20 march 1549 war somerset s only undoubted skill was as a soldier which he had proven on expeditions to scotland and in defence of boulogne sur mer in 1546 from first his main interest as protector was war against scotland after a crushing victory at battle of pinkie cleugh in september 1547 he set up a network of garrisons in scotland stretching as far north as dundee his initial successes however were followed by a loss of direction as his aim of uniting realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic scots allied with france who sent reinforcements for defence of edinburgh in 1548 queen of scots was moved to france where she was betrothed to dauphin cost of maintaining protector s massive armies and his permanent garrisons in scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on royal finances a french attack on boulogne in august 1549 at last forced somerset to begin a withdrawal from scotland rebellion thumb left alt formal portrait of duke of somerset he has a long thin face

name of his nephew as lord protector from 1547 to 1549 longleat house wiltshire during 1548 england was subject to social unrest after april 1549 a series of armed revolts broke out fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances two most serious rebellions which required major military intervention to put down were in devon and cornwall and in norfolk first sometimes called prayer book rebellion arose from imposition of protestantism and second led by a tradesman called robert kett mainly from encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground a complex aspect of social unrest was that protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with protector s support convinced that landlords were lawbreakers for example in hereford a man was recorded as saying that by king s proclamation all enclosures were to be broken up same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout country not only in norfolk and west origin of popular view of somerset as sympathetic to rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal often contradictory proclamations some proclamations expressed sympathy for victims of enclosure and announced action some condemned destruction of enclosures and associated riots another announced pardons for those who had destroyed enclosures by mistake of folly and of mistaking after misunderstanding meaning of proclamations so long as they were sorry and partly in uncoordinated activities of commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage encroachment of large sheep flocks on common land and similar issues somerset s commissions were led by an evangelical m p called john hales whose socially liberal rhetoric linked issue of enclosure with reformation theology and notion of a godly commonwealth local groups often assumed that findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves their aim was not to bring down government but to help it correct faults of local magistrates and identify ways in which england could be reformed king edward wrote in his chronicle that 1549 risings began because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures whatever popular view of somerset disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government and council laid responsibility at protector s door in july 1549 paget wrote to somerset every man of council have your proceedings would to god that at first stir you had followed matter hotly and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to terror of others fall of somerset sequence of events that led to somerset s removal from power has often been called a coup d etat by 1 october 1549 somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat he issued a proclamation calling for assistance took possession of king s person and withdrew for safety to fortified windsor castle where edward wrote me thinks i am in prison meanwhile a united council published details of somerset s government mismanagement they made clear that protector s power came from them not from henry viii s will on 11 october council had somerset arrested and brought king to richmond edward summarised charges against somerset in his chronicle ambition vainglory entering into rash wars in mine youth negligent

contrast efficiency of somerset s takeover of power in which they detect organising skills of allies such as paget master of practices with subsequent ineptitude of his rule by autumn 1549 his costly wars had lost momentum crown faced financial ruin and riots and rebellions had broken out around country until recent decades somerset s reputation with historians was high in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back common people against a rapacious landowning class a f pollard took this line in early 20th century echoed later by edward vi s 1960s biographer w k jordan a more critical approach was initiated by m l bush and dale hoak in 1970s more recently however he has often been portrayed as an arrogant and aloof ruler lacking in political and administrative skills

dark goatee beard john dudley earl of warwick later 1st duke of northumberland led privy council after downfall of somerset knole kent in contrast somerset s successor john dudley earl of warwick made duke of northumberland in 1551 was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at expense of crown since 1970s administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised and he has been credited with restoring authority of royal council and returning government to an even keel after disasters of somerset s protectorate earl of warwick s rival for leadership of new regime was thomas wriothesley 1st earl of southampton whose conservative supporters had allied with dudley s followers to create a unanimous council which they and observers such as holy roman emperor charles v s ambassador expected to reverse somerset s policy of religious reform warwick on other hand pinned his hopes on king s strong protestantism and claiming that edward was old enough to rule in person moved himself and his people closer to king taking control of privy chamber paget accepting a barony joined warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring emperor onto english side over boulogne southampton prepared a case for executing somerset aiming to discredit warwick through somerset s statements that he had done all with warwick s co operation as a counter move warwick convinced parliament to free somerset which it did on 14 january 1550 warwick then had southampton and his followers purged from council after winning support of council members in return for titles and was made lord president of council and great master of king s household hoak explains that office of lord president gave its holder right to create and dismiss councillors as well as to call and dissolve council meetings although not called a protector he was now clearly head of government as edward was growing up he was able to understand more and more government business however his actual involvement in decisions has long been a matter of debate and during 20th century historians have presented whole gamut of possibilities balanc ing an articulate puppet against a mature precocious and essentially adult king in words of stephen alford a special counsel for estate was created when edward was fourteen edward chose members himself in weekly meetings with this council edward was to hear debating of things of most importance a major point of contact with king was privy chamber and there edward worked closely with william cecil and william petre principal secretaries king s greatest influence was in matters of religion where council followed strongly protestant policy that edward favoured duke of northumberland s mode of operation was very different from somerset s careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimise his authority lacking somerset s blood relationship with king he added members to council from his own faction in order to control it he also added members of his family to royal household he saw that to achieve personal dominance he needed total procedural control of council in words of historian john guy like somerset he became quasi king difference was that he managed bureaucracy on pretence that edward had assumed full sovereignty whereas somerset had asserted right to near sovereignty as protector thumb 310px left shilling with portrait of edward vi struck 1551 1553 warwick s war policies were more pragmatic than somerset s and they have earned him criticism for weakness in 1550 he signed a peace treaty with france that agreed to withdrawal from boulogne and recalled all english garrisons from scotland in 1551 edward was betrothed to elisabeth of valois king henry ii s daughter edward sent elisabeth a fair diamond from catherine parr s collection and was made a knight of saint michael in practice he realised that england could no longer support cost of wars at home he took measures to police local unrest to forestall future rebellions he kept permanent representatives of crown in localities including lords lieutenant who commanded military forces and reported back to central government working with william paulet and walter mildmay warwick tackled disastrous state of kingdom s finances however his regime first succumbed to temptations of a quick profit by further debasing coinage economic disaster that resulted caused warwick to hand initiative to expert thomas gresham by 1552 confidence in coinage was restored prices fell and trade at last improved though a full economic recovery was not achieved until elizabeth s reign its origins lay in duke of northumberland s policies regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of government finances and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices which has been called one of more remarkable achievements

robes with a black mantle over full white sleeves and has a doctoral cap on his head thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury exerted a powerful influence on edward s protestantism lambeth palace london in matter of religion regime of northumberland followed same policy as that of somerset supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform although edward vi s practical influence on government was limited his intense protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory his succession was managed by reforming faction who continued in power throughout his reign man edward trusted most thomas cranmer archbishop of canterbury introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised english church from one that while rejecting papal supremacy remained essentially catholic to one that was institutionally protestant confiscation of church property that had begun under henry viii resumed under edward notably with dissolution of chantries to great monetary advantage of crown and new owners of seized property church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under edward vi by end of his reign church had been financially ruined with much of property of bishops transferred into lay hands religious convictions of both somerset and northumberland have proved elusive for historians who are divided on sincerity of their protestantism there is less doubt however about religious fervour of king edward who was said to have read twelve chapters of scripture daily and enjoyed sermons and was commemorated by john foxe as a godly imp edward was depicted during his life and afterwards as a new josiah biblical king who destroyed idols of baal he could be in his anti catholicism and once asked catherine parr to persuade lady mary to attend no longer to foreign dances and which do not become a most christian princess edward s biographer jennifer loach cautions however against accepting too readily pious image of edward handed down by reformers as in john foxe s influential acts and monuments where a woodcut depicts young king listening to a sermon by hugh latimer loach points out following jordan that edward s chronicle records nothing of his religious views and mentions no sermons macculloch counters that edward s notebook of sermons which was once archived and documented has since been lost in early part of his life edward conformed to prevailing catholic practices including attendance at mass but he became convinced under influence of cranmer and reformers among his tutors and courtiers that true religion should be imposed in england english reformation advanced under pressure from two directions from traditionalists on one hand and zealots on other who led incidents of iconoclasm image smashing and complained that reform did not go far enough reformed doctrines were made official such as justification by faith alone and communion for laity as well as clergy in both kinds of bread and wine ordinal of 1550 replaced divine ordination of priests with a government run appointment system authorising ministers to preach gospel and administer sacraments rather than as before to offer sacrifice and celebrate mass both for living and dead cranmer set himself task of writing a uniform liturgy in english detailing all weekly and daily services and religious festivals to be made compulsory in first act of uniformity of 1549 book of common prayer of 1549 intended as a compromise was attacked by traditionalists for dispensing with many cherished rituals of liturgy such as elevation of bread and wine one of grievances of western prayer book rebels in 1549 was that new service seemed like a christmas game while some reformers complained about retention of too many popish elements including vestiges of sacrificial rites at communion prayer book was also opposed by many senior catholic clerics including stephen gardiner bishop of winchester and edmund bonner bishop of london who were both imprisoned in tower and along with others deprived of their sees after 1551 reformation advanced further with approval and encouragement of edward who began to exert more personal influence in his role as supreme head of church new changes were also a response to criticism from such reformers as john hooper bishop of gloucester and scot john knox who was employed as a minister in newcastle upon tyne under duke of northumberland and whose preaching at court prompted king to oppose kneeling at communion cranmer was also influenced by views of continental reformer martin bucer who died in england in 1551 by peter martyr who was teaching at oxford and by other foreign theologians progress of reformation was further speeded by consecration of more reformers as bishops notable among new bishops were john ponet who succeeded gardiner at winchester myles coverdale at exeter and john hooper at gloucester in winter of 1551 52 cranmer rewrote book of common prayer in less ambiguous reformist terms revised canon law and prepared a doctrinal statement forty two articles to clarify practice of reformed religion particularly in divisive matter of communion service cranmer s formulation of reformed religion finally divesting communion service of any notion of real presence of god in bread and wine effectively abolished mass according to elton publication of cranmer s revised prayer book in 1552 supported by a second act of uniformity marked arrival of english church at protestantism prayer book of 1552 ordinal of 1550 which it took over act of uniformity which made prayer book only legal form of worship and forty two articles binding upon all englishmen clerical and lay these between them comprehended protestant reformation in england prayer book of 1552 remains foundation of church of england s services however cranmer was unable to implement all these reforms once it became clear in spring 1553 that king edward upon whom whole reformation in england depended was dying edward

half sister mary would jeopardise english reformation and edward s council and officers had many reasons to fear it edward himself opposed mary s succession not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance which also applied to elizabeth he composed a draft document headed my devise for succession in which he undertook to change succession most probably inspired by his father henry viii s precedent he passed over claims of his half sisters and at last settled crown on his first cousin once removed 16 year old lady jane grey who on 25 may 1553 had married lord

privy council received a message from mary asserting her right and title to throne and commanding that council proclaim her queen as she had already proclaimed herself council replied that jane was queen by edward s authority and that mary by contrast was illegitimate and supported only by a few lewd base people northumberland soon realised that he had miscalculated drastically not least in failing to secure mary s person before edward s death although many of those who rallied to mary were conservatives hoping for defeat of protestantism her supporters also included many for whom her lawful claim to throne overrode religious considerations northumberland was obliged to relinquish control of a nervous council in london and launch an unplanned pursuit of mary into east anglia from

contribution to english reformation and structure of church of england last decade of henry viii s reign had seen a partial stalling of reformation a drifting back to more conservative values by contrast edward s reign saw radical progress in reformation in those six years church transferred from an essentially catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as protestant in particular introduction of book of common prayer ordinal of 1550 and cranmer s forty two articles formed basis for english church practices that continue to this day edward himself fully approved these changes and though they were work of reformers such as thomas cranmer hugh latimer and nicholas ridley backed by edward s determinedly evangelical council fact of king s religion was a catalyst in acceleration of reformation during his reign queen mary s attempts to undo reforming work of her brother s reign faced major obstacles despite her belief in papal supremacy she ruled constitutionally as supreme head of english church a contradiction under which she bridled she found herself entirely unable to restore vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners although she burned a number of leading protestant churchmen many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in england during her reign producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that she was unable to stem nevertheless protestantism was not yet printed in stomachs of english people and had mary lived longer her catholic reconstruction might have succeeded

in elizabethan religious settlement queen elizabeth replaced mary s councillors and bishops with ex edwardians such as william cecil northumberland s former secretary and richard cox edward s old tutor who preached an anti catholic sermon at opening of parliament in 1559 parliament passed an act of uniformity following spring that restored with modifications cranmer s prayer book of 1552 and thirty nine articles of 1563 were largely based on cranmer s forty two articles theological developments of edward s reign provided a vital source of reference for elizabeth s religious policies
