launched intermittent raids against villages in nearby regions such as jubail and matn often in name of defending rights of local christians assaults and their repercussions served as catalysts of 1860 mount lebanon civil war particularly battle of beit mery between local maronites and druze in which shahin was a principal belligerent although he claimed he could raise an army of 50 000 to combat forces of druze feudal lords he did not participate further in war following war s end he was defeated by youssef karam in a struggle over political influence in maronite affairs shahin

maronite christian family in village of rayfoun in keserwan district of mount lebanon in 1815 thompson 2013 p 43 according to historian elizabeth thompson shahin may have been literate as indicated by his early career as an artisan and an entrepreneur while lebanese historian kamal salibi describes him as half literate johnson 2001 pp 95 96 prior to leading 1859 peasant revolt in keserwan shahin was a blacksmith and a muleteer who transported goods throughout keserwan shahin was tall and of muscular build according to thompson shahin was more a man of spoken word than pen famous for powerful sermon like speeches at village meetings and for his violent temper according to salibi he acted as a local shaykh leader of young men a title that carried honor and typically denoted a village strongman who derived power from his following of armed men johnson 2001 p 95 he was admired and respected by peasants of keserwan some of whom considered him their redeemer according to a local chronicler residents prepared grand receptions for him amid joy and celebrations when he entered a local village various european diplomats described him as a ruffian of despicable character and as dishonest while some clergymen also regarded him as deceitful leadership of peasants revolt uprising in keserwan peasant anger in keserwan had been building since mid 19th century due to a number of factors including burdens of corvee unpaid labor for a landlord that had been imposed during rule of emir bashir shihab ii fawaz 1994 p 44 general economic hardship and decreasing availability of land makdisi 2000 p 96 maronite khazen family traditionally served as sheikhs chiefs of keserwan although their power had been significantly diminished during emir bashir s rule khazens opposed creation of double in mount lebanon in 1840s which divided mount lebanon into druze and christian run sectors and were incensed at appointment of a sheikh from mixed druze christian abu l lama family as qaimaqam deputy governor of maronite section of qaimaqamate khazens feared that such an appointment would formally subordinate them to abu l lama sheikhs following abu l lama sheikh s death in 1854 his successor bashir ahmad abu l lama attempted to further reduce khazens influence prompting khazens to stir peasants to revolt against bashir ahmad revolt against bashir ahmad soon turned against khazen sheikhs and their feudal allies peasant subjects of khazen sheikhs had long been wary of their rule due to excessive taxes they imposed as well as additional gifts peasants were virtually obligated to give sheikhs which many peasants considered humiliating in early 1858 a group of peasants from keserwan lodged a formal complaint against khazens to khurshid pasha ottoman governor of beirut later in march 1858 khazens held a summit for people of keserwan to garner support for their nomination of a new qaimaqam instead peasants participating in summit voiced their dissent against khazens and in october several villages in keserwan entered into an alliance against khazen sheikhs shahin was chosen by this alliance of peasants as their leader in december thompson 2013 p 42 and was declared wakil first delegate 2007 p 30 in january 1859 shahin intensified armed revolt against khazen sheikhs and with 800 of his peasant fighters he besieged khazens during a summit they were holding in ghosta siege prompted sheikhs to flee village and peasants under shahin subsequently plundered khazens estates shahin and his men proceeded to attack khazens in other villages with little blood spilled in process with exception of wife and daughter of a khazen sheikh who were killed in ajaltoun in july during a raid on their home by peasants makdisi 2000 p 99 maronite patriarch paul peter massad condemned their killing as a horrific crime silk and wheat warehouses belonging to sheikhs were plundered and goods were redistributed among peasants of keserwan by july khazens had been routed and between 500 and 600 family members had fled to beirut in an impoverished state shahin broadened peasants main demands of tax relief and refunds for illegal payments they had previously paid to khazen sheikhs to also include political and legal reforms shahin cited edict of gulhane which mandated equality for all ottoman citizens thompson 2013 p 37 establishment of republic following his victory over khazen sheikhs shahin and peasants of keserwan formed a government with shahin declaring a republic he became known as wakil amm general delegate and in fall of 1859 moved headquarters of rebellion from coastal village of zouk mikael to his hometown of rayfoun in mountains although revolts were relatively commonplace in mount lebanon ousting of a noble family by their peasant subjects was unprecedented makdisi 2000 p 97 shahin s government consisted of a 100 member council made up of representatives from villages of keserwan over half of representatives were peasants who did not own land 32 were relatively well to do farmers ten were clergymen and three were merchants or lenders shahin who by this point oversaw a 1 000 strong militia exercised power by seizing arms ensured upholding of law and established security on roads he disciplined dissidents suspected of betraying government and issued decrees in name of public he also entered into negotiations with khazen sheikhs but they reached a stalemate main villages that supported shahin s government were rayfoun ajaltoun ashqout and representatives of these villages were able to gain solidarity of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both peaceful and coercive means that as christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose makdisi 2000 p 98 leaders of some villages such as those of ghosta and opposed shahin and his revolt shahin s popularity among christian peasants of mount lebanon grew as he came to be viewed as their savior from both druze nobles and traditional maronite elites this reputation was further solidified after shahin s men backed christian residents in a clash with druze residents in mixed village of beit meri in matn in august 1859 khazens demanded restoration of their rule in keserwan and lodged complaints to ottoman government about property stolen or damaged by peasantry ottomans launched an investigation in keserwan but in their interviews with peasants all claimed that they were unaware of looting and other crimes while representatives of shahin denied that they were rebels insisting that they only sought implementation of tanzimat reforms and restoration of law and order in petitions to maronite patriarchate peasants demanded compensation by khazens for taxes that were illegally extorted from them an abolition to traditional gift giving required of peasants abolition of marriage taxes levied by khazens and an end to practice of beating peasants among other demands shahin nominally recognized maronite patriarchate as ultimate arbiter of disputes but consistently urged them to honor their obligations to ahali commoners in one incident he or his men fired shots toward patriarch s headquarters in for hosting a number of khazens who were seeking refuge there makdisi 2000 p 103 in march 1859 shahin rebuffed church s request to make an agreement with khazen sheikhs citing need to first consult with all ahali and all villages makdisi 2000 p 104 shahin s rise generally confused ottoman government because shahin used tanzimat to legitimize his revolt ottomans did not consider religious equality called for by tanzimat reforms to translate into class equality which is how shahin interpreted it moreover ottomans did not countenance that a semi literate arabic speaking peasant from a rural region such as keserwan would serve as a representative of tanzimat makdisi 2000 p 105 they reacted to shahin s revolt negatively although provincial ottoman authorities of beirut generally felt powerless to act against peasant rebels due to a lack of funds and forces on ground khurshid pasha sympathized more with khazen sheikhs and in a letter to patriarchate accused shahin of using deceit to lead astray minds of people and to seduce them into following his evil ways makdisi 2000 p 106 principal focus of ottoman authorities in lebanon was containing shahin s revolt however later historians of lebanon accused khurshid pasha of at least tacitly supporting shahin in order to break communal solidarity khurshid pasha dispatched emir yusuf ali murad a maronite sheikh from abu l lama family to rein in peasant rebels in jubail but shahin sent a letter warning emir yusuf not to intervene in affairs of jubail because christians of jubail were united with ahali of keserwan and claimed that all christians of syria have made common cause he condemned emir yusuf for aligning himself with ousted sheikhs and his druze relatives and accused him of attempting to subjugate christians after we achieved our freedom makdisi 2000 p 107 he threatened emir yusuf to return without delay and that if he desires a fight we are more eager than you and we are not afraid shahin s confidence in support he received from christian peasantry of keserwan and other parts of mount lebanon and his challenge to emir yusuf through a populist sectarian approach alarmed maronite elites church and ottoman authorities makdisi 2000 pp 107 108 in response to a maronite priest s complaints about harassment by shia muslims against christians shahin s men attacked and plundered shia villages and travelers in jubail and demanded that shia villages convert to christianity to avoid assault shia residents of jubail protested these assaults in june 1859 while shahin s actions further frustrated local elites christian muslim and druze alike his reputation as defender of christian rights was bolstered at popular level makdisi 2000 p 111 civil war in mount lebanon increased assertiveness of maronite peasants as a result of shahin s revolt and confidence in their demographic majority in mount lebanon alarmed druze feudal lords latter resolved to arm their peasant fighters likewise maronite peasants wary of growing muslim hostility toward christians in ottoman syria were also being armed in particular by maronite bishop aoun harris 2012 p 157 tensions turned into violence and between march and may 1860 several retaliatory tit for tat killings and attacks of sectarian nature between druzes and christians occurred throughout mount lebanon and its immediate environs in late may shahin and some 300 of his men entered village of in mixed druze maronite matn district to seize silk owned by a noble family of keserwan however instead of returning to rayfoun they proceeded to enter nearby maronite village of antelias shahin s incursion into antelias was considered a provocation by druze who feared that presence of shahin s fighters in that village threatened druze residents of matn many christians in turn viewed deployment of khurshid pasha s troops in on 26 may as a provocation because they suspected khurshid pasha of being allied with druze and that this was signal for beginning of druze counter attack fawaz 1994 p 50 shahin s stated purpose for entering antelias was to protect christian shihab emirs based in village of baabda shihab emirs requested shahin and his men withdraw from baabda s vicinity to avoid conflict however on 29 may clashes occurred in matn village of beit mery between its druze and christian residents which led to participation of their respective coreligionists from other villages in vicinity by 30 may druze had defeated keserwan fighters in beit meri fighting subsequently spread throughout matn with 35 40 christian villages being burned according to lebanese historian leila fawaz keserwan fighters proved to be undisciplined and ineffective against more experienced unified and better organized druze forces fighting in matn spread throughout mount lebanon and its surrounding area becoming a civil war mainly between druze and christians which later spilled over into other parts of syria shahin claimed that he could raise 50 000 fighters to fight druze fawaz 1994 p 54 and christians from areas outside of keserwan appealed for his intervention fawaz 1994 p 56 however when his men were halted by ottoman forces in matn shahin and other maronite militia leaders largely restricted their operations to guarding their areas of origin 2007 p 35 in mid june when last christian stronghold was besieged by druze shahin did not send reinforcements and town fell fawaz 1994 pp 66 67 this all but consolidated a druze victory in mount lebanon fawaz 1994 p 68 on 29 july under pressure from bishop aoun shahin agreed to openly declare his obedience to ottoman sultan although peasants revolt had not been directly against ottoman state shahin s declaration served as a virtual repudiation of revolt s legitimacy in his declaration shahin asserted that he was forced to revolt by treacherous men of corruption makdisi 2000 p 158 later life and death french led international intervention ended civil war and order was restored by 1861 johnson 2001 p 43 shahin s movement was in a precarious state in war s aftermath shahin could not financially support his impoverished peasant partisans maronite clergy was disillusioned with him and ottoman officialdom and local nobility were arrayed against him ottomans clergy and nobility resolved to bring an end to shahin s movement because it represented last obstacle to their political reorganization of mount lebanon into mount lebanon mutasarrifate shahin threatened to convert to protestantism together with his partisans if khazen sheikhs were restored to keserwan khouri 2003 p 43 while patriarch massad of maronite church was prepared to excommunicate shahin and his supporters meanwhile youssef karam a maronite leader from who acquired a degree of popularity during war and backing from maronite patriarchate and french government was appointed acting qaimaqam of christian areas of mount lebanon by fuad pasha after war s end hakim 2013 pp 111 112 shahin opposed karam who in a bid to reconcile maronite community issued orders directed to peasants of keserwan to restore properties seized from khazens and compensate latter for their losses shahin was backed by emir majid shihab who sought to replace karam as qaimaqam tensions between shahin and karam in keserwan in late march 1861 culminated in a battle between their forces in an area between rayfoun and ashqout hokayem 1988 pp 389 390 in which shahin was defeated and fled 1966 p 152 karam subsequently raided shahin s home in rayfoun imprisoned some of shahin s supporters and posted a number of his own troops in villages that supported shahin s movement fuad pasha advised karam to pursue and capture shahin while british consul communicated his desire to see karam restore khazens to their former position in keserwan shahin ultimately reconciled with karam on 12 april under mediation of french general charles de beaufort hokayem 1988 p 401 shahin agreed to submit to qaimaqamate s authority without conditions later in 1861 shahin relinquished republic that he established in keserwan subsequent to his retirement from politics shahin served as a judicial official in rayfoun there in 1895 he died in relative obscurity he left no memoirs about his role in civil war references bibliography category 1815 births category 1895 deaths category 19th century people of
