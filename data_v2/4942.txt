landing at nadzab was an airborne landing on 5 september 1943 during new guinea campaign of world war ii in conjunction with landing at lae nadzab action began with a parachute drop at lae nadzab airport combined with an overland force parachute drop was carried out by us army s 503rd parachute infantry regiment and elements of australian army s 2 4th field regiment into nadzab new guinea in markham valley observed by general douglas macarthur circling overhead in a b 17 australian 2 2nd pioneer battalion 2 6th field company and b company papuan infantry battalion reached nadzab after an overland and river trek that same day and began preparing airfield first transport aircraft landed next morning but bad weather delayed allied build up over next days 25th infantry brigade of australian 7th division gradually arrived an air crash at jackson s field ultimately caused half allied casualties of battle once assembled at nadzab 25th infantry brigade commenced its advance on lae on 11 september it engaged japanese soldiers at jensen s plantation after defeating them it engaged and defeated a larger japanese force at heath s plantation during this skirmish private richard kelliher won victoria cross australia s highest award for gallantry japanese army elected not to fight for lae preferring instead to withdraw over saruwaged range this proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for japanese soldiers who had to struggle over rugged mountains in end japanese army managed to withdraw its forces from salamaua and lae though with extensive losses from exposure and starvation during retreat troops of 25th infantry brigade reached lae shortly before those of 9th division that had been advancing on lae from opposite direction development of nadzab was delayed by need to upgrade markham valley road after strenuous efforts in face of wet weather road was opened on 15 december nadzab then became major allied air base in new guinea background strategy allied thumb right elkton iii plan march 1943 in july 1942 united states joint chiefs of staff approved a series of operations against japanese bastion at rabaul which blocked any allied advance along northern coast of new guinea toward philippines or north toward main japanese naval base at truk in keeping with overall allied grand strategy of defeating nazi germany first immediate aim of these operations was not defeat of japan but merely reduction of threat posed by japanese aircraft and warships based at rabaul to air and sea communications between united states and australia by agreement among allied nations in march 1942 pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands each with its own commander in chief south west pacific area which included australia indonesia and philippines came under general douglas macarthur as supreme commander most of remainder known as pacific ocean areas came under admiral chester w nimitz there was no overall commander and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources setting priorities or shifting resources from one command to other such decisions had to be made on basis of compromise cooperation and consensus rabaul fell within macarthur s area but initial operations in southern solomon islands came under nimitz japanese reaction to task one seizure of southern part of solomon islands was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before guadalcanal campaign was brought to a successful conclusion meanwhile general macarthur s forces fought off a series of japanese offensives in papua in kokoda track campaign battle of milne bay battle of buna gona battle of wau and battle of bismarck sea following these victories initiative in south west pacific passed to allies and general douglas macarthur pressed ahead with his plans for task two at pacific military conference in washington d c in march 1943 plans were reviewed by joint chiefs of staff chiefs were unable to supply all requested resources so plans had to be scaled back with capture of rabaul postponed to 1944 on 6 may 1943 macarthur s general headquarters ghq in brisbane issued warning instruction no 2 officially informing subordinate commands of plan which divided task two operations on new guinea axis into three parts occupy kiriwina and woodlark islands and establish air forces thereon seize lae salamaua finschhafen madang area and establish air forces therein occupy western new britain establishing air forces at cape gloucester arawe and gasmata occupy or neutralise talasea second part was assigned to general sir thomas blamey s new guinea force ghq warning instruction no 2 awm54 589 5 3 as a result it became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by australian army just as during bitter campaigns of 1942 japanese japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities naval forces came under southeast area fleet commanded by vice admiral jinichi kusaka army forces came under general hitoshi imamura s eighth area army consisting of seventeenth army in solomon islands lieutenant general hatazo adachi s eighteenth army in new guinea and 6th air division based at rabaul as a result of battle of bismarck sea japanese decided not send any more convoys to lae but to land troops at hansa bay and wewak and move them forward to lae by barge or submarine in long run they hoped to complete a road over finisterre range and thence to lae through ramu and markham valleys imamura ordered adachi to capture allied bases at wau bena bena and mount hagen to support these operations imperial general headquarters transferred 7th air division to new guinea on 27 july 1943 lieutenant general kumaichi teramoto s fourth air army was assigned to imamura s command to control 6th and 7th air divisions 14th air brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons by june adachi had three divisions in new guinea 41st division at wewak and 20th division around madang both recently arrived from palau and 51st division in salamaua area a total of about 80 000 men of these only 51st division was in contact with enemy like blamey adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle geography markham river originates in finisterre range and flows for emptying into huon gulf near lae markham valley which rises to an elevation of runs between finisterre range to north and bismarck range to south and varies from wide valley floor is largely composed of gravel and is generally infertile half of its area was covered by dense kangaroo grass high but in parts where there had been a build up of silt kunai grass grew from high rainfall is around per annum markham valley was traversable by motor vehicles in dry season which ran from december to april and therefore formed part of a natural highway between japanese bases at lae and madang planning and preparation at blamey s advanced allied land forces headquarters adv lhq in st lucia queensland deputy chief of general staff major general frank berryman headed planning process a model of lae salamaua area was constructed in a secure room at st lucia windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on door round clock on 16 may blamey held a conference with berryman and lieutenant general sir edmund herring commander of i corps around model at which details of operation were discussed blamey s operational concept was for a double envelopment of lae using two of finest divisions on allied side major general george wootten s 9th division would land east of lae in a shore to shore operation and advance on lae meanwhile major general george alan vasey s 7th division in a reprise of battle of buna gona in 1942 would advance on lae from west by an overland route its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of japanese garrison at lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across markham valley its secondary task was to assist 9th division in capture of lae plan was generally known as operation postern although this was actually ghq code name for lae itself 250px thumb left upright lae nadzab operations meanwhile major general stanley savige s 3rd division in wau area and major general horace fuller s us 41st infantry division around morobe were ordered to advance on salamaua so as to threaten it and draw japanese forces away from lae result was arduous salamaua campaign which was fought between june and september and which at times looked like succeeding all too well capturing salamaua and forcing japanese back to lae thereby throwing blamey s whole strategy into disarray postern plan called for 7th division to move in transports to port moresby and in coastal shipping to mouth of lakekamu river it would travel up river in barges to bulldog and in trucks over bulldog road to wau and bulolo from there it would march overland via watut and wampit valleys to markham river cross markham river with aid of paratroops and secure an airfield site there were a number of suitable airfield sites in markham valley blamey selected nadzab as most promising vasey pronounced plan a dog s breakfast there were a number of serious problems it relied on bulldog road being completed which it was not due to rugged nature of country to be traversed and shortages of equipment even if it was 7th division would have been unlikely to make operation target date it had taken heavy casualties in battle of buna gona and was seriously under strength with many men on leave or suffering from malaria it would take time to concentrate it at its camp at ravenshoe queensland on atherton tableland to bring it up to strength 1st motor brigade was disbanded in july to provide reinforcements reinforcements passed through jungle warfare training centre at canungra queensland where they spent a month training under conditions closely resembling those in new guinea delays in getting overland supply route organised and 7th division itself ready meant that in initial stages of operation at least 7th division would have to be maintained by air vasey further proposed that bulk of his forces avoid a tiring overland march by moving directly to nadzab by air which increased importance of capturing nadzab early macarthur agreed to make 2nd battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment based at nearby queensland available to new guinea force to capture nadzab he further authorised regiment to conduct training with 7th division and a number of exercises were conducted colonel kenneth h kinsler commander of 503rd eager to discuss battle of crete with 21st infantry brigade s brigadier ivan dougherty took unusual step of parachuting into ravenshoe on 31 july vasey raised prospect of utilising entire regiment with kinsler blamey took up matter with macarthur who authorised it on 8 august blamey made australian army transport available to ship regiment from cairns to port moresby ghq operational instruction no 34 5 8 august 1943 awm54 589 5 3 except for 2nd battalion and advance party which moved by air as originally planned 7th division was treated to a training film loading douglas c 47 and commander of advanced echelon of lieutenant general george kenney s fifth air force major general ennis whitehead made five c 47 dakota transports available to 7th division each day so they could practise loading and unloading whitehead also made a boeing b 17 flying fortress available so vasey could fly low over target area on 7 august meanwhile 2 2nd pioneer battalion and 2 6th field company practiced crossing laloki river with folding boats they flew to tsili tsili airfield on 23 and 24 august thumb right crew of a short 25 pounder in markham valley to give paratroops some artillery support lieutenant colonel alan blyth of 2 4th field regiment proposed dropping some of its eight short 25 pounders by parachute a call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected on 30 august vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at rogers airfield this turned out to be easy part brand new guns were received from 10th advanced ordnance depot at port moresby on 23 august two were handed over for training while as a precaution remaining six were sent 2 117th field workshops for inspection and checking all six were condemned owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture on 30 august gunners received orders to move out next day so 2 51st light aid detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun only one was ready in time to leave with gunners so other followed on a special flight eight of 2 4th field regiment s mark ii 25 pounders were also condemned owing to presence of filings in buffer system vasey was less than impressed defects in 25 pdr light guns 3 september 1943 naa vic 1 94 1 450 vasey was concerned about japanese strength in lae area which his staff estimated at 6 400 in addition to 7 000 that herring s i corps staff estimated were in salamaua area however a more immediate danger was posed by japanese fourth air army at wewak photographs taken by allied reconnaissance planes showed 199 japanese aircraft on four fields there on 13 august on 17 august whitehead s heavy and medium bombers and fighters escorted by fighters bombed wewak taking japanese by surprise they destroyed around 100 japanese aircraft on ground in september japanese army air forces had at their disposal only 60 or 70 operational aircraft to oppose allied air forces in new guinea although both 6th and 7th air divisions were in area on south bank of markham river lay markham point where japanese maintained a force of about 200 men on commanding ground part of 24th infantry battalion was ordered to capture position attack on morning of 4 september went wrong from start with two scouts being wounded by a land mine force fought its way into japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw twelve australians were killed and six were wounded in attack it was then decided to merely contain japanese force at markham point which was subjected to mortar fire and an airstrike battle assault transport aircraft were controlled by 54th troop carrier wing which was commanded by colonel paul h prentiss with his headquarters at port moresby he had two groups under his command 374th troop carrier group at ward s field and 375th troop carrier group at dobodura plus 65th and 66th troop carrier squadrons of 403rd troop carrier group at jackson s field in addition prentiss could draw on 317th troop carrier group at archerfield airport and raaf base townsville although it was not under his command postponing operation from august to september 1943 allowed for arrival of troop carrier group from united states each squadron was equipped with 13 c 47 aircraft and each group consisted of four squadrons for a total of 52 aircraft per group thumb left 300px c 47 transport planes loaded with paratroops for drop at nadzab two men at left are generals kenney and macarthur actual date was chosen by general kenney based on advice of his two weather forecasting teams one australian and one american ideally z day would be clear from port moresby to nadzab but foggy over new britain thereby preventing japanese air forces at rabaul from intervening forecasting weather days in advance with such precision was difficult enough in peacetime but more so in wartime when many of areas from which weather patterns developed were occupied by enemy and data from them was consequently denied to forecasters when two teams differed over best possible date kenney split difference between two forecasts and told general macarthur we would be ready to go on morning of 4th for amphibious movement of 9th division to hopoi beach and about nine o clock on morning of 5th we would be ready to fly 503rd parachute regiment to nadzab z day 5 september 1943 dawned with inauspiciously bad weather fog and rain shrouded both departure airfields jackson s and ward s but as forecasters had predicted by 0730 fog began to dissipate first c 47 took off at 0820 formation of 79 c 47s each carrying 19 or 20 paratroops was divided into three flights first consisting of 24 c 47s from 403rd troop carrier group from jackson s carried 1st battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment second of 31 c 47s from 375th troop carrier group from ward s carried 2nd battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment third consisting of 24 c 47s of 317th troop carrier group from jackson s carried 3rd battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment each battalion had its

348th fighter group when kenney informed macarthur that he planned to observe operation from a b 17 macarthur reminded kenney of his orders to keep out of combat orders that brigadier general kenneth walker had disobeyed at cost of his life kenney went over reasons why he thought he should go ending with they were my kids and i was going to see them do their stuff macarthur replied you re right george we ll both go they re my kids too three hundred and two aircraft from eight different airfields in moresby and dobodura areas made a rendezvous over tsili tsili at 10 07 flying through clouds passes in mountains and over top not a single squadron wrote general kenney did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on final flight down watut valley turned to right down markham and went directly to target leading formation were 48 b 25s from 38th and bombardment groups whose job was to sanitise drop zones by dropping their loads of sixty fragmentation bombs and strafing with eight 50 calibre machine guns mounted in their noses they were followed by seven a 20s of 3rd bombardment group light each carried four m10 smoke tanks mounted under wings smoke tanks were each filled with of smoke agent fs in two groups of two and one of three flying at at they laid three smoke curtains adjacent to three drop zones lead aircraft discharged two tanks waited four seconds then discharged other two following aircraft went through same procedure creating a slight overlap to insure a continuous screen conditions were favourable while 85 humidity kept screens effective for five minutes and stopped their dispersal for ten thumb gunners of 2 4th field regiment en route to nadzab next came c 47s flying at at dropping commenced at 10 22 each aircraft dropped all its men in ten seconds and whole regiment was unloaded in four and a half minutes following transports came five b 17s with their racks loaded with packages with parachutes to be dropped to paratroopers on call by panel signals as they needed them this mobile supply unit stayed for much of day eventually dropping 15 tons of supplies a group of 24 b 24s and four b 17s which left column just before junction of watut and markham attacked japanese defensive position at heath s plantation about halfway between nadzab and lae five b 25 weather aircraft were used along route and over passes to keep units informed on weather to be encountered during their flights to rendezvous generals macarthur kenney and vasey observed operation from separate b 17s later macarthur received air medal for having personally led american paratroopers and skillfully directed this historic operation during operation including bombing of heath s a total of of high explosive bombs was dropped of fragmentation bombs were dropped and 42 580 rounds of 50 calibre and 5 180 rounds of 30 calibre ammunition were expended no air opposition was encountered and only one c 47 failed to make drop its cargo door blew off during flight damaging its elevator it safely returned to base three paratroopers were killed in drop two fell to their deaths when their parachutes malfunctioned while another landed in a tree and then fell some to ground there were 33 minor injuries caused by rough landings three battalions met no opposition on ground and formed up in their assembly areas this took some time due to tropical heat and high grass five c 47s of 375th troop carrier group carrying gunners of 2 4th field regiment took off from ward s airfield after main force and landed at tsili tsili after an hour on ground they set out for nadzab most jumped from first two aircraft next three aircraft dropped equipment including dismantled guns pushers out followed when aircraft made a second pass over drop one australian injured his shoulder in drop gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in tall grass enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within two and a half hours of dropping although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning it took three days to find missing parts and assemble other gun at 1515 two b 17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition their dropping was accurate but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes follow up thumb right lieutenant colonel j t lang s force crossing

where it rendezvoused with b company papuan infantry battalion that night a party of engineers and pioneers set out from tsili tsili in 20 small craft sailed and paddled down watut and markham rivers to join lang s force at kirkland s crossing small river borne task force included 10 british 5 ton folding assault boats and military folboats which met up with 2 6 independent commandos who had reconnoitered proposed crossing area with 8 of these folboats day before while neither river was deep both were fast flowing with shoals and hidden snags three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned on morning of 5 september lang s force was treated to sight of air force passing overhead at this point markham river formed three arms separated by broad sand bars two were fordable but other was deep and flowing at using folding boats and local timber they constructed a pontoon bridge allowing whole force to cross river safely with all their equipment that evening they reached americans position reconquest pp 29 30 next day they went to work on airstrip with hand tools trees were felled potholes filled in and a erected fourteen gliders were supposed to fly in three light tractors three mowers a wheeled rake and other engineering equipment from dobodura because lack of opposition made immediate resupply non urgent and because he had doubts about proficiency of glider pilots whom he knew had undergone only minimal training general blamey decided that glider operation was not worth risk to glider pilots or their passengers and cancelled it substituting instead afternoon supply run by specially modified b 17s lacking mowers kunai grass was cut by hand by pioneers sappers paratroops and native civilians and burned causing destruction of some stores and equipment that had been lost in long grass and a swirl of black dust by 11 00 on 6 september strip which had not been used for over a year had been extended to first plane to land was an l 4 piper cub

new airstrip which became known as no 1 existing one becoming no 2 site proved to be an excellent one an old dry riverbed with soil largely composed of gravel a gravel base and steel plank was laid to accommodate fighters based at tsili tsili that were in danger of bogging down when weather deteriorated by end of october there were four airstrips at nadzab one of which was long and sealed with bitumen thumb left two of five trucks carrying members of 2 33rd infantry battalion and 158th general transport company which were destroyed when a b 24 liberator bomber crashed into marshalling park near jackson s airfield on 7 september 1943 while engineers and anti aircraft gunners arrived from tsili tsili no infantry arrived from port moresby on 6 september because of bad flying weather over owen stanley range although 2 25th infantry battalion was flown to tsili tsili on 7 september reveille was sounded for 2 33rd infantry battalion at 03 30 and unit boarded trucks of 158th general

flew out to tsili tsili as scheduled due to unpredictable weather aircraft continued to arrive at nadzab sporadically only 2 25th infantry battalion and part of 2 33rd had reached nadzab by morning of 8 september when vasey ordered commander of 25th infantry brigade brigadier ken eather to initiate advance on lae that day there were 112 landings at nadzab on 9 september as advance began rest of 2 33rd infantry battalion reached nadzab from tsili tsili but while there were 116 landings at nadzab bad weather prevented 2 31st infantry battalion from leaving port moresby finally on 12 september after three non flying days 2 31st infantry battalion reached nadzab on some of 130 landings on two strips at nadzab that day on 13 september a platoon of 2 25th infantry battalion came under very heavy fire from a concealed japanese machine gun near heath s plantation that wounded a number of australians including corporal w h billy richards and halted platoon s advance private richard kelliher suddenly on his own initiative dashed toward post and hurled two grenades at it which killed some of japanese defenders but not all he returned to his section seized a bren gun dashed back to enemy post and silenced it he then asked permission to go out again to rescue wounded richards which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position kelliher was awarded victoria cross north of main advance a patrol from lieutenant colonel john j tolson s 3rd battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment encountered a force of 200 japanese crossing river on 15 september

be relieved thumb right australian troops file past a dead japanese soldier on their way into lae by this time 9th division was about east of lae while 7th division was away and it appeared an odds on bet that 9th would reach lae first 7th division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 september last ten japanese troops facing 2 33rd infantry battalion were killed and 2 25th infantry battalion passed through its position and headed for lae as they moved down markham valley road they occasionally encountered sick japanese soldiers who held column momentarily brigadier eather came up in his jeep and started urging diggers to hurry up they were unimpressed eather armed with a pistol then acted as leading scout with his troops following in a column of route behind him column entered lae unopposed by japanese but aircraft of fifth air force strafed 2 33rd infantry battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs wounding two men whitehead soon received a message sent in clear from vasey that read only fifth air force bombers are preventing me from entering lae by early afternoon 2 31st infantry battalion reached lae airfield where it killed 15 japanese soldiers and captured one 25th infantry brigade then came under fire from 9th division s 25 pounders wounding one soldier vasey and eather tried every available means to inform wootten of situation a message eventually reached him through raaf channels at 14 25 and artillery was silenced japanese withdrawal on 8 september adachi ordered nakano to abandon salamaua and fall back on lae nakano had already evacuated his hospital patients and artillery to lae on 11 september his main body began to withdraw by this time it was clear that blamey intended to cut off and destroy 51st division after discussing matter with imperial general headquarters in tokyo imamura and adachi called off their plans to capture bena bena and mount hagen and instructed nakano and shoge to move overland to north coast of huon peninsula while 20th division moved from madang to finschhafen sending one regiment down ramu valley to assist 51st division salamaua garrison assembled at lae on 14 september and japanese evacuated town over next few days it was a retreating band that contacted 3rd battalion 503rd parachute infantry regiment japanese hurriedly altered their route before australians could intercept them crossing saruwaged range proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for japanese soldiers they started out with ten days rations but this was exhausted by time they reached mount 51st division had already abandoned most of its heavy equipment now many soldiers threw away their rifles crossing wrote lieutenant general kane took far longer than had been expected and its difficulties were beyond discussion near mountain summits cold was intense and sleep was quite impossible all cold night they could only doze beside fire squalls came ice spread and they advanced through snow under this tropical sky gradually road they were climbing became a descending slope but inclination was so steep that if they missed their footing they would fall thousands and thousands of feet and how many men lost their lives like that in end japanese army could take pride in conducting a creditable defence in face of an impossible tactical situation fortune and nature however favoured a valiant defender despite equally valiant striving of attackers aftermath casualties 503rd parachute infantry lost three men killed and 33 injured in jump another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against japanese and 26 were evacuated sick 2 5th field ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 september between 5 and 19 september 7th division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded while another 138 were evacuated sick to this must be added 11 americans and 59 australians killed and 92 australians injured in air crash at jackson s airfield thus 119 allied servicemen were killed 241 wounded or injured and 166 evacuated sick japanese casualties were estimated at 2 200 but it is impossible to apportion them between 7th and 9th divisions base development development of nadzab depended on heavy construction equipment which had to be landed at lae and moved over markham valley road job of improving road was assigned to 842nd engineer aviation battalion which arrived at lae on 20 september but after a few days work it was ordered to relieve 871st airborne aviation battalion at nadzab 842nd reached nadzab on 4 october but a combination of unseasonable rainfall and heavy military traffic destroyed road surface and closed road forcing nadzab to be supplied from lae by air 842nd then had to resume work on road this time from nadzab end heavy rain was experienced on 46 of next 60 days road was reopened on 15 december allowing and engineer aviation battalions and no 62 works wing raaf to move to nadzab to work on development of airbase airbase would eventually consist of four all weather airfields no 1 had a by runway surfaced with marsden matting and a by runway surfaced with bitumen no 2 had a by runway partially surfaced with bitumen no 3 had a by runway surfaced with bitumen in centre with of marsden mat at either end no 4 an raaf airfield named newton after flight lieutenant william ellis newton had two parallel by runways surfaced with bitumen nadzab became allied air forces main base in new guinea outcome general blamey declared capture of lae and salamaua to be a signal step on road to victory reconquest p 12 tolson described 503rd parachute infantry regiment s operation at nadzab as probably classic text book airborne operation of world war ii coming after impressive but flawed performance of airborne arm in allied invasion of sicily nadzab influenced thinking about value of airborne operations however impact was far greater than anyone on allied side realised and ramifications went far beyond new guinea imperial general headquarters had regarded defeats in guadalcanal campaign and battle of buna gona as setbacks only and had continued to plan offensives in south west pacific now it concluded that japanese position was over extended a new defensive line was drawn running through western new guinea caroline islands and mariana islands henceforth positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line general imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory but only with holding on as long as possible so as to delay allied advance notes references external links category 1943 in papua new guinea category battles and operations of world war ii
