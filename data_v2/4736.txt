covered bridges of pennsylvania a guide first covered bridges of burr arch truss design were also built in state pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1 500 covered bridges and is believed to have had most in country between 1830 and 1875 in 2001 pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties thumb right upright south side and east portal of bridge and site of former mill in december 2008 covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges latter made of cast iron or steel in 19th century pennsylvania lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction but wood did not last long when exposed to elements roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected structural elements allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century a burr arch truss consists of a load bearing arch sandwiching multiple king posts resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone although there were 30 covered bridges in sullivan county in 1890 only five were left by 1954 and as of 2015 only three remain forksville hillsgrove and sonestown construction and description all three sullivan county covered bridges were built in or c 1850 with burr arch trusses at time of its construction sonestown bridge was fifth covered bridge in sullivan county bridge crossed muncy creek to provide access to johnny hazen s gristmill which was also built in 1850 although most sources do not list builder of sonestown bridge two newspaper articles on remaining sullivan county covered bridges reported that sadler rodgers had designed or possibly built it as well rogers a native of forksville built both forksville and hillsgrove bridges

bridge is also on 2012 national bridge inventory nbi which lists covered bridge as long with a roadway wide and a maximum load of however maximum load posted beside bridge itself is only according to nrhp bridge s road surface width is which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic according to nrhp form sonestown bridge is of lighter construction than similar bridges in south eastern pennsylvania covered bridge rests on abutments of stone and mortar which have been reinforced with concrete portals are flanked by wing walls below level of road these extend out from abutments at an angle and retain soil of approach embankment note see page 80 and figure 69 for more information on wing walls thumb left bridge interior showing angular burr arches with arch on left north side taller than that on right south side bridge deck is made of wide boards laid perpendicular to axis of bridge with two runners on top of deck which run length of bridge burr arches which support bridge are cruder than those in other two sullivan county covered bridges they are not smooth continuous arcs but several straight segments joined at an angle top of burr arch on south downstream side of bridge is noticeably lower than top of arch on north upstream side note follow this link for a photograph of interior of bridge with south downstream side of bridge on right vertical boards cover

bridges in sullivan county changed considerably in last half of 20th century two of five bridges that remained in 1954 were razed by 1970 when pennsylvania department of transportation considered tearing down forksville bridge but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists hillsgrove covered bridge was added to nrhp in 1973 and two other bridges were added in 1980

buildings had disappeared by 1999 nrhp form states that bridge had been recently repaired in 1969 and that additional maintenance work was needed repairs done at that time included replacing some of siding panels reinforcing abutments with concrete and very minor addition of steel to truss structure in january 1996 there was major flooding throughout pennsylvania a blizzard from january 6 8 produced up to of snow which was followed on january 19 21 by more than of rain with temperatures as high as and winds up to rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout pennsylvania and ice jams made

inventory found sufficiency rating of bridge structure to be only 18 6 percent it found that bridge s foundations were stable for scour conditions potential for stream washing them out but that railing does not meet currently acceptable standards its overall condition was deemed basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action with an estimated cost to improve bridge of 108
