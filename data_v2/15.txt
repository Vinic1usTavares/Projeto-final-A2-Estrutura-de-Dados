strategic plans when they ventured into international markets first to u s and uk in 1998 they chose to follow same practices that were successful in australia by keeping their stage show simple inexpensive props and effects and four original members along with their characters singing and dancing for their audiences financing every business venture themselves they had to bear consequences

since group was formed and their manager since mid 1990s and mike conway who had worked for ernst young in england and was their general manager responsible for their expansion into international markets from 2001 to 2012 in 2012 wiggles cut back much of their international expansion after like many businesses experiencing a decrease in their profits after worldwide recession a few years

tolerance of drug use drinking smoking or bad language by any employee of their organisation they did not tour with a large troupe of dancers and cast members until late 1990s but as field reported we ve been lucky with our cast our turnover is pretty minimal we ve always had great loyalty from and talent among professionals by 2005 they travelled using two 16 metre 52 ft trucks three tour buses a cast of 13 dancers called wiggly dancers and 10 permanent crew members according to field they required that cast and crew of all their productions have a positive and respectful relationship with their audience both on stage and off merchandising wiggles recognised that toys were a necessary part of a child s normal development especially his or her motor and language skills so they trod fine line between maintaining and promoting early childhood values and operating in commercial arena and as field put it proceeded cautiously at first cook reviewed every merchandising proposal they received but turned it over to other companies such as toronto based toy company spin master in later years although field reported that they continued to sign off on things group avoided over extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image like endorsing healthy foods and by remaining within preschool and family markets group was named australia s richest

had many australian entertainers they earned 28 million and had a 28 decrease in profits but they still appeared second on brw s list that year according to brw group restructured wiggles pty ltd in

and personal reasons they were replaced by former back up singers lachlan gillespie simon pryce and emma watkins so that group could continue to develop and preserve their brand although they insisted that they chose watkins group s first female member because she was most qualified for job they admitted that it was a strategy for marketing wiggles into next generation television and dvd production in early years of group s existence it seemed logical to develop a television program that both entertained and conveyed sound and developmentally appropriate values at time according to field australian children s tv was an extremely staid and cautious genre so it was difficult for them to break into it they filmed a television pilot for australian broadcasting corporation abc because they felt a program on network would receive most exposure to pre school market but as sydney morning herald smh reported in 2002 project never got off ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences also according to smh abc told them that they could not communicate with children and that members of group should not speak just sing abc insisted that instead of what smh called their trademark colourful and black trousers they wear shorts and caps wiggles responded to this criticism by creating thirteen episodes of a self produced television series wiggles which they funded from their tours and video sales in this series and in most of their early series they cut costs by using two cameras and visually checked performance of each song that way according to paul field it took them less time to complete a forty minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three minute music video they sold program to australia s channel seven and then moved it to abc in 1998 and to disney channel in 1999 paul field reported that in early 2000s a meeting at a new york licensing fair with grahame abc s acting director of enterprises led to abc s enthusiastic agreement to produce wiggles tv shows beginning in 2002 wiggles filmed four seasons worth of shows exclusively with abc lights camera action wiggles aired on abc in 2003 wiggles show in 2005 and 2006 and wiggle and learn in 2008 network called them most successful property that abc has represented in pre school genre in 2007 wiggles opened their own recording and film studios in sydney called hot potato studios they were first pre school production company in australia to shoot their videos and tv programs in high definition in 2009 as cook put it to try somewhere else and to freshen up our brand a bit wiggles ended their long relationship with disney channel in u s when they entered into a five year long partnership with digital cable channel sprout they also aired previous episodes of their show on channel created and hosted a three hour block of programming that aired in mornings and created online and on demand content sprout called partnership our biggest acquisition that sprout has ever done cook stated that move was not acrimonious and although group owed much of their early success to disney that it was just business first decade of 21st century ended with wiggles expanding their brand by creating new shows including dorothy dinosaur show and baby antonio s circus in 2009 a three minute show that featured field s oldest son and acrobatics other ventures in 2005 as a relatively short lived experiment group franchised its concept to other countries they started in taiwan because as cook stated they thought country was a small enough place in case it didn t work out taiwanese group was successful so they branched out to latin america casting spanish speaking australians wiggles ceased to pursue additional franchising when they learned that viewers in other countries preferred original versions of their songs and programs because they helped children learn english and according to cook when it became too hard for them to control and when it did not prove lucrative by 2012 they found that it was easier to simply dub their programs into other languages thumb right sign at wiggles world in queensland also in 2005 australia s largest theme park dreamworld
