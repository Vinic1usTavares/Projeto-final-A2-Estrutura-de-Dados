in private schools and had his own english language tutor in 1874 he was sent to a private school run by europeans to improve his english and german language skills at time of his early adulthood kano stood but weighed only he was frequently bullied at school due to his size so he wished he were stronger in order to defend himself one day nakai a friend of family who was a member of shoguns guard mentioned that jujutsu was an excellent form of both self defense and physical training he showed kano a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent kano decided he wanted to learn art despite nakai s insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous kano s father also discouraged him from jujutsu telling him to pursue a modern sport instead jujutsu thumb right kano demonstrated jujutsu for ulysses s grant when former u s president visited japan in 1879 when kano attended tokyo imperial university in 1877 he started looking for jujutsu teachers father of judo a biography of jigoro kano by brian n watson pages 29 and 189 he first looked for called his assumption was that doctors who knew martial art were better teachers his search brought him to yagi who had been a student of emon in tenjin shin yo ryu school of jujutsu yagi in turn referred kano to fukuda hachinosuke a who taught tenjin shin yo ryu in a 10 mat room adjacent to his practice tenjin shin yo ryu was itself a combination of two older schools yoshin ryu and shin no shindo ryu fukuda s training method consisted mostly of student taking fall after fall for teacher or senior student until he began to understand mechanics of technique fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form he gave beginners a short description of technique and had them engage in free practice randori in order to teach through experience it was only after student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms kata this method was difficult as there were no special mats for falling only standard straw mats tatami laid over wooden floors kano had trouble defeating fukushima who was one of his seniors at school therefore kano started trying

began studying with iso who had been a friend of fukuda despite being 62 years old and standing only tall iso had gained a powerful build from jujitsu training he was known for excellence in kata and was also a specialist in atemi or striking of vital areas in iso s method one began with kata and then progressed to free fighting randori due to kano s intense practice and his solid grounding in jujitsu taught by fukuda he was soon an assistant at iso s school in 1881 fukuda s widow gave scrolls of school to kano then 21 years old some popular works suggest that kano obtained a teaching license in this school but this has not been documented no tenjin shin yo ryu certificate s with kano s name visible is depicted anywhere in kodokan museum or in any published source neither is such rank specified in any authentic tenjin shin yo ryu archival documents while under iso s tutelage kano witnessed a demonstration by yoshin ryu jujutsu teacher totsuka and later took part in randori with members of totsuka s school kano was impressed by yoshin ryu practitioners and realized that he might never be able to beat someone as talented as totsuka simply by training harder he also needed to train smarter it was this experience that first led kano to believe that to be truly superior one needed to combine best elements of several ryu or schools of jujutsu including yagyu shingan ryu taijutsu toward this end he began to seek teachers who could provide him with superior elements of jujutsu that he could adopt after iso died in 1881 kano began training in kito ryu with iikubo tsunetoshi iikubo was an expert in kata and throwing and fond of randori kano applied himself thoroughly to learning kito ryu believing iikubo s throwing techniques in particular to be better than in

kodokan cultural association were good use of spiritual and physical strength and prospering in common for oneself and others although those are literal translations phrases were usually translated

schools in japan considering that he majored in political science and economics kano s family thought that after graduating from university he would pursue a career in some government ministry indeed through influential friends of his father s he was initially offered a position with ministry of finance however his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at gakushuin students of japan s elite attended gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers students were allowed to ride in rickshaws right to doors of classes whereas teachers were forbidden teachers often felt compelled to visit homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice in effect teachers were treated as servants kano believed this to be unacceptable he refused to play such a subservient role when teaching his students to kano a teacher must command respect at same time he employed latest european and american pedagogical methods theories of american educator john dewey especially influenced him dewey visited kodokan on 31 march 1919 for dewey s thoughts on kano s methods see john dewey and alice chipman dewey letters from china and japan edited by evelyn dewey new york e p dutton 1920 pp 93 94 kano s manner had desired effect upon students but administration was slower to warm to his methods and it was not until arrival of a new principal that kano s ideas found acceptance all this is to say that kano s educational philosophy was a combination of both traditional japanese neo confucianism and contemporary european and american philosophies to include instrumentalism utilitarianism and evolutionary progressivism as social darwinism was then known goals of kano s educational philosophies and methods indeed goals of most japanese educational programs of early 20th century were to develop minds bodies and spirits in equal proportion to increase patriotism and loyalty especially to emperor to teach public morality and to increase physical strength and stamina especially for purpose of making young men more fit for military service amano ikuo education and examination in modern japan translated

sports than a practical source of physical exercise for masses moreover at elite levels baseball football and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development instead elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning at almost any cost japan times 17 august 1936 p 3 for kano answer to this conundrum was one word judo not judo in sense of simply throwing other people around and definitely not judo in sense of winning at any cost instead it was judo in sense of maximum efficiency with minimum effort and mutual welfare and benefit or as kano himself put it to a reporter in 1938 when yielding is highest efficient use of energy then yielding is judo japan times 17 may 1938 p 5 international olympic committee thumb left kano jigoro after ioc vote on 31 july 1936 in berlin which decided to organize 1940 olympics in tokyo kano became active in work of international olympic committee ioc in 1909 this came about after kristian hellstrom of swedish olympic

sprang up throughout world and in 1964 judo was introduced as an olympic sport in tokyo olympics and was reintroduced at munich olympics in 1972 kano s posthumous reputation was therefore assured
