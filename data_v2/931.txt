lapland war was fought between finland and nazi germany effectively from september to november 1944 in finland s northernmost region lapland during world war ii although finns and germans had been fighting soviet union ussr together since 1941 during continuation war soviet vyborg petrozavodsk offensive in summer of 1944 forced finnish leadership to negotiate a separate peace agreement moscow armistice demanded finland break diplomatic ties with germany and expel or disarm any german soldiers remaining in finland after 15 september 1944 wehrmacht had anticipated turn of events and planned an organised withdrawal to german occupied norway called operation birke birch despite a failed offensive landing operation by germany in gulf of finland evacuation proceeded peacefully at first finns escalated situation into warfare on 28 september after soviet pressure to adhere to terms of armistice finnish army was required by ussr to demobilise while at same time pursuing german troops out of finnish soil after a series of minor battles war came to an effective end in november 1944 when german troops had reached norway or its vicinity and took fortified positions last german soldiers left finland on 27 april 1945 and end of world war ii in europe came soon after finns considered war a separate conflict because hostilities with other nations had ceased after continuation war from german perspective it was a part of two campaigns to evacuate from northern finland and northern norway soviet involvement in war amounted to monitoring finnish operations minor air support as well as entering north eastern lapland during petsamo kirkenes offensive military impacts were relatively limited with both sides sustaining around 4 000 in total casualties although germans delaying scorched earth and land mine strategies devastated finnish lapland successfully withdrew and finland upheld its obligations under moscow armistice although it remained formally at war with ussr and united kingdom until ratification of 1947 paris peace treaty prelude thumb a view in 2007 to south east from a fortified german position in finland from norway and finland had been at war with soviet union ussr since operation barbarossa began in june 1941 co operating closely in continuation war and operation silver fox with german 20th mountain army stationed in lapland as early as summer of 1943 german high command oberkommando der wehrmacht began to plan for eventuality that finland might negotiate a separate peace agreement with soviet union germans planned to withdraw their forces northward in order to shield nickel mines near petsamo during winter of 1943 1944 germans improved roads from northern norway to northern finland by extensive use of prisoner of war labour in certain areas casualties among labouring prisoners were high in part because many of them had been captured in southern europe and were still in summer uniform in addition germans surveyed defensive positions and planned to evacuate as much materiel as possible from region and meticulously prepared for withdrawal on 9 april 1944 german withdrawal plan was designated as operation birke in june 1944 germans started to construct fortifications against a possible enemy advance from south accidental death of eduard dietl on 23 june 1944 brought lothar rendulic to command of 20th mountain army after devastating soviet strategic vyborg petrozavodsk offensive in southern finland from june to july and a change in finnish leadership in august 1944 finland negotiated a separate peace agreement with ussr ceasefire agreement required finns to break diplomatic ties with germany and publicly demand withdrawal of all german troops from finland by 15 september 1944 any troops remaining after deadline were to be expelled or disarmed and handed over to ussr even with german withdrawal operation finns estimated it would take three months for wehrmacht to fully evacuate task was further complicated by soviet demand that majority of finnish defence forces be demobilised while conducting a military campaign against germans before deciding to accept soviet demands president carl gustaf emil mannerheim former finnish commander in chief wrote a letter directly to adolf hitler order of battle german 20th mountain army had been fighting soviet karelian front since operation barbarossa along stretch from oulu river to arctic ocean it now comprised 214 000 soldiers a considerable amount of them under ss formations led by rendulic number of active troops decreased quickly as they withdrew to norway army had 32 000 horses and mules and 17 500 26 000 motorised vehicles as well as a total of in rations ammunition and fuel to last for six months army was positioned as follows xix mountain corps in far northern petsamo area beside arctic ocean xxxvi mountain corps in area of salla and alakurtti eastern lapland xviii mountain corps was in charge of southern flank at kestenga and finnish iii corps led by lieutenant general hjalmar siilasvuo gradually shifted from defence of vyborg petrozavodsk offensive to latitude of oulu and was fully repositioned by 28 september iii corps consisted of 3rd 6th and 11th divisions as well as armoured division additionally four battalions formerly under german command were converted into separate detachments two regiments infantry regiment 15 and border jaeger regiment reinforced iii corps in total finnish ground forces in lapland theatre were 75 000 strong number of finnish troops dropped sharply as germans withdrew and finnish army was demobilised by december 1944 only 12 000 were left due to this finnish soldiers were mostly conscripts as veterans were transferred away from front latter part of war was therefore dubbed children s crusade in finland phases of war thumb left upright 1 5 operations birke and nordlicht german withdrawal from finland from 6 september 1944 to 30 january 1945 evacuation and naval operations in september announcement on 2 september 1944 of ceasefire and moscow armistice between finland and ussr triggered frantic efforts by 20th mountain army which immediately started operation birke large amounts of materiel were evacuated from southern finland and harsh punishments were set for any hindering of withdrawal germans began to seize finnish shipping finland responded by denying ships to sail from finland to germany and nearly doomed materiel evacuations of operation birke so order was rescinded and then finns in turn allowed finnish tonnage to be used to hasten german evacuations first german naval mines were laid in finnish on 14 september 1944 allegedly for use against soviet shipping though since finland and germany were not yet in open conflict germans warned finns of their intent thumb germans evacuating equipment from oulu on 19 september 1944 as finns wanted to avoid devastation of their country and germans wished to avoid hostilities both sides strove for evacuation to be performed as smoothly as possible by 15 september a secret agreement had been reached by which germans would inform finns of their withdrawal timetable who would then allow germans to use finnish transportation for evacuation as well as to destroy roads railroads and bridges behind their withdrawal in practice friction soon arose both from destruction caused by germans and from pressure exerted on finns by soviets on 15 september 1944 kriegsmarine tried to land and seize island of suursaari in operation ost to secure shipping routes in gulf of finland ussr sent aircraft to support finnish defenders and failed to capture suursaari after landing attempt a finnish coastal artillery fort at uto island prevented german net laying ships from passing into baltic sea on 15 september as they had been ordered to intern german forces on 16 september a german naval detachment consisting of escorted by five destroyers arrived at uto german cruiser stayed out of range of finnish guns and threatened to open fire with its artillery in order to avoid bloodshed finns allowed net layers to pass in response to german operations finland immediately removed its shipping from joint evacuation operation but evacuation from lapland to norway progressed according to secret agreement last german convoy departed from kemi in northern finland on 21 september 1944 and was escorted by submarines and starting from south of aland islands by german cruisers initial land battles in september and october lack of finnish aggression did not go unnoticed by allied control commission monitoring adherence to moscow armistice and ussr threatened to occupy finland if terms of expelling or disarming germans were not met thus lieutenant general siilasvuo ordered iii corps to engage first hostilities between finnish army and 20th mountain army in lapland took place southwest of pudasjarvi at around 08 00 on 28 september 1944 when finnish advance units first issued a surrender demand and then opened fire on a small german rear guard contingent this took germans by surprise as finns had previously agreed to warn them should they be forced to take hostile action against them after incident partial contact was re established germans told finns they had no interest in fighting them but would not surrender next incident took place on 29 september at a bridge crossing river between kemi and oulu finnish troops who had been ordered to take bridge intact were attempting to disarm explosives rigged to bridge when germans detonated them demolishing bridge and killing among others finnish company commander on 30 september finns attempted to encircle germans at pudasjarvi into a pocket called a in finnish originally meaning of firewood with flanking movements through forests and managed to cut road leading north by then however bulk of german force at pudasjarvi had already left leaving behind only a small detachment which after warning finns blew up a munitions dump risky landings for battle of tornio on border with sweden next to gulf of bothnia began on 30 september 1944 when three finnish transport ships ss norma ss fritz s and ss hesperus departed from oulu towards tornio without any air or naval escorts they arrived on 1 october and disembarked their troops without any interference landing had originally been planned as a diversionary raid with main assault to take place at kemi where finnish battalion sized detachment pennanen was already in control of important industrial facilities on island of various factors including a stronger than expected german garrison at kemi already alerted by local attacks made finns switch target to tornio s outer port finns initially landed infantry regiment 11 of 3rd division which together with a civic guard led uprising at tornio managed to secure both port and most of town as well as bridges over tornio river finnish attack soon bogged down due to disorganisation caused in part by alcohol looted from german supply depots as well as stiffening german resistance during ensuing battle german a reinforced regiment conducted several counterattacks to retake town as it formed an important transportation link between two roads running parallel to kemi and tornio rivers as ordered by rendulic germans took 262 finnish civilian hostages in an attempt to trade them for captured soldiers finns refused and civilians were later released on 12 october thumb gebirgsjager of xviii mountain corps attacking behind cover in 1942 when finland and germany were still at war with ussr together a second wave of four finnish ships arrived on 2 october and a third wave three ships strong and with brewster f2a fighter escorts landed its troops with only a single ship being lightly damaged by german stuka dive bombers on 4 october bad weather prevented finnish air cover from reaching tornio leaving fourth landing wave vulnerable bombers scored several hits and sank ss bore ix and ss alongside pier fifth wave on 5 october suffered only light shrapnel damage despite being both shelled from shore and bombed from sky finnish navy s gunboats and class patrol boats 15 and 16 arrived with sixth wave just in time to witness german focke wulf fw 200 condor bombers attacking shipping at tornio with henschel hs 293 glide bombs without results arrival of naval assets allowed finns to safely disembark heavy equipment to support battle and around 12 500 soldiers in total arrived during landings german forces were reinforced by 2nd company of panzer abteilung 211 two infantry battalions and finnish infantry regiment 11 was reinforced with infantry regiments 50 and 53 finns beat back german counterattacks for a week until 8 october when germans withdrew from tornio meanwhile finnish troops were advancing overland from oulu towards kemi with 15th brigade making only slow progress against meager german resistance their advance was hampered by destruction of roads and bridges by withdrawing germans as well as a lack of spirit in both finnish troops and their leaders finns attacked kemi on 7 october attempting to encircle germans into a with a frontal attack by 15th brigade and an attack from rear by detachment pennanen strong german resistance civilians in area and looted alcohol prevented finns from fully trapping all germans though finnish forces took several hundred prisoners they failed to prevent germans from demolishing bridges over kemi river once they began to withdraw on 8 october from start of war germans had systematically destroyed and mined roads and bridges as they withdrew in a delaying strategy after first hostilities took place rendulic issued several orders on destroying finnish property in lapland on 6 october a strict order was issued which classified only military sites or military necessities as targets on 8 october germans bombed and heavily damaged factory areas of kemi on 9 october demolition order was extended to include all governmental buildings with exception of hospitals on 13 october all covers installations and objects that can be used by an enemy were ordered to be destroyed in northern finland in a scorched earth strategy though it was logical for germans to deny pursuing forces any shelter it had a very limited effect on finns who always carried tents for shelter german withdrawal effective by november when allied advances continued german high command and 20th mountain army leadership asserted that it would be perilous to maintain positions in lapland and east of lyngen municipality in northern norway likewise minister of armaments and war production albert speer had determined that german nickel stores were sufficient and holding petsamo was unnecessary preparations for further withdrawal began hitler accepted proposal on 4 october 1944 and plan was codenamed operation nordlicht on 6 october instead of a gradual withdrawal from southern lapland into fortified positions further to north while evacuating materiel as in operation birke operation nordlicht called for a rapid and strictly organised withdrawal directly behind lyngen fjord in norway while under pressure from harassing enemy forces as germans withdrew towards town of rovaniemi a road junction point in lapland and norway movement was mostly limited to immediate vicinity of lapland s three main roads which constricted military activities considerably in general withdrawal followed a pattern in which advancing finnish units would encounter german rear guards and attempt to flank them on foot but destroyed road network prevented them from bringing up artillery and other heavy weapons as finnish infantry slowly picked their way through dense woods and marshland motorised german units would simply drive away and take up positions further down road thumb a finnish soldier cooking with his dog hupi joy at south of rovaniemi in october 1944 hupi followed its master during three wars according to photographer on 7 october finnish jaeger brigade forced german mountain regiment 218 to fight a delaying action off of their pre set timetable at some south of rovaniemi opposing forces were roughly even numerically and lack of heavy weapons and exhaustion from long marches prevented finnish brigade from trapping defending germans before it received permission to withdraw on 9 october after causing substantial losses to finns on 13 october tables were turned at some south of rovaniemi and only a fortuitous withdrawal by mountain regiment 218 saved finnish infantry regiment 33 from being severely mauled german withdrawal allowed finns to surround one of delaying battalions but mountain regiment 218 returned and managed to rescue stranded battalion germans initially concentrated on destroying governmental buildings in rovaniemi but fire spread and destroyed housing beyond that german attempts to fight fire failed and a train loaded with ammunition caught fire at railroad station on 14 october resulting in an explosion which spread fire throughout primarily wooden buildings of town first finnish units to reach vicinity of rovaniemi on 14 october were components of jaeger brigade advancing from germans repelled finnish attempts to capture last intact bridge over kemi river and then left mostly scorched town to finns on 16 october 1944 thumb a burnt tree and ruins in rovaniemi pictured on 16 october 1944 after german withdrawal demobilisation and difficult supply routes took their toll at tankavaara south of ivalo barely four battalions of finnish jaeger brigade attempted unsuccessfully on 26 october to dislodge twelve battalion strong german 169th infantry division entrenched in prepared fortifications finnish forces gained ground only on 1 november when germans withdrew northward likewise on 26 october at muonio south east of defensive positions in norway german 6th ss mountain division nord reinforced by again had numerical and material superiority with artillery and armoured support this prevented finnish 11th division from gaining upper hand despite initially fairly successful flanking operations by infantry regiments 8 and 50 finns planned to isolate ss mountain division marching from direction of in south east before muonio and thereby entrap it within a delaying action by and destroyed road network thwarted finnish strategy soviet karelian front led by general kirill meretskov initiated its petsamo kirkenes offensive and started to push xix mountain corps towards norway from soviet territory along arctic coast on 7 october by 25 october front captured norwegian port of kirkenes 14th army pursued german troops withdrawing southwest from petsamo and kirkenes approximately into finnish territory along lake inari by 5 november soviet reconnaissance troops met with finnish army at ivalo likewise 26th army had followed withdrawing xviii mountain corps around over finnish border in southern lapland to kuusamo and suomussalmi but left area in november soviet troops in ivalo did not leave until september 1945 thumb finnish soldiers raise flag at three country cairn between norway sweden and finland on 27 april 1945 after end of lapland war and thus end of world war ii in finland for most practical purposes war in lapland concluded in early november 1944 after holding tankavaara germans swiftly withdrew from north eastern lapland at on 25 november 1944 finnish jaeger brigade pursuing them had by then been mostly demobilised in north western lapland only four battalions of finnish troops were left on 4 november and by february 1945 a mere 600 men germans continued their withdrawal but remained in positions first at village from norway in early november 1944 from there they moved to fortified position along river from norway on 26 november german 7th mountain division held these positions until 10 january 1945 when northern norway had been cleared and positions at lyngen fjord were manned on 12 january was sunk with loss of its ten sailors in gulf of bothnia by using an acoustic torpedo some german positions defending lyngen extended over to kilpisjarvi on finnish side of border but no major activity occurred completely withdrew from finland by 27 april 1945 and a finnish battle patrol raised flag on three country cairn between norway sweden and finland to celebrate end of wars aftermath 20th mountain army successfully withdrew most of its over 200 000 men as well as supplies and equipment from lapland to continue defending occupied finnmark from ussr according to american historian earl f ziemke it had no parallel as an evacuation across arctic in winter casualties of conflict were relatively limited 774 killed 262 missing and around 2 904 wounded finns germany experienced around 1 000 deaths and 2 000 wounded 1 300 german soldiers became prisoners of war and were handed over to ussr according to terms of armistice german delaying operations left lapland devastated in addition to 3 100 buildings demolished elsewhere in finland estimates of destroyed infrastructure in lapland are as follows 14 900 buildings representing around 40 46 percent of lapland s property of railroad of road 675 bridges 2 800 road storm drains of phone and telegram lines reconstruction of lapland lasted till early 1950s although railroad network was not functional until 1957 in addition
