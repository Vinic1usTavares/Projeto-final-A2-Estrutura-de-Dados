wihtred c 670 23 april 725 was king of kent from about 690 or 691 until his death he was a son of ecgberht i and a brother of eadric wihtred ascended to throne after a confused period in 680s which included a brief conquest of kent by caedwalla of wessex and subsequent dynastic conflicts his immediate predecessor was oswine who was probably descended from eadbald though not through same line as wihtred shortly after start of his reign wihtred issued a code of laws law of wihtred that has been preserved in a manuscript known as textus roffensis laws pay a great deal of attention to rights of church of time period including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship wihtred s long reign had few incidents recorded in annals of day he was succeeded in 725 by his sons aethelberht ii eadberht i and alric kent in late seventh century thumb right 250px kingdoms of britain in late seventh century dominant force in late seventh century politics south of river humber was wulfhere of mercia who reigned from late 650s to 675 king of kent for much of this time was ecgberht who died in 673 ecgberht s sons eadric and wihtred were probably little more than infants two or three years old when their father died wulfhere was their uncle by virtue of his marriage to eormenhild ecgberht s sister hlothhere ecgberht s brother became king of kent but not until about a year later in 674 and it may be that wulfhere opposed accession of hlothhere and was effective ruler of kent during this year long interregnum kirby earliest english kings p 115 eadric raised an army against his uncle and hlothhere died of wounds sustained in battle in february 685 or possibly 686 kirby earliest english kings p 118 eadric died following year and according to bede whose ecclesiastical history of english people is one of primary sources for this period kingdom fell apart into disorder bede ecclesiastical history iv 26 p 255 caedwalla of wessex invaded in 686 and established his brother mul as king there caedwalla may have ruled kent directly for a period when mul was killed in 687 kirby earliest english kings pp 120 121 when caedwalla departed for rome in 688 oswine who was probably supported by aethelred of mercia took throne for a time oswine lost power in 690 but swaefheard son of sebbi king of essex who had been a king in kent for a year or two remained kirby earliest english kings pp 122 123 there is clear evidence that both swaefheard and oswine were kings at same time as each witnessed other s charters it seems that oswine was king of east kent which was usually position of dominant king while swaefheard was king of west kent yorke kings and kingdoms p 32 accession and reign thumb 300px left family tree showing descendants of eadbald wihtred through his father egbert is of eorcenberht s line oswine s descent was probably through one of eafe s siblings but which one is not known wihtred emerged from this disarray and became king in early 690s bede describes his accession by saying that he was rightful king and that he freed nation from foreign invasion by his devotion and diligence oswine was also of royal family and arguably had a claim to throne hence it has been suggested that bede s comments here are strongly partisan bede s correspondent on kentish affairs was albinus abbot of monastery of st peter and st paul subsequently renamed st augustine s in canterbury and these views can almost certainly be ascribed to church establishment there kirby earliest english kings p 53 stenton anglo saxon england p 182 yorke kings and kingdoms p 25 two charters provide evidence of wihtred s date of accession one dated april 697 indicates wihtred was then in sixth year of his rule so his accession can be dated to some time between april 691 and april 692 another dated 17 july 694 is in his fourth regnal year giving a possible range of july 690 to july 691 overlap in date ranges gives april to july 691 as likely date of his accession note that kirby uses s18 in his argument for wihtred s accession date whereas whitelock uses s15 see kirby earliest english kings p 123 and whitelock english historical documents p 361 another estimate of date of wihtred s accession can be made from duration of his reign given by bede as thirty four and a half years he died on 23 april 725 which would imply an accession date in late 690 bede ecclesiastical history v 23 p 322 325 initially wihtred ruled alongside swaefheard bede s report of election of as archbishop of canterbury in july 692 mentions that swaefheard and wihtred were kings of kent but swaefheard is not heard of after this date it appears that by 694 wihtred was sole ruler of kent though it may also be that his son aethelberht was a junior king in west kent during wihtred s reign yorke kings and kingdoms p 33 wihtred is thought to have had three wives his first was called cynegyth but a charter of 696 names as royal consort and co donor of an estate former spouse must have died or been dismissed after a short time near end of his reign a new wife attested with her husband and son alric kelly wihtred charter of 716 which recorded a synod at in kent is regarded as spurious but is thought to have used genuine witness lists it was also in 694 that wihtred made peace with west saxon king ine ine s predecessor caedwalla had invaded kent and installed his brother mul as king but had subsequently revolted and burned mul wihtred agreed compensation for killing but amount paid to ine is uncertain most manuscripts of anglo saxon chronicle record thirty thousand and some specify thirty thousand pounds if pounds are equal to then this amount is equal of a king s wergild that is legal valuation of a man s life according to his rank swanton anglo saxon chronicle 40 41 note 3 lapidge michael ed wergild in blackwell encyclopedia of anglo saxon england p 469 it seems likely that wihtred ceded some border territory to ine as part of this settlement kirby earliest english kings p 124 laws thumb 200px right first page of twelfth century manuscript known as textus roffensis which contains oldest surviving copy of wihtred s law code earliest anglo saxon law code to survive which may date from 602 or 603 is that of aethelberht of kent whose reign ended in 616 whitelock english historical documents p 357 in 670s or 680s a code was issued in names of hlothhere and eadric of kent next kings to issue laws were ine of wessex and wihtred whitelock english historical documents pp 327 337 dating of wihtred s and ine s laws is somewhat uncertain but there is reason to believe that wihtred s laws were issued on 6 september 695 whitelock english historical documents p 361 while ine s laws were written in 694 or shortly before stenton anglo saxon england p 72 ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with wihtred over compensation for death of mul and there are indications that two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws in addition to coincidence of timing there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes law is chapter 20 in ine s code and chapter 28 in wihtred s ine s version reads if a man from a distance or a foreigner goes through wood off track and does not shout nor blow a horn he is to be assumed to be a thief to be either killed or redeemed wihtred s version is if a man from a distance or a foreigner goes off track and he neither shouts nor blows a horn he is to be assumed to be a thief to be either killed or redeemed see whitelock english historical documents pp 364 366 another sign of collaboration is that wihtred s laws use a west saxon term for noble in place of kentish term it is possible that ine and wihtred issued law codes as an act of prestige to re establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms kirby earliest english kings p 125 wihtred s laws were issued at it is not known for certain where this was but best candidate is bearsted near maidstone laws are primarily concerned with religious affairs only last four of its twenty eight chapters do not deal with ecclesiastical affairs first clause of code gives church freedom from taxation subsequent clauses specify penalties for irregular marriages heathen worship work on sabbath and breaking fasts among other things and also define how members of each class of society such as king bishops priests and can clear themselves by giving an oath whitelock english historical documents pp 362 364 in addition to focus of laws themselves introduction makes clear importance of church in legislative process archbishop of canterbury was present at assembly which devised decrees and so was bishop of rochester and every order of church of that nation spoke in unanimity with loyal people kirby earliest english kings p 2 privileges given to church are notable in addition to freedom from taxation oath of a bishop is incontrovertible which places it at same level as oath of a king and church receives same level of compensation for violence done to dependents as does king this has led one historian to describe church s power less than a century after original roman mission landed in kent as all but co ordinate with king himself in kentish state stenton anglo saxon england p 62 and it has also been described as presupposing a frightening degree of royal power wormald patrick age of bede and aethelbald in campbell anglo saxons p 99 however presence of clauses that provide penalties for any of wihtred s subjects who sacrifice to devils makes it clear that although christianity was dominant older pagan beliefs of population had by no means died out completely stenton anglo saxon england p 128 clause 21 of code specifies that a must find three men of his own class to be his oath helpers an oath helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man to clear him from suspicion of crime laws of ine were more stringent than this requiring that a high ranking person must be found to be an oath helper for everyone no matter what class they were from two laws taken together imply a significant weakening of an earlier state in which a man s kin were legally responsible for him stenton anglo saxon england pp 316 317 death and succession on his death wihtred left kent to his three sons aethelberht ii eadberht i and alric chronology of reigns following wihtred is unclear although there is evidence of both an aethelbert and at least one eadbert in following years yorke kings and kingdoms p 30 31 after wihtred s death and departure of ine of wessex for rome following year aethelbald of mercia became dominant power in south of england kirby earliest english kings p 131 see also list of monarchs of kent notes
