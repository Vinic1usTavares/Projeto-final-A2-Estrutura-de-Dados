tuatara are reptiles endemic to new zealand although resembling most lizards they are part of a distinct lineage order rhynchocephalia their name derives from maori language and means peaks on back single species of tuatara is only surviving member of its order which flourished around 200 million years ago their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with squamates lizards and snakes for this reason tuatara are of interest in study of evolution of lizards and snakes and for reconstruction of appearance and habits of earliest diapsids a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs birds and crocodilians tuatara are greenish brown and grey and measure up to from head to tail tip and weigh up to with a spiny crest along back especially pronounced in males they have two rows of teeth in upper jaw overlapping one row on lower jaw which is unique among living species they are also unusual in having a pronounced photoreceptive eye third eye which is thought to be involved in setting circadian and seasonal cycles they are able to hear although no external ear is present and have unique features in their skeleton some of them apparently evolutionarily retained from fish tuatara are sometimes referred to as living fossils which has generated significant scientific debate while mapping its genome researchers have discovered that species has between 5 and 6 billion base pairs of dna sequence nearly twice that of humans tuatara sphenodon punctatus has been protected by law since 1895 a second species brothers island tuatara s guntheri was recognised in 1989 but since 2009 it has been reclassified as a subspecies s p guntheri tuatara like many of new zealand s native animals are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators such as polynesian rat rattus exulans tuatara were extinct on mainland with remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands until first north island release into heavily fenced and monitored karori sanctuary in 2005 during routine maintenance work at karori sanctuary in late 2008 a tuatara nest was uncovered new zealand s living fossil confirmed as nesting on mainland for first

successfully breeding in wild on new zealand s north island in over 200 years taxonomy and evolution tuatara along with other now extinct members of order sphenodontia belong to superorder lepidosauria only surviving taxon within lepidosauromorpha squamates and tuatara both show caudal loss of tail tip when threatened and have transverse cloacal slits cree alison 2002 tuatara in halliday tim and adler kraig eds new encyclopedia of reptiles and amphibians oxford university press oxford pp 210 211 origin of tuatara probably lies close to split between lepidosauromorpha and though tuatara resemble lizards similarity is superficial because family has several characteristics unique among reptiles typical lizard shape is very common for early amniotes oldest known fossil of

paraphyletic branch lengths do not indicate divergence times tuatara were originally classified as lizards in 1831 when british museum received a skull genus remained misclassified until 1867 when albert gunther of british museum noted features similar to birds turtles and crocodiles he proposed order rhynchocephalia meaning beak head for tuatara and its fossil relatives many related species were subsequently added to rhynchocephalia resulting in what taxonomists call a wastebasket taxon williston proposed sphenodontia to include only tuatara and their closest fossil relatives in 1925 sphenodon is derived from greek for wedge sphenos sphenos and tooth odontos odontos tuatara have been referred to as living fossils which means that they retain many basal characteristics from around time of squamate rhynchocephalian split 220 mya morphometric analyses of variation in jaw morphology among tuatara and extinct rhynchocephalian relatives have been argued to demonstrate morphological conservatism and support for classification of tuatara as a living fossil but reliability of these results has been criticised and debated taxonomic research on sphenodontia indicates that group has undergone a variety of changes throughout mesozoic and rate of molecular evolution for tuatara has been estimated to be among fastest of any animal yet examined many of niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians there was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as which differed markedly from living tuatara tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on islands of new zealand these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their ancestors lived in much warmer climates of mesozoic for instance appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to modern tuatara a species of is known from miocene saint fauna whether it is referable to sphenodon proper is not entirely clear but is assumed to be closely related to tuatara species while there is currently considered to be only one living species of tuatara two species were previously identified sphenodon punctatus or northern tuatara and much rarer sphenodon guntheri or brothers island tuatara which is confined to north brother island in cook strait specific name punctatus is latin for spotted and guntheri refers to german born british herpetologist albert gunther beolens bo watkins michael grayson michael 2011 eponym dictionary of reptiles baltimore johns hopkins university press xiii 296 pp sphenodon guntheri pp 110 111 a 2009 paper re examined genetic bases used to distinguish two supposed species of tuatara and concluded they only represent geographic variants and only one species should be recognized consequently northern tuatara was re classified as sphenodon punctatus punctatus and brothers island tuatara as sphenodon punctatus guntheri individuals from brothers island could also not be distinguished from other modern and fossil samples based on jaw morphology brothers island tuatara has olive brown skin with yellowish patches while colour of northern tuatara ranges from olive green through grey to dark pink or brick red often mottled and always with white spots in addition brothers island tuatara is considerably smaller gill brian whitaker tony 1996 new zealand frogs and reptiles david bateman publishing pp 22 24 an extinct species of

over its lifetime tuatara shed their skin at least once per year as adults and three or four times a year as juveniles tuatara sexes differ in more than size spiny crest on a tuatara s back made of triangular soft folds of skin is larger in males and can be stiffened for display male abdomen is narrower than female s thumb upright 1 2 left skull of a tuatara showing complete temporal arches and individual bones 1 premaxilla 2 nasal 3 prefrontal 4 frontal 5 maxilla 6 7 dentary 8 postorbital 9 jugal 10 parietal 11 squamosal 12 quadrate skull in course of evolution skull has been modified in most diapsids from original version evident in fossil record however all original features are preserved in that of tuatara it has two openings a temporal fenestra on each side of skull with complete arches in addition upper jaw is firmly attached to skull this makes for a very rigid inflexible construction turtles and tortoises have skulls they lack any temporal fenestrae are sometimes considered to be most primitive among amniotes though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost temporal openings rather than never having had them tip of upper jaw is beak like and separated from remainder of jaw by a notch there is a single row of teeth in lower jaw and a double row in upper with bottom row fitting perfectly between two upper rows when mouth is closed this specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws their arrangement and function is different from tuatara s jaws joined by ligament chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action force of bite is suitable for shearing chitin and bone fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago tuatara s teeth are not replaced since they are not separate structures like real teeth but sharp projections of jaw bone as their teeth wear down older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms larvae and slugs and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones brain of sphenodon fills only half of volume of its endocranium this proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils however proportion of tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to same proportion in mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume in endocranium larsson 2001 endocranial anatomy of carcharodontosaurus

both day and night vision and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto retina to enhance vision in dark there is also a third eyelid on each eye nictitating membrane tuatara has a third eye on top of its head called parietal eye it has its own lens a parietal plug which resembles a cornea retina with rod like structures and degenerated nerve connection to brain parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings which have a translucent patch at top centre of skull after four to six months it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment its purpose is unknown but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin d as well as to determine light dark cycles and help with thermoregulation of all extant tetrapods parietal eye is most pronounced in tuatara it is part of pineal complex another part of which is pineal gland which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light and thus determine position of sun even under cloud cover aiding navigation halliday tim r 2002 salamanders and newts finding breeding ponds in halliday tim and adler kraig eds new encyclopedia of reptiles and amphibians oxford university press oxford p 52 together with turtles tuatara has most primitive hearing organs among amniotes there is no eardrum and no and middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue mostly adipose fatty tissue stapes comes into contact with quadrate which is immovable as well as hyoid and squamosal hair cells are unspecialised innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres and respond only to low frequencies though hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800 hz with peak sensitivity of 40 db at 200 hz spine and ribs tuatara spine is made up of hourglass shaped amphicoelous vertebrae concave both before and behind this is usual condition of fish vertebrae and some amphibians but is unique to tuatara within amniotes tuatara has gastralia rib like bones also called gastric or abdominal ribs presumed ancestral trait of diapsids they are found in some lizards where they are mostly made of cartilage as well as crocodiles and tuatara and are not attached to spine or thoracic ribs true ribs are small projections with small hooked bones called uncinate processes found on rear of each rib this feature is also present in birds tuatara is only living tetrapod with well developed gastralia and uncinate processes in early tetrapods gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes together with bony elements such as bony plates in skin osteoderms and clavicles collar bone would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around body protecting belly and helping to hold in guts and inner organs these anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before vertebrates ventured onto land gastralia may have been involved in breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards as is case with other parts of internal anatomy and its scales tail and back spiny plates on back and tail of tuatara resemble those of a crocodile more than a lizard but tuatara shares with lizards ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator and then regenerate it regrowth takes a long time and differs from that of lizards well illustrated reports on tail regeneration in tuatara have been published by meyer age determination currently there are two means of determining age of tuatara using microscopic inspection hematoxylinophilic rings can be identified and counted in both phalanges and femur phalangeal hematoxylinophilic rings can be used for tuatara up to 12 14 years of age as they cease to form around this age femoral rings follow a similar trend however they are useful for tuatara up to 25 35 years of age around that age femoral rings cease to form further research on age determination methods for tuatara is required as tuatara have lifespans much longer than 35 years one possibility could be via examination of tooth wear and tear as tuatara have fused sets of teeth behaviour adult tuatara are terrestrial and nocturnal reptiles though they will often bask in sun to warm their bodies hatchlings hide under logs and stones and are diurnal likely because adults are cannibalistic tuatara thrive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles and hibernate during winter they remain active at temperatures as low as while temperatures over are generally fatal optimal body temperature for tuatara is from lowest of any reptile body temperature of tuatara is lower than that of other reptiles ranging from over a day whereas most reptiles have body temperatures around low body temperature results in a slower metabolism burrowing seabirds such as petrels prions and shearwaters share tuatara s island habitat during birds nesting seasons tuatara use birds burrows for shelter when available or dig their own seabirds guano helps to maintain invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey including beetles crickets and spiders their diets also consist of frogs lizards and bird s eggs and chicks in total darkness no feeding attempt whatsoever was observed and lowest light intensity at which an attempt to snatch a beetle was observed occurred under 0 0125 lux eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids tuatara of both sexes defend territories and will threaten and eventually bite intruders bite can cause serious injury daugherty charles and keall susan tuatara life history in te ara encyclopedia of new zealand tuatara will bite when approached and will not let go easily reproduction thumb upright left a male tuatara named henry living at southland museum and art gallery is still reproductively active at 111 years of age tuatara reproduce very slowly taking 10 to 20 years to reach sexual maturity mating occurs in midsummer females mate and lay eggs once every four years during courtship a male makes his skin darker raises his crests and parades toward female he slowly walks in circles around female with stiffened legs female will either submit and allow male to mount her or retreat to her burrow males do not have a penis they reproduce by male lifting tail of female and placing his vent over hers sperm is then transferred into female much like mating process in birds along with birds tuatara is one of only members of amniota to have lost ancestral penis thumb right tuatara juvenile sphenodon punctatus tuatara eggs have a soft parchment like 0 2 mm thick shell that consists of calcite crystals embedded in a matrix of fibrous layers it takes females between one and three years to provide eggs with yolk and up to seven months to form shell it then takes between 12 and 15 months from copulation to hatching this means reproduction occurs at two to five year intervals slowest in any reptile wild tuatara are known to be still reproducing at about 60 years of age henry a male tuatara at southland museum in invercargill new zealand became a father possibly for first time on 23 january 2009 at age of 111 sex of a hatchling depends on temperature of egg with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuatara and cooler eggs producing females eggs incubated at have an equal chance of being male or female however at 80 are likely to be males and at 80 are likely to be females at all hatchlings will be females some evidence indicates sex determination in tuatara is determined by both genetic and environmental factors tuatara probably have slowest growth rates of any reptile continuing to grow larger for first 35 years of their lives average lifespan is about 60 years but they can live to be well over 100 years old one such male even reproduced successfully for first time at 111 years of age with an 80 year old female some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years conservation distribution and threats tuatara were once widespread on new zealand s main north and south islands where subfossil remains have been found in sand dunes caves and maori middens wiped out from main islands before european settlement they were long confined to 32 offshore islands free of mammals islands are difficult to get to and are colonised by few animal species indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from mainland however polynesian rats had recently become established on several of islands and tuatara were persisting but not breeding on these islands crook i g 1973 tuatara sphenodon punctatus gray on islands with and without populations of polynesian rat rattus exulans peale proceedings of new zealand ecological society 20 115 120 additionally tuatara were much rarer on rat inhabited islands prior to conservation work 25 of distinct tuatara populations had become extinct in past century recent discovery of a tuatara hatchling on mainland indicates that attempts to re establish a breeding population on new zealand mainland have had some success total population of tuatara is estimated to be greater than 60 000 but less than 100 000 daugherty charles and keall susan tuatara tuatara islands in te ara encyclopedia of new zealand eradication of rats tuatara were removed from stanley red mercury and cuvier islands in 1990 and 1991 and maintained in captivity to allow polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands all three populations bred in captivity and after successful eradication of rats all individuals including new juveniles were returned to their islands of origin in 1991 92 season little barrier island was found to hold only eight tuatara which were taken into in situ captivity where females produced 42 eggs which were incubated at victoria university resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on island then released into wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there in hen and chicken islands polynesian rats were eradicated on in 1993 lady alice island in 1994 and island in 1997 following this program juveniles have once again been seen on latter three islands in contrast rats persist on hen island of same group and no juvenile tuatara have been seen there as of 2001 in alderman islands middle chain island holds no tuatara but it is considered possible for rats to swim between middle chain and other islands that do hold tuatara and rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this another rodent eradication was carried out on islands east of d urville island to prepare for release of 432 cook strait tuatara juveniles in 2004 which were being raised at victoria university as of 2001 thumb right upright tuatara at karori sanctuary are given coloured markings on head for identification brothers island tuatara sphenodon guntheri is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400 in 1995 50 juvenile and 18 adult brothers island tuatara were moved to titi island in cook strait and their establishment monitored two years later more than half of animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight in 1998 34 juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild caught adults were similarly transferred to somes island a more publicly accessible location in wellington harbour captive juveniles were from induced from wild females in late october 2007 50 tuatara collected as eggs from north brother island and hatched at victoria university were being released onto long island in outer marlborough sounds animals had been cared for at wellington zoo for last five years and have been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure at zoo off display there is another out of country population of brothers island tuatara that was given to san diego zoological society and is housed off display at san diego zoo facility in balboa no successful reproductive efforts have been reported yet northern tuatara sphenodon punctatus naturally occurs on 29 islands and its population is estimated to be over 60 000 individuals in 1996 32 adult northern tuatara were moved from island to moutohora carrying capacity of moutohora is estimated at 8 500 individuals and island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara in 2003 60 northern tuatara were introduced to tiritiri matangi island from middle island in mercury group they are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to island translocated reptiles part 4 tiritiri matangi an education resource for schools department of conservation november 2007 a mainland release of s punctatus occurred in 2005 in heavily fenced and monitored karori sanctuary second mainland release took place in october 2007 when a further 130 were transferred from stephens island to karori sanctuary in early 2009 first recorded wild born offspring were observed captive breeding first successful breeding of tuatara in captivity is believed to have achieved by sir algernon thomas at either his university offices or residence in symonds street in late 1880s or his new home in mount eden in early 1890s several tuatara breeding programmes are active in new zealand southland museum and art gallery in invercargill was first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme they breed s punctatus hamilton zoo auckland zoo and wellington zoo also breed tuatara for release into wild at auckland zoo in 1990s it was discovered that temperature at which eggs are incubated determines sex of animal victoria university of wellington maintains a research programme into captive breeding of tuatara and mount bruce wildlife centre keeps a pair and a juvenile trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at one notable captive breeding success story took place in january 2009 when all 11 eggs belonging to 110 year old tuatara henry and 80 year old tuatara mildred hatched this story is especially remarkable as henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed in january 2016 chester zoo england announced that they succeeded in breeding tuatara in captivity for first time outside its homeland cultural significance tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends and are held as ariki god forms tuatara are regarded as messengers of whiro god of death and disaster and maori women are forbidden to eat them tuatara also indicate tapu borders of what is sacred and restricted beyond which there is mana meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed maori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards some of which may represent tuatara near their genitals today tuatara are regarded as a taonga special treasure tuatara was featured on one side of new zealand five cent coin which was phased out in october 2006 tuatara was also name of journal of biological society of victoria university college and subsequently victoria university of wellington published from 1947 until 1993 it has now been digitised by new zealand electronic text centre also at victoria in popular culture
