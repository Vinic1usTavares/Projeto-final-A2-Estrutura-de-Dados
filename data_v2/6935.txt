gilgamesh was a historical king of sumerian city state of uruk a major hero in ancient mesopotamian mythology and protagonist of epic of gilgamesh an epic poem written in akkadian during late second millennium bc he probably ruled sometime between 2800 and 2500 bc and was posthumously deified he became a major figure in sumerian legends during third dynasty of ur 2112 2004 bc tales of gilgamesh s legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving sumerian poems earliest of these is probably gilgamesh enkidu and netherworld in which gilgamesh comes to aid of goddess inanna and drives away creatures infesting her huluppu tree she gives him two unknown objects called a mikku and a pikku which he loses after enkidu s death his shade tells gilgamesh about bleak conditions in underworld poem gilgamesh and agga describes gilgamesh s revolt against his overlord king agga other sumerian poems relate gilgamesh s defeat of ogre huwawa and bull of heaven and a fifth poorly preserved one apparently describes his death and funeral in later babylonian times these stories began to be woven into a connected narrative standard akkadian epic of gilgamesh was composed by a scribe named sin leqi unninni probably during middle babylonian period 1600 1155 bc based on much older source material in epic gilgamesh is a demigod of superhuman strength who befriends wildman enkidu together they go on adventures defeating humbaba east semitic name for huwawa and bull of heaven who in epic is sent to attack them by ishtar east semitic equivalent of inanna after gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort after enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from gods gilgamesh becomes afraid of his own death and visits sage utnapishtim survivor of great flood hoping to find immortality gilgamesh repeatedly fails trials set before him and returns home to uruk realizing that immortality is beyond his reach most classical historians agree that epic of gilgamesh exerted substantial influence on both iliad and odyssey two epic poems written in ancient greek during eighth century bc story of gilgamesh s birth is described in a second century ad anecdote from on nature of animals by greek writer aelian aelian relates that gilgamesh s grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant because he had been told by an oracle that his grandson would overthrow him she became pregnant and guards threw child off a tower but an eagle rescued him mid fall and delivered him safely to an orchard where he was raised by gardener epic of gilgamesh was rediscovered in library of ashurbanipal in 1849 after being translated in early 1870s it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and hebrew bible gilgamesh remained mostly obscure until mid twentieth century but since late twentieth century he has become an increasingly prominent figure in modern culture historical king most historians generally agree that gilgamesh was a historical king of sumerian city state of uruk who probably ruled sometime during early part of early dynastic period 2900 2350 bc stephanie dalley a scholar of ancient near east states that precise dates cannot be given for lifetime of gilgamesh but they are generally agreed to lie between 2800 and 2500 bc no contemporary mention of gilgamesh has yet been discovered but 1955 discovery of tummal inscription a thirty four line historiographic text written during reign of ishbi erra 1953 1920 bc has cast considerable light on his reign inscription credits gilgamesh with building walls of uruk lines eleven through fifteen of inscription read for a second time tummal fell into ruin gilgamesh built of house of enlil ur lugal son of gilgamesh made tummal pre eminent brought ninlil to tummal gilgamesh is also referred to as a king by king of kish a known historical figure who may have lived near gilgamesh s lifetime furthermore gilgamesh is listed as one of kings of uruk by sumerian king list fragments of an epic text found in me turan modern tell haddad relate that at end of his life gilgamesh was buried under river bed people of uruk diverted flow of euphrates passing uruk for purpose of burying dead king within river bed deification and legendary exploits sumerian poems thumb upright 1 5 akkadian cylinder seal impression from girsu 2340 2150 bc

hands a mace like object to a goddess thumb indus valley civilization seal with master of animals motif of a man fighting two lions 2500 1500 bc similar to sumerian gilgamesh motif an indicator of indus mesopotamia relations it is certain that during later early dynastic period gilgamesh was worshipped as a god at various locations across sumer in twenty first century bc utu king of uruk adopted gilgamesh as his patron deity kings of third dynasty of ur 2112 2004 bc were especially fond of gilgamesh calling him their divine brother and friend king shulgi of ur 2029 1982 bc declared himself son of and and brother of gilgamesh over centuries there may have been a gradual accretion of stories about gilgamesh some possibly derived from real lives of other historical figures such as gudea second dynasty ruler of lagash 2144 2124 bc prayers inscribed in clay tablets address gilgamesh as a judge of dead in underworld during this period a large number of myths and legends developed surrounding gilgamesh five independent sumerian poems narrating various exploits of gilgamesh have survived to present gilgamesh s first appearance in literature is probably in sumerian poem gilgamesh enkidu and netherworld etcsl 1 8 1 4 narrative begins with a huluppu tree perhaps according to samuel noah kramer a willow growing on banks of river euphrates goddess inanna moves tree to her garden in uruk with intention to carve it into a throne once it is fully grown tree grows and matures but serpent who knows no charm anzu bird and lilitu sumerian forerunner to lilith of jewish folklore all take up residence within tree causing inanna to cry with sorrow gilgamesh who in this story is portrayed as inanna s brother comes along and slays serpent causing anzu bird and lilitu to flee gilgamesh s companions chop down tree and carve its wood into a bed and a throne which they give to inanna inanna responds by fashioning a pikku and a mikku probably a drum and drumsticks respectively although exact identifications are uncertain which she gives to gilgamesh as a reward for his heroism gilgamesh loses pikku and mikku and asks who will retrieve them enkidu descends to underworld to find them but disobeys strict laws of underworld and is therefore required to remain there forever remaining portion of poem is a dialogue in which gilgamesh asks shade of enkidu questions about underworld gilgamesh and agga describes gilgamesh s successful revolt against his overlord agga king of city state of kish etcsl 1 8 1 1 gilgamesh and huwawa describes how gilgamesh and his servant enkidu aided by help of fifty volunteers from uruk defeat monster huwawa an ogre appointed by god enlil ruler of gods as guardian of cedar forest etcsl 1 8 1 5 in gilgamesh and bull of heaven gilgamesh and enkidu slay bull of heaven who has been sent to attack them by goddess inanna etcsl 1 8 1 2 plot of this poem differs substantially from corresponding scene in later akkadian epic of gilgamesh in sumerian poem inanna does not seem to ask gilgamesh to become her consort as she does in later akkadian epic furthermore while she is coercing her father an to give her bull of heaven rather than threatening to raise dead to eat living as she does in later epic she merely threatens to let out a cry that will reach earth a poem known as death of gilgamesh is very poorly preserved etcsl 1 8 1 3 but appears to describe a major state funeral followed by arrival of deceased in underworld it is possible that modern scholars who gave poem its title may have misinterpreted it and poem may actually be about death of enkidu epic of gilgamesh eventually according to kramer gilgamesh became hero par excellence of ancient world an adventurous brave but tragic figure symbolizing man s vain but endless drive for fame glory and immortality by old babylonian period 1830 1531 bc stories of gilgamesh s legendary exploits had been woven into one or several long epics epic of gilgamesh most complete account of gilgamesh s adventures was composed in akkadian during middle babylonian period 1600 1155 bc by a scribe named sin leqi unninni most complete surviving version of epic of gilgamesh is recorded on a set of twelve clay tablets dating to seventh century bc found in library of ashurbanipal in assyrian capital of nineveh epic survives only in a fragmentary form with many pieces of it missing or damaged some scholars and translators choose to supplement missing parts of epic with material from earlier sumerian poems or from other versions of epic of gilgamesh found at other sites throughout near east right thumb tablet v of epic of gilgamesh museum iraq in epic gilgamesh is introduced as two thirds divine and one third mortal at beginning of poem gilgamesh is described as a brutal oppressive ruler this is usually interpreted to mean either that he compels all his subjects to engage in forced labor or that he sexually oppresses all his subjects as punishment for gilgamesh s cruelty god anu creates wildman enkidu after being tamed by a prostitute named enkidu travels to uruk to confront gilgamesh in second tablet two men wrestle and although gilgamesh wins match in end he is so impressed by his opponent s strength and tenacity that they become close friends in earlier sumerian texts enkidu is gilgamesh s servant but in epic of gilgamesh they are companions of equal standing in tablets iii through iv gilgamesh and enkidu travel to cedar forest which is guarded by humbaba akkadian name for huwawa heroes cross seven mountains to cedar forest where they begin chopping down trees confronted by humbaba gilgamesh panics and prays to shamash east semitic name for utu who blows eight winds in humbaba s eyes blinding him humbaba begs for mercy but heroes decapitate him regardless tablet vi begins with gilgamesh returning to uruk where ishtar akkadian name for inanna comes to him and demands him to become her consort gilgamesh repudiates her insisting that she has mistreated all her former lovers in revenge ishtar goes to her father anu and demands that he give her bull of heaven which she sends to attack gilgamesh gilgamesh and enkidu kill bull and offer its heart to shamash while gilgamesh and enkidu are resting ishtar stands up on walls of uruk and curses gilgamesh enkidu tears off bull s right thigh and throws it in ishtar s face saying if i could lay my hands on you it is this i should do to you and lash your entrails to your side ishtar calls together crimped courtesans prostitutes and harlots and orders them to mourn for bull of heaven meanwhile gilgamesh holds a celebration over bull of heaven s defeat tablet vii begins with enkidu recounting a dream in which he saw anu ea and shamash declare that either gilgamesh or enkidu must die as punishment for having slain bull of heaven they choose enkidu and enkidu soon grows sick he has a dream of underworld and then he dies tablet viii describes gilgamesh s inconsolable grief over his friend s death and details of enkidu s funeral tablets ix through xi relate how gilgamesh driven by grief and fear of his own mortality travels a great distance and overcomes many obstacles to find home of utnapishtim sole survivor of great flood who was rewarded with immortality by gods thumb upright 1 3 left early middle assyrian cylinder seal impression dating between 1400 and 1200 bc showing a man with bird wings and a scorpion tail firing an arrow at a griffin on a hillock a scorpion man is among creatures gilgamesh encounters on his journey to homeland of utnapishtim journey to utnapishtim involves a series of episodic challenges which probably originated as major independent adventures but in epic they are reduced to what joseph eddy fontenrose calls fairly harmless incidents first gilgamesh encounters and slays lions in mountain pass upon reaching mountain of mashu gilgamesh encounters a scorpion man and his wife their bodies flash with terrifying radiance but once gilgamesh tells them his purpose they allow him to pass gilgamesh wanders through darkness for twelve days before he finally comes into light he finds a beautiful garden by sea in which he meets siduri divine barmaid at first she tries to prevent gilgamesh from entering garden but later she instead attempts to persuade him to accept death as inevitable and not journey beyond waters when gilgamesh refuses to do this she directs him to urshanabi ferryman of gods who ferries gilgamesh across sea to utnapishtim s homeland when gilgamesh finally arrives at utnapishtim s home utnapishtim tells gilgamesh that to become immortal he must defy sleep gilgamesh fails to do this and falls asleep for seven days without waking next utnapishtim tells him that even if he cannot obtain immortality he can restore his youth using a plant with power of rejuvenation gilgamesh takes plant but leaves it on shore while swimming and a snake steals it explaining why snakes are able to shed their skins despondent at this loss gilgamesh returns to uruk and shows his city to ferryman urshanabi it is at that this point that epic stops being a coherent narrative tablet xii is an appendix corresponding to sumerian poem of gilgamesh enkidu and netherworld describing loss of pikku and mikku numerous elements within this narrative reveal lack of continuity with earlier portions of epic at beginning of tablet xii enkidu is still alive despite having previously died in tablet vii and gilgamesh is kind to ishtar despite violent rivalry between them displayed in tablet vi also while most of parts of epic are free adaptations of their respective sumerian predecessors tablet xii is a literal word for word translation of last part of gilgamesh enkidu and netherworld for these reasons scholars conclude this narrative was probably relegated to end of epic because it did not fit larger narrative in it gilgamesh sees a vision of enkidu s ghost who promises to recover lost items and describes to his friend abysmal condition of underworld in mesopotamian art although stories about gilgamesh were wildly popular throughout ancient mesopotamia authentic representations of him in ancient art are extremely rare popular works often identify depictions of a hero with long hair containing four or six curls as representations of gilgamesh but this identification is known to be incorrect a few genuine ancient mesopotamian representations of gilgamesh do exist however these representations are mostly found on clay plaques and cylinder seals generally it is only possible to identify a figure shown in art as gilgamesh if artistic work in question clearly depicts a scene from epic of gilgamesh itself one set of representations of gilgamesh is found in scenes of two heroes fighting a demonic giant certainly humbaba another set is found in scenes showing a similar pair of heroes confronting a giant winged bull certainly bull of heaven later influence in antiquity thumb upright 1 3 episode involving odysseus s confrontation with polyphemus in odyssey shown in this seventeenth century painting by guido reni bears similarities to gilgamesh and enkidu s battle with humbaba in epic of gilgamesh epic of gilgamesh exerted substantial influence on iliad and odyssey two epic poems written in ancient greek during eighth century bc according to barry b powell an american classical scholar early greeks were probably exposed to mesopotamian oral traditions through their extensive connections to civilizations of ancient near east and this exposure resulted in similarities that are seen between epic of gilgamesh and homeric epics walter burkert a german classicist observes that scene in tablet vi of epic of gilgamesh in which gilgamesh rejects ishtar s advances and she complains before her mother antu but is mildly rebuked by her father anu is directly paralleled in book v of iliad in this scene aphrodite later greek adaptation of ishtar is wounded by hero diomedes and flees to mount olympus where she cries to her mother dione and is mildly rebuked by her father zeus powell observes that opening lines of odyssey seem to echo opening lines of epic of gilgamesh storyline of odyssey likewise bears numerous similarities to that of epic of gilgamesh both gilgamesh and odysseus encounter a woman who can turn men into animals ishtar for gilgamesh and circe for odysseus in odyssey odysseus blinds a giant cyclops named polyphemus an incident which bears similarities to gilgamesh s slaying of humbaba in epic of gilgamesh both gilgamesh and odysseus visit underworld and both find themselves unhappy whilst living in an otherworldly paradise in presence of an attractive woman siduri for gilgamesh and calypso for odysseus finally both heroes have an opportunity for immortality but miss it gilgamesh when he loses plant and odysseus when he leaves calypso s island in qumran scroll known as book of giants c 100 bc names of gilgamesh and humbaba appear as two of antediluvian giants rendered in form as and this same text was later used in middle east by manichaean sects and arabic form survives as name of a demon according to egyptian cleric al suyuti 1500 story of gilgamesh s birth is not recorded in any extant sumerian or akkadian text but a version of it is described in de natura animalium on nature of animals 12 21 a commonplace book which was written in greek sometime around 200 ad by hellenized roman orator aelian according to aelian s story an oracle told king seuechoros of babylonians that his grandson gilgamos would overthrow him to prevent this seuechoros kept his only daughter under close guard at acropolis of city of babylon but she became pregnant nonetheless fearing king s wrath guards hurled infant off top of a tall tower an eagle rescued boy in midflight and carried him to an orchard where it carefully set him down caretaker of orchard found boy and raised him naming him gilgamos gilgamos eventually gilgamos returned to babylon and overthrew his grandfather proclaiming himself king birth narrative described by aelian is in same tradition as other near eastern birth legends such as those of sargon moses and cyrus theodore bar c ad 600 writing in syriac also mentions a king or as last of a line of twelve kings who were contemporaneous with patriarchs from peleg to abraham this occurrence is also considered a vestige of gilgamesh s former memory modern rediscovery akkadian text of epic of gilgamesh was first discovered in 1849 ad by english archaeologist austen henry layard in library of ashurbanipal at nineveh layard was seeking evidence to confirm historicity of events described in christian old testament which at time was believed to contain oldest texts in world instead his excavations and those of others after him revealed existence of much older mesopotamian texts and showed that many of stories in old testament may actually be derived from earlier myths told throughout ancient near east first translation of epic of gilgamesh was produced in early 1870s by george smith a scholar at british museum who published flood story from tablet xi in 1880 under title chaldean account of genesis gilgamesh s name was originally misread as izdubar early interest in epic of gilgamesh was almost exclusively on account of flood story from tablet xi flood story attracted enormous public attention and drew widespread scholarly controversy while rest of epic was largely ignored most attention towards epic of gilgamesh in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from german speaking countries where controversy raged over relationship between babel und bibel babylon and bible in january 1902 german assyriologist friedrich delitzsch gave a lecture at sing akademie zu berlin in front of kaiser and his wife in which he argued that flood story in book of genesis was directly copied off one in epic of gilgamesh delitzsch s lecture was so controversial that by september 1903 he had managed to collect 1 350 short articles from newspapers and journals over 300 longer ones and twenty eight pamphlets all written in response to this lecture as well as another lecture about relationship between code of hammurabi and law of moses in torah these articles were overwhelmingly critical of delitzsch kaiser distanced himself from delitzsch and his radical views and in fall of 1904 delitzsch was forced to give his third lecture in cologne and frankfurt am main rather than in berlin putative relationship between epic of gilgamesh and hebrew bible later became a major part of delitzsch s argument in his 1920 21 book die grosse great deception that hebrew bible was irredeemably contaminated by babylonian influence and that only by eliminating human old testament entirely could christians finally believe in true aryan message of new testament early modern interpretations thumb left upright 1 1 illustration of izdubar gilgamesh in a scene from book length poem ishtar and izdubar 1884 by leonidas le cenci hamilton first modern literary adaptation of epic of gilgamesh first modern literary adaptation of epic of gilgamesh was ishtar and izdubar 1884 by leonidas le cenci hamilton an american lawyer and businessman hamilton had rudimentary knowledge of akkadian which he had learned from archibald s 1872 assyrian grammar for comparative purposes hamilton s book relied heavily on smith s translation of epic of gilgamesh but also made major changes for instance hamilton omitted famous flood story entirely and instead focused on romantic relationship between ishtar and gilgamesh ishtar and izdubar expanded original roughly 3 000 lines of epic of gilgamesh to roughly 6 000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty eight cantos hamilton significantly altered most of characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in original epic significantly influenced by edward fitzgerald s rubaiyat of omar khayyam and edwin arnold s light of asia hamilton s characters dress more like nineteenth century turks than ancient babylonians hamilton also changed tone of epic from grim realism and ironic tragedy of original to a cheery optimism filled with sweet strains of love and harmony in his 1904 book das alte testament im des alten orients german assyriologist alfred jeremias equated gilgamesh with king nimrod from book of genesis and argued that gilgamesh s strength must come from his hair like hero samson in book of judges and that he must have performed twelve labors like hero heracles in greek mythology in his 1906 book das gilgamesch epos in der orientalist peter jensen declared that epic of gilgamesh was source behind nearly all stories in old testament arguing that moses is gilgamesh of exodus who saves children of israel from precisely same situation faced by inhabitants of at beginning of babylonian epic he then proceeded to argue that abraham isaac samson david and various other biblical figures are all nothing more than exact copies of gilgamesh finally he declared that even jesus is nothing but an israelite gilgamesh nothing but an adjunct to abraham moses and countless other figures in saga this ideology became known as panbabylonianism and was almost immediately rejected by mainstream scholars most stalwart critics of panbabylonianism were those associated with emerging religionsgeschichtliche schule hermann gunkel dismissed most of jensen s purported parallels between gilgamesh and biblical figures as mere baseless sensationalism he concluded that jensen and other assyriologists like him had failed to understand complexities of old testament scholarship and had confused scholars with conspicuous mistakes and remarkable aberrations in english speaking countries prevailing scholarly interpretation during early twentieth century was one originally proposed by sir henry rawlinson 1st baronet which held that gilgamesh is a solar hero whose actions represent movements of sun and that twelve tablets of his epic represent twelve signs of babylonian zodiac german psychologist sigmund freud drawing on theories of james george frazer and paul ehrenreich interpreted gilgamesh and earlier misreading for enkidu as representing man and crude sensuality respectively freud sigmund william mcguire ralph manheim r f c hull alan mcglashan and c g jung freud jung letters correspondence between sigmund freud and c g jung princeton n j princeton university press 1994 at 199 he compared them to other brother figures in world mythology remarking one is always weaker than other and dies sooner in gilgamesh this ages old motif of unequal pair of brothers served to represent relationship between a man and his libido he also saw enkidu as representing placenta weaker twin who dies shortly after birth freud s friend and pupil carl jung frequently discusses gilgamesh in his early work symbole der 1911 1912 he for instance cites ishtar s sexual attraction to gilgamesh as an example of mother s incestuous desire for her son humbaba as an example of an oppressive father figure whom gilgamesh must overcome and gilgamesh himself as an example of a man who forgets his dependence on unconscious and is punished by gods who represent it modern cultural significance thumb left upright 1 3 existential angst during aftermath of world war ii significantly contributed to gilgamesh s rise in popularity in middle of twentieth century for instance german novelist hermann kasack used enkidu s vision of underworld from epic of gilgamesh as a metaphor for bombed out city of hamburg pictured above in his 1947 novel die stadt hinter dem strom in years following world war ii gilgamesh formerly an obscure figure known only by a few scholars gradually became increasingly popular with modern audiences epic of gilgamesh s existential themes made it particularly appealing to german authors in years following war in his 1947 existentialist novel die stadt hinter dem strom german novelist hermann kasack adapted elements of epic into a metaphor for aftermath of destruction of world war ii in germany portraying bombed out city of hamburg as resembling frightening underworld seen by enkidu in his dream in hans henny s magnum opus river without shores 1949 1950 middle section of trilogy centers around a composer whose twenty year long homoerotic relationship with a friend mirrors that of gilgamesh with enkidu and whose masterpiece turns out to be a symphony about gilgamesh quest of gilgamesh a 1953 radio play by douglas geoffrey helped popularize epic in britain in united states charles olson praised epic in his poems and essays and gregory corso believed that it contained ancient virtues capable of curing what he viewed as modern moral degeneracy 1966 novel gilgamesch by guido bachmann became a classic of german queer literature and set a decades long international literary trend of portraying gilgamesh and enkidu as homosexual lovers this trend proved so popular that epic of gilgamesh itself is included in columbia anthology of gay literature 1998 as a major early work of that genre in 1970s and 1980s feminist literary critics analyzed epic of gilgamesh as showing evidence for a transition from original matriarchy of all humanity to modern patriarchy as green movement expanded in europe gilgamesh s story began to be seen through an environmentalist lens with enkidu s death symbolizing man s separation from nature thumb upright 1 3 right a modern statue of gilgamesh stands at university of sydney theodore ziolkowski a scholar of modern literature states that unlike most other figures from myth literature and history gilgamesh has established himself as an autonomous entity or simply a name often independent of epic context in which he originally became known as analogous examples one might think for instance of minotaur or frankenstein s monster epic of gilgamesh has been translated into many major world languages and has become a staple of american world literature classes many contemporary authors and novelists have drawn inspiration from it including an american avant garde theater collective called gilgamesh group and joan london in her novel gilgamesh 2001 great american novel 1973 by philip roth features a character named gil gamesh who is star pitcher of a fictional 1930s baseball team called patriot league believing that he can never lose gil gamesh throws a violent temper tantrum when an umpire goes against him and he is subsequently banished from baseball he flees to soviet union where he is trained as a spy against united states gil gamesh reappears late in novel as one of joseph stalin s spies and gives what american literary historian david damrosch calls an eerily casual description of his interrogation training in soviet russia in 2000 a modern statue of gilgamesh by assyrian sculptor lewis was unveiled at university of sydney in australia starting in late twentieth century epic of gilgamesh began to be read again in iraq saddam hussein former president of iraq had a lifelong fascination with gilgamesh hussein s first novel zabibah and king 2000 is an allegory for gulf war set in ancient assyria that blends elements of epic of gilgamesh and one thousand and one nights like gilgamesh king at beginning of novel
