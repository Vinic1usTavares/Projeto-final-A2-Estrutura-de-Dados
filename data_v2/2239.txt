by a torch brought in by a spectator charles s brother louis duke of orleans charles and another of dancers survived ball was one of a number of events intended to entertain young king who previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity event undermined confidence in charles s capacity to rule parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against more powerful members of nobility public s outrage forced king and his brother orleans whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery to offer penance for event charles s wife isabeau of bavaria held ball to honor remarriage of a lady in waiting scholars believe dance performed at ball had elements of traditional charivari with dancers disguised as wild men mythical beings often associated with demonology that were commonly represented in medieval europe and documented in revels of tudor england event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as monk of st denis and jean froissart and illustrated in a number of 15th century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as master of anthony of burgundy incident later provided inspiration for edgar allan poe s short story hop frog background in 1380 after death of his father charles v of france 12 year old charles vi was crowned king beginning his minority with his four uncles acting as regents three uncles were brothers to charles v louis of anjou philip of burgundy commonly known as philip bold and john of berry louis of bourbon was brother of charles vi s mother jeanne of bourbon see tuchman 1978 1978 367 within two years one of them philip of burgundy described by historian robert knecht as one of most powerful princes in europe qtd in knecht 2007 42 became sole regent to young king after louis of anjou pillaged royal treasury and departed to campaign in italy charles s other two uncles john of berry and louis of bourbon showed little interest in governing in 1387 20 year old charles assumed sole control of monarchy and immediately dismissed his uncles and reinstated marmousets his father s traditional counselors unlike his uncles marmousets wanted peace with england less taxation and a strong responsible central government policies that resulted in a negotiated three year truce with england and duke of berry being stripped of his post as governor of languedoc because of his excessive taxation thumb coronation of charles vi of france depicted by jean fouquet in mid 15th century grandes chroniques de france in 1392 charles suffered first in a lifelong series of attacks of insanity manifested by an insatiable fury at attempted assassination of constable of france and leader of marmousets olivier de clisson carried out by pierre de craon but orchestrated by john iv duke of brittany convinced that attempt on clisson s life was also an act of violence against himself and monarchy charles quickly planned a retaliatory invasion of brittany with approval of marmousets and within months departed paris with a force of knights knecht 2007 42 1978 496 499 on a hot august day outside le mans accompanying his forces on way to brittany without warning charles drew his weapons and charged his own household knights including his brother louis i duke of orleans with whom he had a close relationship crying forward against traitors they wish to deliver me to enemy qtd in tuchman 1978 498 he killed four 1996 173 175 before his chamberlain grabbed him by waist and subdued him after which he fell into a coma that lasted for four days few believed he would recover his uncles dukes of burgundy and berry took advantage of king s illness and quickly seized power re established themselves as regents and dissolved council comatose king was returned to le mans where guillaume de harsigny a venerated and well educated 92 year old physician was summoned to treat him after charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided he was returned to paris by harsigny moving slowly from castle to castle with periods of rest in between late in september charles was well enough to make a pilgrimage of thanks to notre dame de near laon after which he returned again to paris thumb right charles vi attacking his knights from froissart s chronicles king s sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as result of sorcery modern historians such as knecht speculate that charles might have been experiencing onset of paranoid schizophrenia charles continued to be mentally fragile believing he was made of glass and according to historian desmond seward running howling like a wolf down corridors of royal palaces seward 1987 143 contemporary chronicler jean froissart wrote that king s illness was so severe that he was far out of way no medicine could help him qtd in seward 1987 144 during worst of his illness charles was unable to recognize his wife isabeau of bavaria demanding her removal when she entered his chamber but after his recovery charles made arrangements for her to hold guardianship of their children isabeau eventually became guardian to her son future charles vii of france b 1403 granting her

harsigny refusing all pleas and offers of riches to remain tuchman 1978 left paris and ordered courtiers to shield king from duties of government and leadership he told king s advisors to be careful not to worry or irritate him burden him with work as little as you can pleasure and forgetfulness will be better for him than anything else to surround charles with a festive atmosphere and to protect him from rigor of governing court turned to elaborate amusements and extravagant fashions isabeau and her sister in law valentina visconti duchess of orleans wore jewel laden dresses and elaborate braided hairstyles coiled into tall shells and covered with wide double that reportedly required doorways to be widened to accommodate them common people thought extravagances excessive yet loved their young king whom they called charles le bien aime well beloved blame for unnecessary excess and expense was directed at foreign queen who was brought from bavaria at request of charles s uncles neither isabeau nor her sister in law valentina daughter of ruthless duke of milan were well liked by either court or people froissart wrote in his chronicles that charles s uncles were content to allow frivolities because so long as queen and duc d orleans danced they were not dangerous or even annoying qtd in tuchman 1978 503 bal des ardents and aftermath thumb 300px bal des ardents by master

masquerade at hotel saint pol to celebrate third marriage of her lady in waiting catherine de monk of st denis claimed woman had been widowed three times making it her fourth marriage see veenstra 90 tuchman explains that a widow s remarriage was traditionally an occasion for mockery and tomfoolery often celebrated with a charivari characterized by all sorts of licence disguises disorders and loud blaring of discordant music and clanging of cymbals tuchman 1978 503 on suggestion of huguet de guisay whom tuchman describes as well known for his outrageous schemes and cruelty six high ranking knights performed a dance in costume as wood savages costumes which were sewn onto men were made of linen soaked with resin to which flax was attached so that they appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot masks made of same materials covered dancers faces and hid their identities from audience some chronicles report that dancers were bound together by chains most of audience were unaware that charles was among dancers strict orders forbade lighting of hall torches and prohibited anyone from entering hall with a torch during performance to minimize risk of highly flammable costumes catching fire according to historian jan veenstra men and howled like wolves spat obscenities and invited audience to guess their identities while dancing in a diabolical frenzy veenstra 1997 91 charles s brother orleans arrived with phillipe de bar late and drunk and they entered hall carrying lit torches accounts vary but orleans may have held his torch above a dancer s mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell setting fire to dancer s leg in 17th century william prynne wrote of incident that duke of put one of torches his servants held so neere flax that he set one of coates on fire and so each of them set fire on to other and so they were all in a bright flame qtd in mackay 2011 167 whereas a contemporary chronicle stated that he threw torch at one of dancers veenstra 1997 89 91 isabeau knowing that her husband was one of dancers fainted when men caught fire charles however was standing at a distance from other dancers near his 15 year old aunt joan duchess of berry who swiftly threw her voluminous skirt over him to protect him from sparks sources disagree as to whether duchess moved into dance and drew king aside to speak to him or whether king moved away toward audience froissart wrote that king who proceeded ahead of dancers departed from his companions and went to ladies to show himself to them and so passed by queen and came near duchess of berry stock

they burned in their costumes and audience many of them also sustaining burns screamed as they tried to rescue burning men tuchman 1979 503 505 event was chronicled in uncharacteristic vividness by monk of st denis who wrote that four men were burned alive their flaming genitals dropping to floor releasing a stream of blood only two dancers survived king thanks to quick reactions of duchess of berry and sieur de who jumped into an open vat of wine and remained there until flames were extinguished count de died at scene yvain de foix son of gaston count of foix and aimery poitiers son of count of lingered with painful burns for two days instigator of affair huguet de guisay survived a day longer described by tuchman as bitterly cursing and insulting his fellow dancers dead and living until his last hour citizens of paris angered by event and at danger posed to their monarch blamed charles s advisors a great commotion swept through city as populace threatened to depose charles s uncles and kill dissolute and depraved courtiers greatly concerned at popular outcry and worried about a repeat of revolt of previous decade when parisians armed with mallets turned against tax collectors charles s uncles persuaded court to do penance at notre dame cathedral preceded by an apologetic royal progress through city in which king rode on horseback with his uncles walking in humility orleans who was blamed for tragedy donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at celestine monastery tuchman 1978 380 froissart s chronicle of event places blame directly on charles s brother orleans he wrote and thus feast and marriage celebrations ended with such great sorrow charles and isabeau could do nothing to remedy it we must accept that it was no fault of theirs but of duke of orleans qtd in nara 2002 237 orleans reputation was severely damaged by event compounded by an episode a few years earlier in which he was accused of sorcery after hiring an apostate monk to imbue a ring dagger and sword with demonic magic theologian jean petit later testified that orleans practiced sorcery and that fire at dance represented a failed attempt at regicide made in retaliation for charles s attack previous summer veenstra 1997 60 91 95 bal des ardents added to impression of a court steeped in extravagance with a king in delicate health and unable to rule charles s attacks of illness increased in frequency such that by end of 1390s his role was merely ceremonial by early 15th century he was neglected and often forgotten a lack of leadership that contributed to decline and fragmentation of valois dynasty wagner 2006 88 tuchman 1978 515 516 in 1407 philip bold s son john fearless had his cousin orleans assassinated because of vice corruption sorcery and a long list of public and private at same time isabeau was accused of having been mistress of her husband s brother tuchman 1978 516 orleans s assassination pushed country into a civil war between burgundians and known as which lasted for several decades vacuum created by lack of central power and general irresponsibility of french court resulted in it gaining a reputation for lax morals and decadence that endured for more than 200 years tuchman 1978 516 537 538 folkloric and christian representations of wild men thumb left upright wild men or wodewoses depicted by albrecht durer 1499 veenstra writes in magic and divination at courts of burgundy and france that bal des ardents reveals tension between christian beliefs and latent paganism that existed in 14th century society according to him event laid bare a great cultural struggle with past but also became an ominous foreshadowing of future wild men or savages usually depicted carrying staves or clubs living beyond bounds of civilization without shelter or fire lacking feelings and souls were then a metaphor for man without god centerwell 1997 27 28 common superstition held that long haired wild men known as who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals lived in mountainous areas such as pyrenees in some village at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men to represent demons were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits church however considered these rituals pagan and demonic early medieval folk festivals in germany and switzerland included a ritual called expulsion of death often performed on fourth sunday in lent also known as sunday of dead an effigy was killed by burning with fragments scattered on fields as a fertility ritual as early as 8th century in saxony and thuringen in germany a ritual was performed in which a a leaf and moss clad villager representing a wild man was ceremonially hunted and killed chambers 1996 ed 183 185 thumb upright wild men depicted in borders of a late 14th century book of hours veenstra explains that it was believed that by dressing as wild men villagers ritualistically conjured demons by imitating them although at that period forbade a belief in wild men or an imitation of them such as costumed dance at isabeau s event in folkloric rituals burning did not happen literally but in he writes contrary to bal des ardents where seasonal fertility rite had watered down to courtly entertainment but where burning had been promoted to a dreadful reality a 15th century chronicle describes bal des ardents as una corea a dance to ward off devil veenstra 1997 94 because remarriage was often thought to be a sacrilege common belief was that sacrament of marriage extended beyond death it was censured by community thus purpose of bal des ardents was twofold to entertain court and to humiliate and rebuke isabeau s lady in waiting in an inherently pagan manner which monk of st denis seemed to dislike veenstra 1997 92 94 a ritual burning on wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had christian origins as well according to veenstra book of tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by demon asmodeus she is eventually freed of demon by burning of heart and liver of a fish veenstra 1997 67 event also may have served as a symbolic exorcism of charles s mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of court in early 15th century ritual burning of evil demonic or satanic forces was not uncommon as shown by orleans s later persecution of king s physician jehan de bar who was burned to death after confessing under torture to practicing sorcery chronicles death of four members of nobility was sufficiently important to ensure that event was recorded in contemporary chronicles most notably by froissart and monk of st denis and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts while two main chroniclers agree on essential points of evening dancers were dressed as wild men king survived one man fell into a vat and four of dancers died there are discrepancies in details froissart wrote that dancers were chained together which is not mentioned in monk s account furthermore two chroniclers are at odds regarding purpose of dance according to historian susan crane monk describes event as a wild charivari with audience participating in dance whereas froissart s description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation crane 2002 155 159 thumb 250px left miniature titled fire at a masked dance from froissart s chronicles by master of getty froissart c 1483 bruges froissart wrote about event in book iv

froissart blamed orleans for tragedy nara 2002 237 and monk blamed instigator de guisay whose reputation for treating low born servants like animals earned him such universal hatred that nobles
