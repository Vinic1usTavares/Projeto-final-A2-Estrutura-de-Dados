out with fourteen volunteers under command of captain james martin steam tug rattler initially took liverpool boat in tow as properties that made it suitable as a lifeboat also made it very heavy to row at approximately same time that liverpool lifeboat was departing mersey docks new brighton formby and hoylake boats also got underway with new brighton rnli boat in tow behind hurricane had abated

start its return journey to dock new brighton lifeboat was still about away when liverpool boat left wreck and thus coxswain turned her around once it became apparent that everyone had already been taken off ship successfully thumb left an 1863 tubular lifeboat from new brighton wind tide and sea made it impossible for liverpool lifeboat to link up with waiting tug for another tow so men were forced to start rowing home about twenty minutes later as boat reached safer waters of channel master elected to raise foresail to help steady vessel people in lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape when captain martin noticed a huge wave like a high wall approaching he instructed everyone to hold on fearing that someone might be washed overboard however rather than breaking over boat wave lifted it and flipped it over boat was not self righting so remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to upturned boat rattlers master witnessed incident signaled to new brighton lifeboat willie and arthur which promptly turned around to come to rescue men who were on capsized boat directed new brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in sea after picking up survivors and one casualty new brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by rattler which brought her back to new brighton six of ellen crew captain
