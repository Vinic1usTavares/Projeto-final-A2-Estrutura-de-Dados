admiral hipper class cruiser admiral hipper class was a group of five heavy cruisers built by nazi germany s kriegsmarine beginning in mid 1930s class comprised lead ship and only first three ships of class saw action with german navy during world war ii work on seydlitz stopped when she was approximately 95 percent complete it was decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier but this was not completed either lutzow was sold incomplete to soviet union in 1940 admiral hipper and blucher took part in operation weserubung invasion of norway in april 1940 blucher was sunk by norwegian coastal defenses outside oslo while admiral hipper led attack on trondheim she then conducted sorties into atlantic to attack allied merchant shipping in 1942 she was deployed to northern norway to attack shipping to soviet union culminating in battle of barents sea in december 1942 where she was damaged by british cruisers prinz eugen saw her first action during operation rheinubung with battleship she eventually returned to germany during channel dash in 1942 after which she too went to norway after being torpedoed by a british submarine she returned to germany for repairs admiral hipper while decommissioned after returning to germany in early 1943 was partially repaired and recommissioned in fall of 1944 for a refugee transport mission in 1945 only prinz eugen continued to serve in full commission and stayed in baltic until end of war admiral hipper was scuttled in kiel in may 1945 leaving prinz eugen as only member of class to survive war she was ceded to us navy which ultimately expended ship in operation crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 seydlitz was towed to konigsberg and scuttled before advancing soviet army could seize ship she was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap lutzow renamed petropavlovsk remained unfinished when germans invaded soviet union ship provided artillery support against advancing german forces until she was sunk in september 1941 she was raised a year later and repaired enough to participate in campaign to relieve siege of leningrad in 1944 she served on in secondary roles until 1950s when she was broken up design development article 181 of treaty of versailles limited german reichsmarine to six battleships of or types and six old light cruisers these obsolete ships could not be replaced until they were at least twenty years old and their replacements could displace no more than and respectively in february 1922 major naval powers signed washington naval treaty germany was not invited to attend but she would be held to same qualitative limitations as signatories by early 1920s cruisers of reichsmarine were old enough to permit replacement three konigsberg class cruisers and were built later in decade to replace older vessels 1930 london naval treaty formally divided cruiser types into two categories heavy cruisers armed with guns and light cruisers armed with guns treaty of versailles still prohibited germany from building heavy cruisers but rise of adolf hitler s nazi party to power in 1933 led to formal rejection of treaty of versailles after pulling out of geneva conference in 1933 hitler argued that if other european powers did not disarm to parity with germany they should accept german rearmament german navy renamed kriegsmarine on 21 may 1935 was now free to pursue rearmament germany concluded anglo german naval agreement with great britain which set german naval strength at 35 of size of royal navy this permitted germany to build of heavy cruisers enough for five 10 000 ton ships design for first three of five admiral hipper class ships was prepared in 1934 1935 seydlitz and lutzow were initially designed as light cruisers their design was prepared in 1934 1936 these last two ships were to be armed with four triple turrets housing guns as opposed to four twin guns on first three ships light cruisers were otherwise planned to follow same particulars as their three heavy half sisters on 14 november 1936 navy decided to complete final two ships identically to other members of class general characteristics thumb left recognition drawing of admiral hipper class showing armament and armor arrangement ships of admiral hipper class varied slightly in size admiral hipper was long at waterline and overall after installation of a clipper bow during fitting out her overall length increased to ship had a beam of blucher was long at waterline and overall with clipper bow her overall length was her beam was both ships had a designed draft of and a full load draft of prinz eugen was at waterline and long overall with clipper bow her overall length was her beam was and a draft of standard and 7 2 m at full load seydlitz and lutzow were long overall with beams of and drafts of standard and at full load although nominally within 10 000 ton limit ships of admiral hipper class significantly exceeded figure admiral hipper and blucher had a designed displacement of and a full load displacement of prinz eugens displacement increased slightly to designed and full load seydlitz and lutzow grew heavier still at designed and full load ships hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames hulls were divided into fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72 percent of length of keel kriegsmarine regarded ships as good sea boats with gentle motion at low speed however they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50 speed with rudder hard over at high speed ships had a standard complement of 42 officers and 1 340 enlisted men wartime modifications increased crew to 51 officers and 1 548 sailors ships carried several smaller vessels including two picket boats two barges one launch one pinnace and two dinghies machinery thumb one of prinz eugens three bladed screws on display at laboe naval memorial admiral hipper class ships were powered by three sets of geared steam turbines admiral hippers and bluchers engines were built by blohm voss while prinz eugens turbines were built by germaniawerft turbines installed on and lutzows engines were manufactured by deschimag steam was provided in first three ships by twelve ultra high pressure boilers seydlitz and lutzow were equipped with nine double ended high pressure boilers admiral hippers and prinz eugens boilers were manufactured by wagner while boilers for other three ships were built by la mont each turbine drove a three bladed screw in diameter ships engines were rated at for a top speed of they carried of fuel oil as designed though ships could carry up to at a cruising speed of ships had a maximum range of steering was controlled by a single rudder admiral hipper and blucher were equipped with three electricity plants with four diesel generators and six turbo generators each diesel generators supplied 150 kw apiece four of six turbo generators provided 460 kw and final pair provided 230 kw total electrical output was 2900 kw prinz eugen seydlitz and lutzow were equipped with three 150 kw diesel generators four 460 kw turbo generators one 230 kw turbo generator and one 150 kw ac generator for a total of kw all five ships electrical plants operated at 220 volts armament three completed ships were armed with eight sk c 34 guns in four twin turrets ships were supplied with between 960 and 1 280 rounds of ammunition or 120 to 160 rounds per gun guns were mounted in drh lc 34 turrets which enabled depression to 10deg and elevation to 37deg at maximum elevation gun could reach out to it fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of projectiles included armor piercing shells base fuzed and nose fuzed high explosive he warheads each ship was also supplied with 40 illumination rounds that weighed and had a muzzle velocity of four gun turrets built for seydlitz were emplaced as coastal artillery pieces in atlantic wall only two forward turrets had been installed on lutzow when she was delivered to soviet union thumb one of prinz eugens 10 5 cm gun mounts ships heavy anti aircraft battery consisted of twelve sk c 33 guns in twin mountings these guns were supplied with a total of 4 800 rounds of ammunition mounts were lc 31 type originally designed for earlier sk c 31 guns lc 31 mounting was stabilized and capable of elevating to 80deg this enabled guns to engage targets up to a ceiling of against surface targets guns had a maximum range of guns fired fixed ammunition weighing guns could fire he and he incendiary rounds as well as illumination shells close range anti aircraft weaponry initially consisted of twelve sk c 30 guns and eight flak 38 guns 3 7 cm gun was a single shot gun with a rate of fire of around 30 rounds per minute at its maximum elevation of 85deg gun had a ceiling of 2 cm gun was a magazine fed automatic weapon firing at up to 500 rounds per minute twenty and forty round magazines were supplied for guns guns were supplied with 16 000 rounds of ammunition later in war light anti aircraft batteries for admiral hipper and prinz eugen were modified four 3 7 cm guns were removed and number of 2 cm guns had increased to twenty eight in 1944 prinz eugens 3 7 cm guns were replaced by fifteen flak 28 guns by 1945 ship s light anti aircraft battery comprised twenty 4 cm guns and eighteen 2 cm guns admiral hipper mounted sixteen 4 cm guns and fourteen 2 cm guns ships armament was rounded out by twelve torpedo tubes they were mounted in four triple launchers on ships main deck ships carried twenty four g7a torpedoes twelve loaded in tubes and one reload for each g7a torpedo carried a warhead it had three speed settings in 1939 it could reach at at and at its maximum speed setting radial engine was improved during war which improved performance ranges increased to and respectively admiral hipper also carried 96 emc mines these mines were contact mines and had a 300 kg explosive charge armor five admiral hipper class ships were protected by krupp steel armor of both wotan hart and wotan types ships had two armored decks to protect ship from vertical attacks upper deck was thick amidships to protect ships vitals at either end deck was reduced to thickness bow and stern was not protected by deck armor main armored deck was thick both decks were wotan hart steel main armored belt was thick amidships and reduced to thick aft an interior 20 mm thick torpedo bulkhead protected ships vitals from underwater attack ships main battery turrets were protected with thick faces and 70 mm thick sides their roofs were also 70 mm thick 10 5 cm guns were equipped with thick gun shields forward conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof rear conning tower was significantly less well armored with only splinter protection their sides were 30 mm thick with a 20 mm thick roof anti aircraft fire directors were also given splinter protection with thick shields construction thumb prinz eugen at her launch admiral hipper ordered as h as a replacement for light cruiser she was laid down at blohm voss shipyard in hamburg under construction number 501 on 6 july 1935 she was launched on 6 february 1937 and fitting out work was completed two years later in april 1939 ship was commissioned into kriegsmarine on 29 april 1939 blucher ordered as g to replace was built by deutsche werke

respectively work ceased on seydlitz when she was approximately 95 percent complete in october 1939 soviet union approached germany with a request to purchase then unfinished prinz eugen seydlitz and lutzow along with plans for german capital ships naval artillery and other naval technology kriegsmarine denied request for seydlitz and prinz eugen but agreed to sell lutzow service history

operation ended without significant success in february 1941 admiral hipper sortied again sinking several merchant vessels before eventually returning to germany via denmark strait ship was then transferred to northern norway to participate in operations against convoys to soviet union culminating in battle of barents sea on 31 december 1942 where she was damaged and forced to withdraw by light cruisers and enraged by defeat at battle adolf hitler ordered majority of surface warships scrapped though admiral karl donitz was able to convince hitler to retain surface fleet as a result admiral hipper was returned to germany and decommissioned for repairs ship was never restored to operational status however and on 3 may 1945 royal air force bombers severely damaged admiral hipper while she was in kiel her crew scuttled ship at her moorings and in july 1945 she was raised and towed to heikendorfer bay she was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948 1952 her bell resides in

damaging hits two torpedoes fired by land based torpedo batteries struck ship causing serious damage a major fire broke out aboard blucher which could not be contained after a magazine explosion ship slowly capsized and sank with major loss of life wreck remains on bottom of oslofjord several salvage attempts were considered after 1963 but none were carried out ship s screws were removed in 1953 and divers removed over of fuel oil from ship s bunkers in 1994 though oil from unaccessible fuel tanks is still leaking from sunken ship at time divers removed oil they also recovered one of her ar 196 floatplanes which is preserved in stavanger prinz eugen thumb prinz eugen passing through panama canal en route to operation crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 prinz eugen saw extensive action during operation rheinubung an attempted breakout into atlantic ocean with battleship bismarck in may 1941 two ships engaged british battlecruiser and battleship in battle of denmark strait during which hood was destroyed and prince of wales was severely damaged prinz eugen was detached from bismarck during operation to raid allied merchant shipping but this was cut short due to engine troubles after putting into occupied france and undergoing repairs ship participated in operation cerberus a daring daylight dash through english channel back to germany in february 1942 prinz eugen was deployed to norway although her time stationed there was cut short when she was torpedoed by british submarine days after arriving in norwegian waters torpedo severely damaged ship s stern which necessitated repairs in germany upon returning to active service ship spent several months training new officer cadets in baltic before serving as artillery support to retreating german army on eastern front after german collapse in may 1945 ship was surrendered to british royal navy before being transferred to us navy as a war prize after examining ship in united states us navy assigned cruiser to operation crossroads nuclear tests in bikini atoll after surviving both atomic blasts prinz eugen was towed to kwajalein atoll where she ultimately capsized and sank in december 1946 wreck remains partially visible above water one of her screws was salvaged and is on display at laboe naval memorial in germany seydlitz thumb reconnaissance photo of seydlitz in march 1942 before conversion work began at time construction on seydlitz was halted she was approximately 95 percent complete unfinished ship remained inactive until march 1942 when kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants seydlitz was among vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers renamed weser conversion work began on ship in may 1942 majority of superstructure was cut away with exception of funnel to prepare for installation of a flight deck and an aircraft hangar in total approximately of material from ship was removed as a carrier ship was to have had a complement of ten bf 109 fighters and ten ju 87 dive bombers she would have been armed with an anti aircraft battery of ten 10 5 cm sk c 33 guns in dual mounts ten 3 7 cm sk c 30 guns in dual mounts and twenty four 2 cm flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts conversion work was halted in june 1943 however and incomplete vessel was towed to konigsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 january 1945 ship was seized by advancing soviet army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship lutzow which had been purchased by soviet navy before war this plan was also abandoned and ship was broken up for scrap lutzow in october 1939 soviet union requested purchase of incomplete lutzow after a series of negotiations kriegsmarine agreed to sale in february 1940 at price of 150 million reichsmarks transfer was completed on 15 april vessel was still incomplete when sold to soviet union with only half of her main battery of eight guns installed and much of superstructure missing renamed petropavlovsk in september 1940 work on ship was effected by a german advised soviet shipyard in leningrad still unfinished when germany invaded soviet union
