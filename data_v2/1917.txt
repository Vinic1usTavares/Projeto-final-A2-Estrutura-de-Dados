road company which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in september 1849 proceeding quickly company established eight toll booths along new route which became known as plank and gravel road due to materials with which it was constructed however greed of toll road operators resulted in diminishing upkeep which forced province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume ownership of roads it took until 1907 for oxford county to assume toll road proprietors were compensated with 15 500 when adjusted for inflation from 1916 gradual implementation of various legislation over following decade allowed many counties to vastly improve roads under their jurisdiction by time department of highways dho assumed road from highway 3 in tillsonburg to highway 2 in ingersoll on
