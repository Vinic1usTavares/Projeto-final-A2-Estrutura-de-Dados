flows through franklin township dallas township kingston township west wyoming wyoming and forty fort watershed of creek has an area of and occupies portions of nine municipalities in northeastern luzerne county watershed is divided into upper abraham creek watershed and lower abraham creek watershed which are joined by a canyon known as hollow upper part of watershed is mostly rural but lower part is heavily urbanized creek s channel has been heavily modified in many places its drainage basin is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery abrahams creek is a perennial stream with relatively poor water quality however it is not considered to be impaired its ph ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and has a daily sediment load of nearly 14 million pounds 31 million kilograms per day main rock formations in watershed include catskill formation llewellyn formation pottsville group mauch chunk formation and pocono formation main soils include chenango pope holly soil lackawanna arnot morris soil udorthents urban land volusia soil and volusia mardin lordstown soil abrahams creek is named after a historic mohican chief of a village in area creek s watershed was historically heavily logged and farmed and a sediment retention structure was built in watershed in 1970s numerous bridges have been built over creek since 1925 abrahams creek watershed association operates in watershed a 500 million gallon reservoir known as frances slocum lake was built on creek in 1965 course abrahams creek begins in franklin township it flows south southwest for a short distance before turning south for several tenths of a mile passing through border between dallas township franklin township and kingston township and entering kingston township creek then continues south for more than a mile before turning southeast and eventually entering frances slocum lake on southeastern end of lake creek turns east northeast for more than a mile entering a deep valley it then turns south southeast for a few miles entering west wyoming flowing through a water gap creek then turns southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering wyoming it then turns west southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west creek then turns south again crossing us route 11 it then turns southwest for more than a mile entering forty fort and reaching its confluence with susquehanna river abrahams creek joins susquehanna river upstream of its mouth tributaries hicks creek was historically a tributary of abrahams creek however it was diverted to northeast by strip mining in 1940s and 1950s it currently flows into susquehanna river at present abrahams creek has no officially named tributaries however it has six unnamed tributaries two of which enter it from left and four of which enter it from right hydrology and climate abrahams creek likely has relatively poor water quality especially in its lower reaches however it is not considered by pennsylvania department of environmental protection to be impaired creek is a perennial stream it has experienced erosion in some places creek s discharge was in its upper reaches was measured to be on may 12 1970 and on september 17 1970 further downstream at west wyoming discharge was measured twice in 1960s values were daily load of sediment in abrahams creek is which equates to a unit area loading of per acre per day a total of comes from transitional land comes from cropland and comes from stream banks a total of comes from hay and pastures and come from forested land low intensity development contributes of sediment per day unpaved roads contribute and coal mines contribute comes from high intensity development comes from wetlands and comes from turf grass in early

elevation of creek s source is between above sea level highest point in watershed is on bunker hill at slightly over above sea level lowest point in watershed is at creek s mouth there are plains to north of abrahams creek wetlands known as abrahams creek wetlands are in vicinity of creek they consist of several ponds along side of creek in franklin township kingston township and dallas township wetlands are listed on luzerne county natural areas inventory creek is in entirely in ridge and valley physiographic province specifically anthracite valley section bunker hill mount lookout ridge crosses watershed and divides it into two drainage basins upper abrahams creek watershed which consists of rolling hills and lower abrahams creek watershed which is on a natural debris fan and old floodplain of susquehanna river between two is hollow a narrow canyon flowing through ridge course of abrahams creek has been altered by flood control projects there is a sediment retention structure on creek at lower end of hollow large portions of creek especially in its lower reaches have undergone full stream channelization with stream channel being hardened by concrete or rock in west wyoming a nearly mile long stretch is lined with concrete in early 20th century part of creek above hollow had grouted stone walls which were completed in 1930s in abrahams creek watershed 94 percent of rock is interbedded sedimentary rock remaining 6 percent is sandstone main rock formations in watershed of abrahams creek include catskill formation llwellyn formation pottsville group mauch chunk formation and pocono formation these formations mainly consist of coal limestone sandstone shale and siltstone catskill formation mainly occurs in watershed s upper reaches mauch chunk formation pocono formation and pottsville group occur under bunker hill mount lookout ridge llwellyn formation also occurs there in addition to underlying floodplain in watershed a considerable area in watershed has been strip mined main soils in watershed of abrahams creek include chenango pope holly soil lackawanna arnot morris soil udorthents urban land volusia soil and volusia mardin lordstown soil watershed s soils are in mostly hydrologic soil groups b and c however hydrological soil group d is also present watershed watershed of abrahams creek has an area of creek s mouth is in united states geological survey quadrangle of pittston however its source is in quadrangle of kingston there are approximately of open stream channels in watershed creek s watershed is situated in northeastern part of luzerne county and occupies portions of nine municipalities exeter forty fort west wyoming wyoming dallas township exeter township franklin township and kingston township watershed is described as being hourglass shaped in abrahams creek watershed assessment and project prioritization a total of 80 percent of abrahams creek watershed is rural and 20 percent is urbanized lower reaches of watershed contain most of urbanization its upper reaches contain second growth forest small patches of residential land linear hedgerows and agricultural land such as hay pastures pastures and farmland bunker hill mount lookout ridge is too steep to be developed but many other areas of watershed could easily be urbanized mining affected land in watershed is in west wyoming a total of 51 percent of watershed of abrahams creek consists of forested land a total of 26 percent of watershed consists of agricultural land and 18 percent is developed remaining 2 percent consists of disturbed land abrahams creek is main source of flooding in west wyoming forty fort and sheet flooding can occur when creek floods over eighth street there is a flood protection project for creek in west wyoming this protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods slocum dam which is upstream of west wyoming also helps to reduce flooding on creek however localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches creek has been experienced extensive modifications such as narrowing and riprap installation in hollow to accommodate west eighth street abrahams creek flows through frances slocum state park and passes through frances slocum lake a flood control lake with a volume of half a billion gallons most of upper reaches of watershed drain into lake creek is also dammed in this location lake was created in 1965 by construction of an earthen dam across creek a pond known as pond is on a tributary of creek it is partially filled and has a decaying stone dam if dam collapsed damage could potentially reach up to downstream there are numerous other dammed ponds in watershed s upper reaches historically wetlands formed sources of many headwater streams in area but many have been drained or flooded by watershed of abrahams creek is continuing to become more developed but at a slower rate than it has in past lower reaches of watershed are most heavily urbanized while upper reaches are still largely rural this has been case as early 1893 upper reaches of watershed have a dendritic drainage system abrahams creek is one of 19 streams in luzerne county to be designated for stormwater management history name and etymology abrahams creek was entered into geographic names information system on august 2 1979 its identifier in geographic names information system is creek is also known as abraham creek abraham s creek abram creek or abrams creek name abraham s creek was once official name of creek it was also referred to by this name in an 1860 map historically mohicans had a settlement on banks of abrahams creek creek is named after abraham a chief of that village extensive logging and intense agriculture were historically done in watershed of abrahams creek area was already beginning to experience road encroachment as early as 1893 several bridges have been built over abrahams creek a concrete slab bridge carrying state route 1021 east eighth street was built in 1925 it is long and is situated in west wyoming a concrete stringer bridge carrying state route 1010 was constructed over creek in 1929 this bridge is long and is also situated in west wyoming a concrete tee beam carrying us route 11 was built in 1939 it is long and is situated in forty fort another bridge carrying us route 11 was built in wyoming in 1953 it is a 14 span steel culvert bridge with a length of a 2 span concrete tee beam bridge was constructed over creek in 1962 in wyoming it is long and carries state route 1021 a steel culvert bridge carrying state route 1044 was built in 1965 it is long and situated in kingston township a prestressed box beam bridge carrying state route 1036 road was constructed over creek in 1976 this bridge is long and is situated in kingston township four bridges over creek are classified as being structurally deficient as of 2007 entire watershed of abrahams creek including all of streams and wetlands has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in area natural surface water hydrology of watershed was substantially modified by projects of united states army corps of engineers and pennsylvania department of environmental protection from 1950s until 1990s sediment retention structure in hollow was constructed in 1970s abrahams creek has a watershed association known as abrahams creek watershed association it was awarded watershed stewardship award by luzerne conservation district in 2009 organization also received a 5000 grand from american water for improving water quality adding riparian buffers and other projects damaging flooding in 2006 caused abrahams creek watershed assessment and project prioritization to be created creek was used as a reference watershed by pennsylvania department of environmental protection when developing a total maximum daily load for nearby solomon creek biology nearly all of watershed of abrahams creek is biologically degraded with only exceptions being several headwater streams however upper part of watershed is less severely degraded than lower reaches drainage basin of abrahams creek is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery wild trout naturally reproduce in a section of a tributary of creek in west wyoming this stretch is long there is an herbaceous wetland along abrahams creek just upstream of where it enters frances slocum lake further to north there is a flooded forested wetland creek has a substantial riparian buffer upstream of frances slocum lake plant species carex inhabits area bird species
