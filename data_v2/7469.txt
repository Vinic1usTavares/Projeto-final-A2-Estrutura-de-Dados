hans charles freeman am faa 26 may 1929 9 november 2008 was a german born australian bioinorganic chemist protein crystallographer and professor of inorganic chemistry who spent most of his academic career at university of sydney his best known contributions to chemistry were his work explaining unusual structural electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of blue copper proteins particularly plastocyanin he also introduced protein crystallography to australia and was a strong advocate for programs to ensure australian scientists have good access to big science facilities freeman has received numerous honours including being elected a fellow of australian academy of science faa and appointed a member of order of australia am by australian government he was a charismatic lecturer who voluntarily continued teaching well into his formal retirement and imbued his students with a love of science biography early years and education hans charles freeman was first and only son of karl and lotte freeman and was born in breslau in germany in 1929 now wroclaw poland in 1938 following a tip off from a nazi party member karl decided to relocate his jewish family to australia karl brought his knowledge of detergents a novelty in australia at time to his new homeland applying it to problem of cleaning blood stained blankets that would otherwise be wasted after war he founded k h freeman pty ltd a detergent and soap manufacturing company hans spent many weekends working in factory gaining a practical insight into chemistry hans adapted well to his new environment quickly mastering his new language and demonstrating his outstanding scholastic ability he was dux of his primary school dux of sydney boys high in 1945 http www org au wp content uploads professors pdf and took his bachelor s degree with university medal in chemistry in 1949 he was one of ten chemistry students in his class at sydney boys high to go on to become professors of chemistry after receiving his msc in 1952 under supervision of raymond le frs freeman attended caltech on a rotary foundation fellowship where at urging of linus pauling he learned fundamentals of crystallography he received a phd in 1957 for his work on structure of biuret hydrate where he completed most of calculations for crystal structure by hand personal life freeman came to australia with his parents and his sister eva following death of his father in 1958 he became a director of k h freeman pty ltd which continues to operate today he met edith in 1964 and they married in 1966 they have two children and philip career thumb right structure of poplar plastocyanin freeman was appointed to faculty of university of sydney in 1954 as a lecturer working his way up until he was made inaugural professor of inorganic chemistry in 1971 freeman pioneered use of computers in crystallography in australia working on australian cousin of university of illinois illiac machine and australia s second computer after its installation in 1956 his research group extended its interests beyond purely organic compounds and on to metal complexes such as copper biuret one of first bioinorganic substances to be structurally determined and went on to determine structures of numerous metal complexes of amino acids and peptides thumb left copper site in plastocyanin with four amino acids that bind metal labelled in 1970 focus of freeman s research became protein crystallography and he turned his attention to blue copper proteins and particularly electron transport protein plastocyanin intensely blue colour of plastocyanin and its unusual redox properties had frustrated all attempts to synthesise a small molecule mimic it was not until 1977 that his group finally determined structure of plastocyanin crystallised from poplar tree see diagram at right this was first protein crystal structure determined in southern hemisphere together with subsequent work in collaboration with ed solomon this work led to understanding of unusual geometry of copper metal site see diagram at left as well as spectroscopic and electrochemical properties characteristic of blue copper proteins later in his career freeman developed an interest in applications of exafs spectroscopy to structure collaborating with both james penner hahn and keith hodgson working together freeman and hodgson groups were in 1988 first to determine a new crystal structure of a protein using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion mad method throughout his career freeman was concerned about influence of tyranny of phrase tyranny of distance comes from 1966 book tyranny of distance how distance shaped australia s history by geoffrey blainey on development of australian science for this reason in 1972 freeman and alexander boden ao faa founded foundation for inorganic chemistry at university to bring international scholars to department to deliver a course for graduate students and give seminars for faculty inaugural foundation scholar was nobel laureate linus pauling and foundation has brought many other eminent research chemists to australia foundation has thus functioned to increase australian awareness of state of art international research increased international recognition of australian research and allowed graduate students to interact with leading chemists based in institutions far from australia many of students have gone on to post graduate or post doctoral positions with a foundation scholar freeman also provided advice to australian government on problem of access to big science facilities this included making major contributions to report small country big science in his work for australian science and technology council report emphasised need for australian researchers to have access to facilities such as synchrotron x ray and high intensity neutron sources and led directly to formation of australian synchrotron research programme asrp to fund access to such facilities freeman served as a board member of asrp until its functions were subsumed under newly commissioned australian synchrotron in 2008 australian expertise developed as a consequence of asrp supported research led to australian synchrotron being built a decade sooner than would have otherwise been case freeman retired from his chair in 1997 and was succeeded by len faa nevertheless he continued working in research and became emeritus professor of chemistry and emeritus professor of molecular and microbial biosciences he also voluntarily continued teaching at first year level his lecturing was described as charismatic and teaching was a love and a privilege and never an obligation for him legacy freeman was principally responsible for establishment of structural biology as a discipline in australia he founded first protein crystallography laboratory in australia today there are more than 15 active research groups carrying out protein crystallography in australia and new zealand many former members of freeman research group have moved on to join one of these other groups groups interact through society of crystallographers of australia and new zealand freeman was foundation president of then society of crystallographers of australia an organisation he was instrumental in forming in 1976 working as a crystallographer freeman s major legacies are understanding of plastocyanin and other blue copper proteins and development of mad method as an extension of exafs spectroscopy freeman s work in ensuring australian scientists have access to big science facilities will continue to assist researchers into future his teaching also leaves a legacy of generations of students imbued with a love of science honours and awards freeman was recognised for his professional achievements with fellowships in royal australian chemical institute raci in 1968 royal society of chemistry in 1984 and australian academy of science in 1984 freeman s contributions were also recognised by australian government with a centenary medal in 2001 for service to australian society and science in chemistry and with his appointment as a member of order of australia in june 2005 for service to science and scientific research in field of bio inorganic chemistry particularly through establishment and development of discipline of crystallography in australia freeman received numerous awards over his long career in 1980 freeman received burrows award premier award of inorganic chemistry division of raci he was also awarded 1999 leighton memorial medal which is raci s most prestigious medal and is awarded in recognition of eminent services to chemistry in australia in broadest sense in 2007 he received both australian academy of science s craig medal and an raci distinguished fellowship most cited publications number of citations indicated for each of following papers are from web of science data as at 22 june 2013 x ray crystal structure analysis of
