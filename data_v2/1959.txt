jan and jule asleep in same bed as a group of heavily armed police gather outside their flat and knock on door jule wakes up when she hears a knock and police force their way into almost empty flat apparently in barcelona jule opens door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room in berlin apartment police find a note manche menschen andern sich nie some people never change in original german version edukators set off in hardenberg s boat in mediterranean presumably to disrupt island signal towers supplying most television programming to western europe production development and characters thumb 140px left alt dark haired bearded casually dressed man director hans weingartner based film on his past as a political activist according to weingartner edukators was influenced by his past as a political activist there s some of me in film he considers it an autobiographical film with bruhl playing weingartner it describes last 10 years of his life an attempt to find a political movement satisfying his ideals it also reflects his frustration over lack of political ideals among his generation and effect of advertising and media images about this he stated we don t know where to put our revolutionary energy and we don t know how to fight system because we can t grab it we don t know how to attack it he said system has become so invulnerable because it sells revolution to us director opted for nonviolence because violence only makes system stronger citing baader meinhof gang which practically killed left movement in germany because they gave police an excuse to really arm up and create a more totalitarian system instead weingartner gave his characters poetic resistance although bruhl thought film very realistic he was dissatisfied with his character s authenticity actor felt attached to jan admiring his courage to want to change way things are going to act to defend his beliefs but thought it was very utopian and naive that they take so much risk to break into some rich man s house to move things around authenticity of love triangle was very important to weingartner who was once part of such a relationship although actors were uncertain at first that peter could forgive jan and jule s betrayal weingartner uses situation to explore his concept of friendship friendship means more to him than bourgeois moral values peter loves jule he doesn t own her he can tell that when she falls in love with jan their love is a wonderful thing coloured by a joint rebellion a shared rejection of social constraint production and filming weingartner said he received an offer large enough that i would not have to work for rest of my life from an american studio but refused it opting to produce film with his own studio and coop99 an austrian studio a low budget film it was funded by a eur250 000 loan weingartner obtained with his parents house as collateral his second feature film edukators was shot with hand held digital cameras allowing director to explore space and give actors license to go wherever they wanted weingartner wanted a technically simple film focused on actors his decision to have a low budget was measured more money means more pressure this way i used a limited crew and was able to set shooting schedule way i wanted it usually huge advantage of this kind of film making is that it s rapid most of film was shot in berlin except for scenes in austrian alps casting character of peter was written for erceg after weingartner saw him in a friend s film bruhl already a popular actor in germany was known to director who saw him as a perfect match for erceg klaussner was cast because according to weingartner i knew energy and vibe between us was right most difficult role to cast was jule weingartner searched for eight months and when he found jentsch she was committed to another film since he was certain that actress was perfect cast he rescheduled filming themes weingartner commented that film is about economic revolution about poor vs rich he also tried to explore in film fact that in his opinion today we live in a society in which revolution is on sale for example in film jan comments that revolutionary icon che guevara now appears on t shirts hardenberg s psycho sexual powerplay against main characters while in alps stands for what weingartner considers a betrayal of european left by hippie era survivors including fischer gerhard schroder and tony blair nonetheless weingartner was not calling for revolution with this film it was much more important to me to emphasize how important it is to be critical and to question status quo even if subject of film is political it deals with lots of themes and theme of revolution of rebellion and of how a person can change course of his life are main ones similarly bruhl commented that there are different things you can take out of it as film also deals with generational conflict and stories of love and friendship weingartner said whole idea of is playful movie is full of jokes and happiness i read somewhere that kids laugh out loud more than 150 times a day adults laugh only 10 times a day well i want people to laugh i want people to go see film and have fun release and reception accolades and public reception edukators premiered on 17 may at 2004 cannes film festival where it received a 10 minute standing ovation

uncommonly smart and interesting film and austin chronicles marc savlov said film was a smart kicky little gem that owes as much to guy debord and according to sean axmaker of seattle post intelligencer it was a rare film that gets smarter as it goes along inject ing a satisfying dash of pragmatism every time it seems ready to slip into either unearned idealism or cynical fatalism ray bennett wrote for hollywood reporter edukators is that rare beast a terrific movie that boasts intelligent wit expert storytelling delightful characters and grown up dialogue plus suspense and a wicked surprise ending a o scott of new york times wrote that despite its shortcomings on political subjects it succeeds brilliantly in telling story of a man who falls in love with his best buddy s girlfriend and doesn t know what to do about it tim appelo of seattle weekly praised marvelous acting sensitive utterly realistic treatment of young love triangle adding edukators is educational not intellectually but emotionally washington post critic stephen hunter praised film s realism whole thing feels messy painful funny and believable just like that hideous circus known as real life times howard swains wrote that it manages to combine political discourse a love triangle and a hostage plot all without sacrificing its graceful humour los angeles times critic carina chocano described it as a sweet funny and gripping romantic adventure and only accurate ironic and poignant depiction of what it s like to be young and socially committed in wto era chocano choose it as one of 13 best films released in 2005 not all reviews were positive orlando sentinels roger moore called edukators a surprisingly generic german stockholm syndrome romantic triangle thriller adding it ends interestingly but it would ve ended better and played better had it been half an hour shorter in slant magazine jason clark wrote that film needed a touch of perverse but weingartner plays out drama far too earnestly and story barely sustains length of a movie half of its running time according to jack mathews of new york daily news dialogue between captive and captors gets a little didactic and ending is as contrived as it is cynical similar criticism of film s didacticism was made by brett michel of boston phoenix kriss allison of stylus magazine and glenn whipp of los angeles daily news andre wright wrote for stranger it starts strong with an anarchic vibe but quickly into a dust dry hectoring socialist lecture a cinematic version of kenner s my first revolution playset jonathan romney of independent said that weingartner presents his indictment of system in crudely stacked terms that make edukators very much a teen movie rather than a plausible political statement in times wendy ide wrote what could have been an effective piece of drama a dialogue to cause both sides to question very foundations of their belief systems is just a two hour rant from a wispy bearded idealist whose idea of brotherhood is to sleep with his best friend s girlfriend film has been considered to be part of a new german wave in cinema deutsche welle staff considered it to be one best films of 2004 and early 2005 in 2018 british film institute named it one of ten great german films of 21st century news publisher local and de magazine deutschland also included film among best ten
