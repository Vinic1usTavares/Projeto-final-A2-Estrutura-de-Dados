atlantic campaign of may 1794 was a series of operations conducted by british royal navy s channel fleet against french navy s atlantic fleet with aim of preventing passage of a strategically important french grain convoy travelling from united states to france campaign involved commerce raiding by detached forces and two minor engagements eventually culminating in full fleet action of glorious first of june 1794 at which both fleets were badly mauled and both britain and france claimed victory french lost seven battleships british none but battle distracted british fleet long enough for french convoy to safely reach port by spring of 1794 french republic under rule of national convention was at war with all its neighbours with famine imminent french committee of public safety looked to france s colonies and united states to provide an infusion of grain this was to be convoyed across atlantic during april may and june accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second larger squadron in bay of biscay however political upheaval had severely reduced french navy s ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale significantly weakening fleet britain by contrast was at a high state of readiness with a well organised command structure but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy french atlantic fleet under admiral villaret de joyeuse was tasked with keeping british channel fleet occupied long enough for convoy to reach france safely channel fleet commanded by lord howe knew of convoy s passage and dispatched squadrons to protect british commerce while pursuing villaret himself with main body of royal navy s channel fleet for over a week two manoeuvred around one another villaret drawing howe deeper westwards into atlantic and away from convoy two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 may followed during which howe seized weather gage from villaret granting him freedom to choose time and place of his next attack culminating action of campaign took place over into atlantic and became known as glorious first of june this final engagement saw howe use weather gage to attack villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional line of battle formation in battle british fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on french after a bitterly contested day of fighting forcing villaret to retreat howe s force captured seven french battleships one of which later sank and inflicted 7 000 casualties on enemy villaret however claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for convoy to reach france safely battle was first in a series of defeats french navy suffered during early years of war which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among french officer corps to engage british at sea background in winter of 1793 war and internal disorder had combined with poor weather to leave france facing starvation following collapse of harvest williams p 381 france s ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports only nation willing and able to sell grain to national convention was united states importing food from americas was a highly risky venture as british royal navy at war with france since early 1793 patrolled much of atlantic passage to provide effective protection for vessels involved a plan was agreed between france and united states to collect supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy a gathering point was arranged at hampton roads in chesapeake bay tracy p 89 a squadron commanded by admiral pierre vanstabel was dispatched to hampton roads to provide escort vanstabel would bring convoy to bay of biscay where a second squadron under joseph marie nielly would reinforce him for rest of journey together these officers mustered six ships of line and numerous smaller craft james p 127 main french battlefleet of 25 ships under admiral villaret de joyeuse would cruise bay of biscay in order to challenge british channel fleet if it attempted to intercept supplies convoy s passage was expected to take approximately two months and it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed france for a year lord howe admiral of british channel fleet was aware of convoy s nature and destination long before it left chesapeake and made preparations to block its passage sending several small squadrons to protect british commerce crossing bay of biscay howe detailed admiral george montagu with six battleships to search for convoy in south of bay while howe took main body of fleet 26 ships of line to patrol near brest james p 125 may 1794 april 1794 was a month of fevered activity on both sides of english channel as villaret and howe made their final preparations for coming campaign slow french convoy had departed american waters on 2 april and british convoys destined for empire had sailed from portsmouth on 2 may howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as western approaches and on 5 may sent frigates hms latona and hms phaeton close in to brest to ascertain status of french they reported that villaret s battlefleet was still in harbour james p 126 commerce raiding out in atlantic detached squadrons of nielly french and montagu british were

his ships to vanstabel s escort to augment convoy s defences he then returned to eastern atlantic to look for signs of british activity which might pose a threat to its passage he also dispatched frigates to villaret carrying information about convoy s location and speed while nielly and montagu searched out at sea howe took his fleet on a series of cruises back and forth across bay of biscay in hope of catching convoy between 5 and 18 may he found nothing and so returned to brest where his scouting frigates reported that french battlefleet had gone taking advantage of dense fog villaret had sailed previous day his ships passing within earshot of british fleet french admiral was on trail of nielly s squadron his intention was to meet both nielly and convoy and combine forces with superior numbers he would then be able to escort convoy to france in safety having eluded howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a dutch convoy of 53 vessels its escorts alliance and fled at sight of approaching french fleet and villaret was free to attack convoy capturing 20 merchantmen james p 128 howe s pursuit howe realised that direction of villaret s departure would take him directly across admiral montagu s planned route and that should montagu meet villaret british squadron would be destroyed james p 129 setting all sail in pursuit howe followed villaret into atlantic on 20 may next day howe s ships recaptured ten of lost dutch merchantmen but he was forced to burn them since crewing them with british sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet mostert p 135 prisoners from these ships gave howe information that french fleet was only a short distance ahead but that it had been joined by an additional ship from nielly s squadron as well as several frigates by now satisfied that montagu was safely to southwest howe pressed on hoped to bring villaret to battle within week on 23 may however british fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find french track again detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of villaret s dutch prizes on morning of 25 may howe s pursuit finally bore fruit when his scouting frigates spotted a lone french ship of line at 04 00 this ship sighted howe s force at same time and immediately made off in direction of french fleet fleeing battleship left behind an american merchant ship she had been towing which when taken reported that french ship was audacieux of nielly s squadron james p 130

rear of scattered french line by 10 35 howe s continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged but he pressed on in belief that villaret intended to use weather gage to outrun him and escape to counter this howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under admiral thomas pasley jane p 94 this squadron was significantly faster than majority of vessels in either fleet and rapidly

audacious under captain william parker audacious had engaged revolutionnaire so closely that she could not safely withdraw and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent audacious took severe damage it was not until 22 00 that audacious and revolutionnaire disentangled themselves and limped apart their respective fleets now some way off audacious s crew later claimed that revolutionnaire had struck her colours during engagement although this has not been corroborated parker stated that he did not take possession of revolutionnaire because he was concerned by distant sighting of nine french battleships on horizon he had spotted a squadron under commodore jean joseph which was uninvolved in current campaign and which soon disappeared without participating in any of subsequent engagements audacious s crew made strenuous efforts to repair their ship and rejoin british fleet during night but became disorientated and in morning audacious was still only half a mile from her former opponent revolutionnaire had suffered much more severely than audacious but survived encounter without being boarded thanks to a misread signal by captain albemarle bertie of thunderer who failed to take possession of dismasted three decker when ordered to during night villaret sent reinforcements to rescue revolutionnaire and at dawn on 29 may parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by undamaged ship of line audacieux frigate bellone and two corvettes once more audacious came under fire from revolutionnaire leaving her no option but to flee this superior force james p 133 audacious was chased for half an hour by bellone and corvettes before losing them in a rain squall and eventually returned to plymouth on 3 june revolutionnaire also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by audacieux who brought her safely to rochefort several days later for leaving battlefleet before main engagement captain was subsequently arrested 29 may thumb upright louis

rear and british line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through french line and isolate and capture ships east of cut captain anthony molloy in hms caesar was chosen to lead attack as his ship was fastest in fleet but manoeuvre was a complete failure due to inexplicable refusal of molloy to close with enemy mostert p 137 instead caesar and hms queen opened fire on rearmost french ships from a distance vans of opposing fleets then engaged in a long range broadside duel from 10 00 this inflicted mild damage on both sides worst hit being french montagnard james p 143 having failed to cut french line at his first attempt howe reissued order at 12 30 once more caesar was to lead way with intention of splitting enemy fleet in half james p 135 captain molloy then refused to carry out order signalling without cause that caesar was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down outside of british fleet rather than towards enemy james p 138 this unexpected move threw following ships into a state of confusion queen coming behind caesar attempted to obey howe s signal alone but was badly damaged by shot and her captain john hutt mortally wounded hutt john oxford

weather gage to save them as howe pressed after main body of french fleet now tailed by damaged terrible rest of his fleet followed bombarding already battered tyrannicide and indomptable as they passed as hms orion hms invincible and hms barfleur cut through french in turn villaret wore his fleet round to face howe encouraged by caesar s disobedience he deliberately sacrificed weather gage in belief that howe s fleet was more damaged than it appeared all of villaret s ships followed him except montagnard which refused to turn claiming to be seriously damaged villaret s manoeuvre soon isolated queen charlotte bellerophon and leviathan which were forced to retreat hastily before main french force having driven away ships threatening indomptable and tyrannicide villaret reformed his fleet and attempted to escape westwards closely followed by british van who were now holding weather gage both fleets were too damaged to continue action in remaining daylight and firing stopped at 17 00 padfield p 16 british fleet has suffered 67 killed and 128 wounded during day s fighting evening found fleets approximately apart sailing northwest both were conducting hasty repairs and attempting to ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 may significantly lord howe was unaware that to northeast over same sea as previous day s action had been fought ponderous convoy of merchant ships was passing having successfully evaded british pursuit james p 172 unlike his opponent villaret knew location of convoy which was joined that evening by battered montagnard escorting convoy admiral nielly had been apprised of situation by montagnard s captain and had left his escort duties to reinforce villaret james p 145 in a postscript to day s action british frigate castor captured early in campaign by nielly was attacked and retaken by smaller hms carysfort under captain francis laforey at frigate action of 29 may 1794 some of crew were released by their rescuers but most including officers were not aboard having been taken onto nielly s flagship sans pareil between actions on morning of 30 may howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they considered their ships ready for combat all but caesar replied in affirmative and howe pushed his ships after retreating french mostert p 139 despite holding weather gage howe s pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog and unable to see or come to grips with enemy throughout whole day admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle however by 31 may fog had cleared and french were still within sight to north tracy p 101 proceedings of his majesty s ship orion to surprise of british none of 26 battleships in french fleet appeared to show battle damage whereas many of british ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls james p 146 villaret had made use of fog to reorganise his force losing montagnard and frigate seine to convoy but gaining independently sailing battleship trente un mai and nielly s squadron of sans pareil trajan and temeraire villaret had also dispatched battered indomptable for home escorted by an undamaged french ship british sources have listed this ship as mont blanc james p 145 but in fact ship originally named mont blanc had been renamed trente un mai by june 1794 and french fleet did not possess another vessel of this name at this time thus identity of ship departing with indomptable is unclear although it may have been brutus a 42 gun throughout 31 may howe s fleet closed with french making full use of advantage of weather gage by 17 00 fleets were five miles 9 km apart but at 19 00 howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of french he did not want a repeat of confusion of 29 may and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted during night fleets remained in visual contact and by first light on 1 june british were just six miles 11 km from villaret s fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more jane p 95 both fleets were now sailing in a western direction villaret still hoping to draw howe away from convoy glorious first of june thumb sinking of vengeur du peuple engraving by p ozanne at 09 24 on morning of 1 june howe sent his ships into action using original tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously so that they would bear down individually on villaret s fleet and each break enemy line separately his intention was to cut french line in 25 places raking enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal ultimately though this ambitious plan failed due to ill discipline among howe s subordinates and damage his fleet had sustained over previous week james p 153 while six of howe s ships did break french line as ordered and several others came close many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect rodger p 430 as various british and french ships broke off into personal duels and some british ships struggled to get into action villaret led his flagship montagne to north and began assembling a coherent counter force from those of his fleet which had escaped howe s assault james p 166 in melee itself several very hard fought engagements took place particularly that between hms brunswick and vengeur du peuple at least twelve ships were dismasted with british battleships hms marlborough and hms defence losing all three masts and ten french vessels suffering similarly james p 152 by 11 30 initial action was dying down and villaret brought his reconstituted force back towards battle site to contest ownership of dismasted hulks floating there howe likewise reformed his main force and met villaret who failed to capture any of battered british ships but did regather six of his own leaving howe with seven prizes jane p 96 of these wrecked vengeur soon sank although british boats had removed many of her crew james p 164 howe was left in possession of battle site but villaret had successfully held off british long enough for convoy to pass to east unmolested both fleets returned to their home ports over next week james p 170 convoy arrives while searching for convoy during first week of june montagu s squadron became trapped between two french squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid villaret s returning fleet as a result french atlantic seaboard was clear of british forces for a significant period james p 171 food convoy arrived safely in france in third week of june and montagu returned to britain empty handed both nations claimed victory in campaign british by virtue of success in only major action and french through intact arrival of their convoy gardiner p 15 campaign had notable effects on navies of both britain and france french did not directly contest british supremacy in northern european waters again spending most of next 23 years in brest and other ports their few major sallies mainly directed at mediterranean continued upheavals in french navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps so that by battle of trafalgar 11 years later port bound nature of french fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook padfield p 163 in britain battle created a division within royal navy s officer corps howe s dispatch after battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action and those officers received none of honours distributed at end of campaign fallout from this dispute was widespread with several senior figures resigning in disgust caldwell

support his admiral gardiner p 39 see also notes weather gage was a vital advantage in sailing warfare because ships required wind of correct volume and direction to conduct operations when wind was in wrong direction a captain could tack to compensate but possessing weather gage meant that a ship could use wind to attack their opponent directly without need for complicated manoeuvre as long as villaret held weather gage howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on defensive while simultaneously attempting to force villaret to give up his advantage villaret could have used weather gage to attack howe at any time but did not do so in order to buy time for convoy to pass british fleet references bibliography palmer r r twelve who ruled princeton university press 2005
