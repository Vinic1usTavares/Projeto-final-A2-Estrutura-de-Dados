manufacturer s works team was largely a trial year he started season by winning arctic rally in january but only drove his talbot sunbeam lotus in four selected world rally championship events his

of my idols and secretly i ve always wanted to beat his record as youngest winner over 20 years after 1980 rac paul white nicknamed chalkie by toivonen commented that he still receives questions about rally and henri toivonen he noted that talbot team run by des o dell and 15 full time personnel was much smaller than other works teams and had to draft in mercenary mechanics to help toivonen s results led to another year in talbot squad in 1981 season he was signed up for a larger wrc programme and had a new co driver fred gallagher who would later partner juha kankkunen and bjorn in a toyota turbo toivonen s rear wheel drive group 2 sunbeam lotus was now less competitive against group 4 cars and all wheel drive audi quattro but despite four retirements second places at rally

boesel thumb toivonen driving manta 400 toivonen continued with opel into 1983 season now driving manta 400 which took advantage of new group b regulations although manta was a group b car it was underpowered against likes of audi quattro a2 and lancia 037 which were controlling world rally scene at time toivonen achieved a win at manx international rally a round of british open rally championship and european rally championship in isle of man at his first attempt he also finished first at mille pistes rally in france but organisers decided to ban group b cars halfway through event

season he was linked to lead drive at peugeot talbot sport peugeot s new factory world rally championship team but eventually signed to drive a porsche 911 sc rs for rothmans sponsored porsche factory team in european rally championship team was run by a new motorsport group set up by david richards toivonen s former boss at opel his european season with porsche turned out to be a success he started with two retirements a third and a second place but went on to win five rallies in a row and led championship from italian lancia driver carlo capone as toivonen had a contract with lancia for world rally championship and lancia boss cesare fiorio wanted capone to win european title it was suggested that fiorio might enter toivonen in wrc events to keep him away from important erc rounds however toivonen s title campaign ended in a back injury and a resulting enforced rest that was expected to take up to two months he missed several events and finished second in championship behind capone toivonen s wrc contract with lancia martini consisted of five events fiorio stated that team needed another top driver as audi will have four top drivers next year so it would be very difficult competing with only two toivonen had his lancia 037 debut in portugal with very limited testing experience it has been snowing in italy every time i have been to try this car so i don t know its limits however similarly to his opel ascona 400 debut at same event two years ago toivonen immediately took lead and set several fastest stage times before retiring this time retirement was not caused by a broken clutch but a mistake and a crash by toivonen after a retirement also in greece he finished third in his home event 1000 lakes rally these three remained toivonen s only wrc events of season as his back injury forced him to miss sanremo and rac rallies before sanremo markku alen re signed with lancia and fiorio stated he wanted to sign toivonen with a similar two year contract depending on condition of his back and his contractual situation with rothmans porsche who had claimed toivonen had already re signed with them toivonen chose to become a full fledged lancia driver for 1985 season lancia 1985 86 thumb left a factory team lancia 037 rally 1985 season started badly when toivonen crashed his lancia 037 into a brick wall at rally costa smeralda in european championship seriously injuring his back and breaking three vertebrae in his neck at beginning of may lancia drivers toivonen and alen lost a friend and team mate when italian driver attilio bettega crashed fatally during fourth special stage at tour de corse toivonen made his comeback from his injuries at 1000 lakes rally in august and finished fourth he finished third at next rally in sanremo his final event with car 037 did not suit toivonen s driving style and had fallen well behind audi and peugeot in terms of performance as it was rear wheel drive and had only compared to 440 of peugeot and 500 of audi it was replaced by lancia delta s4 for final event of season rac rally delta s4 had all wheel drive and was both supercharged and turbocharged former increasing power in middle of engine s speed range and latter boosting power at higher engine speeds car could reportedly accelerate from 0 to in 2 3 seconds on a gravel road delta s4 turned out to be a success toivonen won rally and alen finished second only 56 seconds behind although toivonen competed in only four world rallies in 1985 his results placed him career best sixth overall in championship thumb a lancia delta s4 1986 season started with a dominant win for toivonen at monte carlo rally with new co driver sergio cresto fellow flying finns timo salonen and hannu mikkola finished second and third toivonen s father pauli toivonen had won event 20 years earlier after ten cars including first four to cross finishing line were disqualified due to having non standard headlights disqualification had caused an uproar and prince rainier of monaco refused to attend prize giving ceremony henri toivonen s victory caused his father to comment now name of toivonen has been cleared monte carlo win made toivonen favourite for title however at swedish rally he retired from lead due to an engine failure at next rally in portugal joaquim santos lost control of his ford rs200 on a special stage and plunged into crowd accident killed three spectators and injured more than 30 toivonen along with all other factory team drivers decided to withdraw from event but lancia disapproved of retirement toivonen stated that lancia team will not accept anything but a win during portuguese rally toivonen is often reported to have tested his delta s4 at estoril circuit and to have set a fastest lap time that would have qualified him in sixth position at 1986 portuguese grand prix mtv3 and espn citing kankkunen and fiorio respectively looked into claim a few decades later and came to a skeptical conclusion red bull explored story further by interviewing former lancia manager ninni russo whose connections stated that toivonen had made a time on full circuit that was in first ten of f1 cars from their test at estoril two or three weeks before despite setbacks toivonen remained title favourite with no driver seeming able to match his pace death thumb after accident only blackened space frame remained of toivonen s lancia delta s4 1986 tour de corse a world rally on narrow and very twisty mountain roads around island of corsica began on thursday 1 may toivonen had a sore throat and was suffering from flu but he insisted on driving after having lost his championship lead during last three rallies due to retiring car in sweden lancia team withdrawing from tragic portugal event and toivonen not even competing in kenyan safari rally according to several sources he was also taking medicine to treat fever despite his ill health he was taking stage win after stage win and leading 1017 km rally by a large margin after first leg toivonen commented toivonen was complaining about car being too fast and powerful for a rally like tour de corse he found it very hard to keep 600 hp lancia balanced on road and admitted it was very exhausting a number of other rally drivers driving other group b cars in rally shared his concerns and in a short interview before he steered his lancia into 18th stage toivonen made a comment which would remain his last words in public during second leg on friday 2 may at seventh kilometre of 18th stage corte taverna toivonen s lancia went off side of road at a tight left corner with no guardrail car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof aluminium fuel tank underneath driver s seat was ruptured by trees and exploded fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate an item used mainly on gravel rallies which was not fitted for all asphalt tour de corse explosion happened within seconds of crash and toivonen and his co driver sergio cresto would not have had time to get out if they were still alive fire caused by explosion was so intense that delta s4 built of fast burning kevlar reinforced plastic composite was unidentifiable as a car afterwards both toivonen and cresto died in their seats toivonen left behind wife married in 1982 1982 welsh youtube and two young children son markus and daughter while cresto was single with no children toivonen s crash remains a mystery because it had no close witnesses although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down stage it proved to be impossible to determine cause of crash from footage no race marshalls were close to scene to notice black smoke and no one at race finish knew about crash toivonen s team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from stage on schedule next rally crew through stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke by time emergency vehicles arrived on crash scene they could only put down flames which had been fanned by breezes lancia engineers and technicians could not determine cause of crash because remains of car were so charred walter rohrl later confirmed that toivonen was taking medicine for his flu in a later interview with motorsport news fellow driver malcolm wilson claimed that since neck injuries sustained in his 1985 costa smeralda crash toivonen had suffered from random blackouts but did not tell his team because he did not want to lose his place at lancia at least one person who attended aftermath of crash reported that there were no skid marks on tarmac fuelling speculation that toivonen could have suddenly lost consciousness at wheel but cause of crash is still unknown aftermath within hours of toivonen s crash jean marie balestre and fisa decided to ban group b cars from competing in 1987 season planned group s was also cancelled and manufacturers were stuck with cars they could not race audi and ford withdrew from group b racing immediately but other teams competed until end of season tour de corse continued next day and bruno saby won with his peugeot 205 turbo 16 e2 prior to santos and toivonen s crashes many commentators and drivers had warned of accidents resulting from drivers simply being unable to control their powerful cars fisa was criticised for recognising problem too late a fisa investigation later proved that drivers reactions were too slow to keep up with speed of group b cars and drivers eyes could not adjust their focus between fast corners resulting in tunnel vision however due to high speed of cars rallying was more popular among spectators than ever fisa had to face criticism also for overreacting to toivonen s accident john davenport author and former rally co driver stated in 2004 that group b could have been tamed they were only unsafe in so much as fuel system which caused toivonen s death and crowd control needed changing it wasn t actual cars group b cars have been described as too fast to race legacy toivonen was known as a competitive driver both on loose gravel dirt sand snow and ice and tarmac surfaces and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying after becoming a rally driver he still competed in some circuit racing events successfully in a european endurance championship event and also in a few races for eddie jordan s british formula three championship team jordan called toivonen s performances incredible and compared him to ayrton senna after toivonen s death jordan weighed in on his chances in formula one during his world rally championship career toivonen competed in 40 world rallies gathering three wins nine podium places 185 stage wins and retiring 22 times with only wins and retirements in last five of his rallies he was at peak of his career in lancia delta s4 after finally finding a car that was both competitive and suitable for his driving style however toivonen admitted having problems with car i may have won rac rally with lancia but i just did not know how to drive it it seemed to have a mind of its own lancia team boss cesare fiorio later claimed that toivonen was only driver who could really control delta s4 toivonen often complained about s4 during tv interviews often saying car was difficult to drive particularly on tarmac where more power could be put down therefore making car faster in such conditions in a henri toivonen obituary titled rebel with a cause published in motor five days after toivonen s fatal accident rally author martin holmes named him a rebel driver and proof that young drivers can be successful in rallying a sport which had previously been dominated by older more experienced drivers such as fellow finn hannu mikkola swede stig blomqvist and german walter rohrl however toivonen could not achieve necessary level of consistency to avoid a number of high speed accidents prior to introduction of delta s4 he was known for his ability to make up large amounts of time in single stages this led to a number of stage wins but also to several bad accidents resulting from driving mistakes toivonen s career almost ended in early 1985 when he was nearly paralysed in rally costa smeralda accident 1985 would have been his first full wrc season excluding extremely arduous endurance events in africa safari rally and ivory coast rally for which he was never entered in his career in actual fact toivonen never did a single rally outside europe not even safari rally which was considered one of most prestigious rally events up until 2002 when it was taken off wrc calendar world rally archive s hall of fame now names him an icon for one of most controversial periods of rallying thumb 2007 race of champions at wembley stadium toivonen was buried in espoo where his family moved from jyvaskyla when toivonen was still very young in corsica a marble slab dedicated to him and sergio cresto was placed at curve where toivonen drove out memorial place always has an unopened bottle of martini which is a reference to toivonen s martini sponsored lancia factory team a local resident puts new flowers by slab every day in july rally marca in italy was titled memorial henri toivonen in honour of toivonen rally was stopped after a fatal accident on fourth stage in 1988 former rally driver and arguably most successful female race car driver in history michele mouton organised first race of champions to commemorate toivonen s death race of champions was originally restricted to rally drivers but became even more popular with introduction of formula one and nascar stars henri toivonen memorial trophy is still awarded to winner of individual event every year another trophy bearing toivonen s name was henri toivonen grand attack trophy which was awarded by peugeot s rally challenge organised by des o dell to driver who most embodied spirit shown by young finn in 2006 toivonen was honoured at neste oil rally finland an exhibition in memory of him was opened on 17 august in rally hq jyvaskyla
