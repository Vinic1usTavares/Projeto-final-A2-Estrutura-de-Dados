reporter corey steinhoff r bruce elliott as news reporter frank james r black as a police officer production chase was written and directed by adam rifkin who at time was best known for directing cult and independent films like 1991 comedy dark backward rifkin conceived chase as a direct response to dark backwards extremely poor performance at box office according to him i needed to make something that studio executives could watch and see money making potential from so i wrote and directed purposely a really brightly lit simplistic car crash movie that i wanted to be polar opposite of dark backward although film was released by 20th century fox it was made with a relatively small budget of a few million dollars as a result rifkin considers it an independent film rather than a studio film although film is set in california it was actually shot in houston metropolitan area texas rifkin explained that shutting down a freeway in los angeles for a long period of time would have been too expensive opening scene where jack kidnaps natalie was filmed at a convenience store in kemah while most of chase scenes were shot on a section of hardy toll road other film locations include mecom fountain and houston police department headquarters at 61 to reduce costs part of car chase was filmed in middle of a traffic stream during an actual houston rush hour without clearance and with no stunt drivers filling in for actors charlie sheen and henry rollins during film s production sheen was also training for his role in major league ii rollins a former vocalist of punk rock band black flag was cast as an attention seeking cop due to his muscled physique role proved to be exciting for rollins who used to sing about police brutality musicians anthony kiedis and flea of rock band red hot chili peppers had cameo roles in film flea commented positively on his experience in creating their characters according to him we were making up lines whole time i remember we said something about geraldo rivera and we called him we thought that was so funny pornographic actor ron jeremy also had a cameo appearance as a cameraman film s soundtrack features alternative artists such as bad religion rancid offspring down by law nofx rollins band suede and one dove a soundtrack album by epitaph records was originally intended to be released in march 1994 release chase

hill during its second weekend film grossed an estimated 1 7 million finishing in 13th place overall chase went on to make 7 9 million in us considering its limited budget rifkin felt film was a commercial success stating that it made a huge profit for 20th century fox chase was released on vhs in united states by 20th century fox home entertainment on august 3 1994 and on dvd on september 6 2005 dvd s only supplemental material is film s original theatrical trailer critical reception according to review aggregator rotten tomatoes chase has a 37 approval rating based on 19 reviews although film was generally criticized for its forced script and subpar characters several critics praised film s use of satire to criticize television news industry film also criticizes millionaire businessmen like character of dalton voss who uses kidnapping of his daughter as a political advantage while he runs for government of california chicago sun times critic roger ebert who gave film two and a half out of three stars felt that chase was slick charming and with moments of real wit he also praised swanson s unaffected charm and sheen s ability to play an almost impossible role in a fairly straight style film critic james berardinelli agreed stating that sheen develops a surprisingly effective chemistry with swanson and noted that rifkin s use of satire is far more perceptive than one might expect from a piece of cartoon fluff like this writing for chicago tribune editor john petrakis noted film s numerous gags and political and socio economic commentary stating that they parody films such as smokey and bandit and convoy but said that its simplistic premise does not allow for an effective love story stephen holden of new york times while criticizing film s superficial characters remarked that chase still detonates laughs although swanson s performance was highlighted variety writer brian lowry felt that whining valley girl aspects of her role does not contribute to her characterization he also described sheen s performance as same jack nicholson wannabe pose he s employed with varying degrees of success in films such as major league and navy seals marc savlov of austin chronicle agreed but noted that sheen s familial transparency serves him well in film he concluded that while chase is nobody s idea of excellence in cinema rifkin s skewed world view suits this rollicking stupid slab of celluloid just fine it s big it s dumb it s fun legacy retrospectively chase was considered ahead of its time because it was released before o j simpson s infamous white bronco chase in june 1994 film was highlighted for taking a look at growing infatuation that media had with tabloid journalism and specifically need for tv news crews to capture and speculate upon every minor freeway chase that happened in california film was released at a time when road movies were considered appealing hence film s tagline reads getting there is twice fun in 2015 rollins stated that chase had attracted a cult following and that he had always received mail about it when film airs on tv references external links category 1994 films category 1990s action comedy films
