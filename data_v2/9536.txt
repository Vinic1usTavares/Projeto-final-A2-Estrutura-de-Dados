pleasant dreams is sixth studio album by american punk rock band ramones released on july 20 1981 through sire records while band members wanted steve lillywhite to produce sire chose graham gouldman in an attempt to gain popularity through a well known producer recording process brought about many conflicts between band members most notably strife between joey ramone and johnny ramone due to johnny starting a relationship with joey s girlfriend there were also disputes about overall direction of album with johnny leaning towards hard rock and joey towards pop music ultimately album incorporated high production values and varying musical styles straying from traditional punk rock on songs such as we want airwaves she s a sensation and come on now despite sire s efforts to broaden band s appeal by enlisting gouldman to produce album was not commercially successful peaking at 58 on billboard 200 and only charting outside of us in sweden album also met with mixed critical reception conception writing process for pleasant dreams began in january 1981 with sire records management being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer to work on album they hired graham gouldman songwriter and musician for british band 10cc to produce album prior to working with gouldman ramones had recorded demos for album with audio engineer ed stasium and while band had intended for steve lillywhite to produce album this decision was rejected by sire studio recording process began on march 30 1981 and initiated several conflicts between band members this tension was partially due to dee dee ramone s drug addiction as well as marky ramone and joey ramone developing problems with alcohol resulting in frustration of johnny ramone these conflicts and differences became evident in songwriting as for first time on a ramones album each song was now credited to individual members rather than multiple members bowe 2010 p 62 time period of recording was a high point in musical style for both joey and johnny though they directed their sound towards different styles of music joey s inspiration from pop music became evident in his writing while johnny s keenness of hard rock guitar riffs are apparent in much of his performing on album johnny thought that this did not result well for band s sound saying i knew going in that this was not going to be type of album i wanted it really could have used another two of three punk songs all i want to do is keep our fans happy and not sell out i m fighting within band they are trying to go lighter looking for ways to be more commercial i m against band for doing that true 2005 p 162 bowe 2010 pp 63 64 joey countered by explaining by road to ruin and end of century i was doing majority of songwriting i started feeling that ramones were faceless there were no individual identities in band joey went on to say that while this method had worked well in beginning of their career it began to annoy him since everything he wrote band would take credit for bowe 2010 p 64 during early stages of album s development joey was dating linda daniele after album was released however daniele left joey and became johnny s girlfriend ramones road manager monte melnick relates joey was devastated it affected him deeply johnny knew it was bad and kept linda totally hidden from that point on she didn t come to many shows and if she did he d hide her in back she wouldn t come backstage he d run out to meet her and leave as soon as they were done melnick meyer 2003 p 173 bowe 2010 p 65 while johnny would eventually marry linda joey held a strong grudge against them both and though they continued to perform and tour together two rarely talked to each other joey explained that johnny had crossed line once he started dating daniele and noted that he destroyed relationship and band right there johnny defended himself by stating that had daniele not left joey for him he wouldn t have even been talking about her and saying how much he loved her because he wouldn t have been obsessed about it melnick meyer 2003 p 177 bowe 2010 pp 65 66 composition and lyrics album opens with we want airwaves which has instrumentation that strays from traditional punk rock and more towards hard rock music journalist chuck eddy described song as a sort of black sabbath punk rock eddy 2011 p 34 though it was long rumored that album s third track kkk took my baby away was written about johnny stealing joey s girlfriend loder 2011 ch end of century schinder schwartz 2008 p 554 wise 2013 ch 3 song was reportedly written some time before joey had found out about this joey s brother mickey leigh relates connection between johnny and kkk raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day at time though it had to be an unusual situation for him being that as often happens with song lyrics his words now took on a whole new meaning leigh 2010 p 216 following track don t go was described in musician player and listener as spector ish likening song s production values to those of music producer phil spector infamous producer of band s previous record end of century according to magazine

track dee dee s you sound like you re sick returns to bassist s traditional institutionalised theme side a ends with it s not my place in 9 to 5 world which was described by music critic david fricke as driven home by drummer marky s feisty bo diddley style drum beat noting that it borrows middle eight of thirty two bar form from who song whiskey man side b of album begins with she s a sensation which was said by author dave thompson to have a 1960s melody which melts through hard rock next song 7 11 deals with dating at a young age where couple goes on dates to places like convenience stores

singer s torched 7 11 joey details in time honoured girl group fashion beauty of young love that takes place among most mundane humdrum of surroundings true 2005 p 166 you didn t mean anything to me written by dee dee reflects desolation and vacillation that bassist was feeling in his personal life as well as within band this is evident through lines like every dinner was crummy even ones for free true 2005 p 167 pop oriented song come on now was described by true as a sparkling rush of blood to head from comic book boy with true adding that it was comparable to songs by dave clark five and 1910 company eleventh track on album this business is killing me was written by joey about how everyone expects him to please others but how he simply cannot please everyone all time pleasant dreams concludes with sitting in my room which david fricke quoted in conclusion of his review of album saying it s us against them sneers joey they just wanna worry they just wanna be so lame maybe they should try and sniff some glue or put pleasant dreams on box and crank it up to ten reception released on july 20 1981 album was not commercially successful failing to spawn a single hit though sire records had merged with warner bros records none of singles from pleasant dreams were released in us sire had insisted that album be produced by a celebrity producer hiring graham gouldman to job expecting this to help expand band s fan base joey relates record company told us album would bomb if we didn t use graham gouldman so we worked with graham and album bombed anyway leigh 2009 p 219 album would only chart in us and sweden peaking at 58 on billboard 200 and 35 on sverigetopplistan chart with singles released from album failing to chart pleasant dreams received mixed reviews from critics with many pointing out that high quality sound production made band stray from their roots even more so than change in style stephen thomas erlewine senior editor for allmusic noted that gouldman steers band s style away from bubblegum british invasion and surf fetishes and toward acid rock and heavy metal he went on to say that sound quality was too clean to qualify as punk and that music on album had lost sight of infectious qualities that made their earlier records such fun music critic robert christgau said that album comes off corny compared to band s first four releases which he described as aural rush and conceptual punch while he felt that songs featured on album were better than those on end of century he claimed album was less focused compared to leave home but fun anyway david fricke of rolling stone began his review by writing pity poor ramones and went on to give it a mixed review he deemed album a comic relief and noted its contents of fortified vocal harmonies an occasional dash of keyboards a certain production gimmickry track listing track listing adapted from allmusic all tracks written by joey ramone except where noted all tracks written by
