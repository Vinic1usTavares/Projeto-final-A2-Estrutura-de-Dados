family after playing locally he made his yorkshire debut in 1920 and appeared intermittently in following two seasons although not statistically successful he impressed judges at club and was a regular member of team from 1923 he steadily improved over following seasons to reach fringes of england team and made his test debut in 1928 against west indies that winter he toured australia a controversial decision as he replaced famous batsman frank woolley and scored a century in his only test of series he remained in side until 1930 but a loss of form in next two seasons called his place into question he recovered by scoring 1 000 runs in august 1932 to secure his inclusion in team to tour australia in 1932 33 during that series leyland scored runs several times under pressure and by time australia toured england in 1934 he was a leading batsman in team he held his place until 1938 when he was replaced in team by younger batsmen for series against australia recalled for final match he scored 187 his highest test score in what became his last match after military service in second world war leyland returned to yorkshire team for one season before announcing his retirement from regular first class cricket he maintained his connection with yorkshire and served as county coach between 1950 and 1963 he died in 1967 although he was neither aesthetically nor technically among best batsmen leyland had a reputation for batting well under pressure he performed most effectively against best teams and bowlers and in difficult situations his test batting record is better than his first class figures and against australia his average is even higher outside of tests he had some success with ball and had it not been for depth of spin bowling in yorkshire he might have been a leading bowler he was one of first to bowl left arm wrist spin and may have invented name to describe such deliveries chinamen very popular with team mates and spectators leyland had a reputation as a humorist and many stories were told about him early life and career leyland was born on 20 july 1900 in bilton an area of harrogate to mercy nee lambert and edward ted leyland he was registered at birth as morris leyland but his name was usually spelt maurice his father was a stonemason and a well respected professional cricketer for moorside in lancashire leyland senior also acted as moorside s groundsman and in later years continued that role at harrogate headingley cricket ground and edgbaston leyland junior joined his father in moorside team in 1912 hodgson p 115 and by age of fourteen had graduated to lancashire league after military service in first world war he became a professional cricketer for harrogate between 1918 and 1920 from there he made appearances for yorkshire council and yorkshire s second team for whom he bowled regularly when he reached first team he bowled infrequently in his first seasons around this time he also played football for harrogate during early 1920s yorkshire committee was attempting to find players to replace those whose careers had ended with first world war late in 1920 season leyland made his first class debut for yorkshire having played several times in second team that summer he played once against essex scoring ten runs in his only innings but this was his sole appearance that year he had never previously attended a county championship game following year leyland played in five first team matches scoring 52 not out against leicestershire averaging just over 19 for season in latter part of 1922 season he played more regularly replacing norman kilner in team although leyland s batting figures were unimpressive summary of yorkshire s season in wisden cricketers almanack said he gave signs of promise as a forcing batsman and fielded very finely his highest score in 14 matches was 29 but he was awarded his county cap and critics within yorkshire judged him to have great potential established county cricketer leyland played regularly in 1923 season and reached 1 000 runs in first class cricket a total he exceeded in each of seventeen seasons between 1923 and outbreak of war in 1939 in 1923 he scored seven fifties and averaged 27 89 wisden suggested that he would become a leading left handed batsman and that his future seems assured in his history of yorkshire county cricket club anthony woodhouse states that leyland gained valuable experience as part of a successful batting side woodhouse 1989 p 326 during this period yorkshire won county championship in four successive seasons from 1922 to 1925 a later review of leyland s career in wisden suggested that this team was one of yorkshire s strongest but sometimes became over competitive and aggressive review stated that this environment was a hard school for a young cricketer but leyland thrived on such discipline and he has never lost his laugh by beginning of 1924 season leyland was recognised in times as one of most promising young professional batsmen in england newspaper s cricket correspondent noted that leyland is fully expected in yorkshire to develop into a first rate left handed batsman he continued to improve that season woodhouse 1989 pp 332 33 scoring 1 259 runs at 30 70 in august he scored his first century in first class cricket hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against lancashire later in month he scored another century leyland further improved his record in 1925 hitting 1 572 runs at 40 30 wisden commented leyland still further increased big reputation he had made in previous summer and ought if all goes well with him to attain highest distinction by end of 1926 season in which he scored 1 561 runs at 39 02 and hit five centuries leyland had established himself as one of most reliable batsmen in yorkshire team following example of wilfred rhodes several yorkshire cricketers in 1920s spent english winters coaching in india for maharaja of patiala leyland coached in winter of 1926 27 along with arthur dolphin yorkshire wicketkeeper that same winter a marylebone cricket club mcc team toured india although not chosen in touring party both leyland and dolphin played a handful of matches for mcc during 1927 season leyland scored 1 625 runs at 41 66 and against middlesex scored his first double century wisden suggested that he was not so dependable as could have been desired but batted in an entertaining fashion in august he was selected in a trial game to assess players who might represent england in test matches he played against england team for a side named rest and scored 102 in winter of 1927 28 leyland once more coached in india for maharajah of patiala shortly after returning from india leyland married constance connie russell in harrogate on 29 march 1928 in later years connie looked after children of herbert sutcliffe during yorkshire matches at harrogate when their behaviour became too much for their own mother sutcliffe s daughter later recalled connie as very stern and cross and only person who could control her and her brother i was frightened to death hill p 82 test match cricketer test debut and selection for australian tour thumb upright death of roy kilner left yorkshire attack weakened and led to leyland bowling more frequently alt a cricketer wearing a blazer like leyland yorkshire bowler roy kilner coached in india during 1927 28 however in doing so kilner contracted a fever and died shortly after returning to england with a weakened bowling attack and affected by injuries and loss of form yorkshire pressed leyland into service as an occasional bowler in 1928 season he had done little bowling for yorkshire at this point team possessed two slow left arm spinners in kilner and rhodes leaving leyland with little opportunity having never bowled 50 first class overs in a previous season nor taken more than four wickets he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets at an average of 34 20 at this stage yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on kilner s bowling workload or succeed rhodes in senior spinner s position gibson p 141 leyland also had his most effective season with bat he scored 1 783 runs at an average of 54 03 and scored another double century at end of season wisden commented leyland can play both games dogged defence when a bad position must be saved and a fine forcing game when it is necessary to make runs quickly in ordinary way his preference is for attack and he is a delightful batsman to watch during june 1928 leyland was selected for another test trial playing for rest against england then in mid july he played for players against gentlemen at lord s cricket ground at end of july mcc named team to tour australia for 1928 29 ashes series leyland was included in team according to times it would have been difficult to leave him out and his presence lifted fielding ability of side his selection was controversial in south of england and particularly in kent as he took place that veteran kent batsman frank woolley was expected to fill gibson pp 141 42 one kent supporter wrote that leyland was a cross bat village greener lemmon p 75 pelham warner a selector at time claimed that leyland s superior fielding influenced decision but cricket writer alan gibson suggests that real choice was between woolley and phil mead two batsmen of similar age gibson p 142 in 1928 west indies toured england playing their first test matches team did not perform well but england selectors picked strong teams to provide practice for players leyland was selected for last of three test matches making his debut on 11 august 1928 he was dismissed for 0 by herman griffith in his only innings mcc team which toured australia was extremely strong in batting and leyland served as back up to main batsmen douglas p 64 english batting line up was settled for most of series leaving little opportunity for back ups although mead played in first test he was subsequently left out to strengthen bowling lemmon pp 79 83 playing in other first class matches on tour leyland scored centuries against south australia and queensland with england 4 0 ahead in series chapman stood down from final test although it is not clear why he did so one possibility is that he wished to give as many members of team as possible a chance to appear in tests alternatively he may have felt that his batting form did not warrant a place in team whatever reason leyland took his place lemmon pp 90 92 douglas p 83 england lost match but leyland was successful he scored 137 his first test century and 53 not out report in wisden stated he distinguished himself by two really delightful displays his exhibition of powerful well timed driving past cover point will long be remembered by those who saw it overall in first class matches on tour he scored 614 runs at 43 85 but his bowling was ineffective on hard pitches following his success in last test leyland was expected to become one of leading english batsmen and before 1929 season he was named one of wisden cricketers of year for his performances in 1928 season test regular leyland scored 1 931 runs at 42 91 in 1929 and took 50 first class wickets in season at an average of 30 26 in match against oxford university he took eight wickets and against glamorgan he took five wickets in an innings for first time in his career against lancashire in a match which rhodes missed with injury leyland took role of main spinner and returned figures of seven wickets for 52 runs after watching this performance cricket writer neville cardus judged that leyland had bowled well and with spirit on a wet pitch which favoured spin bowling but that he lacked accuracy and flight required in left arm spin bowlers and exemplified by rhodes cardus 1982 pp 272 76 in another game cardus observed that leyland seemed to be attempting left handed googly bowling hodgson p 127 cardus 1982 p 263 following success in a trial game leyland kept his place in test team playing all five matches against south africa that summer to score 294 runs at an average of 42 00 in second test played at lord s he scored 73 and 102 leyland did not play in first two matches of 1930 ashes series woolley replaced him in team but was unsuccessful and leyland came in for final three games gibson p 143 leyland was little more effective and his highest score in series was 44 england lost 2 1 more successful for yorkshire he scored five centuries for county and hit his highest score of season against lancashire eventual county champions for 1930 at time yorkshire v lancashire matches were mainly dour slow scoring affairs but leyland played freely to score 211 not out in around 270 minutes he hit two sixes in one over cardus 1982 pp 284 86 290 and according to cardus played great and beautiful cricket cardus 1982 p 286 leyland s best bowling performance that year came for players against gentlemen at lord s when he took seven for 94 in first innings and nine wickets in match in all first class matches in 1930 he scored 2 175 runs at an average of 50 58 first time he reached 2 000 runs in a season and took 53 wickets at 27 92 during 1930 31 english winter he toured south africa with an mcc team owing to absence of a regular opening batsman leyland opened batting on several occasions and performed consistently during tour in first class matches he scored 774 runs at 36 85 and took nine wickets in test series he scored 300 runs at 42 85 twice passing fifty in second game he took three for 91 his best bowling performance in test matches bodyline tour leyland struggled in following two seasons in 1931 he scored just one century as his aggregate and average 1 228 runs at 38 37 both fell although his increasing habit of succeeding against best opposition continued when he scored 96 for yorkshire against rest of england with ball he took 12 wickets at an average over 40 despite his loss of form yorkshire won county championship for first time since 1925 team were also champions in next two seasons and went on to win seven out of nine championships before second world war leyland played for players against gentlemen but was not selected for any of tests in three match series between england and new zealand wisden later suggested that he was stale at time in reviewing candidates to tour australia in 1932 33 wisden editor believed that no reason exists why leyland should not regain his best form thumb 350px left a team photograph of england s 1932 33 side leyland is in middle of back row alt a cricket team arranged in three rows seventeen men are dressed as players other three men are in suits at beginning of 1932 season leyland continued to struggle although he was chosen in two test trial matches and scored 189 against middlesex he was left out of england team for only test of summer and had little success in first three months of season however in august he made 1 013 runs at 84 14 scoring four centuries and two innings over 90 during this spell leyland shared a partnership of 149 runs in 55 minutes with herbert sutcliffe against essex that county had chosen two fast bowlers in an attempt to intimidate yorkshire batsmen ken farnes and morris nichols bowled a succession of bouncers farnes attempted fast leg theory bowling a tactic which developed into bodyline during mcc tour of australia in 1932 33 frith p 49 eventually sutcliffe began to hook short ball and in six successive overs he and leyland added 102 runs an unusually fast rate of scoring leyland faced little of bowling later remembering that he received only four deliveries in this period hitting each for four in total he contributed only 45 runs to partnership hill p 136 farnes was reduced to tears by assault on his bowling hill p 137 and these events possibly persuaded mcc selectors to leave him out of team for 1932 33 tour leyland on other hand was among last names added to touring party in mid august at end of season he scored 105 against rest of england for yorkshire his team playing as county champions in total he scored 1 980 runs at 52 10 and took 23 wickets at 20 86 england won 1932 33 ashes series 4 1 but cricket was overshadowed by controversy over team s use of bodyline tactics leyland was not particularly successful in statistical terms however assessing tour in wisden sydney southerton wrote that leyland fared on whole extremely well he had batted finely in test matches at adelaide and brisbane he scored 306 runs in five test matches at an average of 34 00 he began and ended series with scores of 0 but played innings of 83 and 86 in decisive third and fourth test matches with his team under pressure when he batted gibson points out that both of his ducks came when england were in dominant positions in all first class matches on tour leyland scored 880 runs at 44 00 including two centuries against state teams former australian batsmen charlie macartney suggested that although a useful player leyland was hindered by his defensive approach going against his naturally aggressive approach made him seem awkward and never allowed him to play at his best other australian commentators had a more favourable opinion peak years returning from australia leyland scored 2 317 first class runs in 1933 season highest seasonal aggregate of his career averaging 50 36 he scored seven centuries with ball he took 37 wickets at 28 13 in a game against leicestershire in august he took ten wickets for 94 runs only time in his career he took ten wickets in a match west indies team toured england that season but leyland played only in first test he scored one run in his single innings leyland also scored over 2 000 first class runs in 1934 at an average of 53 55 playing all five test matches of series against touring australian team he scored 478 runs at an average of 68 28 his three centuries were scored when england were in difficult situations a wisden review of his career written in 1943 stated in 1934 leyland reached height of his powers ripe in technique rich in experience like granite in battle he was in this season england s greatest batsman england lost series 2 1 australians were heavily dependent on bowling of clarrie grimmett and bill o reilly at time o reilly was regarded as best bowler in world and among greatest of all time but leyland began a spell of relative dominance over him cardus 1979 p 129 in second test leyland scored 109 and shared a partnership of 129 with les ames in next match he hit 153 runs sharing large partnerships with patsy hendren and ames and in final test he played an innings of 110 however rest of england batting was unreliable reviewing season wisden editor sydney southerton wrote in nearly every match either hendren leyland or ames instead of being able to go in and play a free confident game had to save or remedy a position seriously damaged by quick fall of two or three wickets in addition to his batting successes leyland was generally best outfielder in england team he also scored three centuries for yorkshire another for rest of england against lancashire champion county and 80 for players against gentlemen at lord s with ball he took 33 first class wickets he was given a benefit match against nottinghamshire his benefit eventually raised ps3 648 at time third highest amount raised for a yorkshire player hodgson p 251 during winter of 1934 35 leyland toured west indies with an mcc team which lost four test series 2 1 english batsmen were overwhelmed by pace bowlers of west indies team and some mcc players complained that learie constantine manny martindale and leslie hylton intimidated visiting batsmen with short pitched bowling leyland played three tests but scored only 36 runs in six innings more successful in other first class games he scored 347 runs at 21 68 overall and took 11 wickets he scored 1 815 runs at an average of 38 61 in 1935 and took 32 wickets at 25 46 he played in four of five tests against south africa he missed third with lumbago to score 342 runs at 57 00 in first and fourth tests he hit fifties and in final match scored 161 runs in 130 minutes batting quickly throughout however england could not force a win and having lost second test were beaten 1 0 in series after taking part in a tour of jamaica by yorkshire team on which he scored 115 and 75 in successive games leyland scored 1 790 runs at 45 89 in 1936 he hit seven centuries including an innings of 263 runs against essex in season highest first class score of his career he played in two of three tests against india that season he missed second with injury but only batted twice in first test he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when england were in a difficult position home side won series 2 0 during season leyland was among first players chosen to tour australia with mcc in forthcoming winter mcc team was captained by g o b allen who added leyland to team selection committee during tour team won first two tests but lost next three to lose series 3 2 and wisden blamed a weakness in batting for defeat leyland was one of few batsmen excused leyland though very restrained was one of mainstays of batting before series england were expected to struggle severely against bowling of o reilly according to cardus leyland told o reilly before first test ah can tell thi one thing now for certain ah s got thee where ah wants thi bill and ah thinks tha knows it in first test leyland scored 126 after team lost first three wickets for 20 runs many critics judged this to be his greatest innings gibson p 144 at this point he had scored four centuries in seven test innings against australia he played an effective defensive innings in second innings and another in second test when he was criticised for slow scoring then in third test on a pitch made exceptionally difficult for batsmen by rain england could only score 76 for nine leyland scored 17 of those runs and according to wisden was one real success for england he never seemed in difficulties in second innings he scored a century in total in five test matches he scored 441 runs at an average of 55 12 australian critics viewed leyland as one of england s best batsmen and gave him credit for england s strong showing early in series in all first class games on tour he scored 902 runs at 50 11 he was unsuccessful in three games team played in new zealand on completion of main tour last years as a cricketer leyland missed a substantial amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger barely playing in july and missing test series against new zealand he scored 1 306 runs at 36 27 and took 19 wickets injuries continued to trouble him in 1938 he scored 1 884 first class runs at 43 81 but a shoulder strain early in season adversely affected his form he was not selected for first three tests against australia not least as england side contained several promising batsmen however he had his best season with ball a succession of hard dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and leyland took 63 wickets at 19 32 gibson p 145 early in season he took eight for 63 against hampshire best figures of his career just as his batting form returned and when he was likely to be recalled to england side leyland broke his thumb in a match against middlesex however he recovered in time to play in final test of series australia s victory in fourth test had given team a 1 0 lead wisden commented inclusion once again of leyland was a move which yielded splendid results coming in to bat at number three leyland shared a partnership of 382 with len hutton at time a record english test partnership for any wicket as of 2013 it remains england s highest partnership for second wicket and highest for any wicket against australia as there was no time limit on match leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six and a half hours before he was run out hutton went on to score 364 at time highest score in tests england had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate bowlers and cardus expressed his frustration to leyland during an interval in play cardus wrote and even you maurice i complained in sorrow not anger even you won t hit ball and give us some cricket hey wait a minute mr cardus leyland as though pained at my protest wait a minute tha must remember that ah m playing for me place in team england went on to win match and level series leyland s innings was his highest in tests but this was his final match for england in 41 tests he scored 2 764 runs at 46 06 and took six wickets in 1939 last season before second world war leyland scored 1 238 runs at 39 93 and took 23 wickets he served in army during war first as a sergeant instructor and was later commissioned as lieutenant between his army duties he played cricket in bradford league and played for various wartime teams including ones representing army in 1945 he played some non first class games for teams representing yorkshire and a first class game for yorkshire against lancashire choosing to continue his career after war to help yorkshire team become re established leyland played a last full season in 1946 when he scored 632 runs at 21 06 with a highest score of 88 and took 16 wickets at 14 70 against warwickshire he took seven for 36 during august 1946 he announced his retirement but in following two seasons he appeared in some end of season first class games he ended his first class career in 1948 with 33 660 runs at 40 50 and 466 wickets at 29 31 later life after his retirement from yorkshire team leyland returned to play for harrogate until 1950 woodhouse 1989 p 317 when he became chief coach along with arthur mitchell at yorkshire thomson p 129 gibson p 146 mitchell was a dour serious man but contrast with leyland made an effective partnership leyland also served as a representative of paper manufacturers thomas owen hill p 186 in 1949 he was among first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of mcc he continued as a respected coach of yorkshire until illness forced his retirement in 1963 suffering from parkinson s disease he maintained some connections with yorkshire cricket and always tried to attend matches played at harrogate in recognition of his achievements harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour leyland died in a hospital at knaresborough on 1 january 1967 style technique and personality thumb leyland practising batting in 1936 alt a left handed cricketer hitting ball as a batsman leyland generally batted in middle order or occasionally opened batting early in his career commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty even when he was statistically successful his use of cut shot was mistrusted by some yorkshire critics and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his yorkshire contemporaries cardus suggested that instead he was in line of humorous yorkshiremen which broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and leavening of generally dour lump there was a twinkle in his eye and there was a twinkle in his bat no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in yorkshire cricket writer e w swanton observed that leyland s bat was often not straight when he played his shots contrary to orthodox technique but speed of his footwork and his ability to watch ball closely made up for any lapses swanton p 38 opposing bowlers suggested that impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit ball although leyland was not a stylish batsman he was effective cardus described him as a sturdy cricketer not tall but his sloping bottle neck shoulders seemed to add inches to him and he had long arms of impressive thickness veined with strength at wrist also he was broad in beam with a smile on his cheerful open countenance cardus 1979 p 130 he was a good driver of ball with a high backlift and moved quickly and economically to reach pitch of ball cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character he put his nature into every stroke and as soon as he had got bowling where he wanted it he didn t merely hit or drive it he walloped it cardus 1979 p 131 at times leyland s desire to score quickly brought about his dismissal however when necessary he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed ball with his bat critics judged leyland a better test than county batsman swanton p 39 his first class batting figures were not exceptional compared to other cricketers who played far fewer test matches gibson pp 140 41 but in tests his average is six runs an innings higher against australia strongest of england s opponents during his career he averaged 56 a further increase of ten runs gibson suggests that he rose to big occasions and that he performed best against toughest opponents according to leyland s obituary in times he was essentially a man for big occasion a batsman at his best in a crisis and his favourite game was a roses match or an australian test england s supporters often breathed a sigh of relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to wicket writer r c robertson glasgow suggested that leyland in a test match was like four of ancient or romantic times he was horatius on tottering bridge hector who alone stood between troy and destruction he was born to rescue but he is more dangerous than those who are stubborn or grim he has something of d artagnan in him there is a gaiety besides simplicity and strength seen in slight list of cap and in a certain and optimism of gait robertson glasgow p 19 although he did not have to face top class fast bowling in test matches he was successful against english fast bowlers such as harold larwood in county cricket and he established his ascendancy over o reilly world s best bowler at time cardus 1979 pp 132 33 on one occasion o reilly held his head in his hands when he saw leyland come out to bat and was heard to say oh it s that bloody yorkshireman again in later years o reilly vigorously denied that leyland held upper hand responding to such suggestions by saying you just check how many times i got him out frith p 156 cricket historian david frith points out that answer is nine times in 16 tests but with decreasing frequency in their test encounters leyland made 1 412 runs at an average of 56 robertson glasgow noted that leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure he came to life in more difficult circumstances his element was foul weather he would disappear into haze of bramall lane where a sterner sort of game was being played under name of cricket and entrench himself among sawdust and smoke and off breaks and appeals and do his raw tough work in silence leyland was regarded by critics as a good fielder in almost any position he bowled left arm spin but contrary to orthodox practice for a left arm spinner to use his fingers to spin ball usually bowled ball from back of his hand delivery known as chinaman he did not take bowling seriously but enjoyed it in this role he was effective at times but other players were used in main spinner s role for yorkshire in preference to him and he was generally used as back up for example when other bowlers had failed to dismiss well set batsmen his wisden obituary suggests that had he played for another county he might have developed into a world class all rounder his lack of opportunity prompted him to experiment with wrist spin and he later claimed that he originated term chinaman to describe delivery wisden suggests whenever two batsmen were difficult to shift or something different was wanted someone in yorkshire team would say put on maurice to bowl some of those chinese things roy kilner explained it s foreign stuff and you can t call it anything else another version was leyland believed that particular delivery was only good enough to get chinese out however there are several theories over how delivery came to be named leyland was noted as a humorist in his playing days many stories are associated with him although some are probably apocryphal he told stories against himself one story concerned his dismissal during a wartime match in which he was out to a terrible delivery from a bowler who was badly out of practice leyland hit ball in air and was caught he ruefully commented you know i don t get much practice against that stuff another time he described how he faced an over from o reilly as related in his obituary in cricketer first he bowled me an off break then he bowled me a leg break then his googly then a bumper then one that went with his arm but that s only five maurice what about last one oh that said maurice deprecatingly that was a straight un and it bowled me among his team mates leyland was known as or turnip possibly a reference to his country upbringing robertson glasgow and cardus wrote prolifically on leyland gibson suggests that these pieces are among their best work leyland was popular with team mates opponents and spectators around
