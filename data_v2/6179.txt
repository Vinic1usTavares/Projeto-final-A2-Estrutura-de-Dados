1950 atlantic hurricane season was first year in atlantic hurricane database hurdat that storms were given names in atlantic basin names were taken from joint army navy phonetic alphabet with first named storm being designated able second baker and so on it was an active season with sixteen tropical storms with eleven of them developing into hurricanes six of these hurricanes were intense enough to be classified as major hurricanes a denomination reserved for storms that attained sustained winds equivalent to a category 3 or greater on present day saffir simpson scale one storm twelfth of season was unnamed and was originally excluded from yearly summary and three additional storms were discovered in re analysis large quantity of strong storms during year yielded prior to modern reanalysis what was highest seasonal accumulated cyclone energy ace of 20th century in atlantic basin 1950 held seasonal ace record until broken by 2005 atlantic hurricane season however later examination by researchers determined that several storms in 1950 season were weaker than thought leading to a lower ace than assessed originally tropical cyclones of season produced a total of 88 fatalities and 38 5 million in property damage 1950 usd first officially named atlantic hurricane was hurricane able which formed on august 12 brushed north carolina coastline and later moved across atlantic canada strongest hurricane of season hurricane dog reached equivalent of a category 4 hurricane on saffir simpson scale and caused extensive damage to leeward islands two major hurricanes affected florida easy produced highest 24 hour rainfall total recorded in united states while king struck downtown miami as a category 4 hurricane and caused 27 75 million 1950 usd of damage two major landfalls made 1945 1950 period only five year period to feature five major hurricane landfalls in united states a record that held until tied in 2000 2005 last storm of year an unnamed tropical storm dissipated on november 13 seasonal summary season officially began on june 15 and ended on november 15 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin this season was first time that united states weather bureau operated with radar technology to observe hurricanes away from land although season began on june 15 tropical activity typically does not begin before august tropics remained tranquil through early august and u s weather bureau noted that season had been remarkably quiet inactive period ended on august 12 when first tropical storm developed east of lesser antilles this storm received name able as part of joint army navy phonetic alphabet same alphabet was also used in 1951 and 1952 seasons before being replaced by female naming in 1953 before end of august four hurricanes had formed in atlantic two of which attained major hurricane status a major hurricane is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least a storm of this intensity would be classified as a category 3 or greater on saffir simpson hurricane scale introduced in 1970s in contrast to busy august only three named storms developed in september although three of august hurricanes lasted into september hurricane dog became strongest hurricane of season on september 6 with winds of its peak strength occurred over open atlantic ocean so it did not cause significant damage when it was at its strongest it was among most severe hurricanes on record in antigua where hurricane struck early in its duration eight tropical storms or hurricanes formed in october which is greater than in any other year in total there were sixteen tropical storms during season of which five tropical storm how tropical storm mike and three unnamed tropical storms did not attain hurricane status overall six major hurricanes occurred during year hurricane hunters made about 300 flights into hurricanes during season most since practice began in 1943 number of storms was above average in a typical year eleven tropical storms six hurricanes and between two and three major hurricanes take place with numerous major hurricanes season produced a high accumulated cyclone energy ace of 211 although it was originally assessed as 243 before reanalysis at one point 1950 total was highest on record before being surpassed by 2005 season this value is an approximation of combined kinetic energy used by all tropical cyclones throughout season systems hurricane able beginning of hurricane season was inactive with formation of no tropical cyclones during june or july first storm of year originated from a tropical wave that exited west coast of africa around august 5 its status over next few days were unknown due to sparse observations on august 12 system was designated tropical storm able east of lesser antilles which strengthened to hurricane status on august 14 able gradually intensified as it tracked generally west northwestward and by 12 00 utc on august 17 able became a major hurricane initially able was thought to pose a threat to bahamas and florida instead hurricane turned to northwest reaching its peak intensity as a strong category 3 hurricane with winds of storm later turned to northeast passing just offshore cape hatteras north carolina and cape cod steadily weakening and accelerating able struck nova scotia as a minimal hurricane and later struck newfoundland as an extratropical storm it dissipated early on august 24 in far northern atlantic ocean along coast of north carolina hurricane produced light winds and rough waves as well as moderate precipitation heavier rainfall occurred in southern new england causing flooding in portions of new york city and producing slick roads that caused nine traffic fatalities able produced hurricane force winds in nova scotia and damage across canada totaled over 1 million 1950 cad usd in agriculture communications and fishing industries two people died in canada when their raft was overturned hurricane baker a tropical wave exited western africa on august 13 which developed into tropical storm baker east of lesser antilles on august 18 it moved northwestward and later turned to west attaining hurricane status on august 21 next day hurricane attained category 2 intensity just as it crossed over antigua where heavy damage was reported more than 100 homes were damaged or destroyed which left thousands homeless afterward hurricane began to weaken and later on august 22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status cyclone then struck montserrat as a strong tropical storm next day it struck southwestern puerto rico and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression passing over dominican republic baker turned more to west re attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern cuba on august 24 in cuba 37 people died and property losses reached several million dollars on august 25 baker weakened to tropical depression status while crossing cuba but soon thereafter regained tropical storm intensity in western caribbean sea two days later baker entered gulf of mexico and by next day baker had regained hurricane status it turned northward reaching a peak intensity of on august 30 baker weakened slightly before making landfall near gulf shores alabama with winds of on august 31 property and crop damage totaled 2 55 million 1950 usd primarily between mobile alabama and saint marks florida torrential rainfall fell throughout region with largest total occurring in caryville florida where of precipitation were recorded heavy precipitation was responsible for extensive crop damage across region hurricane also spawned two tornadoes one of which destroyed four houses and a building in apalachicola florida in birmingham alabama high wind downed power lines which caused one death and two injuries due to live wires while inland baker tracked northwestward and eventually dissipated over southeastern missouri on september 1 hurricane charlie hurricane charlie developed on august 21 to southwest of cape verde islands at time weather bureau did not consider charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later for four days storm tracked generally to west as a weak tropical storm on august 25 it turned to northwest and intensified becoming a hurricane on august 28 on august 30 charlie attained peak winds of although hurricane hunters estimated higher winds at time hurricane was stalled to east southeast of bermuda and subsequently turned to a westward drift on september 2 charlie turned to north and northeast at time it co existed with two other hurricanes dog and easy it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in atlantic charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics and by september 5 charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about southeast of halifax nova scotia it dissipated later on september 5 without having affected land hurricane dog hurricane dog is believed to have developed from a tropical wave that left coast of africa on august 24 its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on august 30 when it was a hurricane storm is believed to have begun farther east as a cape verde type hurricane but was not detectable before august 30 at time dog was located east of lesser antilles and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to west northwest dog passed through lesser antilles with winds of it was considered among worst hurricanes in history of antigua where thousands were left homeless damage was estimated at 1 million 1950 usd usd and there were two deaths from drowning in region after passing through leeward islands hurricane turned to a northerly drift with continued intensification on september 5 it attained wind speeds that would be equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on present day saffir simpson scale with sustained winds of operationally wind intensity value was estimated by hurricane hunters at when hurricane was located about south southwest of bermuda this estimate is now believed to have been an overestimation of peak winds in hurricane dog though storm produced enormous wave heights at sea maintaining peak intensity for about 18 hours dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to west it accelerated to north on september 10 and two days later dog passed within of cape cod newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in mid atlantic states which resulted in five deaths to hurricane further north hurricane killed 12 people in new england and produced a total of 2 million 1950 usd usd of property damage twelve others died in two shipwrecks off coast of canada hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone maintaining hurricane force winds while passing south of nova scotia and eventually hitting scotland with hurricane force gusts on september 18 hurricane easy hurricane easy developed on september 1 from a trough in western caribbean which persisted after hurricane baker moved through region in late august moving northeastward hurricane crossed cuba on september 3 and entered gulf of mexico easy turned to northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a category 3 hurricane at time easy was located just off west coast of florida however a ridge to its north caused hurricane to stall execute a small loop and make landfall near cedar key following landfall easy moved offshore turned to southeast and made a second landfall near hernando beach on september 6 hurricane turned northwestward over florida peninsula and gradually weakened as it moved into georgia and southeastern united states on september 9 easy dissipated over northeastern arkansas damage in cuba was minor although large portions of western florida experienced hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall yankeetown reported of precipitation in 24 hours which at time was largest 24 hour rainfall total on record in united states cumulative total rainfall on yankeetown from easy was which still retains record for wettest tropical cyclone in florida damage was heaviest in cedar key where half of houses were destroyed and most of remaining were damaged rainfall caused heavy crop damage in region across state easy caused 3 million in damage 1950 usd total was less than expected due to sparse population of affected area additionally hurricane was indirectly responsible for two deaths by electrocution at time easy was also known as cedar keys hurricane hurricane fox on september 8 tropical storm fox was present in open atlantic ocean between lesser antilles and cape verde likely originating from a tropical wave hurricane fox was first discovered by hurricane hunters on september 10 when it was located about east of puerto rico a small system hurricane moved generally northwestward and gradually intensified after turning toward north fox reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of on september 14 as it passed about east of bermuda following its peak intensity hurricane accelerated to north and northeast by september 17 fox had lost all tropical characteristics and later that day circulation dissipated about halfway between azores and newfoundland fox never affected land along its path when fox dissipated it was first time in 36 days without an active tropical cyclone in atlantic ocean hurricane george tropical storm george originated on september 27 from a strong tropical wave northeast of lesser antilles and southeast of bermuda a large system it moved to northwest and later west northwest george began strengthening on september 30 as it decreased its forward speed next day while remaining nearly stationary south of bermuda a nearby ship reported that george had reached hurricane status it continued moving very slowly passing only south of bermuda island experienced winds of aside from rainbands little impact was reported on bermuda hurricane passed west of bermuda on october 3 a day later george reached its maximum intensity attaining sustained winds of in its small eye an air force hurricane hunter plane measured a central pressure of it accelerated to north and later to northeast and on october 5 george transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter it passed just south of newfoundland and on october 7 remnants of george dissipated south of iceland tropical storm how a weak trough existed in eastern gulf of mexico on september 29 a circulation developed within storm becoming a tropical depression on october 1 later that day system intensified into tropical storm how initially tropical storm moved west northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by october 2 estimated at officials advised small boats to remain at port along louisiana coast due to storm on october 3 tropical storm how turned toward southwest as it began weakening and next day it moved ashore near la pesca tamaulipas as a tropical depression about six hours after making landfall how dissipated over sierra madre oriental in northeastern mexico how was only named storm in season not to attain hurricane status hurricane item on october 4 a trough was present in western caribbean sea and was possibly a tropical cyclone moving northwest system crossed yucatan peninsula and became disrupted while also associating with a cold front it emerged into gulf of mexico on october 7 and became more defined on next day system developed into tropical storm item off northwest coast of yucatan peninsula storm moved to southwest and intensified into a hurricane on october 9 reaching peak winds of on next day based on hurricane hunters observations it is possible that item was stronger due to storm s small size but lack of direct observations on october 11 hurricane made landfall at 04 00 utc near nautla veracruz with peak gusts of hurricane quickly dissipated over land in sparsely populated area where item moved ashore hurricane dropped heavy rainfall newspaper reports considered it worst storm to hit mexico in ten years with damage in veracruz totaling around 1 5 million 1950 usd usd strong winds sank 20 ships and although there were no reports of casualties item caused 15 injuries communications were disrupted across region and downed trees blocked roads near winds damaged large areas of banana plantations hurricane jig a tropical storm was first observed on october 11 in central atlantic ocean northeast of lesser antilles and southeast of bermuda two days later a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop indicating a hurricane was in region tropical cyclone was given name jig it moved northwestward steadily intensifying before turning to north and northeast on october 15 hurricane jig passed about east of bermuda and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of although intensity was uncertain based on estimates from hurricane hunters hurricane began weakening on october 16 jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated never having affected land due to its small size hurricane king a trough was present in western caribbean on october 11 it is estimated that a tropical depression developed just off north coast of honduras on october 13 which moved northeastward and intensified into tropical storm king next day tropical storm was a small weather system throughout its duration on october 16 king reached hurricane strength while passing between jamaica and cayman islands next day king struck cuba near camaguey cuba with winds of equivalent to an upper end category 1 hurricane hurricane killed seven people and caused 2 million 1950 usd usd in damage throughout country after crossing cuba king rapidly deepened as it turned toward south florida becoming sixth and final major hurricane of season on october 18 king made landfall around 04 30 utc on october 18 with estimated winds of or a category 4 on saffir simpson scale it was most severe hurricane to impact city since 1926 miami hurricane as it approached miami hurricane had a radius of maximum winds of and a minimum pressure of was reported as king moved across city swath of destructive winds was only likened to a small tornado early on october 19 king weakened to tropical storm status over north central florida and on next day it dissipated over western georgia there was one additional death in georgia across florida damage totaled 27 75 million 1950 usd usd of which 15 million 1950 usd usd was in miami metropolitan area a preliminary survey indicated there were 12 290 houses damaged in region with an additional eight destroyed along its path through state strong winds were observed around lake okeechobee with a gust in clewiston overall there were three deaths in state tropical storm twelve a tropical storm was present in east central atlantic on october 17 it moved northwestward at first before turning to northeast on october 19 when it was already a small compact tropical cyclone storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward azores and it reached a peak intensity of on october 21 maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through southern azores it turned to southeast weakening to tropical depression status on october 24 subsequently system turned to south and quickly dissipated this tropical storm was not included in monthly weather review s summary of 1950 hurricane season and it was added to atlantic hurricane database in 1959 hurricane love in wake of hurricane king moving northward through florida an area of low pressure developed into a tropical cyclone on october 18 south of louisiana this storm was given name love and quickly strengthened reaching hurricane status shortly thereafter storm initially moved westward across gulf of mexico but soon swung southward into central portion of gulf on october 19 hurricane love s maximum sustained winds are believed to have reached their peak intensity early on october 20 throughout hurricane s track dry air infringed on western side of tropical cyclone s circulation which produced unfavorable conditions for additional tropical cyclogenesis on october 20 storm began curving northeastward towards coast of western florida however dry air completely circled love s center of circulation drastically weakening cyclone in process on october 21 love weakened to a tropical storm and it struck big bend region of florida north of cedar key at time its winds were only of moderate gale force and storm degenerated into a trough of low pressure shortly thereafter this combined with an approaching cold front to produce a powerful extratropical storm certain areas began preparing for storm along florida s west coast hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure and some coastal residents left their homes initially storm was forecast to strike tampa area but missed to north as it weakened it reportedly left little damage in sparsely populated land where it made landfall tropical storm mike a westerly moving trough was evident in east central atlantic ocean on october 24 south of a dissipating cold front ships in region reported light winds and surface observations suggested that a circulation developed by october 25 on that basis it is estimated that a tropical depression formed a nearby ship reported gale force winds on october 27 suggesting that it intensified into a tropical storm with peak winds of an approaching cold front turned storm northward which absorbed storm on october 28 air weather service aws noted system as storm mike but storm was not included in annual monthly weather review summary nor was it included in database until it was added by atlantic hurricane reanalysis project in 2014 tropical storm fifteen ships in eastern atlantic ocean suggested that a tropical storm was present on october 28 with peak winds of it was estimated to have originated previous day small storm moved to northwest and later west into an area of sparse observations suggesting a weaker system system s track ended on october 29 due to uncertainty but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after tropical storm sixteen for several days in november a trough was present across west central atlantic ocean on november 10 three ships reported a cyclonic circulation northeast of bermuda with peak winds of it was a large system and would likely have been classified a subtropical cyclone in satellite era storm moved northeastward and weakened degenerating into a trough on november 12 before being merging with another system storm names this was first season in atlantic hurricane database in which cyclones that attained at least tropical storm status were given names names used to name storms during 1950 season were taken from joint army navy phonetic alphabet which was also used in 1951 and 1952 hurricane seasons before being replaced by female names in 1953 names that were not assigned are marked in able baker charlie dog easy fox george how king love mike season effects this is a table of all storms that have formed in 1950 atlantic hurricane season it includes their duration names landfall s denoted in parentheses damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while storm was extratropical a tropical wave or a low and all damage figures are in 1950 usd
