character his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped safran build alex s perception of her own family safran wrote his own experience into alex s struggle to learn truth about her father he said i ve always struggled with knowing that i would never know truth because there is no real such thing as truth with regard to somebody who may or may not be telling truth that struggle informed character of alex priyanka chopra was cast in role in february 2015 which was result of a talent holding deal between chopra and abc studios deal required abc studios to either develop a project starring her or cast her in an existing show for 2015 network television season for quite some time casting executive at abc keli lee had been trying to convince chopra to do television in united states something that chopra was not sure of however when chopra was first considering possibility of doing a television series in america lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her to which she reacted by saying no you can t make this deal elsewhere you re coming here and i m flying to india later lee traveled to india and was finally able to convince her to accept offer in an interview with vanity fair chopra revealed only condition she put forward to lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would put her in same position that she currently enjoyed in india she said there were tv shows and movies that were offered to me before this one as well but i wanted a part that put me on same platform as i had in india i wanted to play a leading part i didn t want to settle for anything less chopra saw deal as an opportunity to represent south asians and break indian stereotypes in hollywood and united states in general in process she became first south asian to headline an american network drama series she revealed that when she was in school in america she never saw anyone on television who looked like her and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of south asian descent in america and in other parts of world she also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what indians were usually seen as in global pop culture saying that indians never talk like apu from simpsons after signing deal and being given all 26 pilot scripts that abc was developing for 2015 2016 television season chopra chose quantico having appeared in over fifty films at that time series was also chopra s first ever audition which she found very new and nerve wracking at same time following chopra s casting series underwent a significant change safran had initially intended to make show as an ensemble drama with no obvious lead but after chopra s casting alex became main character and show was re structured around her character was initially written to be white which was also re written keeping chopra in mind background of character was tweaked by making her half indian with an additional backstory of alex having spent ten years in mumbai india apart from changing her ethnicity safran completely re envisioned character for example alex was initially written as jaded and brooding but was re written as fun and warm earlier series was supposed to focus on character s dark side because safran had never imagined alex having a positive side which changed after chopra stepped in role safran said priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control and still warm and vibrant because she knew no one was going to get through her walls from that point on alex was kind of character who can have humor who can have heart characterization series is told from alex s point of view american broadcasting company describes her as a fiercely competitive and naturally gifted person who can read people instantly which makes it hard for her to trust anyone making her relationships short lived at 2015 television critics associations summer press tour chopra said that she chose series as her first television project because of character s appeal comparing her to female jason bourne chopra chose to depict character as tough but also feminine saying she s as smart as that but she is also vulnerable and soft i didn t want to make alex extremely macho i wanted to celebrate femininity you can be an absolute woman and also be smart and tough and not lose your femininity thumb 200px alex was initially written as a white character and was re written with priyanka chopra in mind screen rant wrote of character rather than beginning series in a state of potential heroism alex begins series as a potential villain and yet alex is still a hero everything that follows is a desperate attempt at survival and at remaining one step ahead of those who are trying to harm her in fact alex s narrative is one in which she is nearly immediately immersed in adventure and thrown headfirst into chaos character is also opinionated and outspoken chopra said alex is someone with a point of a view and she s a woman with an opinion and at same time she s not afraid of being who she is modern woman today is different and alex is definitely bold and expressive and she identifies herself as a human being of today not a man or a woman she s empowered and she s confident alex has been depicted as someone who is not afraid of expressing her sexuality and as a flawed human being who takes charge of her own life chopra told cosmopolitan it s empowering in that way which doesn t say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be it s extremely individual to each one of us as for alex she happens to not care character treats men as dispensable entities similar to how men usually treat women she does not treat men as if they are most important thing in her life because she is more focused on her work with men just happen to come and go in her life chopra explained i think that s extremely empowering on her end it may not be something i personally agree with or something i do but i think different people have different individual choices that they make alex s friendships with her fellow trainees also form crux of character as well as series especially her friendship with her roommate and best friend shelby johanna braddy who plays shelby told tv guide that shelby s friendship with alex is a big part of quantico safran talked to entertainment weekly that idea for their friendship came from similarity between characters he said so for alex and shelby you know as roommates and as friends we just really loved idea of these two people from two different parts of world all these things that don t touch upon each other but they actually at their core are both very driven successful smart and kind humans that find each other one of other characters alex is very close to other than shelby was simon who is killed in finale talking about losing a friend and its repercussions on chopra explained she s extremely affected but doesn t believe in sharing her emotions or opening up with someone as show progresses alex and ryan s romance evolves into a relationship when alex confesses that her only motive to join academy was to find out truth about her father and was about to leave ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent alex s on again off again relationship with ryan has been described by chopra as star crossed she said alex and ryan are star crossed lovers you love them and they fight and have this intense passionate bond but alex is also a little self destructive she s a solitary person and she s not vulnerable enough whereas ryan really is she s a little rough around edges and whatever s happened in past she has trust issues so that leads to issues in their relationship fans have dubbed alex and ryan on being asked about possibility of having to choose between ryan and saving world chopra said i m pretty sure she d pick saving world because she s that kind of person reception character of alex parrish received positive reviews and chopra was immediately praised for her portrayal describing character as cool charismatic and complex sonia saraiya of salon said that alex parrish is indian american heroine she had been waiting for james poniewozik of new york times described chopra as strongest human asset of show adding that she is immediately charismatic and commanding buddy tv praised alex s characterization calling her bold and sassy and writing
