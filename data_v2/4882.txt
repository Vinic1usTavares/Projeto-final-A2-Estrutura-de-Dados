as a filming location for 1970 science fiction television movie love war agricultural development del valle acquired his first valencia orange seedlings in 1857 from his friend william wolfskill fruit from these trees was first to be commercially grown in what is now ventura county although this was relatively small scale because crops had to be taken by wagon to los angeles a southern pacific line opened in 1876 seventeen miles 27 km to east in saugus providing a more convenient form of transport however primary agricultural product from rancho camulos was wine ninety acres 360 000 m2 of vineyards were planted in 1860s and camulos wines and brandies were known throughout los angeles and santa barbara in 1870 records indicate camulos was largest of four vintners in san buenaventura township of santa barbara county with 45 tons 40 900 kg of grapes grown making 6 000 us gallons 23 000 l of wine and 800 us gallons 3 000 l of brandy in addition to oranges and grapes ranch produced almonds walnuts apricots wheat corn and barley flower petals from roses grown at camulos were shipped to europe to make perfume over years vineyards were replaced by other fruits today about are under cultivation most of it oranges but lemons grapefruit and avocados are grown too this makes camulos a rare instance of a surviving citrus operation during years 1920 45 citrus industry underwent a period of great growth in contrast to natural desert like conditions of area photographs of citrus belts were publicized that helped establish image of southern california for nation as an idyllic farmland after world war ii urban and suburban development displaced much of southern california citrus production with notable exception of santa clara river valley ramona ramona published in 1884 was based in part on experiences that helen hunt jackson had had during her visit to rancho camulos in 1882 jackson spent only two hours on ranch and did not meet ysabel del valle but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in novel for example altar cloth in rancho s chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended in novel character margarita accidentally tears altar cloth and ramona it back together delyser p 70 book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism which was stimulated by improved access possible due to opening of southern pacific railroad lines in southern california with all of interest generated by book a number of communities declared that they were setting for novel in order to cash in on boom most notably rancho guajome in san diego county which jackson had also visited prior to writing her book however location of fictional moreno ranch midway in valley between lands to east and west which had once belonged to missions of san fernando and san bonaventura corresponds to location of rancho camulos and physical description of some of buildings on fictional ranch accurately describe buildings at camulos on other hand relative to other locations in novel ramona s having been married in san diego and alessandro s family being from temecula area camulos seems too distant to be real location delyser p 89 jackson died in 1885 never having publicly disclosed what locations she drew from for book historians today are unsure whether moreno ranch represented a historic site thumb postcard from 1906 where rancho is called home of ramona by 1886 many readers and observers already considered camulos to be setting of novel edward roberts published an article entitled ramona s home a visit to camulos ranch and to scenes described by h h in may 13 1886 edition of san francisco chronicle significantly he was one of first to publish an account that blended fact and fiction inclusion of his article as an appendix to later versions of novel only served to cement that association first book solely devoted to ramona and ranch was published in 1888 by charles fletcher lummis a close friend of del valles and an admirer of their daughter teenage susana carmen nicknamed del valle lummis took photographs of buildings and published them in his own book home of ramona photographs of camulos fine old spanish estate described by mrs helen hunt jackson as home of ramona he emphasized that del valles were nothing like fictional morenos who treated ramona poorly but he too would mix fact with fiction for instance he wrote veranda is about a hundred feet in length and runs from door of father s room to that of ramona s room lummis 1888 as quoted in delyser p 74 lummis s goal was to discourage novel s association with other properties for same purpose adam clark vroman s ramona illustrated genesis of story of ramona compared photographs of rancho s buildings and environs with text from novel as well as photographs from competing locations by 1909 george wharton james could confidently declare that camulos was avowed and accepted home of heroine despite lack of easy access to ranch and any lodging in area tourists flocked to this site 1887 completion of southern pacific line increased number of visitors as railroad featured ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish line from its competitors although ranch was not developed for tourism del valles with their californio sense of hospitality would lodge visitors by october 1888 housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for family that reginaldo del valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable delyser p 77 tourists could be quite a nuisance and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from house as souvenirs or help themselves to fruit from orchards delyser p 79 naturally name camulos became so tied to novel that many people began to use it instead of original moreno ranch when referring to novel an 1897 play based on book was called ramona or bells of camulos in virginia calhoun s 1905 stage adaptation characters in play called ranch camulos as well delyser p 80 given general belief that camulos was original setting of novel d w griffith shot portions of his 1910 silent film adaptation at rancho using chapel adobe and patio and nearby mountains as backdrops paintings and photographs of rancho by noted artists such as adam clark vroman henry sandham who had accompanied jackson on her initial tour henry chapman ford and alexander harmer also illustrated later versions of novel thumb home of ramona branding label although tourism brought much difficulty to del valles they were not above capitalizing upon their newfound fame branding their wine and oranges as home of ramona brand their label used same view of veranda that had been popularized in postcards one tataviam servant girl was said to make quite a bit of money by pretending to be real ramona and charging tourists for a photograph delyser p 82 tourists continued to arrive even after sp relocated its main line in 1903 through santa susana pass bypassing camulos two daily trains made stops at camulos until service was discontinued in 1940s with tourism by automobile having become preferred method of travel after took ownership in 1924 they continued to welcome visitors in small numbers converting second floor of

shaped structure when initially constructed in 1853 it was an l shaped four room house connected with an external as opposed to an interior hallway as is typical of spanish colonial style it is unusual for its time period because around this time monterey style was in vogue as is evidenced by contemporaneous buildings in santa barbara los alamos ranch house in santa barbara county and rancho guajome adobe and las flores adobe in san diego county all national historic landmarks are built in a similar style house expanded in several phases in 1861 before del valle family moved here permanently they added three additional rooms as well as a free standing cocina kitchen this was to keep fire away from main building as well as to keep it cooler a basement was dug out as foundation of new rooms in 1870s another wing was added perpendicular to 1861 addition finally some time after 1895 one more room was added to new wing as well as a to kitchen completing current shape remodeling completed after this time was to interior only basement of house initially served as wine storage area in 1867 family had a one and a half story brick winery constructed after 1900 when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially this building served as a storage room rubel later converted it to a museum for ramona visitors complete with del valle family artifacts in 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles thumb left california black walnut juglans californica tree planted circa 1860s to west of main house is a large california black walnut juglans
