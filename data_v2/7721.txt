australian album charts and entered at number 109 on u s billboard 200 several singles have been released from album including shake a fist ready for floor which reached number six on uk singles chart and one pure thought a defining feature of album is strong presence of romantic ballads ballad made in dark was described as sublime by one critic although not all ballads received universal praise alexis taylor main contributor to lyrics said he was proud of album lyrically and felt that feelings of love and happiness partly result of his recent marriage had contributed to album s romantic tone critics stated that songs such as ready for floor and bendable poseable were reminiscent of their previous release warning style of album was not considered as big a leap forward as changes evident between coming on strong 2004 to warning 2006 it was said that hot chip had honed their music by using quirks of their musical style to make more accomplished music however some critics felt that album lacked focus containing too many varied elements it was described as loveable but flawed production thumb right al doyle hot chip often record their music in a bedroom however band took a different approach in recording made in dark to make it sound not quite so homemade recording took place in a variety of locations including in studio and live venues to make different acoustic spaces to be obvious to listener lead vocalist alexis taylor said there was tension between band s members as band did not want to continue creating music in same way but also did not want to throw away a songwriting and production partnership that has worked before taylor and vocalist joe goddard worked on some of songs together several songs were overdubbed with parts of rest of band playing in regards to editing taylor said that hot chip have never really been too good at bothering to get rid of little imperfections in music he felt they added personality and said that it s good not to be too dogmatic about it if that s what suits song hot chip used a variety of vocal structures including layered vocals where two takes of same vocals were added together changed by idiosyncrasies from way it had been sung and doubling of a single performance shifted out of beat drummer felix martin said made in dark was a true group effort process began with taylor and goddard creating lyrics then goddard would produce parts of tracks which alexis would then add lyrical content and melodies and so on that he s thought of while he s on bus or in bath or wherever he happened to be other three members of hot chip owen clarke al doyle and felix martin would then have some influence on way songs are put together some equipment used to create album remained same as previous albums goddard used steinberg cubase on his laptop and doyle and martin worked on songs using apple logic in their studio to create chorus for ready for floor goddard used plug ins from such as moog modular he used two sound channels to control noise and melody and placed noise channel in cubase and had it follow melody to make it punchier with bendable poseable goddard recorded live percussion parts with a shure beta mic going directly into cubase and fashioned them into a jittery three minute loop this was emailed to taylor who then recorded main vocals for song to create beat in shake a fist martin used elektron hot chip enjoy being a live band and have said it is something they ve always tried to do as group contains a lot of different types of musicianship band have to be spontaneous whenever they can doyle guitarist stated that hot chip change original recordings when playing their music live at london based studio called strongroom one pure thought hold on and shake a fist were recorded live instead of on multitrack and were subsequently pieced together this was first occasion that hot chip had recorded music in a studio environment taylor described made in dark as a real mix of different things and said that hot chip was learning how to be a different kind of band while making album featured collaborators in march 2008 hot chip re recorded several songs from made in dark with one of their all time heroes robert wyatt doyle said band had wanted it to happen for ages and that people would see it as a surprise collaboration taylor said i crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised i try to do that in words and music and try to be what people don t think we are robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise we feel closer to people in a different field age or era album features emma smith who had previously joined with hot chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums kylie minogue thumb kylie minogue in october 2007 mtv reported that hot chip was planning to give ready for floor to kylie minogue other reports incorrectly suggested that hot chip had written made in dark s second single ready for floor specifically for minogue taylor explained that it was a misunderstanding it started because someone asked me if we would ever write for kylie i said that we d been asked to write for her but we d never got round to it and i said if we had to give her one of our songs ready for floor would probably be most suitable from that i got misquoted we didn t write ready for floor for kylie didn t send it to her and she never heard it after first rumour circulated joe goddard created a reverse rumour saying that minogue had written a track for hot chip he told nme kylie wrote a song for us she sent it through our management to us it was totally bizarre it was beginnings of a track i think she wrote it and just thought this would be perfect for hot chip or possibly for a collaboration it s a crazy song it s industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it it s kind of music you d never normally associate with kylie when i m allowed to send it around it s going to change a few people s ideas about her maybe it s one for our next album after made in dark taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear goddard said we ve been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny in january 2010 goddard stated that at beginning there was some contact as i recall we were going to do a session with one of her writers but both hot chip and minogue were too busy at time he added there was a grain of truth in beginning but then it all snowballed into some big silly thing when asked in 2010 about giving a song to minogue he stated that it would be amazing composition influences album is influenced by music goddard and taylor listened to during their childhood and adolescence such as prince s sign o times and beatles self titled album taylor explained why hot chip s albums go from one mood to another so readily by saying eclectic music has been our first musical background and that he and goddard had different musical interests when they were younger made in dark is influenced by contemporary artists such as black dice and will oldham taylor appreciated oldham for his minimalism of just acoustic guitar and harmonium and voice for whole record and wanted hot chip to emulate him musical style thumb 300px right hot chip performing songs from made in dark on tour in an interview with pitchfork in october 2007 taylor said there would be an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material as band doesn t do things by adding one thing and taking something else away album contained maximalist and minimalist songs several tracks on album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music and track wrestlers started taking a new direction because band was wrestling with idea of making an r kelly kind of slick r and b number and ultimately sounded more like randy newman s short people he said if press release says it s faster and rockier it doesn t account for fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record taylor said that feelings of happiness and love influenced album s romantic feel goddard considered varying styles and influences a key factor in band s music he explained to sun that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence goddard and doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to unpleasant periods of silence but ultimately thought clashes created something more interesting because you have these different voices and not one person dictating martin told georgia straight that group are afflicted with something akin to musical attention deficit disorder and said that group get bored quite easily with their own records at times he elaborated by saying that group aren t really interested in reproducing same sound because they don t find it exciting taylor stated hot chip didn t set out to make something with one mood and that he thought band s style of jump ing all over place stylistically made sense as a record in an interview with georgia straight martin expressed that hot chip didn t want to create a classic record that would have a particular sound as they wanted to make music that was quite experimental and out there made in dark was intended to represent whole live sound of band and they are a band as much as originally having been a duo lyrics thumb right alexis taylor taylor stated in an interview with sun that he was so proud of album lyrically and thought song made in dark contained best lyrics he had ever written taylor explained that it was very easy for him to focus on more serious lyrics like a love song very dear to his heart but stated that wrestlers was equally as important and feels like a very different style of music than we have ever got down on record before he discussed wrestlers in band s interview with sun explaining that song is musically and lyrically quite direct because it doesn t have thousands of layers in contrast to song bendable poseable concept of song wrestlers originates from a text message from james murphy of lcd soundsystem after doyle toured with murphy murphy sent a text message that said sorry you can t have al back i ll wrestle you for him and i ll beat you because i m bigger and stronger than you goddard explained that words in that song are about wrestling and band have no doubt that murphy would defeat them in a wrestling fight song ready for floor contains an allusion to 1989 film batman with line you re my number one guy in an interview with fader magazine taylor said reference was a result of thinking about batman film which has many things that taylor is fond of such as prince soundtrack he commented that sometimes those items seep into what we re writing about and said that he likes to reference in an oblique way he conjectured that he had included line to say something to everyone in band particularly to joe goddard you re my number one guy why is there any problems between any of us shake a fist was written by taylor after goddard took a legal herbal substance during glastonbury festival which produced feelings akin to teleportation goddard said it was a brilliant time and told alexis to write down words to go with his experience song features a voice sample from todd rundgren packaging artwork darren wall wallzo and owen clarke designed artwork after several graphical experiments after initial experimentation wall wanted to create a cover that was more brooding and conservative and formed a list of ideas that band had responded positively to list included dual colour illustrations circles and verdigris green coating formed on copper during oxygenation wall amalgamated ideas to create image used on album s cover which was named artifact image was embossed on metallic copper card to give a tactile feel that would imply album was an object rather than illustration based design album title several titles were considered during production including shot down in flames and iv former was rejected because martin thought it sounded like a title beta band would use taylor supported name iv because he liked giving people wrong impression all time and defended his opinion saying if people give us any time they would see that we re very serious about comedy and serious things as well album was called made in dark because it was a title band agreed on taylor considered eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs and thought it was nice to name album after a thoughtful song in contrast to coming on strong and warning which he described as being big slightly jokey macho phrases release and reception made in dark charted for 23 weeks in over 10 different charts entering uk album chart at number four billboard top heatseekers chart at number one and billboard top electronic albums chart at number two album according to nielsen soundscan

charts peaking at number six on uk singles top 75 promotion in january 2008 in order to promote made in dark hot chip locked themselves away to practice in anticipation of an american tour where material from their new album would be played band are not accustomed to such an intensive rehearsal regime as they usually just rehearse for two days and then go on tour critical reception critical reception to album was generally favourable based on 40 reviews review aggregate website metacritic reported a rating of 78 out of 100 there were mixed comments about ballads two reviewers noted a disparity between energy of ballads to different songs drowned in sound commented that ballads remain a strong suit particularly easy grace of title track but more often than not sit awkwardly next to more toothsome numbers and feel under produced by comparison with similar comments from allmusic who said made in dark s main weakness might be its ballads but that may just be in comparison to its many energetic moments which are so addictive that it feels like a forced come down whenever band slows things down however observer gave a positive evaluation of ballads hot chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad and made in dark can boast four of best pitchfork described it as a patchy turbulent record due to use of many different individual components and also said that it was a good record but not a great one martin responded to criticism made by pitchfork pitchfork despite their initial rating went on to list album number 23 on their list of fifty best albums of 2008 and would later state that its bold charms have lent it a fond longevity another element that caused mixed reception was use of a todd rundgren sample in shake a fist which musicomh called delightful but guardian described it as grating musicomh whose description of album was positive said that tracks ready for floor and bendable poseable had elements reminiscent of previous album warning times said that although execution was novel and song made in dark was exquisite that much of made in dark seems to spring from sticky relationship issues comparisons were also made to paul mccartney s mccartney ii album with songs like wrestlers bendable poseable whistle for will and we re looking for a lot of love which were described as having airless proto electronica of mccartney ii in regards to lyrics allmusic said album boasts some of hot chip s most kinetic music with rhythms and melodies that are just as hyper articulate as word play rolling stone summarised album as having catchy tunes monster
