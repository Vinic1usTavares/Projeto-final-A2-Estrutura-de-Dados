which reveals that helen was child of mary who died shortly after her daughter s birth in letter raymond informs clarke that mary became pregnant after his experiment caused her to see god pan implying that pan fathered helen background thumb upright 1 3 arthur machen credited his childhood visits to ruined roman temple at caerwent pictured which he believed was dedicated to god nodens as his inspiration for great god pan machen s lifelong fascination with occultism began after he read an article on alchemy in an edition of charles dickens s periodical household words belonging to his father a clergyman in his 1922 autobiography far off things machen wrote that great god pan was inspired by times he visited usk a welsh river and welsh towns of caerleon on usk and caerwent as a boy all of these places had been settled by romans he wrote that strange relics were frequently found at caerwent from ruined temple of nodens god of depths machen visited temple which he described as a lonely house between dark forest and silver river in writing novella he tried to pass on vague indefinable sense of awe and mystery and terror that he had received while visiting those ruins machen felt that he had transliterated feeling clumsily in great god pan elaborating i translated awe at worst awfulness into evil again i say one dreams with fire and works in clay dennis denisoff said that machen s decision to make helen vaughan child of a welsh woman and a pagan figure parallels machen s own authorial self identity as one arising from not only his welsh ancestry but also pagan myth what is now first chapter of novella was published in 1890 in a magazine called whirlwind while what is now third chapter of book was published in same magazine following year as a standalone short story called city of resurrections machen only viewed two works as connected after they were finished once he decided two stories were connected machen wrote rest of great god pan in a single evening save for its final chapter machen did not think of an ending for tale for months and in that time believed that novella would remain unfinished forever last chapter was completed in june 1891 machen sent novella to publisher blackwood who rejected it deeming it a clever story that shrink s from central idea it was accepted by john lane and published in 1894 when published as a book great god pan was accompanied by another machen tale called inmost light which also features a mad scientist and elements of science fiction book s cover was illustrated by aubrey beardsley analysis genre joe of independent views great god pan as a work of gothic horror according to encyclopedia of science fiction story is typical of victorian science fiction horror at about time science fiction was beginning to shed its gothic elements into a separate horror fantasy genre aaron worth writes that great god pan superficially resembles science fiction due to its depiction of dr raymond as a mad scientist but it cannot be seen as an example of genre as it posits that occultism is superior to science novella has been classified as decadent literature as well as it features hallmarks of genre such as occultism paganism non mainstream eroticism sexual diversity femme fatale violent and strange deaths and simultaneous investment in and disavowal of bourgeois identities pan has also been described as fantasy literature modernist literature and a cautionary tale against men mistreating women way that raymond mistreated mary influences left thumb third century relief carving from a roman sarcophagus showing pan dancing with a mad woman playing a tambourine pan was an ancient greek god primarily worshipped in arcadia who was associated with shepherds and their flocks and with nature he was believed to lurk in caves mountains and other lonely isolated locations in some stories he inflicted his enemies with sudden terror i e panic phrase great god pan comes from an ancient greek folktale recorded in plutarch s de defectu oraculorum on decline of oracles which claims that a greek sailor near island of paxi during reign of emperor tiberius ruled 14 37 ad heard a voice cry out when you are arrived at take care to make it known that great god pan is dead plutarch moralia de defectu oraculorum 17 early christian commentaries suggested that this event occurred at same time as death of christ and that death of pan represented transition from a pagan to a christian world this story had particular resonance with victorian literary audiences in 1844 elizabeth barrett browning wrote her poem dead pan an adaption of plutarch s story which insisted that proper christian literature should abandon greek mythology with each stanza ending in words pan pan is dead as a member of decadent movement machen sought to subvert traditional themes and transgress literary boundaries an agenda which made pan a particularly appealing figure title of great god pan appears to have been specifically derived from browning s later poem a musical instrument 1862 in which first line of every stanza ends with words great god pan machen s use of pan in novella may have also been influenced by robert louis stevenson s essay pan s pipes 1878 and algernon charles swinburne s poem a 1894 in which pan is portrayed as emblem of delicious combination of ecstasy and terror in a review of novella for black gate matthew david surridge hypothesized that machen took inspiration from mary shelley s frankenstein 1818 in his portrayal of dr raymond as a mad scientist akin to victor frankenstein works of robert louis stevenson especially his 1886 novella strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde were among machen s most significant influences when writing great god pan critic john also sees machen s novella as reminiscent of horror stories of edgar allan poe and sheridan le fanu aaron worth noted similitude between death of helen vaughan and theories of alchemist thomas vaughan who is character s namesake and helen s disintegration recalls alchemical concept of prima materia john c tibbetts observes similarities between helen vaughan and ayesha sexually liberated demonic priestess from h rider haggard s she a history of adventure 1886 machen wrote that several critics felt that joris karl huysmans s novels a rebours 1884 and la bas 1891 had inspired great god pan though he did not read either book until after pan was published upon reading two novels machen concluded that my critics had not read them either religious themes right thumb helen vaughan and pan have respectively been compared to antichrist left and lucifer right novella is characteristic of a late nineteenth century interest in paganism in general and pan in particular that is found in works of florence farr and kenneth grahame according to british scholar of modern literature roger luckhurst raymond expresses a typical neoplatonist view of reality in which true object of study is revelation of a higher hidden spiritual world he is therefore an occultist rather than a materialist scientist neoplatonism is also commonly regarded as last school of pagan philosophy and raymond s views therefore relate back to recurring theme of death of pan author theodora goss sees great god pan as equating paganism with irrationality and what carl jung would call collective unconscious literary critic kostas reads story from a judeo christian perspective arguing that helen vaughan embodies a female version of an antichrist a perversion of jesus as well as figure of lilith from judaic myth with helen s mother mary being a direct analogy of biblical virgin mary black gates matthew david surridge believes that story associates paganism with sex and femininity while portraying helen as a female antichrist a view shared by james goho in journeys into darkness critical essays on gothic horror 2014 surridge adds from another perspective helen is undoing of progress rather than proceeding from paganism to christianity as orthodox victorian belief imagined progress of history she is a reversal of time revenge of atavistic in keeping with this idea surridge sees mary s name as a reference to mary mother of jesus and helen s name as a reference to pagan figure helen of troy goho interprets story as machen s warning against abandonment of true religion and embrace of paganism at one point in novella a latin creed is recited et diabolus incarnatus est et homo factus est and devil was made incarnate and was made man luckhurst identifies this as a blasphemous rewriting of nicene creed an early christian creed which includes line by power of holy spirit he jesus became incarnate from virgin mary and was made man goho writes that portrayal of pan in novella draws on mythology of lucifer and depictions of pan as fetish for evil and suffering and danger and dread of wilderness rather than depictions of pan as a playful and harmless god surridge sees book s references to satan and nodens as implying that satan nodens and pan are same being while goho connects novella to fact that early christians associated pan with devil critical reception left thumb oscar wilde praised novella great god pan implied sexuality caused a scandal upon its original release and hurt machen s reputation as an author reviewing novella for magazine literary news richard henry stoddard criticised story as too morbid to be production of a healthy mind richard henry stoddard review of great god pan in colavito jason ed a hideous bit of morbidity an anthology of horror criticism from enlightenment to world war i jefferson nc mcfarland 2008 p 228 230 art critic harry quilter s review of book titled gospel of intensity and published in contemporary review in june 1895 was even more harsh quilter declared great god pan is i have no hesitation in saying a perfectly abominable story in which author has spared no endeavor to suggest and horror which he describes as beyond reach of words harry quilter gospel of intensity in colavito ed a hideous bit of morbidity an anthology of horror criticism from enlightenment to world war i jefferson nc mcfarland 2008 p 230 254 quilter warned that machen s books were a dangerous threat to entire british public and that they would destroy readers and senses of morality quilter went on to attack story s publisher john lane as well as machen himself why should he be allowed for sake of a few miserable pounds to cast into our midst these monstrous creations of his diseased brain quilter added that works of fiction like machen s should be unanimously condemned by literary critics and newspapers if press was so disposed it could stamp out such art and fiction in a few months and that disposition must be acquired must even be enforced he was particularly harsh in his denunciation of sexual ambiguity and polymorphous androgyny in book he expressed revulsion at machen s description of helen s sex changing immediately before her death and concluded his review with a comment of distaste regarding nasty little naked figure of dubious sex and humanity with which mr aubrey beardsley has prefaced story a positive appraisal of novella came from oscar wilde who called it un succes fou machen s literary reputation was re evaluated in 1920s and great god pan has since attained reputation of a horror masterpiece in supernatural horror in literature 1926 revised 1933 h p lovecraft praised story saying no one could begin to describe cumulative suspense and ultimate horror with which every paragraph abounds he added that sensitive reader reaches end with an appreciative shudder lovecraft also noted however that melodrama is undeniably present and coincidence is stretched to a length which appears absurd upon analysis bennett cerf described story as a masterpiece arthur machen celebrated english author of such masterpieces as great god pan and hill of dreams bennett cerf trade winds saturday review of

greatest supernatural tales ever written black gate matthew david surridge said that great god pan is a fascinating troubling story and for all its influence not like much else than i can think of it s not simple and yet it s effective more so than can easily be explained some commentary on great god pan has focused on its portrayal of women surridge sees novella as expressing a fear of women even though ultimate source of horror in story is a male deity encyclopedia of science fiction says that helen s metamorphosis remains one of most dramatically horrible and misogynistic in fiction helen never speaks in book according to victoria margree and bryony randall in victorian gothic an edinburgh companion silence of central female character is part of text s misogyny but also part of its narrative effect margree and randall also view helen s fate as a punishment for her sexual impropriety dennis denisoff connects machen s tendency to make his empowered female characters sexually monstrous to his criticisms of authors who discussed subject of women s rights james defends machen and great god pan from charges from misogyny on grounds that male protagonist of machen s story novel of white powder 1895 disintegrates in a manner reminiscent of helen vaughan and on grounds that machen married amy hogg a woman who defied sexual boundaries of her time adaptations a pair of parodies of pan were published in 1895 arthur rickett s a yellow creeper and arthur sykes s great pan demon both suggest that machen is an author of limited imagination with latter depicting him as a mad scientist unleashing degenerate literature on an unsuspecting public great god pan was brought to stage in 2008 by wildclaw theatre company in chicago it was adapted and directed by wildclaw

pan influenced later works of horror fiction including dunwich horror 1929 by h p lovecraft black gate matthew david surridge said that great god pan influenced bram stoker s dracula 1897 as both works feature an introductory sequence featuring a horrified englishman in a non english setting then a variety of seemingly unconnected events in london metropole at heart of empire then discovery that all those events are in fact inspired by one malign and supernatural intelligence that rational contemporary capital is threatened by irrational and archaic then an equivocal conclusion fear of sex women foreignness john c tibbetts notes that both helen vaughan in great god pan and lucy westenra in dracula are demon women of voracious and malignant sexuality theodora goss also notes similarities between death of helen vaughan in machen s novella and lucy s death in dracula tibbetts also notes that machen s portrayal of helen vaughan as demonic and hyper sexual may have influenced a similar character woman of songs in richard marsh s beetle 1897 great god pan was highly influential on circle of writers around h p lovecraft structure of machen s story influenced structure of lovecraft s call of cthulhu 1928 pans depiction of a monstrous half human hybrid inspired plot of lovecraft s dunwich horror 1929 which refers to machen s novella by name according to lovecraft scholar robert m price dunwich horror is in every sense an homage to machen and even a pastiche there is little in lovecraft s wonderful story that does not come directly out of machen s fiction pan also inspired lovecraft to create his character nodens who appears most prominently in dream quest of unknown 1943 clark ashton smith was inspired by great god pan to write his story nameless offspring 1931 which also features a monstrous child born of a human and a supernatural entity pan has suggested to me an idea so hellish that i am almost afraid to work it out in story form a woman gives birth to a child and dies child is so monstrous that no one is permitted to see it clark ashton smith letter to h p lovecraft c january 27 1931 in selected letters of clark ashton smith edited by scott connors and david e schultz sauk city wis arkham house 2003 pp 145 46 it has been suggested that michael arlen s novel hell said duchess 1934 is a parody of great god pan as arlen was influenced by machen s work hell said duchess was probably conceived as a parodic version of arthur machen s classic decadent fantasy great god pan stableford brian 1998 arlen michael st james guide

pan influenced peter straub s novel ghost story 1979 in its depiction of a shapeshifting monster who terrifies those it encounters straub himself frequently credited great god pan as having been a major influence on his work according to film historians keith mcdonald and roger clark mexican film director guillermo del toro s portrayal of faun in his 2006 dark fantasy film pan s labyrinth was inspired by ambivalent and possibly dangerous portrayals of pan in late victorian and early edwardian novels including machen s great god pan and pan s garden 1912 by algernon blackwood del toro deliberately chose to imitate darker more sinister fauns of machen and blackwood rather than sweetly domesticated figure of mr from c s lewis s lion witch and wardrobe 1950 original title of film in spanish is el laberinto del labyrinth of faun but english title pan s labyrinth emphasizes connection between del toro s film and body of late nineteenth century writings about pan including great god pan stephen king wrote that his novella n from his story collection just after sunset 2008 is a riff on arthur machen s great god pan mine isn t anywhere near as good as original but i loved chance to put neurotic behavior obsessive compulsive disorder together with idea of a monster filled king has also cited machen s novella as an influence on his novel revival 2014 similar to pan revival
