apep is a triple star system containing a wolf rayet binary and a hot supergiant located in constellation of norma named after serpent deity from egyptian mythology star system is surrounded by a vast complex of stellar wind and cosmic dust thrown into space by high rotation speed of binary s primary star and formed into a pinwheel shape by secondary star s influence ground based studies of system in 2010s concluded that system was best known gamma ray burst progenitor candidate in milky way galaxy nomenclature apep pronounced was named by a team of astronomers led by joseph callingham of astron who studied system between 2016 and 2018 and published a scientific paper on their observations it was named after eponymous mortal enemy of deity of sun ra in egyptian mythology who was often illustrated as a giant serpent their rivalry was described as an apt allusion to appearance of system and its stellar wind in infrared as a star embattled within a dragon s coils in xmm newton serendipitous source catalogue 2xmm a star catalog of x ray sources observed by xmm newton space telescope system is catalogued as 2xmm j160050 7 514245 characteristics apep is a triple star system containing a wolf rayet binary described as central engine orbiting with a period of 100 years and a third hot supergiant star described as northern companion orbiting central engine at a distance of 1 700 astronomical units and a period of 10 000 years a vast complex of stellar wind and cosmic dust surrounds system resembling wr 104 another wolf rayet star system producing a pinwheel nebula wind travelling at a velocity of and dust travelling at at edge of system suggest that at least one component of central engine is rapidly rotating in which its surface gravity is close to being balanced by its centrifugal force outwards this component produces faster stellar winds from its poles and slower winds from its equator and equatorial wind s interaction with wind of its secondary produces system s pinwheel shape rapidly rotating wolf rayet stars are theoretically capable of producing a gamma ray burst during a supernova and system has been identified as a progenitor for a gamma ray burst apep is estimated to be at a distance of 2 4 kiloparsecs or 8 000 light years from earth with a potential discrepancy of 0 2 and 0 5 kiloparsecs at its estimated visual extinction of 11 4 observation apep is located in constellation of norma at a right ascension of and declination of system can be resolved into two components central engine wolf rayet binary and northern companion supergiant total apparent magnitude of system is 17 5 with apparent magnitude of a resolved central engine and northern companion being 19 0 and 17 8 respectively its infrared spectral energy distribution sed is unique with brightness ranging from an apparent magnitude of 6 4 at 2 2 um to 2 4 at 22 um surveys conducted with european southern observatory eso s sinfoni instrument on very large telescope measured apparent magnitude in infrared j band for central engine as and for northern companion as sinfoni also measured apparent magnitude of system in k band as for central engine and for c in l band as for central engine and for northern companion and in m band as for central engine and for northern companion sinfoni observations further detailed that northern companion is possibly a conventional high luminosity star a and b show a typical spectrum from a star but with additional wn4 or wn5 star features theorised to be from one of stars of central engine if confirmed this would make apep a rare binary system of wr stars an alternative hypothesis also based on sinfoni data proposes that spectra could all be from an unusual transitional wn wc star and that northern companion would then be a conventional ob star system was first gamma ray burst progenitor candidate to be discovered in milky way galaxy although it had not been known as such in early observations such as those with xmm newton and chandra space telescopes where it had been identified simply as an x ray source as early as august 2004 astronomer joe callingham first observed apep during undergraduate studies at university of sydney with molonglo observatory synthesis telescope and was noted as a potential colliding wind binary with a radio source as bright as eta carinae callingham and peter tuthill who assisted in discovery of wr 104 in 1998 and sought interest in apep after observing its extreme infrared properties used eso s very large telescope for observations in august 2016 further observations with anglo australian telescope and australia telescope compact array along with contributions from various international institutions led to publication of a scientific paper in nature astronomy on 19 november 2018 it concluded that system was a wolf rayet binary and a progenitor for a gamma ray burst it had been previously assumed that such systems were only found
