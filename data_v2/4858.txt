this study left forward batteries two 12 inch triple turrets and three of 5 inch dual turrets in place and added a reduced version of first plan for aft this would have cost 82 million and was still seen as too cost prohibitive garzke dulin p 187 as a result conversion proposal was abandoned and ship was instead stricken from naval registry on 1 june 1960 on 30 june she was sold to lipsett
