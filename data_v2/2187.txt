development thumb left 150px alt image of balding man charles cecil was game s director revolution software and thq announced broken sword angel of death on 17 august 2005 according to charles cecil broken sword series was originally planned to be a trilogy but that after release of broken sword sleeping dragon demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming though sleeping dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as windows this approach required certain development compromises as pc version with its superior graphics and processing power was held back by constraints of console versions as a result revolution agreed with thq to write angel of death for windows only so as to really push boundaries in terms of technology and graphics angel of death was co developed by revolution and sumo digital as opposed to other games in broken sword series which had revolution as sole game developer cecil believed that because of requirement for ever larger development team sizes it was no longer possible to maintain a large team to write single original titles as a result revolution concentrated on design while sumo concentrated on production game uses sumo s emmersion engine it is first game ever to be ambx enabled broken sword sleeping dragon was criticized for featuring a high number of action elements which aimed to put player under pressure while cecil still stood behind this principle he thought action elements were not right approach sleeping dragon was also criticized for using a high number of crate puzzles as a result cecil reduced number of them in angel of death music in game was composed by ben mccullough and features tracks by ubernoise while rolf saxon returns to voice george stobbart nicole nico collard was this time

angel of death has both pointed and clicked wisely it s another nail out of adventure gaming coffin although admittedly quite a few remain adventure classic gaming said not only game succeeds in addressing many of flaws in broken sword sleeping dragon that have plagued previous title this sequel is able to surpass high standard and expectation set forth by past games in series to create yet
