ki is eleventh studio album by canadian musician devin townsend and first album in devin townsend project series album was released on may 25 2009 on townsend s independent record label hevydevy records townsend founder songwriter and frontman of extreme metal band strapping young lad and progressive metal group devin townsend band dissolved both bands in 2006 to spend time with his family and avoid burnout of touring and interviewing after a period of self discovery and a year long break from songwriting townsend began work on a four album series to clarify his identity as a musician ki includes themes of self control and sobriety and is musically subtler than much of artist s previous work consisting of ambient rock music interlaced with tentative bursts of heavy metal album was written produced mixed and co engineered by townsend who also performed guitar and vocals townsend assembled a supporting group of vancouver musicians including blues drummer duris maxwell rock bassist jean savoie keyboardist dave young and guest vocalist che aimee dorval to play on album while some critics found album uneven ki received generally positive reviews for its unexpected musical direction along with its production vocal dynamics and mix of influences background after disbanding his extreme metal band strapping young lad and his progressive metal project devin townsend band in 2006 townsend shaved off his trademark hairstyle and gave up alcohol and marijuana townsend found it disconcerting that he had difficulty writing music without drugs and that he had trouble identifying his purpose as a musician he spent a year producing albums in absence of writing but found it unrewarding and decided to pick up guitar and just write this began a period of self discovery where he learned how to create without drugs over two years townsend wrote over 60 songs and found that they fit into four distinct styles in march 2009 townsend announced his plans for a four album series called devin townsend project with goal of clarifying his musical identity and being accountable for persona he projects to public ki first album of devin townsend project is written to set stage for subsequent albums word ki represents japanese concept of life force qi ki townsend chose name as an homage to 1981 kitaro album of same name which he loved as a kid project s concept includes a different group of musicians for each album for ki townsend chose a group of musicians with whom he had not previously worked he discovered duris maxwell a blues drummer who has played with such acts as heart jefferson airplane and tommy chong in a blues club in northern canada townsend was impressed by his energy and recruited him for ki townsend also chose jean savoie a music store employee who plays in a beatles cover band to play bass on album maxwell and savoie were ideal for album townsend explained because they had little experience playing heavy music and had a fresh perspective that fit with ki s subtler sound townsend also brought back dave young an ambient keyboardist who had played in devin townsend band and recruited vancouver artist che aimee dorval as a vocalist on several tracks album was primarily recorded produced and mixed from late 2008 to early 2009 at and studio d drums were recorded at factory studios in vancouver music and lyrical themes townsend channelled his new found self control and sobriety into ki a restrained melodic and tranquil album that is a sharp contrast to heavy metal he is known for while maintaining his signature sound album features undistorted guitar tones live takes no drum triggering and relatively quiet mastering with a musical style combining ambient progressive rock jazz rock and psychedelic blues album s recurring musical theme is tension and release a gradual build in intensity which suddenly stops and gives way to something relaxing album s musical style has been compared to porcupine tree chroma key and pink floyd with townsend s vocals drawing comparisons to steven wilson and steve hackett ki was mixed by townsend and features very little compression in contrast with his usual wall of sound production style townsend explained that he originally tried doing wall of sound with it and it just kind of ruined it it turned it into a not so good strapping record album deliberately eschews loudness wars recent music industry practice of competitively mastering audio to seem as loud as possible i officially pull my hat out of loudness wars townsend told his mastering engineer album s songs were primarily written in open c tuning except for a monday trainfire and disruptr in open b heaven s end and winter in open b and quiet riot in standard tuning townsend has cited second nature by young gods paul horn chants of india by ravi shankar and ween as influences on album townsend described ki as both introduction and moral to larger concept of devin townsend project album s lyrical themes explore townsend s inner demons past addictions self acceptance and his newfound ability to say no album opens with a brief instrumental that leads into coast a quiet bass driven track that sets stage for album as a metaphor for devin s newfound restraint townsend described it as intro to story quiet dark haunted and unsure track builds in intensity toward end with layers of vocals but rather than exploding into strapping young lad style metal fades into loose bluesy guitar work disruptr has been described as a coffee house metal track contrasting light instrumentation with heavy metal style songwriting and vocals in a way that one critic compared to talking heads gato proceeds in a similar vein but is set apart with backing vocals by dorval disruptr and gato continue musical theme each song builds in intensity toward end but stops and takes a deep breath before proceeding album then fades into terminal an atmospheric track with quiet vocals that was co written by keyboardist dave young townsend s restraint reaches a breaking point on heaven s end which jon wiederhorn of revolver described as a groovy pop song that morphs into a violent acid drenched nightmare it is followed by ain t never gonna win a live studio jam by album s four musicians which was described by david e gehlke of online magazine blistering as trippy trainfire a classic country style song inspired by elvis presley s cover of mystery train addresses townsend s former addiction to pornography which he described as this crazy crack cocaine on internet that nobody wants to talk about song continues album s theme of honesty and self acceptance both about pornography and musical tastes townsend explained song s musical style saying yes i like heavy music and am good at making it but that is not all that i listen to and that is not all that i want to play album s climax is found in title track described by artist as a personal breakthrough and is initially born out of a grey skies demo soft previously released on ass sordid demos ii ki builds into a cyclical progression of arpeggios which martin popoff of brave words bloody knuckles described as album s moment it leads into quiet riot an acoustic version of cum on feel noize with new lyrics quiet riot townsend explained basically sums up idea that although i am damaged i m fine and have chosen to make my life better release

jon wiederhorn of revolver said album is well worth a listen and praised heavier tracks such as disruptr and heaven send saying townsend mostly contains his rage but he s at his best when he loses it martin popoff of brave words bloody knuckles found album to have an odd identity with all sorts of things going on just under surface that rewarded multiple listens david e gehlke of blistering was less impressed and found album inconsistent gehlke described winter as lush and gorgeous but felt that album fails to hit mark at other points such as ain t never gonna win and trainfire tyler munro of sputnikmusic said ki showed townsend at his loosest and most dynamic and praised townsend s and dorval s vocals but felt album was held back by musical repetition and its extended guitar jams greg prato of allmusic gave album a moderate review admiring townsend s unpredictability but feeling album was not most gripping or groundbreaking album in townsend s collection daniel cairns of chronicles of chaos praised ki as a difficult unusual collection of music that also might just be townsend s best yet track listing personnel musicians devin townsend vocals guitar fretless bass guitar ambience
