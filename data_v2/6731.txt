high school and represented scotland schoolboys his father forbade him from joining celtic as he did not want him involved in religion based rivalry with rangers and bremner rejected both arsenal and chelsea as he did not enjoy his stay in london during trial spells with two clubs and was instead convinced to join bill lambton s leeds united in 1959 he joined along with his friend tommy henderson who would return to scotland due to homesickness without making a first team debut manager jack taylor gave him his debut at outside right in a 3 1 win against chelsea at stamford bridge at age of 17

times headline later dubbed him as 10st of barbed wire due to his tenacity and tough tackling regular outside right chris crowe was sold to blackburn rovers in march 1960 allowing bremner to take his place on a permanent basis however leeds went on to be relegated from first division at end of 1959 60 season dropped following an opening day defeat by liverpool at anfield bremner had to win back his first team place later in 1960 61 season after meeting with jack taylor to explain his frustration at being left out of team taylor resigned in march 1961 and player don revie was promoted to manager revie rejected an approach of ps25 000 from hibernian for bremner despite player wanting to return to scotland to be with his fiancee leeds struggled in 1961 62 campaign finishing just three points above second division relegation zone despite 12 goals in 45 appearances from bremner who finished as club s joint top scorer alongside centre half jack charlton one bright spot was signing of bobby collins in march who helped form win at all costs attitude that defined leeds and bremner throughout rest of revie s 13 years as manager united had a more promising 1962 63 campaign finishing four points shy of promotion though bremner was limited to 24 appearances he was out of form and dropped from first team during end of season run in which contained a disproportionately large number of games due to high level of postponements that occurred during harsh winter revie moved bremner to central midfield and bought manchester united s johnny giles to create what would prove to be one of most highly effective central midfield partnerships of next 12 years with bremner collins and giles in midfield leeds went on to win promotion as champions in 1963 64 season club won no friends in doing so however and following summer were labelled by football association s own fa news as dirtiest team in football league in november of 1964 65 season bremner featured heavily in a win at everton that was marred by violent clashes on pitch game was stopped for a short spell ten minutes before half time as referee felt that a spell of cooling down was needed to prevent further violence despite referee only giving 12 leeds fouls to everton s 19 match helped to cement united s reputation as a dirty and overly physical team a run of victories put club top by new year however they lost title on goal average to manchester united after drawing last game of season with already relegated birmingham city manchester club would become a keen rival one which intensified after leeds knocked them out of fa cup at semi finals after two physical encounters leeds faced liverpool in final at wembley and game went to extra time after a 0 0 draw bremner scored a half volley in 100th minute to cancel out roger hunt s opener but ian st john won game for liverpool in 113th minute in october 1965 leeds skipper collins was injured in an inter cities fairs cup game against torino and revie gave captaincy to bremner after initially handing armband to charlton for remainder of season charlton was keen to give up captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming out of tunnel last on match days revie and bremner had a strong bond of trust which was why manager gave him captaincy at such a young age leeds finished second in league in 1965 66 campaign to liverpool who had finished six points clear at top thumb 200px bremner and tottenham hotspur s dave mackay on 20 august 1966 a poor start to 1966 67 season prevented another push for title and leeds eventually finished in fourth place they made it to fa cup semi finals before chelsea knocked them out with a 1 0 win in europe they beat dws netherlands valencia spain bologna italy and kilmarnock scotland to reach inter cities fairs cup final against dinamo zagreb yugoslavia zagreb won 2 0 at stadion and held leeds to a 0 0 draw at elland road to leave leeds with another second place finish club had a slow start to 1967 68 season but soon picked up particularly so with a 7 0 victory over chelsea though for second successive season they ended up in fourth spot success instead came from cup competitions as they first knocked out luton town bury sunderland stoke city and derby county in league cup en route to final against arsenal at wembley leeds won game 1 0 in a dour defensive manner but striker jimmy greenhoff later said it was most memorable of club s trophies due to it being first such success second soon followed despite a disappointment of exiting fa cup at semi final stage with defeat by everton as they reached final of inter cities fairs cup by beating ca luxembourg fk partizan yugoslavia hibernian scotland rangers scotland and dundee scotland they beat ferencvarosi hungary 1 0 at elland road and held them to a 0 0 draw at nepstadion to win club s first european trophy revie targeted title for 1968 69 campaign and played bremner in every league game as leeds finished six points clear at top to become champions of england for first time title was secured with a 0 0 draw with title rivals liverpool at anfield on 28 april after which bremner led players to applaud liverpool fans who responded by chanting champions champions champions leeds set a number of records most points 67 most wins 27 fewest defeats 2 and most home points 39 a still unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into following season 1969 70 season opened with victory in 1969 fa charity shield as bremner captained leeds to a 2 1 victory over manchester city with new arrival allan clarke played upfront alongside mick jones and peter lorimer revie had to instruct bremner and giles to resist temptation to get forward and attack it took team some time to gel as only two wins came from opening eight league games and leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions everton they chased everton all season only to give up on title after a home defeat by southampton late in campaign in european cup leeds recorded a club record 10 0 win over norwegian side lyn with bremner netting two of goals however they exited competition at semi final stage after two defeats to celtic bremner levelled aggregate score by putting united 1 0 ahead in front of a competition record 136 505 spectators at hampden park but celtic came back to win game and tie with two second half goals further disappointment came in 1970 fa cup final where leeds were beaten 2 1 by chelsea in extra time of replay at old trafford bremner was named as fwa footballer of year for season league title in 1970 71 season was decided in mid april in front of match of day cameras at elland road when leeds lost their lead at top with defeat by west bromwich albion leeds players blamed referee for costing them title as offside was not given for colin for jeff astle s winner and despite bremner saying but we fight on make no mistake about that it is not over yet leeds could not overtake arsenal who went on to win double success instead came in inter cities fairs cup as leeds knocked out sarpsborg norway dynamo dresden east germany sparta prague czechoslovakia vitoria portugal and liverpool to reach final with juventus italy bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face liverpool in semi finals and scored only goal of two legged tie with a header at anfield leeds won final on away goals rule after recording a 2 2 draw at stadio olimpico di torino and then a 1 1 draw at elland road leeds finished second in league for third successive season in 1971 72 campaign despite playing some of best football in club s history they knocked out bristol rovers liverpool cardiff city tottenham hotspur and birmingham city to reach 1972 fa cup final with arsenal they then won trophy for first time in club s history with allan clarke scoring final s only goal two days after final leeds could have secured double by winning a point against wolverhampton wanderers at molineux but a 2 1 defeat handed title to derby county on 3 february 1982 bremner won ps100 000 libel damages along with legal costs after he sued sunday people newspaper for publishing an article on 11 september 1977 that alleged he tried to fix football matches including may 1972 game at wolves bremner donated damages to a leeds hospice no glossing over it how football cheated leeds united gary edwards 2013 title was nowhere near as close in 1972 73 season which saw leeds finish third seven points behind liverpool however more runners up medals came from fa cup and european cup winners cup after bremner scored only goal of semi final clash with wolves leeds went on to lose fa cup final 1 0 to second division sunderland they were then beaten 1 0 by italian side a c milan at kaftanzoglio stadium in european cup winners cup final though bremner missed final due to suspension revie instructed bremner to be more attacking in 1973 74 campaign and result was 11 goals in 52 appearances his biggest goal tally in 12 years manager focused entirely on league and told his team aim was to go season unbeaten and although they lost three games they secured a second league title by a five point margin on second place liverpool bremner was named on pfa team of year and finished second in fwa footballer of year voting to ian callaghan at end of season he was given a testimonial match against sunderland which raised him ps32 500 he had chosen opponents in an attempt to avenge defeat in previous year s fa cup final manager don revie took england management job in july 1974 bremner applied for vacant leeds job after johnny giles had been named by revie as his successor but instead board surprised everyone by appointing brian clough who went on to a disastrous 44 day spell in charge of leeds at start of 1974 75 season revie s departure was tough for bremner who had a strong bond with his manager leeds lost 1974 fa charity shield in a penalty shoot out to liverpool but more significantly bremner and kevin keegan were sent off for fighting and received eleven game suspensions by time bremner was allowed to play again jimmy armfield was manager though he refuted accusation that he had attempted to undermine clough as ridiculous teammate peter lorimer insisted that only criticism he had of bremner was in applying for management job against giles which had caused to board to look elsewhere for fear of dividing dressing room by choosing between bremner and giles results improved with bremner back in side and though they ended season in ninth place they were only eight points behind champions derby club s biggest aim would be success in european cup and they made it to final after knocking out fc zurich switzerland ujpest fc hungary anderlecht belgium and barcelona spain their final opponents at parc des princes were defending champions bayern munich germany who beat leeds 2 0 united had a goal controversially ruled out for offside and tie ended in rioting by united fans with most of revie built team retiring or moving on to other clubs armfield had to rebuild squad though bremner would still play 38 games in 1975 76 campaign however he missed a lengthy spell in new year due to injury and results dipped during this time and ultimately ended club s title hopes they went on to end campaign in fifth spot hull city bremner signed with hull city for a ps25 000 fee on 23 september 1976 manager john kaye feeling that bremner s experience would benefit his youthful second division side his debut at boothferry park came against brian clough s nottingham forest and bremner was credited with scoring winning goal of game with a free kick though it seemed to have gone in with a significant deflection despite good start results dipped midway through 1976 77 season and tigers ended season in 14th place despite suffering with a back injury bremner was appointed as captain and played 32 games he missed 1977 78 pre season with a knee injury but recovered well enough to make 36 appearances throughout campaign kaye was sacked after a poor start to season and was replaced by bremner s former leeds teammate bobby collins who had joined club as assistant manager in summer as at leeds bremner had applied for vacant managerial role but was rejected after being turned down for job he announced his intention to retire as a player at end of his contract in june 1978 season was a disaster and though collins was sacked and replaced by youth coach ken houghton in february results did not improve and hull were relegated in last place ten points from safety international career bremner was well established in scotland set up winning three under 23 caps before he made his debut for scotland in a 0 0 draw with spain at hampden park he went on to feature in qualifying games for 1966 fifa world cup but defeats to poland and italy left scotland second in group which was not enough to qualify he also played in friendlies against brazil and portugal and received a black eye from pele s elbow in a clash during a high ball despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to bremner how he had failed to intimidate pele as he had done to many other great players of day thumb 250px left bremner and johan cruyff in 1971 england scotland football rivalry was intense throughout his playing career and so great media attention came upon bremner and rest of scottish players after they beat world cup winners england 3 2 at wembley to become unofficial world champions on 15 april 1967 many teammates said that bremner held this match as one of proudest moments of his career placed in a tough group for qualification to 1970 fifa world cup scotland failed to qualify after finishing in second place bremner captained his country throughout process having first taken up armband in a friendly defeat by denmark in copenhagen he scored his first international goal in a 2 1 qualifying victory over austria at hampden park his first game as captain this game was followed by two victories over cyprus and a 1 1 draw with west germany however a 3 2 defeat by west germany in hamburg ended their hopes of making it to world cup bremner s second international goal came in a 3 2 win over wales in a british home championship game at racecourse ground thumbnail bremner playing for scotland at 1974 world cup scotland were only home nation to qualify for 1974 fifa world cup after finishing ahead of czechoslovakia and denmark in their group however bremner was nearly not selected by manager willie ormond after ormond found him drunk in a bar not long after jimmy johnstone had to be rescued by coast guard having gotten stranded in a rowing boat during a night out following a home internationals match with northern ireland having been selected bremner captained scotland to a 2 0 win over zaire at westfalenstadion a highly creditable 0 0 draw with world champions brazil left scotland with high hopes of qualifying to second round yet a 1 1 draw with yugoslavia sent scotland out of competition unbeaten due to brazil and yugoslavia finishing level on points but with superior goal difference bremner s last cap came against denmark on 3 september 1975 an incident in copenhagen after game where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a lifetime ban from international football by scottish football association four other players willie young joe harper pat mccluskey and arthur graham also were banned for life graham and harper later had their bans overturned bremner maintained his innocence stating that incident had been blown out of proportion by sfa management career doncaster rovers bremner was appointed manager of struggling fourth division side doncaster rovers in november 1978 he oversaw a 1 0 win over rochdale at belle vue in his first match in charge results fluctuated during 1978 79 season demonstrated by a 7 1 defeat by struggling bournemouth punctuating a run of five wins

straight wins for which bremner was credited with fourth division manager of month award however a run of just one win in 15 games followed for which bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities a mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 march for visit of bournemouth a game in which 16 year old ian snodin was named on bench rovers ended season in 12th place a disappointing opening sequence of 1980 81 season was followed by six wins in six games in september and bremner won his second manager of month award good results continued for rest of
