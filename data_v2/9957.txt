far north as memphis a strong cold front trailing low pressure area approached region from west high temperatures and dew points created moderate instability across outbreak area cape values a measurement of level of tropospheric instability were over 1000 j kg and helicity levels a measurement of potential for rotating winds reached over 200 m2 s2 upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear these factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather thumb right ef4 damage to a large brick home near moulton alabama on february 5 at 6 39 am cst 1239
