scleractinia also called stony corals or hard corals are marine animals in phylum cnidaria that build themselves a hard skeleton individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc in which a mouth is fringed with tentacles although some species are solitary most are colonial founding polyp settles and starts to secrete calcium carbonate to protect its soft body solitary corals can be as much as across but in colonial species polyps are usually only a few millimetres in diameter these polyps reproduce asexually by budding but remain attached to each other forming a multi polyp colony of clones with a common skeleton which may be up to several metres in diameter or height according to species shape and appearance of each coral colony depends not only on species but also on its location depth amount of water movement and other factors many shallow water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues these give their colour to coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains stony corals are closely related to sea anemones and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes corals reproduce both sexually and asexually most species release gametes into sea where fertilisation takes place and planula larvae drift as part of plankton but a few species brood their eggs asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere stony corals occur in all world s oceans much of framework of modern coral reefs is formed by scleractinians reef building or hermatypic corals are mostly colonial most of these are zooxanthellate and are found in shallow waters into which sunlight penetrates other corals that do not form reefs may be solitary or colonial some of these occur at abyssal depths where no light reaches stony corals first appeared in middle triassic but their relationship to tabulate and rugose corals of paleozoic is currently unresolved in modern times stony corals numbers are expected to decline due to effects of global warming and ocean acidification reef building corals lose out to softer cousins due to global warming march 24 2013 scientific american anatomy thumb diagram showing a coral polyp its corallite coenosarc and scleractinian corals may be solitary or colonial colonies can reach considerable size consisting of a large number of individual polyps soft parts stony corals are members of class anthozoa and like other members of group do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle individual animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles base of polyp secretes stony material from which coral skeleton is formed body wall of polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis mouth is at centre of oral disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into body before opening into gastrovascular cavity that fills interior of body and tentacles unlike other cnidarians however cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions thin sheets of living tissue known as mesenteries gonads are also located within cavity walls polyp is retractable into corallite stony cup in which it sits being pulled back by sheet like retractor muscles polyps are connected by horizontal sheets of tissue known as coenosarc extending over outer surface of skeleton and completely covering it these sheets are continuous with body wall of polyps and include extensions of gastrovascular cavity so that food and water can circulate between all different members of colony in colonial species repeated asexual division of polyps causes corallites to be interconnected thus forming colonies also cases exist in which adjacent colonies of same species form a single colony by fusing most colonial species have very small polyps ranging from in diameter although some solitary species may be as large as skeleton thumb left a brain coral skeleton of an individual scleractinian polyp is known as a corallite it is secreted by epidermis of lower part of body and initially forms a cup surrounding this part of polyp interior of cup contains radially aligned plates or septa projecting upwards from base each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries septa are secreted by mesenteries and are therefore added in same order as mesenteries are as a result septa of different ages are adjacent to one another and symmetry of scleractinian skeleton is radial or this pattern of septal insertion is termed cyclic by paleontologists by contrast in some fossil corals adjacent septa lie in order of increasing age a pattern termed serial and produces a bilateral symmetry scleractinians secrete a stony exoskeleton in which septa are inserted between mesenteries in multiples of six all modern scleractinian skeletons are composed of calcium carbonate in form of crystals of aragonite however a prehistoric scleractinian had a non aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous rather than solid as is case in prehistoric order rugosa scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion growth thumb meandering corallite walls of an intratentacular budding coral thumb separate corallites of an extratentacular budding species in colonial corals growth results from budding of new polyps there are two types of budding intratentacular and extratentacular in intratentacular budding a new polyp develops on oral disc inside ring of tentacles this can form individual separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths tentacles grow around margin of this elongated oral disc and not around individual mouths this is surrounded by a single corallite wall as is case in corallites of brain corals extratentacular budding always results in separate polyps each with its own corallite wall in case of bushy corals such as acropora lateral budding from axial polyps form basis of trunk and branches rate at which a stony coral colony lays down calcium carbonate depends on species but some of branching species can increase in height or length by around a year about same rate as human hair grows other corals like dome and plate species are more bulky and may only grow per year piper ross 2007 extraordinary animals an encyclopedia of curious and unusual animals greenwood press rate of aragonite deposition varies diurnally and seasonally examination of cross sections of coral can show bands of deposition indicating annual growth like tree rings these can be used to estimate age of coral solitary corals do not bud they gradually increase in size as they deposit more calcium carbonate and produce new whorls of septa a large for example normally has a single mouth may be about long and have more than a thousand septa distribution stony corals occur in all world s oceans there are two main ecological groups hermatypic corals are mostly colonial corals which tend to live in clear oligotrophic shallow tropical waters they are world s primary reef builders ahermatypic corals are either colonial or solitary and are found in all regions of ocean and do not build reefs some live in tropical waters but some inhabit temperate seas polar waters or live at great depths from photic zone down to about ecology thumb hard coral extends its polyps at night to feed scleractinians fall into one of two main categories reef forming or hermatypic corals which mostly contain zooxanthellae non reef forming or ahermatypic corals which mostly do not contain zooxanthellae in reef forming corals cells are usually replete with symbiotic unicellular dinoflagellates known as zooxanthellae there are sometimes as many as five million cells of these per of coral tissue symbionts benefit corals because up to 50 of organic compounds they produce are used as food by polyps oxygen byproduct of photosynthesis and additional energy derived from sugars produced by zooxanthallae enable these corals to grow at a rate up to three times faster than similar species without symbionts these corals typically grow in shallow well lit warm water with moderate to brisk turbulence and abundant oxygen and prefer firm non muddy surfaces on which to settle most stony corals extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton but those with larger polyps take correspondingly larger prey including various invertebrates and even small fish in addition to capturing prey in this way many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into mouth in a few stony corals this is primary method of feeding and tentacles are reduced or absent an example being acropora acuminata caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal with polyps retracting into their skeletons during day thus maximising exposure of zooxanthallae to light but in indo pacific region many species feed by day and night non zooxanthellate corals are usually not reef formers they can be found most abundantly beneath about of water they thrive at much colder temperatures and can live in total darkness deriving their energy from capture of plankton and suspended organic particles growth rates of most species of non zooxanthellate corals are significantly slower than those of their counterparts and typical structure for these corals is less calcified and more susceptible to mechanical damage than that of zooxanthellate corals life cycle stony corals have a great range of reproductive strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually many species have separate sexes whole colony being either male or female but others are hermaphroditic with individual polyps having both male and female gonads some species brood their eggs but in most species sexual reproduction results in production of a free swimming planula larva that eventually settles on seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp in colonial species this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually to give rise to entire colony asexual reproduction thumb montastraea annularis can be fragmented to form new colonies most common means of asexual reproduction in colonial stony corals is by fragmentation pieces of branching corals may get detached during storms by strong water movement or by mechanical means and fragments fall to sea bed in suitable conditions these are capable of adhering to substrate and starting new colonies even such massive corals as montastraea annularis have been shown to be capable of forming new colonies after fragmentation this process is used in reef aquarium hobby to increase stock without necessity to harvest corals from wild under adverse conditions certain species of coral resort to another type of asexual reproduction in form of polyp bail out which may allow polyps to survive even though parent colony dies it involves growth of coenosarc to seal off polyps detachment of polyps and their settlement on seabed to initiate new colonies in other species small balls of tissue detach themselves from coenosarc differentiate into polyps and start secreting calcium carbonate to form new colonies and in unfertilised eggs can develop into viable larvae sexual reproduction overwhelming majority of scleractinian taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies in temperate regions usual pattern is synchronized release of eggs and sperm into water during brief spawning events often related to phases of moon in tropical regions reproduction may occur throughout year in many cases as in genus acropora eggs and sperm are released in buoyant bundles which rise to surface this increases concentration of sperm and eggs and thus likelihood of fertilization and reduces risk of self fertilization immediately after spawning eggs are delayed in their capability for fertilization until after release of polar bodies this delay and possibly some degree of self incompatibility likely increases chance of cross fertilization a study of four species of scleractinia found that cross fertilization was actually dominant mating pattern although three of species were also capable of self fertilization to varying extents evolutionary history thumb left palaeozoic rugose corals with calcite skeletons like this grewingkia canadensis are doubtfully ancestors of scleractinia there is little evidence on which to base a hypothesis about origin of scleractinians plenty is known about modern species but very little about fossil specimens which first appeared in record in middle triassic stanley g d evolution of modern corals and their early history earth science rev 60 195 225 2003 it was not until 25 million years later that they became important reef builders their success perhaps a result of teaming up with algae nine of sub orders were in existence by end of triassic and three more had appeared by jurassic 200 million years ago with a further suborder appearing in middle cretaceous 100 million years ago some may have developed from a common ancestor either an anemone like coral without a skeleton or a rugose coral a rugose coral seems an unlikely common ancestor because these corals had calcite rather than aragonite skeletons and septa were arranged serially rather than cyclically however it may be that similarities of scleractinians to rugosans are due to a common non ancestor in early paleozoic alternatively scleractinians may have developed from a corallimorpharia like ancestor it seems that may have been associated with development of symbiosis and reef formation and may have occurred on more than one occasion dna sequencing appears to indicate that scleractinian corals are a monophyletic group thumb scleractinian coral from formation jurassic of earliest scleractinians were not reef builders but were small or solitary individuals scleractinian corals were probably at their greatest diversity in jurassic and all but disappeared in mass extinction event at end of cretaceous about 18 out of 67 genera surviving recently discovered paleozoic corals with skeletons and cyclic septal insertion two features that characterize scleractinia have strengthened hypothesis for an independent origin of scleractinia whether early scleractinian corals were zooxanthellate is an open question phenomenon seems to have evolved independently on numerous occasions during tertiary and genera and all in different families each have both zooxanthellate and non zooxanthellate members classification thumb left upright a deep sea collected by royal indian marine survey ship investigator 1898 taxonomy of scleractinia is particularly challenging many species were described before advent of scuba diving with little realisation by authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats and were unable to observe changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid deeper water conditions more than 2 000 nominal species were described in this era and by rules of nomenclature name given to first described species has precedence over rest even when that description is poor and environment and even sometimes country of type specimen is unknown even concept of species is suspect with regard to corals which have large geographical ranges with a number of sub populations their geographic boundaries merge with those of other species their morphological boundaries merge with those of other species and there are no definite distinctions between species and subspecies evolutionary relationships among stony corals were first examined in 19th and early 20th centuries two most advanced 19th century classifications both used complex skeletal characters 1857 classification of french zoologists henri milne edwards and jules s was based on macroscopic skeletal characters while francis grant ogilvie s 1897 scheme was developed using observations of skeletal microstructures with particular attention to structure and pattern of septal trabeculae in 1943 american zoologists thomas wayland vaughan and john west wells and wells again in 1956 used patterns of septal trabeculae to divide group into five suborders in addition they considered features such as growth of tentacles they also distinguished families by wall type and type of budding 1952 classification by french zoologist j alloiteau was built on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve anatomical characters of polyp alloiteau recognized eight suborders in 1942 w h bryan and d hill stressed importance of microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers which are genetically derived therefore diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and that there were many examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa rise of molecular techniques at end of 20th century prompted new evolutionary hypotheses that were different from ones founded on skeletal data results of molecular studies explained a variety of aspects of evolutionary biology of scleractinia including connections between and within extant taxa and supplied support for hypotheses about extant corals that are founded on fossil record 1996 analysis of mitochondrial rna undertaken by american zoologists sandra romano and stephen palumbi found that molecular data supported assembling of species into existing families but not into traditional suborders for example some genera affiliated with different suborders were now located on same branch of a phylogenetic tree in addition there is no distinguishing morphological character that separates clades only molecular differences australian zoologist john veron and his co workers analyzed ribosomal rna in 1996 to obtain similar results to romano and palumbi again concluding that traditional families were plausible but that suborders were incorrect they also established that stony corals are monophyletic including all descendants of a common ancestor but that they are divided into two groups robust and complex clades veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes families world register of marine species lists following families as being included in order scleractinia
