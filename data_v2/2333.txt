tansy beetle chrysolina graminis is a species of leaf beetle it measures 7 7 10 5 mm in length and has a characteristic bright metallic green colouration common name derives from tansy plant on which they often feed as both larvae and adults in addition to nominotypical subspecies which repeats specific name c graminis graminis there are five further distinct subspecies of tansy beetle which collectively have a palearctic distribution although in majority of countries where it is found species is declining in united kingdom it is designated as nationally rare and this localised population centred on york north yorkshire has been subject of much recent research taxonomy tansy beetle was first described by linnaeus in 1758 in 10th edition of systema naturae as chrysomela graminis and was later transferred to genus chrysolina genus chrysolina currently contains 39 subgenera c graminis with its several subspecies is located in subgenus which contains only one other species c virgata this subgenus was first established in 1950 its species name graminis is a form of latin noun grass meaning of grass grass like chrysolina graminis sensu lato has at least three later binomial names which are considered to be synonyms chrysomela fabricius 1801 mallet 1924 and chrysolina mallet 1924 there are six subspecies of tansy beetle nominate subspecies c graminis graminis was established via original description of species in 1758 c graminis santonici named after italian name santonico for its host plant artemisa caerulescens was described by n b contarini in 1847 in 1860 described two subspecies c graminis artemisiae and c graminis auraria these were added to in 20th century with c graminis christianae mallet 1933 and c graminis mediterranea 1950 subspecies of c graminis have localised distributions c graminis artemisiae is located in south east europe central asia and southern siberia c graminis auraria is located in eastern mongolia and china c graminis christianae is located in france c graminis mediterranea is located in corsica and spain c graminis santonici is located in central alps description all tansy beetles are small rounded beetles approximately 7 12 mm in length there are both internal and external morphological differences between six subspecies morphological features of tansy beetle subspecies subspecies graminis graminis nominotypical species tansy beetles c graminis graminis are small rounded beetles 7 7 10 5 mm in length body is dorsally bright green elytra mostly with golden red or golden lateral margins and stripe near suture iridescence on elytra visibly contrasts with head and pronotum punctuation on elytra is easily visible by eye but any punctuation is very difficult to see on pronotum with exception of side margins there is a smooth lip running entire length of ventral edge of elytra aedeagus is narrowed at apex without teeth on underside c graminis auraria 9 5 11 4 mm in length with deep lateral depressions of pronotum developed only in its basal half c graminis mediterranea 10 12 mm in length with a more finely punctuated pronotum than nominotypical species punctuation is slightly rougher except at scutellum and central margin is wider than in c graminis graminis but poorly distinct across its entire length c graminis santonici described as having black mouth parts and palps green elytra and a red abdomen with four brown spots evident larvae larvae of c graminis have four instar stages though first instar may not possess characteristics of later instars larvae are brown and dorsally convex with spiracles evident on eight segments they usually have small indistinct tubercles with very short setae head of each larva is a darker brown than body and has six ocelli on each side mandibles have five apical teeth distinguishing chrysolina graminis and chrysolina herbacea 150px thumb right mint beetle chrysolina herbacea chrysolina graminis and c herbacea are similar in size and colour and may be confused in uk populations distinguishing two species in united kingdom is particularly important as c graminis is a vulnerable species whereas c herbacea is much more common this has previously led to misidentification of c herbacea as c graminis c herbacea measures 7 11 mm in length it is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout punctuation on pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar unlike in c graminis there is a smooth lip running only half length of ventral edge of elytra whereas this lip runs full length on c graminis distribution and habitat tansy beetle has a palearctic distribution evidence from archaeological excavation has shown that its presence in western europe is confirmed at least as early as neolithic period beetles may be found on tansy tanacetum vulgare and water mint mentha aquatica in fen land and banks of rivers with broad floodplains in britain larvae are also recorded from other host plants achillea ptarmica sneezewort in france and various plants of genus artemisia in russia adults and larvae feed on leaves of their host plants distribution in continental europe c graminis is widespread from scandinavia to mediterranean sea it may also be found in central asia and china in russia it may be found in tundra zone from polar urals to kolyma river and in nearby countries of kazakhstan and mongolia it is listed as vulnerable in austria denmark sweden and norway and in germany it is rare in one district endangered in another united kingdom in united kingdom its range is currently restricted to about 45 km of banks of river ouse centred on york north yorkshire although there are scattered records from across england some of these may represent mis identifications of mint beetle a more widespread species tansy beetles had previously been recorded from wicken fen cambridgeshire where species of mint mentha spp not tansy acted as host plant last accurate record for beetle at this site was in 1981 in august 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at fen following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from yorkshire to this site was undertaken as of 2006 there were 19 british 10 km squares with records of tansy beetle but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970 six of which are centred around york in 2015 total number of individuals estimated from a survey of this area on banks of river ouse was 24 000 in 2016 this number increased significantly to 40 000 threats to habitat decline in c graminis is likely to be due to habitat loss resulting from land improvement and arable conversion over grazing development drainage and lowering of water tables due to over abstraction neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over shading or competition of food plants with invasive species such as himalayan balsam impatiens glandulifera flood bank works may deplete or destroy local sub populations within york distribution beetles are dependent on tansy as their sole food source if a clump disappears beetles are forced to walk to a new location as they rarely fly despite having fully working wings and being capable of doing so loss of habitat impacts upon ability of tansy beetle to find an alternative source of host plant additionally tansy is a ruderal species and thus has a naturally high rate of turnover of plants forcing beetles to regularly seek out new tansy patches to colonise a 2009 study of tansy beetle occupancy amongst 1305 patches stems separated by no more than 50 cm of tansy plant on banks of river ouse york uk intended to establish data on distribution of tansy plants and relate this to existing tansy beetle populations in order to contribute to conservation effort of species results were analysed using generalised additive models to conclude that tansy patches should be managed towards volumes of 3 m and that these patches should be targeted within 200 m of existing beetle subpopulations on same river bank in order to help beetle population disperse and survive life cycle thumb right tansy tanacetum vulgare a medicinal herb both adults and larvae use same host plant during their life cycle as tansy often grows in discrete clumps total population of c graminis in an area may be divided and individuals may spend their entire life cycle within an area of a few square metres adults mate between march and june in monitored populations at york mating of same pair could last over 24 hours during which time some pairs moved between tansy patches mating in a russian population of c graminis is preceded by an elaborate ritual not evident in other populations of species involving male tapping female s eyes pronotum and antennae with its antennae mated females lay batches of 3 15 elongated yellow eggs each 2 mm long on underside of tansy leaves eggs hatch into grey larvae in captivity one newly mated female produced 561 eggs over 136 days and another produced 158 eggs over 49 days females will lay in several locations average clutch size is 5 6 eggs female c graminis will eggs of other females in laboratory conditions newly hatched larvae have been shown to survive for at least four days without food and thus have a long window of opportunity in which to reach a tansy plant in july final instar larvae burrow underground beneath plant to pupate although very little is known about biology of this process in c graminis between august and september this new adult population emerges to feed before returning underground to overwinter in october emergence of adults is from march to april next year long term monitoring has indicated that survival during winter hibernation is surprisingly high as autumn and spring population sizes are very similar this is despite annual winter flooding of river ouse implying that overwintering individuals must be extremely tolerant of long periods of inundation and oxygen deprivation approximately 5 of overwintering adults do not emerge from soil after winter but remain underground for next year in a state of extended diapause and emerge in following spring a few adult beetles may overlap between spring and summer populations but most adults from earlier emergence die before end of summer both adult and larval tansy beetles are to detect their host plant or each other at a distance either by smell sight or a combination of two starvation is thus likely to be a major contributor to mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost behaviour and ecology diet tansy beetles are herbivorous and primarily use tansy tanacetum vulgare as their host plant species has however also been recorded consuming a wider range of food plants including europaeus palustris marsh achillea ptarmica sneezewort mentha aquatica water mint mentha rotundifolia false apple mint as well as other species of genera chrysanthemum and artemisia subspecies c graminis santonico is associated with artemisa caerulescens tansy plant naturally contains a number of volatile components including 1 8 cineole trans camphor and with quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant 1 8 cineole is a toxin believed to defend plant leaves against attacks by herbivores tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals however tansy is a repellent to other beetles for example steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and and is strongly repellent to colorado potato beetle predation thumb scorpionfly panorpa germanica has been observed preying on tansy beetle larvae thumb tansy beetle with damaged elytra on tansy flower heads beetle remains bearing what appeared to be marks of bird attacks have been found by river ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra interpreted as pinch marks inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening dead beetles have also been found in webs of spiders in a captive population accidental predation of c graminis by livestock consuming tansy plant is also possible predation of a larva by scorpionfly panorpa germanica has been observed in field tachinid genus macquartia exclusively parasitizes beetles and one species of which macquartia dispar may parasitise c graminis directly adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into vicinity of host larvae larvae of other are predated by birds predatory bugs larvae larvae ants wasps spiders and harvestmen all of which are common on tansy around york population pupal stage may be directly predated by european mole parasites a mite family has been recorded from a single adult specimen of c graminis and chrysomela a species of hymenopteran of family is recorded as an endoparasite of pupal stage relationship with humans conservation in united kingdom thumb himalayan balsam impatiens glandulifera an invasive plant competing with tansy in uk species is formally designated as nationally rare in united kingdom and categorised as a species of principal importance in accordance with natural environment and rural communities act 2006 tansy beetle action group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from university of york north yorkshire county council city of york council environment agency and national trust a recovery programme started involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy such as himalayan balsam and limited re introductions within current species range new clumps of tansy have been planted particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond 200 m walking range of beetle in order to publicise conservation project rachael maskell member of parliament for constituency of york central became a tansy beetle species champion in 2016 that same year a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90 km stretch of banks of river ouse surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers rising over 60 between 2015 and 2016 to 40 000 individuals references external links tansy beetle life
