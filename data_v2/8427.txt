hurricane nicole of 2016 it was sixth named storm fourth hurricane and first major hurricane of season developed from a tropical wave in tropical atlantic ocean on august 25 it moved west northwestward under influence of subtropical ridge to its north and steadily strengthened in an area of warm water temperatures and light wind shear hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145 mph 230 km h on september 1 and it slowly weakened as it turned northward on september 5 fabian made a direct hit on bermuda with wind speeds of over 120 mph 195 km h after passing island hurricane turned to northeast and became extratropical on september 8 before dissipating two days later fabian was strongest hurricane to hit bermuda since hurricane arlene in 1963 it was both most damaging and first

coast in all fabian caused around us in damage and eight deaths meteorological history on august 25 a tropical wave emerged off coast of africa tracking westward wave developed convection over its center and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further system passed through cape verde islands later that day as convection steadily weakened early on august 27 convection again increased and consolidated near center and later that day wave developed into tropical depression ten while located 420 miles 675 km west of cape verde islands moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear depression steadily intensified and was named tropical storm fabian on august 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent banding features and outflow continued to develop as a ring of convection formed around center of fabian and on august 30 storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to west northwest as banding features and outflow became better defined an eye developed in center of deepest convection fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day deep convection became very concentric around 11 5 mile 18 5 km wide eye and hurricane reached winds of 125 mph 205 km h early on august 31 at this time deepest convection near eye degraded in appearance and fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend later that day eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection outflow continued to expand in all directions and fabian intensified into a category 4 hurricane late on august 31 thunderstorm activity near eyewall became more intense and cloud tops in eyewall became much cooler simultaneously outflow away from eye became much more symmetrical both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone fabian reached its peak intensity of 145 mph 230 km h on september 1 while located 345 miles 555 km east of northern lesser antilles right thumb hurricane fabian south of bermuda on september 5 after maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations and began to weaken hurricane turned to northwest on september 2 in response to a weakness in subtropical ridge a break caused by a mid level circulation over southwest atlantic ocean after fading back to a category 3 hurricane fabian re intensified on september 4 and regained category 4 status for a short time hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards bermuda a motion due to an approaching mid level trough as small pockets of dry air became entrained in eyewall fabian weakened slightly passing just 14 miles 23 km west of bermuda on september 5 as a 120 mph 185 km h category 3 hurricane div eastern portion of eyewall moved over island resulting in a direct hit however as center did not move over island fabian did not make landfall after passing island hurricane accelerated northeastward and weakened to a 105 mph 165 km h category 2 hurricane on september 7 steady weakening occurred as hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear drier air and progressively cooler waters on september 8 while located 680 miles 1095 km east northeast of cape race newfoundland fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm with no deep convection remaining near center fabian s extratropical remnant turned to north on september 9 and on september 10 fabian s remnant merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern greenland and iceland preparations several days prior to fabian striking bermuda computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing hurricane to west of island by 200 miles 320 km not expected to be a direct threat a meteorologist at bermuda weather service expected gusty winds and
