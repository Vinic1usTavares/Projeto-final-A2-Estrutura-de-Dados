george ledyard stebbins jr january 6 1906 january 19 2000 was an american botanist and geneticist who is widely regarded as one of leading evolutionary biologists of 20th century yoon c k january 21 2000 ledyard stebbins 94 dies applied evolution to plants new york times section b page 9 stebbins received his ph d in botany from harvard university in 1931 he went on to university of california berkeley where his work with e b babcock on genetic evolution of plant species and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as bay area biosystematists led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics his most important publication was variation and evolution in plants which combined genetics and darwin s theory of natural selection to describe plant speciation it is regarded as one of main publications which formed core of modern synthesis and still provides conceptual framework for research in plant evolutionary biology according to ernst mayr few later works dealing with evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by stebbins work mayr ernst botany introduction in evolutionary synthesis perspectives on unification of biology ernst mayr and william provine editors cambridge massachusetts harvard university press 1998 p 138 regarding synthesis more than anything else it was stebbins book variation and evolution in plants 1950 that brought botany into synthesis it had same impact in botany as dobzhansky s book in population genetics integrating widely scattered literature of plant evolution and providing abundant suggestions for further research he also researched and wrote widely on role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in field from 1960 stebbins was instrumental in establishment of department of genetics at university of california davis and was active in numerous organizations involved in promotion of evolution and of science in general he was elected to national academy of science was awarded national medal of science and was involved in development of evolution based science programs for california high schools as well as conservation of rare plants in that state early life and education stebbins was born in lawrence new york youngest of three children his parents were george ledyard stebbins a wealthy real estate financier who developed seal harbor maine and helped to establish acadia national park and edith alden candler stebbins both parents were native new yorkers and episcopalians stebbins was known throughout his life as ledyard to distinguish himself from his father family encouraged their sons interest in natural history during their periodic journeys to seal harbor in 1914 edith contracted tuberculosis and stebbins moved to santa barbara california to improve her health in california stebbins was enrolled at cate school in carpinteria where he became influenced by ralph hoffmann an american natural history instructor and amateur ornithologist and botanist colloquium on variation and evolution in plants and microorganisms toward a new synthesis 50 years after stebbins by michael i after graduating from high school he embarked on a major in political studies at harvard by third year of his undergraduate study he had decided to major in botany thumb perennial plant antennaria is one of species studied by stebbins for his doctoral dissertation stebbins started graduate studies at harvard in 1928 initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography particularly that of flora of new england with merritt lyndon fernald he completed his ma in 1929 and continued to work toward his ph d he became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies a method that fernald did not support stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on cytology of plant reproductive processes in genus antennaria with e c jeffrey as his supervisor and fernald on his supervisory panel during his ph d candidature stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist karl sax sax identified several errors in stebbins s work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that while in accordance with jeffrey s views were inconsistent with work of contemporary geneticists jeffrey and sax argued over stebbins s dissertation and thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views stebbins s ph d was granted by harvard in 1931 in march that year he married margaret chamberlin with whom he had three children in 1932 he took a teaching position in biology at colgate university while at colgate he continued his work in cytogenetics in particular he continued to study genetics of antennaria and began to study behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist percy saunders saunders and stebbins attended 1932 international congress of genetics in ithaca new york here stebbins s interest was captured by talks given by thomas hunt morgan and barbara mcclintock who spoke about chromosomal crossover stebbins reproduced mcclintock s crossover experiments in peony and published several papers on cytogenetics of paeonia which established his reputation as a geneticist uc berkeley thumb polyploidy and speciation in genus crepis was subject of stebbins and babcock s work on plant species formation c sibirica shown here was a species he examined in 1935 stebbins was offered a genetics research position at university of california berkeley working with geneticist e b babcock babcock needed assistance with a large rockefeller funded project characterizing genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from genus crepis and was interested in developing crepis into a model plant to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in model insect drosophila melanogaster like genera that stebbins had previously studied crepis commonly hybridized displayed polyploidy chromosome doubling and could make seed without fertilization a process known as apomixis collaboration between babcock and stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs first monograph published in 1937 resulted in splitting off asiatic crepis species into genus second published in 1938 was titled american species of crepis their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis in american species of crepis babcock and stebbins described concept of polyploid complex and its role in plant evolution some genera such as crepis have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones babcock and stebbins also observed that types formed from hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments because they inherit all traits from both parents they also showed that hybridization in polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on history of a genus this monograph was described by swedish botanist ake gustafsson as most important work on formation of species during that period gustafsson a 1946 1947 apomixis in higher plants c w k gleerup lund thumb triangle of u shows how hybridization and polyploidy have given rise to new species in genus brassica chromosomes from each of genomes a b and c are represented by different colours cartoon shows origin of aabb aacc and species which have chromosome sets from their aa bb and cc ancestors stebbins s review significance of polyploidy in plant evolution published in american naturalist in 1940 demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes had shown that polyploidy was important in developing large complex and widespread genera however by looking at history of polyploidy in plant families he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials and infrequent in woody plants and annuals as such polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented acquisition and replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution this work continued with 1947 paper types of polyploids their classification and significance which detailed a system for classification of polyploids and described stebbins ideas about role of in angiosperm evolution where he argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for construction of phylogenies these reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study role of polyploidy in evolution in 1939 with babcock s support stebbins was made a full professor in department of genetics at uc berkeley after department of botany failed to promote him stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution he became associated with a group known as bay area biosystematists which included botanist jens clausen taxonomist david d keck physiologist william hiesey and evolutionary geneticist theodosius dobzhansky during this time he also became friends with botanist herbert baker with encouragement of this group of scientists stebbins directed his research towards evolution he became involved with society for study of evolution in 1946 and was one of few botanists involved with new organization his research on plant evolution also progressed during this period he worked on genetics of forage grasses looking at polyploidy and evolution of poaceae and publishing numerous papers on subject though 1940s he produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from diploid species erecta through treatment with chromosome doubling agent colchicine he was able to establish plant in field and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment variation and evolution in plants columbia university s jesup lectures were starting point for many of most important works of modern evolutionary synthesis presenters introduced connection between two important discoveries units of evolution genes with selection as primary mechanism of evolution in 1941 edgar anderson whose work on hybridization in genus iris had interested stebbins since they met in 1930 and ernst mayr co presented lecture series and mayr later published his lectures as systematics and origin of species in 1946 stebbins was invited on dobzhansky s recommendation to present prestigious lectures stebbins lectures drew together otherwise disparate fields of genetics ecology systematics cytology and paleontology in 1950 these lectures were published as variation and evolution in plants which proved to be one of most important books in 20th century botany book brought botanical science into new synthesis of evolutionary theory and became part of canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed modern synthesis of evolution variation and evolution in plants was first book to provide a wide ranging explanation of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at genetic level it brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from dobzhansky s 1937 genetics and origin of species and provided conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field plant evolutionary biology in book stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels first that of individual variation within an interbreeding population second that of distribution and frequency of this variation and third that of separation and divergence of populations as result of building up of isolating mechanisms leading to formation of species he used work of biosystematists clausen keck hiesey and turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variation that is genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments one of book s most original chapters used cytogenetics work of c d darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection book offered few original hypotheses but stebbins hoped that by summarising available research on plant evolution book would help to open way towards a deeper understanding of evolutionary problems and more fruitful research in direction of their solution stebbins g l 1950 variation and evolution in plants columbia university press book effectively ended any serious belief in alternative mechanisms of evolution in plants such as lamarckian evolution or soft inheritance which were still upheld by some botanists following that publication stebbins was regarded as an expert on modern evolutionary theory and is widely credited with founding of science of plant evolutionary biology variation and evolution in plants continues to be widely cited in contemporary scientific botanical literature more than 50 years after its publication stebbins regarded his contribution to modern synthesis as application of genetic principles already established by other workers to botany i didn t add any new elements to modern synthetic theory to speak of i just modified things so that people could understand how things were in plant world g ledyard stebbins january 6 1906 january 19 2000 spring 2000 uc davis alumni newsletter uc davis and later life stebbins took an appointment at university of california davis in 1950 where he was a key figure in establishment of university s department of genetics he was department s first chairman and held position from 1958 to 1963 university of california university of california history genetics at davis focus of his research changed to incorporate newer areas such as developmental morphology and genetics in crop plants including barley he continued to publish widely and extensively on plant evolution writing over 200 papers and several books after 1950 stebbins and edgar anderson wrote a paper in 1954 on importance of hybridization in adapting to new environments they proposed novel adaptations would facilitate invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate formation of stabilized hybrid species following this paper stebbins developed first model of adaptive radiation he proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances that because of slow mutation rates genetic recombination was most likely source of this variation and that variation could be maximised though hybridization as of 2006 research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for creation and evolution of plant species it has been argued that contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with work of stebbins and anderson stebbins wrote several books during his time at uc davis these included his follow up to variation and evolution flowering plants evolution above species level which was published in 1974 following his delivery of prather lectures at harvard stebbins discusses origins genetics and developmental biology of angiosperms he argues for role of adaptive radiation in diversification of angiosperms and usefulness of applying our current understanding of species genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about evolution of ancient species raven p h angiosperm evolution science 187 734 735 he also wrote processes of organic evolution basis of progressive evolution chromosomal evolution in plants and textbook evolution with co authors dobzhansky francisco ayala and james w valentine his last book darwin to dna molecules to humanity was published in 1982 stebbins was passionate about teaching evolution advocating during 1960s and 70s teaching of darwinian evolution in public schools he worked closely with biological sciences curriculum study to develop high school curricula based on evolution as central unifying principle in biology he also opposed scientific creationism groups stebbins was active in numerous science organizations including international union of biological sciences western society of naturalists botanical society of america and society for study of evolution and served as president of american society of naturalists he was elected to national academy of sciences in 1952 stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science national medal of science gold medal from linnean society of london addison emery verrill medal from yale peabody museum of natural history and john frederick lewis award from american philosophical society he was elected a fellow of american academy of arts and sciences in 1952 he was awarded 1983 leidy award from academy of natural sciences of philadelphia stebbins was active in conservation issues in california during his later life he established a california native plant society branch in sacramento in early 1960s through society he created an active field trip program to increase interest in native flora of california and to document rare plants stebbins was state president of society during 1966 society was instrumental in preventing destruction of a beach on monterey peninsula that he referred to as evolution hill area is now known as s f b morse botanical area and is managed by del monte forest foundation del monte forest foundation del monte forest foundation properties he was a major contributor to society s 1996 book california s wild gardens a living legacy stebbins was instrumental in establishment of inventory of rare and endangered vascular plants of california by california native plant society it is still used by state and federal bodies in united states for conservation policy making stebbins was also a member of sierra club during his tenure at uc davis he trained more than 30 graduate students in genetics developmental biology and agricultural science in 1973 stebbins gave his last lectures at uc davis and was made professor emeritus following his retirement he travelled widely taught and visited colleagues for next 20 years his last paper a brief summary of my ideas on evolution was published in american journal of botany in 1999 same year he was co recipient with ernst mayr of distinguished service award from american institute of biological sciences a colloquium was held by national academies of science in 2000 to commemorate 50th anniversary of publication of variation and evolution in plants stebbins died in his home in davis same year from a cancer related illness stebbins was honored at a unitarian memorial service he had been active in church in his later years following his 1958 marriage to his second wife barbara monaghan stebbins pioneering evolutionist ledyard stebbins dies at age 94 january 20 2000 uc davis news

thought and botany by developing an intellectual framework for studying plant evolution including modern concepts of plant species and plant speciation his contributions to literature of plant evolutionary biology in addition to his seven books include more than 280 journal articles and book chapters a compilation of which were published in 2004 scientific papers of g ledyard stebbins 1929 2000 betty smocovitis a historian of science who is preparing a book length biography on stebbins described stebbins s scientific contribution as follows in science as in everything small scale synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties but truly great synthesizers can fall between cracks in cycle of scientific credit ledyard stebbins was in latter category neither fish nor fowl he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas usually at hands of narrower colleagues few however have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework his ability to read quickly recognize novel insights digest new material and then integrate knowledge were hallmarks of his scientific work style he was a masterful synthesizer and master of review essay or synthetic thought piece in 1980 university of california davis named a parcel of land near lake berryessa california
