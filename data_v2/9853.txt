tyrannosauridae or tyrannosaurids meaning tyrant lizards is a family of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs that comprises two subfamilies containing up to thirteen genera including eponymous tyrannosaurus exact number of genera is controversial with some experts recognizing as few as three all of these animals lived near end of cretaceous period and their fossils have been found only in north america europe and asia although descended from smaller ancestors tyrannosaurids were almost always largest predators in their respective ecosystems putting them at apex of food chain largest species was tyrannosaurus rex one of largest and most massive known land predators which measured over in length and according to most modern estimates to in weight tyrannosaurids were bipedal carnivores with massive skulls filled with large teeth despite their large size their legs were long and proportioned for fast movement in contrast their arms were very small bearing only two functional digits unlike most other groups of dinosaurs very complete remains have been discovered for most known tyrannosaurids this has allowed a variety of research into their biology scientific studies have focused on their ontogeny biomechanics and ecology among other subjects description tyrannosaurids were all large animals with all species capable of weighing at least 1 metric ton a single specimen of alioramus of an individual estimated at between long has been discovered although it is considered by some experts to be a juvenile albertosaurus gorgosaurus and daspletosaurus all measured between long while tarbosaurus reached lengths of from snout to tail massive tyrannosaurus reached in largest specimen fmnh pr2081 thumb tyrannosaurid t rex and allosaurus fragilis skulls note forward facing eye sockets of t rex tyrannosaurid skull anatomy is well understood as complete skulls are known for all genera but alioramus which is known only from partial skull remains tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus and daspletosaurus had skulls that exceeded in length adult tyrannosaurids had tall massive skulls with many bones fused and reinforced for strength at same time hollow chambers within many skull bones and large openings fenestrae between those bones helped to reduce skull weight many features of tyrannosaurid skulls were also found in their immediate ancestors including tall premaxillae and fused nasal bones tyrannosaurid skulls had many unique characteristics including fused parietal bones with a prominent sagittal crest which ran longitudinally along sagittal suture and separated two supratemporal fenestrae on skull roof behind these fenestrae tyrannosaurids had a characteristically tall nuchal crest which also arose from parietals but ran along a transverse plane rather than longitudinally nuchal crest was especially well developed in tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus and alioramus albertosaurus daspletosaurus and gorgosaurus had tall crests in front of eyes on lacrimal bones while tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus had extremely thickened postorbital bones forming crescent shaped crests behind eyes alioramus had a row of six bony crests on top of its snout arising from nasal bones lower crests have been reported on some specimens of daspletosaurus and tarbosaurus as well as more basal tyrannosauroid appalachiosaurus skull was perched at end of a thick s shaped neck and a long heavy tail acted as a counterweight to balance out head and torso with center of mass over hips tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two fingered forelimbs although remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found abstract only tarbosaurus had shortest forelimbs compared to its body size while daspletosaurus had longest tyrannosaurids walked exclusively on their hindlimbs so their leg bones were massive in contrast to forelimbs hindlimbs were longer compared to body size than almost any other theropods juveniles and even some smaller adults like more basal tyrannosauroids had longer tibiae than femora a characteristic of fast running dinosaurs like ornithomimids larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower moving animals but not to extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between second and fourth metatarsals forming a structure known as arctometatarsus it is unclear when arctometatarsus first evolved it was not present in earliest tyrannosauroids like dilong but was found in later appalachiosaurus this structure also characterized troodontids ornithomimids and caenagnathids but its absence in earliest tyrannosauroids indicates that it was acquired by convergent evolution teeth tyrannosaurids like their tyrannosauroid ancestors were heterodont with premaxillary teeth d shaped in cross section and smaller than rest unlike earlier tyrannosauroids and most other theropods maxillary and mandibular teeth of mature tyrannosaurids are not blade like but extremely thickened and often circular in cross section with some species having reduced serrations tooth counts tend to be consistent within species and larger species tend to have lower tooth counts than smaller ones for example alioramus had 76 to 78 teeth in its jaws while tyrannosaurus had between 54 and 60 william abler observed in 2001 that albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla abler w l 2001 a kerf and drill model of tyrannosaur tooth serrations p 84 89 in mesozoic vertebrate life ed s tanke d h carpenter k skrepnick m w indiana university press tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body so when a tyrannosaur would have pulled back on a piece of meat tension could cause a purely crack like serration to spread through tooth however presence of ampulla would have distributed these forces over a larger surface area and lessened risk of damage to tooth under strain presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to as abler describes impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity to wood they work with use of a drill to create an ampulla of sorts and prevent propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect airplane surfaces abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called and drilled holes was more than 25 stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions unlike tyrannosaurs and other theropods ancient predators like phytosaurs and dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent crack like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to forces of feeding history of discovery thumb left deinodon teeth earliest known tyrannosaurid remains first remains of tyrannosaurids were uncovered during expeditions led by geological survey of canada which located numerous scattered teeth these distinctive dinosaur teeth were given name deinodon terrible tooth by joseph leidy in 1856 first good specimens of a tyrannosaurid were found in horseshoe canyon formation of alberta and consisted of nearly complete skulls with partial skeletons these remains were first studied by edward drinker cope in 1876 who considered them a species of eastern tyrannosauroid dryptosaurus in 1905 henry fairfield osborn recognized that alberta remains differed considerably from dryptosaurus and coined a new name for them albertosaurus sarcophagus flesh eating alberta lizard cope described more tyrannosaur material in 1892 in form of isolated vertebrae and gave this animal name gigas this discovery was mostly overlooked for over a century and caused controversy in early 2000s when it was discovered that this material actually belonged to and had name priority over tyrannosaurus rex thumb teeth that have been assigned to aublysodon at various times in his 1905 paper naming albertosaurus osborn described two additional tyrannosaur specimens that had been collected from in montana and wyoming during a 1902 expedition of american museum of natural history led by barnum brown initially osborn considered these to be distinct species first he named dynamosaurus imperiosus emperor power lizard and second tyrannosaurus rex king tyrant lizard a year later osborn recognized that these two specimens actually came from same species despite fact that dynamosaurus had been found first name tyrannosaurus had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens therefore according to international code of zoological nomenclature iczn name tyrannosaurus was used barnum brown went on to collect several more tyrannosaurid specimens from alberta including first to preserve shortened two fingered forelimbs characteristic of group which lawrence lambe named gorgosaurus libratus balanced fierce lizard in 1914 a second significant find attributed to gorgosaurus was made in 1942 in form of a well preserved though unusually small complete skull specimen waited until after end of world war ii to be studied by charles w gilmore who named it gorgosaurus this skull was re studied by robert t bakker phil currie and michael williams in 1988 and assigned to new genus nanotyrannus it was also in 1946 that paleontologists from soviet union began expeditions into mongolia and uncovered first tyrannosaur remains from asia evgeny maleev described new mongolian species of tyrannosaurus and gorgosaurus in 1955 and one new genus tarbosaurus terrifying lizard subsequent studies however showed that all of maleev s tyrannosaur species were actually one species of tarbosaurus at different stages of growth a second species of mongolian tyrannosaurid was found later described by sergei in 1976 and given name alioramus remote different branch though its status as a true tyrannosaurid and not a more primitive tyrannosaur is still controversial distribution thumb right 450px while earlier tyrannosauroids are found on all three northern continents with possible remains from australia tyrannosaurid fossils blue dots are known only from north america and asia while earlier tyrannosauroids are found on all three northern continents tyrannosaurid fossils are known only from north america and asia sometimes fragmentary remains uncovered in southern hemisphere have been reported as southern hemisphere tyrannosaurids although these seem to have been misidentified abelisaurid fossils exact time and place of origin of family remain unknown due to poor fossil record in middle part of cretaceous on both continents although earliest confirmed tyrannosaurids lived in early campanian stage in western north america tyrannosaurid remains have never been recovered from eastern north america while more basal tyrannosauroids like dryptosaurus and appalachiosaurus persisted there until end of cretaceous indicating that tyrannosaurids must have evolved in or dispersed into western north america after continent was divided in half by western interior seaway in middle of cretaceous tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in alaska which may have provided a route for dispersal between north america and asia alioramus and tarbosaurus are found to be related in one cladistic analysis forming a unique asian branch of family this was later disproven with discovery of qianzhousaurus and description of tyrannosaur family alioramini tyrannosaurid teeth from a large species of unknown variety were discovered in nagasaki peninsula by researchers from fukui prefectural

in asia which was home to tyrannosaurines such as tarbosaurus and zhuchengtyrannus and qianzhousaurus and alioramus of alioramini both tyrannosaurinae and albertosaurinae subfamilies were present in campanian and early maastrichtian stages of north america with tyrannosaurines like daspletosaurus ranging throughout western interior while albertosaurines albertosaurus and gorgosaurus are currently known only from northwestern part of continent by late maastrichtian albertosaurines appear to have gone extinct while tyrannosaurine tyrannosaurus roamed from saskatchewan to texas this pattern is mirrored in other north american dinosaur taxa during campanian and early maastrichtian lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in northwest while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to south by end of cretaceous centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout western interior a study published in journal scientific reports on february 2 2016 by steve brusatte thomas carr et al indicates that during later maastrichtian tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for extinction of other tyrannosaurids in most of western north america study indicates that tyrannosaurus might have been an immigrant from asia as opposed to having evolved in north america possibly a descendant of closely related tarbosaurus that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids this theory is further supported by fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within tyrannosaurus known range http www livescience com t rex was invasive species html physiology growth paleontologist gregory erickson and colleagues have studied growth and life history of tyrannosaurids analysis of bone histology can determine age of a specimen when it died growth rates can be examined when age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives after rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity growth slowed down considerably in adult animals a tyrannosaurid growth curve is s shaped with maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age alt left thumb cast of skeleton of jane a juvenile tyrannosaurid in burpee museum of natural history in rockford smallest known tyrannosaurus rex individual lacm jordan theropod is estimated to have weighed only at only 2 years old while largest such as fmnh pr2081 sue most likely weighed about estimated to have been 28 years old an age which may have been close to maximum for species and corresponding body mass estimates ranged from 29 9 to 5654 kg t rex juveniles remained under until approximately 14 years of age when body size began to increase dramatically during this rapid growth phase a young t rex would gain an average of a year for next four years this slowed after 16 years and at 18 years of age curve plateaus again indicating that growth slowed dramatically for example only separated 28 year old sue from a 22 year old canadian specimen 81 12 1 this sudden change in growth rate may indicate physical maturity a hypothesis that is supported by discovery of medullary tissue in femur of an 18 year old t rex from montana mor 1125 also known as b rex medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation indicating that b rex was of reproductive age other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes compared to albertosaurines daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight maximum growth rate in daspletosaurus was per year based on a mass estimate of in adults other authors have suggested higher adult weights for daspletosaurus this would change magnitude of growth rate but not overall pattern youngest known albertosaurus is a two year old discovered in dry island bonebed which would have weighed about and measured slightly more than in length specimen from same quarry is oldest and largest known at 28 years of age fastest growth rate is estimated to occur around 12 16 years of age reaching per year based on a adult which is about a fifth of rate for t rex for gorgosaurus calculated maximum growth rate is about during rapid growth phase which is comparable to that of albertosaurus life history thumb nearly complete skeleton of a subadult gorgosaurus libratus from royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology end of rapid growth phase suggests onset of sexual maturity in albertosaurus although growth continued at a slower rate throughout animals lives sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from pattern in birds which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing by tabulating number of specimens of each age group erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in populations their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in fossil record subadults in rapid growth phase and adults were far more common over half of known t rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large long lived birds and mammals today these species are characterized by high infant mortality rates followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles mortality increases again following sexual maturity partly due to stresses of reproduction while this could be due to preservation or collection biases erickson hypothesized that difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants this low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by age of two paleontologists have not found enough daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis but erickson notes that same general trend seems to apply tyrannosaurids spent as much as half its life in juvenile phase before ballooning up to near maximum size in only a few years this along with complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods suggests these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids this is seen in modern komodo dragons where hatchlings start off as tree dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates for example albertosaurus have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed age packs locomotion locomotion abilities are best studied for tyrannosaurus and there are two main issues concerning this how well it could turn and what its maximum straight line speed was likely to have been tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45deg an amount that humans being vertically oriented and tail less can spin in a fraction of a second cause of difficulty is rotational inertia since much of tyrannosauruss mass was some distance from its center of gravity like a human carrying a heavy timber scientists have produced a wide range of maximum speed estimates mostly around but a few as low as and a few as high as researchers have to rely on various estimating techniques because while there are many tracks of very large theropods walking so far none have been found of very large theropods running and this absence may indicate that they did not run jack horner and don lessem argued in 1993 that tyrannosaurus was slow and probably could not run no airborne phase in mid stride however holtz 1998 concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were fastest large theropods christiansen 1998 estimated that leg bones of tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run there is no airborne phase and hence proposed that dinosaur s maximum speed would have been about which is about speed of a human sprinter farlow and colleagues 1995 have argued that a 6 to 8 ton tyrannosaurus would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly since its torso would have slammed into ground at a deceleration of 6 g six times acceleration due to gravity or about 60 metres s2 and its tiny arms could not have reduced impact bigger they come harder they fall new scientist 7 october 1995 p 18 however giraffes have been known to gallop at despite risk that they might break a leg or worse which can be fatal even in a safe environment such as a zoo thus it is quite possible that tyrannosaurus also moved fast when necessary and had to accept such risks this scenario has been studied for allosaurus too catalogs injuries of allosaurus known as big al at least one was attributed to a fall most recent research on tyrannosaurus locomotion does not narrow down speeds further than a range from i e from walking or slow running to moderate speed running r 1997 tendons dinosaur cards orbis publishing ltd a computer model study in 2007 estimated running speeds based on data taken directly from

manchester co author of a paper published in proceedings of royal society b retrieved 22 august 2007 probably a juvenile individual studies by eric snively et al published in 2019 indicate that tyrannosaurids such as tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus itself were more maneuverable than allosauroids of comparable size due to low rotational inertia compared to their body mass combined with large leg muscles as a result it is hypothesized that tyrannosaurids were capable of making relatively quick turns and could likely pivot their bodies more quickly when close to their prey or that while turning they could pirouette on a single planted foot while alternating leg was held out in a suspended swing during pursuit results of this study potentially could shed light on how agility could

debate in paleontological community surrounds extent and nature of tyrannosaurid integumentary covering long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from early cretaceous yixian formation and other nearby geological formations from liaoning china these filaments have usually been interpreted as protofeathers homologous with branched feathers found in birds and some non avian theropods although other hypotheses have been proposed a skeleton of dilong was described in 2004 that included first example of protofeathers in a tyrannosauroid similarly to down feathers of modern birds protofeathers found in dilong were branched but not pennaceous and may have been used for insulation discovery and description of feathered

sockets of t rex faced mainly forwards giving it good binocular vision eye sockets of tyrannosaurus are positioned so that eyes would point forward giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks while predatory theropods in general had binocular vision directly in front of their skull tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap jack horner also pointed out that tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision it is hard to see how natural selection would have favored this long term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers which would not have needed advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides in modern animals binocular vision is found mainly in predators principal exceptions are primates which need it for leaping from branch to branch unlike tyrannosaurus tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which eyes faced primarily sideways all of this suggests that tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight in gorgosaurus specimens eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera in daspletosaurus this was a tall oval somewhere in between circular shape seen in gorgosaurus and keyhole shape of tyrannosaurus facial sensory system based on comparisons of bone texture of daspletosaurus with extant crocodilians a detailed study in 2017 by thomas d carr et al found that tyrannosaurs had large flat scales on their snouts at center of these scales were small keratinised patches in crocodilians such patches cover bundles of sensory neurons that can detect mechanical thermal and chemical stimuli they proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also had bundles of sensory neurons under their facial scales and may have used them to identify objects measure temperature of their nests and gently pick up eggs and hatchlings bony crests thumb skull of alioramus with distinct nasal bumps bony crests are found on skulls of many theropods including many tyrannosaurids alioramus a possible tyrannosaurid from mongolia bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on nasal bones a similar row of much lower bumps is present on skull of appalachiosaurus as well as some specimens of daspletosaurus albertosaurus and tarbosaurus in albertosaurus gorgosaurus and daspletosaurus there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on lacrimal bone lacrimal horn is absent in tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus which instead have a crescent shaped crest behind each eye on postorbital bone these head crests may have been used for display perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior thermoregulation tyrannosaurus like most dinosaurs was long thought to have an ectothermic cold blooded reptilian metabolism but was challenged by scientists like robert t bakker and john ostrom in early years of dinosaur renaissance beginning in late 1960s tyrannosaurus rex itself was claimed to have been endothermic warm blooded implying a very active lifestyle since then several paleontologists have sought to determine ability of tyrannosaurus to regulate its body temperature histological evidence of high growth rates in young t rex comparable to those of mammals and birds may support hypothesis of a high metabolism growth curves indicate that as in mammals and birds t rex growth was limited mostly to immature animals rather than indeterminate growth seen in most other vertebrates it has been indicated that temperature difference may have been no more than 4 to 5 degc 7 to 9 degf between vertebrae of torso and tibia of lower leg this small temperature range between body core and extremities was claimed by paleontologist reese barrick and geochemist william showers to indicate that t rex maintained a constant internal body temperature homeothermy and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals later they found similar results in giganotosaurus specimens who lived on a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time even if tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy as in some living sea turtles paleoecology coexistence of daspletosaurus and gorgosaurus thumb skeleton of daspletosaurus specimen fmnh at field museum in chicago in dinosaur park formation gorgosaurus lived alongside a rarer species of tyrannosaurine daspletosaurus this is one of few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting similarly sized predators in modern predator guilds are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition niche differentiation between dinosaur park tyrannosaurids is not well understood in 1970 dale russell hypothesized that more common gorgosaurus actively hunted fleet footed hadrosaurs while rarer and more troublesome ceratopsians and ankylosaurians horned and heavily armoured dinosaurs were left to more heavily built daspletosaurus however a specimen of daspletosaurus 200 from contemporaneous two medicine formation of montana preserves digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region unlike some other groups of dinosaurs neither genus was more common at higher or lower elevations than other however gorgosaurus appears more common in northern formations like dinosaur park with species of daspletosaurus more abundant to south same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in two medicine formation of montana and in southwestern north america during campanian while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines at end of later maastrichtian stage tyrannosaurines like tyrannosaurus rex hadrosaurines like edmontosaurus and chasmosaurines like triceratops were widespread throughout western north america while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct and lambeosaurines were rare social behavior there is limited evidence of social behavior among tyrannosaurids for example sue t rex specimen apparently died from a massive bite to head which could only have been inflicted by another tyrannosaur researchers reported that a subadult and a juvenile skeleton were found in same quarry as sue specimen which has been used to support hypothesis that tyrannosaurs may have lived in social groups of some kind guinness world records ltd 2003 2003 guinness world records pg 90 while

facial biting is very common among predators facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like gorgosaurus and tyrannosaurus as well as in other theropod genera like sinraptor and saurornitholestes

were not brought together by river currents but that all of animals were buried simultaneously at same location hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear many marks from tyrannosaur teeth indicating that daspletosaurus were feeding on hadrosaurs at time of death cause of death is unknown currie speculates that formed a pack although this cannot be stated with certainty other scientists are skeptical of evidence for social groups in daspletosaurus and other large theropods brian roach and daniel brinkman have suggested that daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled modern komodo dragon where non cooperative individuals mob carcasses frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in process dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his

old and six juveniles between ages of 2 and 11 years who had not yet reached growth phase near absence of herbivore remains and similar state of preservation between many individuals at albertosaurus bonebed quarry led phil currie to conclude that locality was not a predator trap like la brea tar pits in california and that all of preserved animals died at same time currie claims this as evidence of pack behavior not printed until 2000 other scientists are skeptical observing that animals may have been driven together by drought flood or for other reasons while it generally remains

powerful but also slower juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults filling predator niches between those of enormous adults and smaller contemporaneous theropods largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult albertosaurus in mass however as preservation of behavior in fossil record is exceedingly rare these ideas cannot readily be tested phil currie speculates that daspletosaurus formed packs to hunt although this cannot be stated with certainty there is no evidence of such gregarious behavior in gorgosaurus not printed until 2000 debate about whether tyrannosaurus was a predator or a pure scavenger is as old as debate about its locomotion lambe 1917 described a good skeleton of tyrannosauruss close relative gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger because teeth showed hardly any wear this argument is no longer taken seriously because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly ever since first discovery of tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was a predator although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator s kill if it had opportunity dorey m 1997 tyrannosaurus dinosaur cards orbis publishing ltd noted hadrosaur expert jack horner is currently major advocate of idea that tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all horner has presented several arguments to support pure scavenger hypothesis presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances teeth could crush bone and therefore could extract as much food bone marrow as possible from carcass remnants usually least nutritious parts at least some of its potential prey could move quickly while evidence suggests that tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran other evidence suggests hunting behavior in tyrannosaurus eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that eyes would point forward giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks tyrannosaur inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and triceratops that seemed to have survived initial attacks some researchers argue that if tyrannosaurus were a scavenger another dinosaur had to be top predator in upper cretaceous top prey were larger marginocephalians and ornithopods other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators in this light scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators walters m j 1995 dictionary of prehistoric life claremont books classification name deinodontidae was coined by edward drinker cope in 1866 for this family and continued to be used in place of newer name tyrannosauridae through 1960s type genus of deinodontidae is deinodon which was named after isolated teeth from montana however in a 1970 review of north american tyrannosaurs dale russell concluded that deinodon was not a valid taxon and used name tyrannosauridae in place of deinodontidae stating that this was in accordance with iczn rules therefore tyrannosauridae is preferred by modern experts tyrannosaurus was named by henry fairfield osborn in 1905 along with family tyrannosauridae name is derived from ancient greek words turannos tyrannos tyrant and sauros sauros lizard very common suffix idae is normally appended to zoological family names and is derived from greek suffix idai idai which indicates a plural noun taxonomy thumb diagram showing differences between a generalised tarbosaurus a and tyrannosaurus b skull tyrannosauridae is a family in rank based linnaean taxonomy within superfamily tyrannosauroidea and suborder theropoda tyrannosauridae is divided into two subfamilies albertosaurinae comprises north american genera albertosaurus and gorgosaurus while tyrannosaurinae includes daspletosaurus teratophoneus bistahieversor tarbosaurus zhuchengtyrannus and tyrannosaurus itself some authors include species gorgosaurus libratus in genus albertosaurus and tarbosaurus bataar in genus tyrannosaurus while others prefer to retain gorgosaurus and tarbosaurus as separate genera albertosaurines are characterized by more slender builds lower skulls and proportionately longer tibiae than tyrannosaurines in tyrannosaurines sagittal crest on parietals continues forward onto frontals in 2014 lu junchang et al described alioramini as a tribe within tyrannosauridae containing genera alioramus and qianzhousaurus their phylogenetic analysis indicated that tribe was located at base of tyrannosaurinae some authors such as george olshevsky and tracy ford have created other subdivisions or tribes for various combinations of tyrannosaurids within subfamilies however these have not been phylogenetically defined and usually consisted of genera that are now considered synonymous with other genera or species additional subfamilies have been named for more fragmentary genera including aublysodontinae and however genera aublysodon and deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids an additional tyrannosaurid was initially described as a more primitive tyrannosauroid but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to tarbosaurus however as it is known only from a juvenile specimen it is also currently considered a nomen dubium phylogeny with advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions original was produced by paul sereno in 1998 and included all tyrannosauroids closer to tyrannosaurus than to either alectrosaurus aublysodon or nanotyrannus however nanotyrannus is often considered to be a juvenile tyrannosaurus rex while aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in definition of a clade definitions since then have been based on more well established genera in 2001 thomas r holtz jr published a cladistic analysis of tyrannosauridae he concluded that there were two subfamilies more primitive aublysodontinae characterized by unserrated premaxillary teeth and tyrannosaurinae aublysodontinae included aublysodon kirtland aublysodon and alectrosaurus holtz also found that siamotyrannus exhibited some of synapomorphies of tyrannosauridae but lay outside family proper later in same paper he proposed that tyrannosauridae be defined as all descendants of most recent common ancestor of tyrannosaurus and aublysodon he also criticized definitions previously proposed by other workers like one proposed by paul sereno that tyrannosauridae was all taxa closer to tyrannosaurus than to alectrosaurus aublysodon and nanotyrannus holtz observed that since nanotyrannus was probably a misidentified t rex juvenile sereno s proposed definition would have family tyrannosauridae as a of genus tyrannosaurus further his proposed definition of subfamily tyrannosaurinae would also be limited to tyrannosaurus holtz tr jr 2001 phylogeny and taxonomy of tyrannosauridae in k carpenter d tanke eds mesozoic vertebrate life indiana univ press pp 64 83 a 2003 attempt by christopher brochu included albertosaurus alectrosaurus alioramus daspletosaurus gorgosaurus tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus in definition holtz redefined clade in 2004 to use all of above as specifiers except for alioramus and alectrosaurus which his analysis could not place with certainty however in same paper holtz also provided a completely different definition including all theropods more closely related to tyrannosaurus than to eotyrannus most recent definition is that of sereno in 2005 which defined tyrannosauridae as least inclusive clade containing albertosaurus gorgosaurus and tyrannosaurus cladistic analyses of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa with daspletosaurus more basal than either a close relationship between tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features including pattern of sutures between certain bones presence of a crescent shaped crest on postorbital bone behind each eye and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on lower edge among others an alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by phil currie and colleagues which found weak support for daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including tarbosaurus and alioramus both from asia based on absence of a bony prong connecting nasal and lacrimal bones alioramus was found to be closest relative of tarbosaurus in this study based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in skull a related study also noted a locking mechanism in lower jaw shared between two genera in a separate paper currie noted possibility that alioramus might represent a juvenile tarbosaurus but stated that much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in alioramus suggest it is a distinct genus similarly currie uses high tooth count of nanotyrannus to suggest that it may be a distinct genus rather than a juvenile tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe however discovery and description of qianzhousaurus reveals that alioramus is not a close relation to tarbosaurus instead belonging to a newly described tribe of tyrannosaurids alioramini qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout asia and would have shared same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey timeline
