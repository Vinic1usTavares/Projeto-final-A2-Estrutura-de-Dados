madonna first performed song in a similar matador theme at 57th annual grammy awards it became most watched moment of night second performance was at 2015 brit awards which made headlines due to singer s wardrobe malfunction causing her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of stage alternate versions of living for love were performed on le grand journal ellen degeneres show and on madonna s 2015 16 rebel heart tour writing and development living for love was written and produced by madonna diplo and ariel rechtshaid with additional writing from mozella and toby gad madonna s collaboration with diplo was revealed in may 2014 through an image on her instagram showing her working on her laptop with him she had invited him for her annual oscar party and he could not make it so he began texting with her about music and sent some music madonna replied with a 20 page text containing her anecdotes on music following this they started collaborating for album in an interview with idolator diplo explained that madonna had asked him to provide his craziest record for album together they wrote and recorded seven songs and diplo added that those records are gonna be crazy sounding we really pushed envelope with some of stuff we were doing s he was up for anything i love when an artist gives a producer confidence he needs to work with them and madonna was very open minded to my ideas she was down from day one according to diplo living for love had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an edm composition ultimately madonna and diplo compromising on a middle level rechtshaid and british singer mnek also joined for writing sessions with them improving verse of song madonna denied that there were 20 versions of song admitting it might be a little too high and commented on how she wanted it to sound we knew we wanted to make a dance record but you know there s so many different levels of dance music and even different categories of house music so it was really like what s bass line gonna sound like is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse or is it going to be loaded up is it gonna be chicago house is it gonna be u k house it s like all over place is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line is it gonna be a whole choir singing so we were experimenting and trying out different things they all sounded good but at end of day we wanted it to sound timeless also not just something of moment in october 2014 american singer alicia keys confirmed that she worked on madonna s upcoming studio album saying it was good i was in here doing a meeting or something and madonna was working with diplo they were like oh maybe you can play some piano on this thing and i was like alright i ll try if you hate it you can take it off it was just like that casual and cool annie from london community gospel choir provided female background vocals throughout song madonna also mentioned that new versions would be coming out but just not yet describing song as one of diplo s more mellow productions madonna composed living for love as a break up song commenting lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable but nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards so i thought how can i do this i didn t want to share sentiment of being a victim this scenario devastated me but it just made me stronger she complemented saying that living for love was kind of like old me and new me all mixed in together release demo

her 1989 singles like a prayer and express yourself by jason lipshutz from billboard keys piano tracks are played along with electronic music up to chorus unlike madonna s previous two lead singles 4 minutes 2008 and give me all your luvin 2012 living for love puts emphasis on lyrics and vocals with lines on bridge going like took me to heaven let me fall down now that it s over i m gonna carry on

music releases and diy ethic they displayed starting from taylor swift s shake it off to ariana grande s break free and katy perry s roar survivor anthem like nature of track was evocative of madonna

release living for love earned critical praise lipshutz was appreciative of song commending madonna s confident vocal delivery he said that song sounded like a giddy combination of madonna s past and present and represents an encouraging sign for a 2015 project that was unexpectedly thrown into jeopardy at end of 2014 stern compared song to madonna s 1992 single deeper and deeper noting that unlike uk dance acts and teen pop groups paying homage to 1990s house music madonna had lived through that era calling song a total beast of a collaborative effort and ended his review saying fuck singing about tanqueray in club this is madonna we ve always known and lived to love with flares of future and nostalgic nods to past times jamieson cox observed that living for love was tailor made for radio with increase in popularity of house music and crossover success of british house musicians giving song a rating of three out of five stars hardeep phull from new york post complimented it

it s sort of determined dance anthem madonna does so well dallas morning news hunter hauk described song as a solid melding of different club musics and appreciated dance break and madonna s singing attitude calling it less prickly or defiant than we see on instagram these days jeff miers from buffalo news compared living for love to earlier club anthems songs which had become commercial success

songs from album but called living for love as an unexpectedly perfect balance between ghosts of madge past and future dean piper from daily telegraph called it most original among songs released however he was critical of lyrics saying that they failed to penetrate your soul cinquemani complemented changes in song from demo version calling it madonna s most rousing lead single in years but

julien choquart and camille hirigoyen together known as j a c k it was edited by danny b tull styled by b akerlund and choreographed by megan lawson according to madonna she wanted to have a cinematic and storytelling aspect with video adding that thing about that song it s such a passionate song i had to present it in a passionate way and i used mythology to tell story with story of minotaur matador fighting for love and color red and flowers horns and death and naked men you know important things in life i don t want to make every video same but i did love richness of that video to me it felt like a painting that came to life that s what i was trying to do dietzel creator of fashion label v couture who specializes in different kinds of corsets were enlisted to create clothing for video as well as a grammy awards performance dietzel explained that she had initially thought madonna s e mail as spam however after confirmation from singer s assistant stylist b akerlund she started working on designs within 48 hours she sewed a new corset as well as created two new ones by basing them on only information provided to her that of madonna s bra size she had to search on google for deducing rest of singer s proportions in total four different corsets were shipped off to madonna lebanese designer shady zeineldine was also contacted by akerlund who visited designer s press conference in los angeles and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for video after deal was finalized he created a custom made matador jacket which madonna wore in video another dress was a bodysuit featuring a nude satin stretch corset covered in three different types of lace a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie there was also a red velvet bolero jacket corset was described by steff yotka from style com as masculine feminine mix it s sort of tight sexy gender bending thing we ve come to expect from madonna singer and her team had sent matador references to zeineldine who wanted to give a feminine touch to designs utilizing numerous laces and nude color palette to highlight singer s body curves amber from style com explained that madonna s make up in video was inspired by recent runway shows of christian dior and givenchy singer had applied parallel eye liner with her bolero jacket look as well as sported bobby pin and princess leia like buns on her hair designer riccardo tisci approved of minotaur costumes used by dancers which used crystal masks designed by marianna and leather horns he also gave his approval of gemstones applied on singer s face for one sequence in video release and synopsis thumb madonna in music video for song she is dressed in nude corset created by shady zeineldine shot portrays her onstage being surrounded by dancers as minotaurs music video was released on picture messaging application snapchat on february 5 2015 where it was available for viewing on application s snap channel platform madonna became first artist to premiere her video on snapchat video was deleted after 24 hours in lieu of snapchat s self destructing ethos and was later uploaded on madonna s vevo channel sara from marketing week commended decision believing it to be a major move for snapchat and decision by madonna s label could pave way for other label giants to host content on app as well as other branded content video begins with a focus light on madonna s hand which gradually reveals a circular red stage surrounded by red curtains madonna wearing red velvet jacket moves around stage throwing off a cape and does choreographed dance moves interspersed are visuals of a male dancer as a minotaur wearing horned mask dancing on ground and madonna in matador dress she entices male dancer with cape as chorus ends a flock of male dancers wearing similar horned mask appear and surround madonna around stage throughout second verse madonna chase dancers and defeat them in mock fight one of them pick her up and together they perform a second choreography atop stage madonna is also shown in bejeweled corset flapping around a red cape for final verses and chorus madonna in nude corset dances among minotaurs and ultimately slays them all last visual shows singer standing among slain bodies of minotaurs throwing off cape while holding a pair of horns in her left hand red roses fall around her and sound of applause is heard as a quote by german philosopher friedrich nietzsche flashes on screen man is cruelest animal at tragedies bullfights and crucifixions he has felt best on earth and when he invented hell for himself that was his very heaven reception and analysis hugh mcintyre from forbes commended madonna s decision to partner with snapchat for video release because he considered it to be a profit for both parties for madonna it would enable her to connect with younger audience while for snapchat release of a new madonna video would lead to an older demographic to download app matthew jacobs from huffington post believed that music video and its imagery matched with uplifting nature of song he compared parts of video with express yourself and hung up saying that madonna emerging victorious among a flock of men dressed as bulls evoked leaks of rebel hearts songs recalling self referential undertones in videos for give me all your luvin and girl gone wild jacobs explained that madonna presents herself as queen of big top without relying on allusions to her own resume to prove she is master of postmodern pop scene this is madonna video we ve waited a decade for houston chronicles joey guerra gave another positive review saying we haven t already learned time and again never underestimate madonna and describing video as a nice fit for song a writer for guardian described video as a straightforward performance clip and believed that simplistic nature of video suggested that it was designed for being viewed on mobile devices louis virtel from hitfix called living for love as madonna s best video since hung up he found references to older madonna videos like express yourself in unusual choreography with all of its masculine posturing and grappling take a bow with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career and open your heart during sequences where madonna fends off minotaur dancers virtel also commended choreography costumes madonna s looks and cinematography of video along with take a bow reference billboards joe lynch called video as incredible and lush arresting but criticized for misspelling of nietzsche at end rita from instyle said that video was just as good as you could have expected and while we were completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique we were equally in awe of her outfits nathan smith from out found video to be transcending gender roles with madonna assuming role of a matador a title generally reserved for a man also he noted that madonna demonstrated her toned and lean physique demonstrating her unique and unparalleled mastery of male species for alyssa from e madonna transforms into a fierce and sexy matador in clip and dances her butt off with some seriously acrobatic moves jim farber from new york daily news found a contrast with song s title and battlefield like portrayal in video saying while it s sonically exuberant song s lyrics reflect aftermath of a hard won battle rachel pilcher from yahoo found video to be strange but believed that it was to be expected from madonna live performances madonna first performed living for love at 57th annual grammy awards on february 8 2015 she confirmed her appearance at ceremony by uploading an image of grammy trophy wrapped with black strings like internet memes for cover art of rebel heart singer was dressed in a one piece outfit in matador red surrounded by male dancers as minotaurs similar to song s music video it was developed by designer riccardo tisci for givenchy and styled by akerlund performance was described as a beautiful story for why matadors fight bulls and that also reflects life after being introduced by singers miley cyrus and nicki minaj performance began with images of madonna on a kabuki screen talking about starting a revolution she emerged from screen and started singing surrounded by dancers near end singer encouraged audience to sing along with her finally being pulled atop

praised madonna also performed song at 2015 brit awards on february 25 however in early stages of performance a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of stage it was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck she fell down to floor however madonna then continued performance as planned she later took to instagram to confirm that she was well posting thanks for good wishes i m fine richard smirke from billboard praised performance and madonna s recovery saying that singer didn t let fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored matador theme of her recent grammy awards performance madonna explained on jonathan ross show that she was told to start walking towards stage further than originally planned hence her team thought that cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck singer had two choices when cape did not come undone i could either be strangled or fall and i chose to fall madonna endured a whiplash and added that she smacked back of my head and i had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure i was compos mentis singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core
