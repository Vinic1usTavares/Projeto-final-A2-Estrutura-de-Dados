breakdown ann bleecker never fully recovered from all these traumatic events her daughter margaretta faugeres later described how bleecker developed a tendency toward depression and there was a melancholy reflection in her writings she was frequently very lively and would then give way to flights of her fertile fancy and write songs satires and burlesque but heaviest dejection would succeed and then all pieces which were not as melancholy as herself she destroyed ann eliza bleecker died november 23 1783 she is buried in cemetery of reformed dutch church in albany though all bodies buried

maria kittle a captivity narrative set during french and indian war due to its popularity history of maria kittle was republished separately in 1797 maria kittle bleecker s epistolary novel history of maria kittle took indian captivity story genre in new directions as it was possibly first american fictional account focusing on native americans in late 18th century indian captivity stories subsequently became very popular maria kittle has many features typical of indian captivity story there are many graphic scenes of violence and it describes native americans as terrible savages who cruelly kill babies and women and tells story of maria s journey as a captive but by end of story maria gets rescued and real emotion comes out as three women in story tearfully recount their stories of maternal loss to others this story has many similarities to bleecker s own experience with death of her own daughter as a result of fleeing from british army in telling her tale of loss bleecker hoped to help women overcome their tragedies yet these stories also helped foster racism toward native americans bleecker s writing was exciting for time and her sense of style added dimension to a new type of novel didactic novel her expression was influenced by eighteenth century british cult of sensibility she wrote in a mannered and often exaggerated way to express her moral lesson in addition she used literary device structuring story as a series of letters to her half sister susan ten eyck in which she interrupted narrative to comment on action and address susan directly poems ann eliza bleecker s pastoral poems exemplified a new style of american poetry and due to her experience of american revolutionary tumult a new sense of national identity these poems written in pastoral tradition conveyed both beauty of colonial new york countryside and horrific impact of war suffering death and destruction because bleecker was writing from interesting perspective of a terrified young mother her articulate depictions of revolutionary war are still read by historians today references external links women s early american historical narratives from google books giving
