european republics to change their flags one example that gave life to idea of tricolor was french blue white and red flag adopted after french revolution only tricolor that existed for lithuania before yellow green and red flag was a green white and red flag used to represent lithuania minor it is not known who originally suggested yellow green and red colors but idea is usually attributed to lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in europe or in united states during 19th century these three colors were frequently used in folk and traditional dress lithuanian folk textile arts at great seimas of vilnius of 1905 this flag was favored over vytis banner as flag of lithuanian nation vytis strongly advocated by jonas basanavicius was not chosen for three reasons first was that as part of drive for national identity seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from flag of grand duchy of lithuania which also encompassed now distinct nations such as belarus and ukraine second issue was choice of color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with marxist or communist causes and finally flag with vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn debates about national flag occurred again in 1917 during vilnius conference two colors green and red were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art artist antanas zmuidzinavicius decorated conference hall with small red and green flags however delegates did not like design as it was too dark and gloomy then daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow to symbolize rising sun in between red clouds lit up by morning sun and green fields and forests however delegates decided that matter should be settled by a special commission composed of basanavicius zmuidzinavicius and daugirdas on 19 april 1918 they submitted their final protocol to council of lithuania flag was supposed to be a tri color yellow at top green in middle and red at bottom with vytis in upper left corner or in middle council accepted proposal but 1922 constitution of lithuania did not include any mention of coat of arms it adopted national flag that is used today any of debates failed to produce a historical flag discussions of national
