hurricane elida was first hurricane of 2002 pacific hurricane season to reach category 5 strength on saffir simpson hurricane scale forming on july 23 from a tropical wave storm rapidly intensified from a tropical depression into a category 5 hurricane in two days and lasted for only six hours at that intensity before weakening it was one of only sixteen known hurricanes in east pacific east of international date line to have reached such an intensity although heavy waves were able to reach mexican coastline no damages or casualties were reported in relation to hurricane hurricane moved westward due to a high pressure ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles first was around peak intensity and was completed when hurricane moved over cooler waters and second was a brief cycle shortly after hurricane began to weaken last advisory was issued while hurricane was west of mexico but it was not until remnants were west of los angeles california that they finally dissipated elida s rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in intensity forecasting of hurricane although intensity forecasts were off track forecasts were better than usual compared to ten year period prior to that year meteorological history elida formed from a tropical wave that left coast of africa on july 13 wave moved uneventfully through atlantic ocean and caribbean sea emerging over pacific ocean on july 21 wave began organizing next day becoming tropical depression six e on july 23 while south southeast of puerto escondido mexico depression was predicted to move westward due to presence of a ridge of high pressure which was also controlling movement of hurricane douglas due to low shear and warm ocean waters it was predicted that depression would reach hurricane strength in 48 hours depression began rapid intensification while moving westward and only six hours after being recognized as a depression system was upgraded to tropical storm elida while displaying banding features and a central dense overcast forecast was revised now predicting storm to attain hurricane strength next day storm continued to rapidly intensify and gradually developed a banding eye feature and infrared satellite images showed a possible eyewall in central dense overcast after six more hours a small eye had formed and elida was upgraded to a high end category 2 hurricane on saffir simpson hurricane scale with winds on july 24 only eighteen hours after having first been initiated as a tropical depression elida continued to rapidly strengthen breaking dvorak estimates and reaching six hours afterward making it a category 4 hurricane and resulting in a rare forecast for hurricane to reach category 5 intensity hurricane moving at proceeded to make a west northwestward turn while displaying an eye with an estimated diameter of on july 25 elida reached highest sustained wind speed of a category 4 hurricane at though possibility that elida was briefly a category 5 hurricane just prior to advisory issuance was indicated even though a later discussion mentioned that elida had attained category 5 status it was not until tropical cyclone report that it was finally analyzed that elida had maintained category 5 strength for only six hours at this time elida was observed to have formed concentric eyewalls but it was not until hurricane moved over cooler waters that storm s eyewall replacement cycle was completed right thumb hurricane elida shortly after peak intensity on july 25 afterward hurricane began to weaken in an irregular fashion after inner eyewall dissolved intensity of hurricane decreased to a low level category 3 storm with winds of by this time elida had reached edge of ridge that kept cyclone from turning northwest and a turn to northwest was beginning hurricane proceeded to undergo another eyewall replacement cycle lowering its intensity to category 2 intensity late on july 26 eye disappeared from satellite weakening trend continued and elida weakened to a tropical storm on july 27 at this time a weakness in subtropical ridge allowed storm to make a turn towards north early on july 28 elida began redeveloping regaining moderate convection and possibly reintensifying but eventually storm weakened back into a depression early on july 29 on next day elida degenerated into a remnant low and last advisory was issued while an area of convection was displaced to north of center with seas in area center was from punta eugenia mexico when last advisory was issued remnant low of elida moved northeast and eventually dissipated on july 31 west of los angeles california impact although winds and rains associated with storm remained far offshore tropical cyclone report issued by national hurricane center mentioned that elida caused swells and waves to hit mexican shore but no reports of damage or casualties linked to elida were ever received and no land advisories were ever needed for hurricane only report anywhere near storm came from new century 1 vehicle carrier ship call sign which was from center of hurricane ship reported winds of and a pressure of 1008 5 while track errors associated with forecasting hurricane were lower than errors in period between 1992 and 2001 elida s intensity proved to be hard to predict leading to large errors in nhc forecasts errors in forecast period except for 72 hour period were worse than long term average large errors in intensity forecasts were blamed on rapid intensification of hurricane to winds and unsteady weakening after reaching peak intensity when sensor aboard european space agency s satellite envisat observed and recorded hurricane elida at peak intensity it was first time that sensor had observed a hurricane sensor was originally designed primarily for recording oceanic biology and water quality as well as land vegetation clouds and water vapor see also list of pacific hurricanes list of
