alfred russel wallace 8 january 18237 november 1913 was a british naturalist explorer geographer anthropologist and biologist he is best known for independently conceiving theory of evolution through natural selection his paper on subject was jointly published with some of charles darwin s writings in 1858 this prompted darwin to publish his own ideas in on origin of species like darwin wallace did extensive fieldwork first in amazon river basin and then in malay archipelago where he identified faunal divide now termed wallace line which separates indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts a western portion in which animals are largely of asian origin and an eastern portion where fauna reflect australasia he was considered 19th century s leading expert on geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called father of biogeography wallace was one of leading evolutionary thinkers of 19th century and made many other contributions to development of evolutionary theory besides being co discoverer of natural selection these included concept of warning colouration in animals and wallace effect a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging development of barriers against hybridisation wallace s 1904 book man s place in universe was first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate likelihood of life on other planets he was also one of first scientists to write a serious exploration of subject of whether there was life on mars wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas such as evolution his advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non material origin for higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of scientific establishment aside from scientific work he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system capitalism in 19th century britain his interest in natural history resulted in his being one of first prominent scientists to raise concerns over environmental impact of human activity he was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in singapore indonesia and malaysia malay archipelago was both popular and highly regarded since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life his amazon and far eastern trips were supported by sale of specimens he collected and after he lost most of considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments he had to support himself mostly from publications he produced unlike some of his contemporaries in british scientific community such as darwin and charles lyell he had no family wealth to fall back on and he was unsuccessful in finding a long term salaried position receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension through darwin s efforts in 1881 biography early life alfred wallace was born in welsh village of near usk monmouthshire wilson forgotten naturalist p 1 he was eighth of nine children of thomas vere wallace and mary anne mary anne was english thomas wallace was probably of scottish ancestry his family like many wallaces claimed a connection to william wallace a leader of scottish forces during wars of scottish independence in 13th century thomas wallace graduated in law but never practised law he owned some income generating property but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of family s financial position his mother was from a middle class english family from hertford north of london when wallace was five years old his family moved to hertford there he attended hertford grammar school until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836 when he was aged 14 wilson pp 6 10 thumb left upright a photograph from wallace s autobiography

a stopgap measure until william his oldest brother was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor while in london alfred attended lectures and read books at london mechanics institute here he was exposed to radical political ideas of welsh social reformer robert owen and of thomas paine he left london in 1837 to live with william and work as his apprentice for six years at end of 1839 they moved to kington hereford near welsh border before eventually settling at neath in glamorgan in wales between 1840 and 1843 wallace did land surveying work in countryside of west of england and wales

difficult economic conditions and wallace at age of 20 left in january one result of wallace s early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality since wallace was born in monmouthshire some sources have considered him to be welsh however some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was welsh his family only briefly lived in monmouthshire welsh people wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be english and because wallace himself consistently referred to himself as english rather than welsh even when writing about his time in wales one wallace scholar has stated that most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an englishman born in wales after a brief period of unemployment he was hired as a master at collegiate school in leicester to teach drawing mapmaking and surveying wallace spent many hours at library in leicester he read an essay on principle of population by thomas robert malthus and one evening he met entomologist henry bates bates was 19 years old and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in journal zoologist he befriended wallace and started him collecting insects shermer in darwin s shadow p 53 slotten pp 22 26 william died in march 1845 and wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother s firm in neath but his brother john and he were unable to make business work after a few months wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in vale of neath wallace s work on survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in countryside allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects wallace persuaded his brother john to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm which carried out a number of projects including design of a building for neath mechanics institute founded in 1843 neath mechanics institute swansea university retrieved 21 april 2013 william jevons founder of that institute was impressed by wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering in autumn of 1846 john and he purchased a cottage near neath where they lived with their mother and sister fanny his father had died in 1843 slotten pp 26 29 wilson pp 19 20 during this period he read avidly exchanging letters with bates about robert chambers anonymously published evolutionary

decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist slotten pp 34 37 in 1848 wallace and henry bates left for brazil aboard mischief their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in amazon rainforest for their private collections selling duplicates to museums and collectors back in britain in order to fund trip wallace also hoped to gather evidence of transmutation of species wallace and bates spent most of their first year collecting near belem then explored inland separately occasionally meeting to discuss their findings in 1849 they were briefly joined by another young explorer botanist richard spruce along with wallace s younger brother herbert herbert left soon thereafter dying two years later from yellow fever but spruce like bates would spend over ten years collecting in south america wilson p 36 raby pp 89 98 99 120 21 wallace continued charting rio negro for four years collecting specimens and making notes on peoples and languages he encountered as well as geography flora and fauna raby pp 89 95 on 12 july 1852 wallace embarked for uk on brig helen after 26 days at sea ship s cargo caught fire and crew was forced to abandon ship all of specimens wallace had on ship mostly collected during last and most interesting two years of his trip were lost he managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else wallace and crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by brig jordeson which was sailing from cuba to london jordeson s provisions were strained by unexpected passengers but after a difficult passage on very short rations ship finally reached its destination on 1 october 1852 shermer pp 72 73 slotten pp 84 88 after his return to uk wallace spent 18 months in london living on insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to britain prior to his starting his exploration of rio negro until indian town of on orinoco river basin and as far west as on uaupes river he was deeply impressed by grandeur of virgin forest by variety and beauty of butterflies and birds and by his first encounter with indians on uaupes river area an experience he never forgot during this period despite having lost almost all of notes from his south american expedition he wrote six academic papers which included on monkeys of amazon and two books palm trees of amazon and their uses and travels on amazon wilson p 45 he also made connections with a number of other british naturalists raby bright paradise p 148 thumb left an illustration from

specimens for sale and to study natural history a set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in indonesia and associated documentation can be found in cambridge university museum of zoology wallace had as many as a hundred assistants who collected on his behalf among these his most trusted assistant was a malay by name of ali who later called himself ali wallace while wallace collected insects many of bird specimens were collected by his assistants including around 5000 collected and prepared by ali wallace s observations of marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in archipelago led to his proposing zoogeographical boundary now known as wallace line wallace collected more than 126 000 specimens in malay archipelago more than 80 000 beetles alone several thousand of them represented species new to science shermer p 14 one of his better known species descriptions during this trip is that of gliding tree frog rhacophorus nigropalmatus known as wallace s flying frog while he was exploring archipelago he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection in 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to darwin it was published along with a description of darwin s own theory in same year accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as malay archipelago which became one of most popular books of scientific exploration of 19th century and has never been out of print it was praised by scientists such as darwin to whom book was dedicated and charles lyell and by non scientists such as novelist joseph conrad who called it his favorite bedside companion and used it as source of information for several of his novels especially lord jim slotten p 267 return to england marriage and children thumb upright a photograph of a r wallace taken in singapore in 1862 in 1862 wallace returned to england where he moved in with his sister fanny sims and her husband thomas while recovering from his travels wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as zoological society of london later that year he visited darwin at down house and became friendly with both charles lyell and herbert spencer shermer pp 151 52 during 1860s wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection he also corresponded with darwin about a variety of topics including sexual selection warning colouration and possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and divergence of species slotten pp 249 58 in 1865 he began investigating spiritualism slotten p 235 after a year of courtship wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom in his autobiography he would only identify as miss l miss l was daughter of

1951 slotten pp 239 40 financial struggles in late 1860s and 1870s wallace was very concerned about financial security of his family while he was in malay archipelago sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money which had been carefully invested by agent who sold specimens for wallace however on his return to uk wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of money and he found himself badly in need of proceeds from publication of malay archipelago slotten pp 265 67 despite assistance from his friends he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum to remain financially solvent wallace worked grading government examinations wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums and was paid by lyell and darwin to help edit some of their own works slotten pp 299 300 in 1876 wallace needed a ps500 advance from publisher of geographical distribution of animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property slotten p 325 darwin was very aware of wallace s financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science when ps200 annual pension was awarded in 1881 it helped to stabilise wallace s financial position by supplementing income from his writings slotten pp 361 64 social activism john stuart mill was impressed by remarks criticising english society that wallace had included in malay archipelago mill asked him to join general committee of his land tenure reform association but association dissolved after mill s death in 1873 wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when at age of 56 he entered debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest he believed that rural land should be owned by state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit largest number of people thus breaking often abused power of wealthy landowners in british society in 1881 wallace was elected as first president of newly formed land nationalisation society in next year he published a book land nationalisation its necessity and its aims on subject he criticised uk s free trade policies for negative impact they had on working class people slotten pp 365 72 in 1889 wallace read looking backward by edward bellamy and declared himself a socialist despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor slotten p 436 after reading progress and poverty best selling book by progressive land reformist henry george wallace described it as undoubtedly most remarkable and important book of present century wallace opposed eugenics an idea supported by other prominent 19th century evolutionary thinkers on grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit slotten pp 436 38 in 1890 article human selection he wrote those who succeed in race for wealth are by no means best or most intelligent in 1898 wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system not backed by silver or gold which impressed economist irving fisher so much that he dedicated his 1920 book stabilizing dollar to wallace wallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for women s suffrage and repeatedly on dangers and wastefulness of militarism slotten pp 366 453 487 88 shermer pp 23 279 in an essay published in 1899 wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people that all modern wars are dynastic that they are caused by ambition interests jealousies and insatiable greed of power of their rulers or of great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers and that results of war are never good for people who yet bear all its burthens in a letter published by daily mail in 1909 with aviation in its infancy he advocated an international treaty to ban military use of aircraft arguing against idea that this new horror is inevitable and that all we can do is to be sure and be in front rank of aerial assassins for surely no other term can so describe dropping of say ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy s capital from an invisible flight of airships in 1898 wallace published a book entitled wonderful century its successes and its failures about developments in 19th century first part of book covered major scientific and technical advances of century second part covered what wallace considered to be its social failures including destruction and waste of wars and arms races rise of urban poor and dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums environmental damage caused by capitalism and evils of european colonialism slotten pp 453 55 ref cite book last

to geographic distribution of animals in november 1886 wallace began a ten month trip to united states to give a series of popular lectures most of lectures were on darwinism evolution through natural selection but he also gave speeches on biogeography spiritualism and socio economic reform during trip he was reunited with his brother john who had emigrated to california years before he also spent a week in colorado with american botanist alice eastwood as his guide exploring flora of rocky mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between mountain flora of europe asia and north america which he published in 1891 in paper english and american flowers he met many other prominent american naturalists and viewed their

friends suggested that he be buried in westminster abbey but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in small cemetery at broadstone dorset several prominent british scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of wallace placed in westminster abbey near where darwin had been buried medallion was unveiled on 1 november 1915 theory of evolution early evolutionary thinking unlike darwin wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in transmutation of species concept had been advocated by jean baptiste lamarck geoffroy saint hilaire erasmus darwin and robert grant among others it was widely discussed but not generally accepted by leading naturalists and was considered to have radical even revolutionary connotations larson evolution p 73 peter j

charles lyell attacked it vigorously mcgowan dragon seekers pp 101 154 55 larson pp 23 24 37 38 it has been suggested that wallace accepted idea of transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics religion and science and because he was unusually open to marginal even fringe ideas in science shermer p 54 he was also profoundly influenced by robert chambers work vestiges of natural history of creation a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for solar system earth and living things slotten p 31 wallace wrote to henry bates in 1845 in 1847 he wrote to bates wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories during his work in amazon basin he came to realise that geographical barriers such as amazon and its major tributaries often separated ranges of closely allied species and he included these observations in his 1853 paper on monkeys of amazon slotten p 94 near end of paper he asks question are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country in february 1855 while working in sarawak on island of borneo wallace wrote on law which has regulated introduction of new species a paper which was published in annals and magazine of natural history in september 1855 in this paper he discussed observations regarding geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species what would become known as biogeography his conclusion that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species has come to be known as sarawak law wallace thus answered question he had posed in his earlier paper on monkeys of amazon river basin although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution this paper foreshadowed momentous paper he would write three years later paper shook charles lyell s belief that species were immutable although his friend charles darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to idea around start of 1856 he told darwin about wallace s paper as did edward blyth who thought it good upon whole wallace has i think put matter well and according to his theory various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species despite this hint darwin mistook wallace s conclusion for progressive creationism of time and wrote that it was nothing very new uses my simile of tree but it seems all creation with him lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species in which he grappled with consequences particularly for human ancestry darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend joseph hooker and now for first time he spelt out full details of natural selection to lyell although lyell could not agree he urged darwin to publish to establish priority darwin demurred at first then began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in may 1856 desmond moore darwin 1991 p 438 browne charles darwin voyaging pp 537 46 natural selection and darwin by february 1858 wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in malay archipelago of reality of evolution as he later wrote in his autobiography according to his autobiography it was while he was in bed with a fever that wallace thought about thomas robert malthus s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with idea of natural selection slotten pp 144 45 wallace said in his autobiography that he was on island of ternate at time but historians have questioned this saying that on basis of journal he kept at time he was on island of gilolo slotten p 144 from 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on ternate from dutchman maarten dirk van van he used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands

medal was issued by linnean society on 50th anniversary of reading of darwin and wallace s papers on natural selection wallace had once briefly met darwin and was one of correspondents whose observations darwin used to support his own theories although wallace s first letter to darwin has been lost wallace carefully kept letters he received marchant 1916 p 105 in first letter dated 1 may 1857 darwin commented that wallace s letter of 10 october which he had recently received as well as wallace s paper on law which has regulated introduction of new species of 1855 showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time darwin francis 1887 life and letters of charles darwin p 95 second letter dated 22 december 1857 said how glad he was that wallace was theorising about distribution adding that without speculation there is no good and original observation while commenting that i believe i go much further than you darwin francis 1887 life and letters of charles darwin p 108 wallace trusted darwin s opinion on matter and sent him his february 1858 essay on tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from original type with request that darwin would review it and pass it on to charles lyell if he thought it worthwhile although wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through malay archipelago ternate essay was in a private letter on 18 june 1858 darwin received essay from wallace while wallace s essay obviously did not employ darwin s term natural selection it did outline mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures in this sense it was very similar to theory that darwin had worked on for twenty years but had yet to publish darwin sent manuscript to charles lyell with a letter saying he could not have made a better short abstract even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters he does not say he wishes me to publish but i shall of course at once write and offer to send to any journal slotten pp 153 54 darwin francis 1887 life and letters of charles darwin p 116 distraught about illness of his baby son darwin put problem to charles lyell and joseph hooker who decided to publish essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted darwin s priority wallace s essay was presented to linnean society of london on 1 july 1858 along with excerpts from an essay which darwin had disclosed privately to hooker in 1847 and a letter darwin had written to asa gray in 1857 browne charles darwin power of place pp 33 42 communication with wallace in far off malay archipelago was impossible without months of delay so he was not part of this rapid publication fortunately wallace accepted arrangement after fact happy that he had been included at all and never expressed public or private bitterness darwin s social and scientific status was far greater than wallace s and it was unlikely that without darwin wallace s views on evolution would have been taken seriously lyell and hooker s arrangement relegated wallace to position of co discoverer and he was not social equal of darwin or other prominent british natural scientists however joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated wallace with more famous darwin this combined with darwin s as well as hooker s and lyell s advocacy on his behalf would give wallace greater access to highest levels of scientific community shermer pp 148 50 reaction to reading was muted with president of linnean society remarking in may 1859 that year had not been marked by any striking discoveries browne charles darwin power of place pp 40 42 but with darwin s publication of on origin of species later in 1859 its significance became apparent when wallace returned to uk he met darwin although some of wallace s iconoclastic opinions in ensuing years would test darwin s patience they remained on friendly terms for rest of darwin s life over years a few people have questioned this version of events in early 1980s two books one written by arnold and another by john langdon brooks even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob wallace of his proper credit but that darwin had actually stolen a key idea from wallace to finish his own theory these claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing slotten pp 157 62 research into shipping schedules has shown that contrary to these accusations wallace s letter could not have been delivered earlier than date shown in darwin s letter to lyell defence of darwin and his ideas after publication of darwin s on origin of species wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to england in 1862 in one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased darwin wallace published short paper remarks on rev s haughton s paper on bee s cell and on origin of species in order to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at university of dublin that had sharply criticised darwin s comments in origin on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection slotten pp 197 99 an even lengthier defence of darwin s work was creation by law a review wallace wrote in 1867 for quarterly journal of science of book reign of law which had been written by george campbell 8th duke of argyll as a refutation of natural selection after an 1870 meeting of british science association wallace wrote to darwin complaining that there were no opponents left who know anything of natural history so that there are none of good discussions we used to have slotten p 261 differences between darwin s and wallace s ideas on natural selection historians of science have noted that while darwin considered ideas in wallace s paper to be essentially same as his own there were differences darwin emphasised competition between individuals of same species to survive and reproduce whereas wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions leading populations in different locations to diverge larson p 75 bowler morus p 149 some historians notably peter j bowler have suggested possibility that in paper he mailed to darwin wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection bowler 2013 pp 61 63 however malcolm m 1985 charles darwin and alfred russel wallace two decades of debate over natural selection in david kohn ed darwinian heritage princeton nj princeton university press 367 432 has shown that this notion is incorrect and wallace was indeed discussing individual variations others have noted that another difference was that wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment they point to a largely overlooked passage of wallace s famous 1858 paper and anthropologist gregory bateson would observe in 1970s that though writing it only as an example wallace had probably said most powerful thing that d been said in 19th century bateson revisited topic in his 1979 book mind and nature a necessary unity and other scholars have continued to explore connection between natural selection and systems theory warning coloration and sexual selection in 1867 darwin wrote to wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes darwin had come to believe that sexual selection an agency to which wallace did not attribute same importance as darwin did explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes however darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars wallace responded that he and henry bates had observed that many of most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste and that he had been told by john jenner weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable now as white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in daylight wallace wrote back to darwin that it seemed likely that conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection darwin was impressed by idea at a subsequent meeting of entomological society wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on topic in 1869 weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported wallace s idea warning coloration was one of a number of contributions wallace made in area of evolution of animal coloration in general and concept of protective coloration in particular slotten pp 251 54 it was also part of a lifelong disagreement wallace had with darwin over importance of sexual selection in his 1878 book tropical nature and other essays he wrote extensively on coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases darwin had attributed to sexual selection slotten pp 353 56 he revisited topic at length in his 1889 book darwinism in 1890 he wrote a critical review in nature of his friend edward bagnall poulton s colours of animals which supported darwin on sexual selection attacking especially poulton s claims on aesthetic preferences of insect world wallace effect in 1889 wallace wrote book darwinism which explained and defended natural selection in it he proposed hypothesis that natural selection could drive reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging development of barriers against hybridisation thus it might contribute to development of new species he suggested following scenario when two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point each adapted to particular conditions hybrid offspring would be less well adapted than either parent form and at that point natural selection will tend to eliminate hybrids furthermore under such conditions natural selection would favour development of barriers to hybridisation as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring and thus contribute to reproductive isolation of two incipient species this idea came to be known as wallace effect slotten pp 413 15 later referred to as reinforcement wallace had suggested to darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868 but had not worked it out to this level of detail slotten p 404 it continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity application of theory to humans and role of teleology in evolution thumb an illustration from chapter on application of natural selection to humans in wallace s 1889 book darwinism shows a chimpanzee in 1864 wallace published a paper origin of human races and antiquity of man deduced from theory of natural selection applying theory to humankind darwin had not yet publicly addressed subject although thomas huxley had in evidence as to man s place in nature he explained apparent stability of human stock by pointing to vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and great apes unlike some other darwinists including darwin himself he did not regard modern primitives as almost filling gap between man and ape he saw evolution of humans in two stages achieving a bipedal posture freeing hands to carry out dictates of brain and recognition of human brain as a totally new factor in history of life wallace was apparently first evolutionist to recognize clearly that with emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes human brain bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded for this paper he won darwin s praise shortly afterwards wallace became a spiritualist at about same time he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical artistic or musical genius as well as metaphysical musings and wit and humour he eventually said that something in unseen universe of spirit had interceded at least three times in history first was creation of life from inorganic matter second was introduction of consciousness in higher animals and third was generation of higher mental faculties in humankind he also believed that raison d etre of universe was development of human spirit wallace darwinism p 477 these views greatly disturbed darwin who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non adaptive mental phenomena while some historians have concluded that wallace s belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain development of consciousness and human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism other wallace scholars have disagreed and some maintain that wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas shermer pp 157 60 reaction to wallace s ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at time varied charles lyell endorsed wallace s views on human evolution rather than darwin s larson p 100 shermer p 160 wallace s belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in late 19th and early 20th centuries shermer pp 231 33 however many including huxley hooker and darwin himself were critical of wallace slotten pp 280 96 as historian of science michael shermer has stated wallace s views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of emerging darwinian philosophy which were that evolution was not teleological purpose driven and that it was not anthropocentric human centred shermer pp 208 09 much later in his life wallace returned to these themes that evolution suggested that universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes in a 1909 magazine article entitled world of life which he later expanded into a book of same name a work that shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout 20th century assessment of wallace s role in history of evolutionary theory in many accounts of development of evolutionary theory wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being stimulus to publication of darwin s own theory slotten p 6 in reality wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from darwin s and was considered by many especially darwin to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day whose ideas could not be ignored one historian of science has pointed out that through both private correspondence and published works darwin and wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other s ideas and theories over an extended period shermer p 149 wallace is most cited naturalist in darwin s descent of man occasionally in strong disagreement slotten pp 289 90 both darwin and wallace agreed on importance of natural selection and some of factors responsible for it competition between species and geographical isolation but wallace believed that evolution had a purpose teleology in maintaining species fitness to their environment whereas darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process scientific discoveries since 19th century support darwin s viewpoint by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers mutations in germ line dna i e dna of sperm or egg which manifest in offspring these occur spontaneously or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals a recently discovered mechanism which is likely to be more important than others combined is infections with viruses which integrate their dna into their hosts garry hamilton

of species that until event were perfectly adapted to their environment such as dinosaurs dramatic reduction of competition among surviving species makes newly evolved species more likely to survive wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for rest of his life by 1880s evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles in 1889 wallace published book darwinism as a response to scientific critics of natural selection slotten p 409 of all wallace s books it is most cited by scholarly publications shermer p 18 other scientific contributions biogeography and ecology thumb upright 1 5 a map of world from geographical distribution of animals shows wallace s six biogeographical regions in 1872 at urging of many of his friends including darwin philip sclater and alfred newton wallace began research for a general review of geographic distribution of animals he was unable to make much progress initially in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at time slotten p 301 he resumed work in earnest in 1874 after publication of a number of new works on classification slotten p 315 extending system developed by sclater for birds which divided earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution to cover mammals reptiles and insects as well wallace created basis for regions still in use today he discussed all of factors then known to influence current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region these included effects of appearance and disappearance of land bridges such as one currently connecting north america and south america and effects of periods of increased glaciation he provided maps that displayed factors such as elevation of mountains depths of oceans and character of regional vegetation that affected distribution of animals he also summarised all known families and genera of higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location resulting two volume work geographical distribution of animals was published in 1876 and would serve as definitive text on zoogeography for next 80 years slotten pp 320 25 in this book wallace did not confine himself to biogeography of living species but also included evidence from fossil record to discuss processes of evolution and migration that had led to geographical distribution of modern animal species for example he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in northern hemisphere migrating between north america and eurasia and then much more recently to south america after which northern species became extinct leaving modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in south america and southeast asia bowler 2013 p 152 wallace was very aware of and interested in mass extinction of megafauna in late pleistocene in geographical distribution of animals 1876 he wrote we live in a impoverished world from which all and fiercest and strangest forms have recently disappeared wallace geographical distribution of animals p 150 he added that he believed most likely cause for rapid extinctions to have been glaciation but by time he wrote world of life 1911 he had come to believe those extinctions were due to man s agency wallace world of life 1911 p 264 thumb left upright 1 7 line separating indo malayan and austro malayan region in wallace s on physical geography of malay archipelago 1863 in 1880 wallace published book island life as a sequel to geographical distribution of animals it surveyed distribution of both animal and plant species on islands wallace classified islands into three different types oceanic islands such as galapagos and hawaiian islands then known as sandwich islands formed in mid ocean and never part of any large continent such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians and their inhabitants with exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity were typically result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution he divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent like britain or much less recently like madagascar and discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna he talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in preservation of classes of animals such as lemurs of madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas he extensively discussed how changes of climate particularly periods of increased glaciation may have affected distribution of flora and fauna on some islands and first portion of book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages island life was considered a very important work at time of its publication it was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence slotten p 361 environmental issues wallace s extensive work in biogeography made him aware of impact of human activities on natural world in tropical nature and other essays 1878 he warned about dangers of deforestation and soil erosion especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall noting complex interactions between vegetation and climate he warned that extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in ceylon sri lanka and india would adversely impact climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion slotten pp 352 53 in island life wallace again mentioned deforestation and also impact of invasive species on impact of european colonisation on island of saint helena he wrote wallace s comments on environment grew more strident later in his career in world of life 1911 he wrote astrobiology wallace s 1904 book man s place in universe was first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate likelihood of life on other planets he concluded that earth was only planet in solar system that could possibly support life mainly because it was only one in which water could exist in liquid phase more controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in galaxy could have planets with necessary properties existence of other galaxies not having been proved at time his treatment of mars in this book was brief and in 1907 wallace returned to subject with a book is mars habitable to criticise claims made by percival lowell that there were martian canals built by intelligent beings wallace did months of research consulted various experts and produced his own scientific analysis of martian climate and atmospheric conditions slotten p 474 among other things wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in martian atmosphere that lowell s analysis of mars s climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated surface temperature and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water let alone a planet irrigation system impossible richard milner comments it was brilliant and eccentric evolutionist alfred russel wallace who effectively debunked lowell s illusionary network of martian canals wallace originally became interested in topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in universe shermer p 294 other contributions poetry wallace also wrote poetic verse an example being a description of from his book travels on amazon poem begins tis where streams divide to swell floods of two mighty rivers of our globe where gushing in their narrow beds it continues then to describe people of village and their lives in detail although it is not an idyllic description there is an indian village all around dark eternal boundless forest spreads its varied foliage stately palm trees rise on every side and numerous trees unknown save by strange names uncouth to english ears here i dwelt awhile one white man among perhaps two hundred living souls they pass a peaceful and contented life poem is a lyrical description of life of a tribe he was living with along amazon river while it has echoes of tennyson in rhymes and rhythms poem itself is not overly romantic serving more as a tool to set scene and then draw contrast between lives of people living here and those in england poem is a comment on savagery and greed making point that some in england were more savage than those on amazon either by a greed for gold or by their greed for gold driving others into poverty wallace concludes i d be an indian here and live content to fish and hunt and paddle my canoe and see my children grow like young wild fawns in health of body and in peace of mind rich without wealth and happy without gold poem is referenced and partially recited in bbc television series ascent of man controversies spiritualism in a letter to his brother in law in 1861 wallace wrote wallace was an enthusiast of phrenology slotten pp 203 05 early in his career he experimented with hypnosis then known as mesmerism he used some of his students in leicester as subjects with considerable success slotten pp 234 35 when he began his experiments with mesmerism topic was very controversial and early experimenters such as john had been harshly criticised by medical and scientific establishment wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into spiritualism in 1893 he wrote thumb right spirit photograph taken by frederick hudson of wallace and his mother wallace began investigating spiritualism in summer of 1865 possibly at urging of his older sister fanny sims who had been involved with it for some time slotten p 231 after reviewing literature on topic and attempting to test phenomena he witnessed at seances he came to accept that belief was connected to a natural reality for rest of his life he remained convinced that at least some seance phenomena were genuine no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism it has been suggested by one biographer that emotional shock he had received a few months earlier when his first fiancee broke their engagement contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism slotten p 236 other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead wallace s desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena both material and non material of natural world and of human society shermer pp 199 201 spiritualism appealed to many educated victorians who no longer found traditional religious doctrine such as that of church of england acceptable yet were unsatisfied with completely materialistic and mechanical view of world that was increasingly emerging from 19th century science slotten p 4 however several scholars who have researched wallace s views in depth have emphasised that for him spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief among other prominent 19th century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were social reformer robert owen who was one of wallace s early idols slotten p 232 physicists william crookes and lord rayleigh mathematician augustus de morgan and scottish publisher robert chambers shermer p 183 during 1860s stage magician john nevil maskelyne exposed trickery of davenport brothers jim 2005 hiding elephant arrow pp 95 96 wallace was unable to accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods and stated that maskelyne possessed supernatural powers brandon ruth 1993 life and many deaths of harry houdini secker warburg p 230 byrne georgina 2010 modern spiritualism and church of england 1850 1939 press pp 28 29 however in one of his writings wallace dismissed maskelyne referring to a lecture exposing his tricks wallace alfred russel 1875 on miracles and modern spiritualism london james burns pp 173 174 in 1874 wallace visited spirit photographer frederick hudson a photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced and wallace declared photograph genuine declaring even if he had by some means obtained possession of all photographs ever taken of my mother they would not have been of slightest use to him in manufacture of these pictures i see no escape from conclusion that some spiritual being acquainted with my mother s various aspects during life produced these recognisable impressions on plate wallace alfred russel 1875 on miracles and modern spiritualism london james burns pp 190 191 however hudson s photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872 mccabe joseph 1920 spiritualism a popular history from 1847 dodd mead and company p 157 wallace s very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in 1870s damaged his scientific reputation in 1875 wallace published evidence he believed proved his position in his book on miracles and modern spiritualism which is a compilation of essays he wrote over a period of time in his chapter entitled modern spiritualism evidence of men of science wallace refers to three men of highest eminence in their respective departments who were professor de morgan professor hare and judge edmonds who all investigated spiritualist phenomena however wallace himself is only quoting their results and was not present at any of their investigations his vehement defence of spiritualism strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as henry bates thomas huxley and even darwin who felt he was overly credulous evidence of this can be seen in wallace s letters dated 22 november and 1 december 1866 to thomas huxley asking him if he would be interested in getting involved in scientific spiritualist investigations which huxley politely but emphatically declined on basis that he had neither time nor inclination others such as physiologist william benjamin carpenter and zoologist e ray lankester became openly and publicly hostile to wallace over issue wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism notably william crookes were subject to much criticism from press with lancet as leading english medical journal of time being particularly harsh controversy affected public perception of wallace s work for rest of his career slotten pp 298 351 when in 1879 darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to wallace joseph hooker responded hooker eventually relented and agreed to support pension request slotten p 362 flat earth wager in 1870 a flat earth proponent named john hampden offered a ps500 wager equivalent to about ps in present day terms in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river canal or lake wallace intrigued by challenge and short of money at time designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six mile 10 km stretch of canal both objects were at same height above water and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at same height above water as well when seen through telescope one object appeared higher than other showing curvature of earth judge for wager editor of field magazine declared wallace winner but hampden refused to accept result he sued wallace and launched a campaign which persisted for several years of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief wallace won multiple libel suits against hampden but resulting litigation cost wallace more than amount of wager and controversy frustrated him for years shermer pp 258 61 anti vaccination campaign in early 1880s wallace was drawn into debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination wallace originally saw issue as a matter of personal liberty but after studying some of statistics provided by anti vaccination activists he began to question efficacy of vaccination at time germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted moreover no one knew enough about human immune system to understand why vaccination worked when wallace did some research he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable in a few cases completely phony statistics to support their arguments always suspicious of authority wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination and became convinced that reductions in incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were in fact due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation slotten pp 422 36 another factor in wallace s thinking was his belief that because of action of natural selection organisms were in a state of balance with their environment and that everything in nature even disease causing organisms served a useful purpose in natural order of things he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results wallace and other anti pointed out that vaccination which at time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner could be dangerous shermer pp 215 16 in 1890 wallace gave evidence before a royal commission investigating controversy when commission examined material he had submitted to support his testimony they found errors including some questionable statistics lancet averred that wallace and other anti vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety and that penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe years later in 1898 wallace wrote a pamphlet vaccination a delusion its penal enforcement a crime attacking commission s findings it in turn was attacked by lancet which stated that it contained many of same errors as his evidence given to commission legacy and historical perception thumb left upright wallace and his signature on frontispiece of darwinism 1889 as a result of his writing at time of his death wallace had been for many years a well known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist he was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics shermer pp 292 94 he received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours such royal society s royal medal and darwin medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively and order of merit in 1908 above all his role as co discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure he was undoubtedly one of greatest natural history explorers of 19th century despite this his fame faded quickly after his death for a long time he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in history of science a number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention including his modesty his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation and discomfort of much of scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas recently he has become a less obscure figure with publication of several book length biographies on him as well as anthologies of his writings in 2007 a literary critic for new yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000 there has also been a web page created that is dedicated to wallace scholarship in a 2010 book environmentalist tim flannery claimed that wallace was first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival flannery p 32 and suggested that wallace s understanding of natural selection and his later work on atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking thumb upright anthony smith s statue of wallace looking up at a bronze model of a wallace s golden birdwing butterfly natural history
