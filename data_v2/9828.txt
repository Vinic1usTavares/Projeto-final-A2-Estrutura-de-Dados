somerset county cricket club made their debut in first class cricket in 1882 english cricket season they were captained by stephen newton and played eight first class matches five against county opposition two against marylebone cricket club and one against touring australian team they only won one of eight contests that against hampshire at taunton of other matches one was drawn and other six were all losses for somerset wisden cricketers almanack described season as disastrous but publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883 part of reason for somerset s poor performances was their inability to consistently field their best players at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to full fixture list and in all county played 30 different people in their eight matches faint praise was offered to batting of william herbert fowler newton and edward sainsbury in sportsman but bowling was considered by wisden to be sub standard particularly that of arnold fothergill background somerset county cricket club was formed in 1875 and played irregular county fixtures in years after that during which time they struggled to remain financially solvent upon their formation club had no fixed home ground and it was declared that they would play on any ground in county that may be selected by committee foot 1986 pp 15 17 however in 1881 they moved into newly built athletic grounds in taunton although it is widely accepted that somerset s debut first class match came in 1882 some records do include earlier matches in 1879 and 1881 against gloucestershire as being of first class status squad thumb right bill roe was one of a number of players that were only available for part of season in their eight first class matches in 1882 somerset fielded 30 different players only three appeared in all eight matches arnold fothergill william herbert fowler and edward sainsbury while fourteen players appeared in only one match that season club captain stephen newton missed first three matches of season as he was a schoolmaster in london and was not available until summer holidays newton was not only talented player to only make limited appearances for side in their review of season wisden cricketers almanack explained that alfred evans robert ramsay and bill roe were all unavailable at various points and that these absences were among many good reasons to account for a disastrous season foot 1986 p 19 following players made at least one appearance for somerset in first class cricket in 1882 age given is at start of

1986 p 20 western daily press noted that somerset were not able to field a full strength team in match missing evans ramsay and roe however lancashire team which faced them was described by same paper as being very second rate weather was showery most of day and play was abandoned at half five because of rain with lancashire on 231 for 8 having won toss and batted first heavy rain overnight made ground unplayable on second day so play resumed following day although rain continued to threaten original wicket was badly damaged being described in york herald as a puddle and so stumps were moved to enable play to begin somerset took final two lancashire wickets in first ten minutes bowling them out for 237 fowler and sainsbury opened batting for somerset and put on eighteen runs together before being dismissed in quick succession western daily press recorded that after this disaster waited on visitors only two other batsmen scored any runs for somerset and they were all out for 29 runs second lowest first class total at time somerset followed on and their second innings proceeded in much same fashion as first pair scored 35 runs while rest of team only added a further 6 somerset lost match by an innings and 157 runs bath chronicle and weekly gazette defended somerset s performance on third day slightly noting that poor condition of pitch favoured lancashire bowlers lancashire s george nash took eight wickets in first innings including four in one four ball over while fellow spin bowler jack crossland collected six in second innings thumb right william herbert fowler was one of few somerset players to be praised by western gazette in their summary of season in somerset s second match they faced their nearest opposition gloucestershire once again weather was poor and spa ground in gloucester which was hosting match was specially looked after during heavy rain preceding match to ensure that it would be in a good condition for game as it was bristol mercury described wicket as being in fairly good order and play started just over half an hour late on first day somerset s batting failed to make a significant total fowler was only batsman to reach double figures totalling more than half of his team s runs with 39 w g grace took eight wickets for gloucestershire to bowl somerset out for 62 in gloucestershire s reply e m grace and billy midwinter scored centuries to help them establish a lead of 286 runs in their response somerset scored 109 including a partnership of 61 between sainsbury and fred which was praised in birmingham daily post despite an improved batting performance somerset lost match by an innings and 177 runs facing hampshire in southampton for third match somerset won toss and opted to bat first pitch was soft due to heavy rainfall through morning and play started shortly after midday sainsbury was yet again one of few somerset players to reach double figures and they were bowled out for 101 cecil currie a spin bowler for hampshire collected eight of wickets somerset managed to restrict hampshire s lead to 46 runs francis reed took four wickets and fothergill three fowler and fothergill were somerset s most successful batsmen in their second innings played mostly in light rain helping county to reach 118 runs that left hampshire requiring 73 runs to win which hosts achieved without losing any wickets to beat somerset with ten wickets to spare somerset team travelled to lord s in london in early august to face marylebone cricket club mcc somerset batted first after winning toss but lost three batsmen for ducks early in innings somerset s captain newton playing his first match of season for county batted for rest of innings to score 57 runs and shared a large partnership with francis reed mcc started well in their innings but introduction of fowler into bowling attack brought their batting to a quick conclusion fowler took four wickets while only conceding eight runs and claimed a hat trick by bowling edward hawtrey charles burke and thomas mycroft in successive deliveries somerset had a 25 run lead going into second innings in which newton once again top scored in addition to his total of 67 hildyard made an unbeaten 59 and fowler scored 23 runs from just six scoring shots including a six which went out of ground western daily press described fowler as possibly hardest hitter amongst english cricketers while his history of county david foot suggests that fowler was perhaps earliest somerset batsman to parade fundamental skills of slogging somerset totalled 219 to leave mcc needing to score 245 runs to win principally due to batting of john russel mcc reached target but only had one wicket remaining fothergill having taken five wickets and charles winter four second half of season home matches a few days later somerset played their first home fixture at taunton athletic grounds hosting hampshire in contrast to many of their previous game weather was good and on winning toss hampshire decided to bat first charles seymour batted well for visitors accruing 57 out of hampshire s 146 runs but fowler was again best of somerset bowlers collecting four wickets for nine runs to help restrict hampshire total ramsay top scored for somerset in their reply accumulating 71 runs before being bowled while a number of other batsmen made useful scores to help somerset to their total of 214 edward western somerset secretary batted in his only innings of season for county coming in as last man but he failed to score a run somerset struggled to collect wickets when hampshire batted again and tried eight different bowlers without much success their fielding was described by bristol mercury as being loose but when sixth wicket was taken with 232 runs scored rest followed reasonably quickly and hampshire finished on 290 fowler was dismissed early in somerset s chase but newton and sainsbury put on 118 runs together to help their towards victory sainsbury was dismissed for 63 but newton continued to bat putting on 80 runs before being dismissed somerset eventually reached required total with five wickets remaining to achieve their first win of season thumb left billy gunn scored 188 runs against somerset prompting western daily press to claim that somerset s bowling had been mastered by mcc batsmen next day after defeating hampshire somerset faced mcc at taunton mcc had brought a strong team including eight professionals and on winning toss they elected to bat after a cautious start second wicket partnership of billy gunn and william hearn put on 173 runs together and according to western daily press somerset bowling was completely mastered somerset tried eight different bowlers to try to get a wicket but partnership was eventually broken when hearn was run out for 91 frank hearne then joined gunn at crease and pair continued mcc s dominance adding a further 130 runs another run out again due to fielding of newton brought gunn s innings to an end after mcc batsman had scored 188 runs wickets then began to fall more frequently roe collected three while fothergill and winter had two apiece and mcc were eventually all out for 506 on second morning in their response somerset lost early wickets of sainsbury and newton but then a partnership between fowler and roe took score up to 181 during which fowler reached his century coming in just 55 minutes once that partnership was ended with dismissal of roe somerset regularly lost wickets fowler was caught in slips for 139 which had included three sixes and somerset ended their innings on 286 they followed on and lost five early wickets before a partnership between francis terry who scored 77 runs and fothergill steadied innings and help somerset secure a draw somerset s final county match of season came against same opposition as their first lancashire low attendance at match was criticised in press and western daily press in particular described that it was painfully obvious that as a body take no interest in first class cricket six wickets from evans helped somerset to limit lancashire to 178 runs in their first innings but somerset failed to capitalise fowler and newton scored 24 and 23 runs respectively but no other batsman reached double figures somerset were dismissed for 74 runs more than 100 behind and were asked to follow on by lancashire batting again somerset players put in an improved performance and reached 157 runs of which roe scored 45 lancashire were required to bat again but reached winning target of 53 runs for loss of only one wicket towards end of august touring australian team visited taunton attracting largest crowd of season roughly 1 500 people somerset were not considered to have much chance in match though australia were missing three of their better players leeds mercury offered somerset faint praise suggesting that they had no great cause to be dissatisfied with their performances australians batted first and were restricted to 245 by somerset alick bannerman was highest scorer for tourists with 50 runs while evans and fothergill took three wickets each in their response somerset s batsmen struggled against bowling of fred

second innings somerset performed slightly better newton scored 32 runs and five other batsmen reached double figures australian bowling once again proved too much though and somerset lost match by an
