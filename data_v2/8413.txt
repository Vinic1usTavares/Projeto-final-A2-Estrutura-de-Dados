audience group next proposed to write a track with an uptempo rhythm sinclair 2004 p 42 rowe set up a drum loop on his mpc3000 drum machine its fast rhythm reminded stannard of scene in grease stannard commented that only pre planned concept for song was that it should represent essence of what they were group then added their own contributions to song rowe recalls they made all these different bits up not thinking in terms of verse chorus bridge or what was going to go where just coming up with all these sections of chanting rapping and singing which we recorded all and then we just sewed it together it was rather like way we d been working on dance remixes we d been doing before kind of a cut and paste method wannabe was completed in thirty minutes mainly because group had written and composed parts of song beforehand in what brown describes as a sudden creative frenzy spice girls 1997 p 34 brown 2002 p 182 during session brown and bunton came up with idea of including a rap near end of song at this point group got very motivated and incorporated word zigazig ah into lyrics chisholm told billboard magazine you know when you re in a gang and you re having a laugh and you make up silly words well we were having a giggle and we made up this silly word zigazig ha we were in studio and it all came together in this song bronson 2003 p 852 at end of 2015 daily star reported about an insider telling that word was derived from phrase shit and cigars referring to an 80s pop musician being a studio neighbor when recording song he is said to having used shared studio toilet while smoking cigars recording and production while most of other songs on spice album required two or three days of studio time wannabe was recorded in less than an hour solo parts were divided between brown bunton chisholm and halliwell victoria adams missed most of writing session and communicated with rest of group on a mobile phone beckham 2001 pp 128 129 in her autobiography she wrote i just couldn t bear not being there because whatever they said about how it didn t matter it did matter saying yes i like that or not sure about that down phone is not same she contributed backing vocals and sings during chorus rowe stayed up all night working on song and it was finished by morning only later addition was sound of brown s footsteps as she ran to microphone group parted

lacklustre by label s executives sinclair 2004 pp 73 74 ashley newton who was in charge of a r sent song to american producer dave way for remixing result was not what group had hoped to achieve as halliwell later described it result was bloody awful halliwell 1999 p 207 she elaborated in her second autobiography just for record right at beginning of spice girls ashley newton had tried to turn us into an r b group he sent wannabe over to america to be remixed by some hot r b producers he brought us jungle versions and hip hop mixes and i hated them all although mel b was a big fan of r b she agreed with me that these versions just didn t work so we exercised our spice veto halliwell 2003 p 16 fuller gave song to audio engineer mark spike stent who thought that it was a weird pop record stent remixed it in six hours in what he described as tightening it up and getting vocals sounding really good composition wannabe is a dance pop song with influences of hip hop and rap written in key of b major it is set in time signature of common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 110 beats per minute spice girls 2008 pp 60 64 it uses sequence b d e a a as a bass line during refrain chorus and bridge and uses a chord progression of f g m e b for verses song is constructed in a verse pre chorus chorus form with a rapped bridge before third and final chorus musically it is energised by a highly syncopated synthesised riff and by way repetitive lyrics and rhythm are highlighted during bridge whiteley 2000 pp 220 221 224 wannabe presents a different version of traditional pop love song performed by females its energetic self assertive style expresses a confident independence that is not reliant on male figure for its continuance bloustein 1999 p 136 song opens with brown s laugh ha ha followed by piano notes stolen from popular grease summer nights bass line over these notes first lines of refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between brown and halliwell words tell really and i wanna are repeated so that vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self assertion refrain ends with word zigazig ah which sounds like work of lewis carroll s made up words a euphemism for female desire which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic shuker 2001 p 131 blake 1999 pp 162 163 first verse follows chisholm bunton brown and halliwell sing one line individually in that order in this part lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of situation they begin if you want my future forget my past this according to musicologist sheila whiteley taps directly into emotions of young teenage audience during chorus lyrics if you wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends address value of female friendship over heterosexual bond while ascending group of chords and number of voices creates a sense of power that adds to song s level of excitement same pattern occurs leading to second chorus towards end brown and halliwell rap bridge which serves as a presentation to each of girls personalities de ribera berenguer 1997 p 42 group repeats chorus for last time ending song with energetic refrains slam your body down and wind it all around and word zigazig ah release and promotion after signing group virgin records launched a major campaign for their debut song to promote them as new high profile act there was a period of indecision about what song would be released as first single label wanted to get everything right for campaign because all girl group format was untested group led by brown and halliwell was adamant that debut song should be wannabe they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and girl power statement virgin s executives believed that first single should either be say you ll be there which they considered a much cooler track or love thing at beginning of 1996 impasse between group and their record label about release of single was temporarily solved in march fuller announced that he agreed with virgin in that wannabe should not be first single label wanted a song that appealed to mainstream market and nothing considered too radical halliwell was shocked and furious she

feminist lyric she was also surprised that considering slightness of wannabe group had an overwhelming amount of offers from record companies magazine nme characterised song as a combined force of bananarama betty boo and shampoo rolled into one dele of same magazine called rap during song s bridge annoying and added writing of group s music it s not good it s not clever but it s fun magazine

typifies this debut s tart bubblegum and packaged sexiness greg kot of chicago tribune called it insidiously snappy that is shaping up as this year s macarena karla peterson of san diego union tribune said that wannabe has ugh written all over it adding that it was relentlessly catchy and horrifyingly hummable buffalo news s anthony violanti called it irresistible sarah rodman of boston globe described it as a maniacally zippy single and stephanie zacharek of salon com referred to it as an unapologetically sassy dance hit melissa ruggieri of richmond times dispatch commented that based on their efficacious american debut single spice girls might be expected to deliver more of that zingy pop on their debut album but she felt that aside from wannabe album s dance tracks are color by numbers bland larry flick of billboard magazine said that fans of more edgy girl group may find this single too fluffy but added that everyone else with a love of tasty pop hooks lyrical positivity and jaunty rhythms is going to be humming this single for months to come some reviewers noticed combination of musical genres christina kelly from rolling stone magazine criticised group s image and added that their songs including wannabe were a watered down mix of hip hop and cheesy pop balladry brought together by a manager with a marketing concept matt diehl of entertainment weekly said that it was more a compendium of music styles from abba style choruses to unconvincing hip hop than an actual song and sara scribner of los angeles times described it as a bubblegum hip hop confection of rapping lifted off neneh cherry and monie love albums charles aaron of spin magazine called it a quickie mid 80s teen paperback come to life so gooey it melts in your hands not in your mouth song ranked at fifteenth on village voice s 1997 pazz jop critics poll conducted by music journalist robert christgau present day reviews from critics however are mostly positive stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said that none of girls have great voices but they do exude personality and charisma which is what drives bouncy dance pop like wannabe with its ridiculous zig a zig hook into pure pop guilty pleasure dan cairns of sunday times said that song leaves a bad taste in mouth because true legacy of girl power is arguably a preteen clothing industry selling crop tops and other minimal garments to young girls but added that it remains same two minutes and 53 seconds of pop perfection that it ever was in a review of their greatest hits album ign said that after ten years it still sound reasonably fresh while digital spy s nick levine said that wannabe still remained an exuberant calling card billboard named song 5 on their list of 100 greatest girl group songs of all time and best
