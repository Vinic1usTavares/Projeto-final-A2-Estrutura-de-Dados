determined to do something to combat human trafficking film by february 2012 kooman was working on a screenplay version of she has a name idea of a stage to film adaptation of she has a name was also

photograph of a man with blue green eyes looking at viewer smiling and wearing a brown shirt all in front of a sheet of black material stephen waldschmidt said that sympathetic portrayal of perpetrators prevents play from becoming simplistic kooman made justice focus of she has a name social issues that interest him include poverty hiv aids epidemic and effects of war central issues in she has a name are gender based general topic of play is human trafficking of children into sexual slavery for general topic of play see for specific topic of play see kooman has stated that she has a name suggests that justice can only be realized if real people know care and take informed and decisive action victimized child in play is known only by number 18 to reflect that traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number which in some cases is branded onto victim s body after his rape of number 18 pimp leaves situation without adverse effect but number 18 is left bleeding from her crotch and mouth play invites viewers to feel sympathetic towards number 18 and although world of human trafficking is depicted as horrific and ugly both victims and perpetrators of human trafficking are portrayed as relatable characters suggesting that every individual has inherent value and dignity for way that play invites viewers to feel towards number 18 see for play s depiction of human trafficking see for play s portrayal of human trafficking victims and perpetrators see for what play suggests about individuals value and dignity see in an interview with calgary journal prior to 2012 tour waldschmidt said that sympathetic portrayal of perpetrators prevents play from becoming a simplistic story of good and evil according to liz nicholls of edmonton journal number 18 is a nuanced character better developed than stock damsel in distress thumb left 300px alt a photograph of a man wearing a dress shirt and blue jeans standing and leaning on a table opposite a blonde woman in a green dress to depict tension between jason and ali two communicate via skype which is represented on stage by two laptops that are set up back to back kooman said that massive proportions of human trafficking often prevent people from dealing with it he therefore chose to portray a single trafficked victim in play so that audiences could approach subject on a more workable level he hoped that audiences would avoid getting stuck in statistics of human trafficking and would connect with a personal story two questions that propel story are can jason convince number 18 to risk her life to testify for sake of justice and can he save her from unthinkable circumstances jason is weary and although he never falls into self pity he comes to hate himself for his inability to save number 18 from her slavery because he lacks evidence he requires for his case to be successful in court for jason s weariness and self hatred see for jason s lack of self pity and evidence see much of play is concerned with demonstrating immensity of difficulties that face jason in trying to rescue number 18 for example he finds it difficult to be away from his wife and struggles with decision of whether to continue his work or return to canada to depict this tension jason and ali communicate via skype represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back to back with jason and ali standing on either side facing one another two argue but their interactions demonstrate kind of love that number 18 can only dream of in 2012 cross canada tour a torn picture of number 18 s family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what character has lost this picture took form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted family as tired poor and living in a shack lana michelin of red deer advocate said most emotionally gripping scene was one in which voices cause number 18 to recall face of her dead father anna of st albert gazette called play a story of fallible people who find strength in each other under worst conditions thumb alt a photograph of a man wearing a blue dress shirt and blue jeans and looking into eyes of a woman

actor who portrayed number 18 in premiere said that play was about human condition for wong s connection to play see for wong s comment about play see evelyn chew actor who took over role for 2012 tour said that play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking and that builds in intensity to its climax sienna howell holden who played mama in premiere and 2012 tour said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st century human trafficking character of mama calls attention to fact that poverty in third world fuels sex trafficking stephen waldschmidt said he hoped that play will educate canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn thereby turning them into anti sexual slavery activists for waldschmidt s comment about education and motivation see for waldschmidt s comment about so called contemporary abolitionism see he also said he hoped that play will put a face on million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide because of play s heavy themes producers of first performances issued an advisory for parents waldschmidt also stressed amount of action in play and said that if play was a film it would receive a pg 13 rating and would be billed a thriller for waldschmidt s comment about action see for waldschmidt s comment about a theoretical film rating see for waldschmidt s comment about genre see he also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage she has a name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because play is so theatrically gripping country sunrise news stated that drama has a fast pace mallory clarkson of london community news reported that while she has a name is an emotional play there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh similarly lana michelin of red deer advocate asserted that play s sporadic humorous points maintain audience s engagement with story so they do not become numb to play s emotional pulls kooman stated that he tried to write play in a way that would shock audiences without disturbing them to point that they would not recommend it to friends marlo campbell a writer for uptown said that play critiques masculine egotism and western heroism through character of jason lana michelin of red deer advocate disagreed stating that jason never lapses into self importance aaron krogman who portrayed jason and pimp in play s premiere said there is a thin line between jason and pimp both characters are struggling with power and how they use it waldschmidt stated that doubling of this role is intended to remind audiences that there are canadians who are perpetrators of human trafficking and that it is not just somebody else s problem over there but that it s us and it s in our country and in our backyard and in our suburbs for waldschmidt s comment about canadian perpetrators of human trafficking see for quotation see jason has in this way been considered an everyman chris quandt who portrayed jason at united states premiere said that he and his fellow cast members greatly appreciated fact that kooman incorporated into play facts that taking down one brothel often leaves space for another brothel to be established soon afterwards and that child sex tourism exists because there is a demand for it one canadian critic said that play s bangkok setting allows canadians to easily dissociate from issue liz nicholls of edmonton journal wrote that pimp character represents ruthless spirit of pure human greed stephen pederson of chronicle herald called play a combination of idealism realism and lyricism dustin wiebe of mennonite brethren herald wrote that play shows darker side of man s desire for control by presenting number 18 as having been stripped of her humanity disaster that concludes play is foreshadowed throughout play both starts and ends with a depiction of reality of contemporary slavery critical reception critical response to she has a name began with initial readings of play at 2009 scripts at work workshop where script was given scripts at work alberta playwrights network award play has since become very successful and was endorsed by canadian activists including mp joy smith ratanak international s brian mcconaghy and ijm canada s jamie mcintosh for subsequent success of play see for canadian anti sex work activists who endorsed play see lara director of calgary chapter of act alberta said she was concerned that she has a name suggests that human trafficking is limited to sex trafficking of women and children in thailand but there is sexual slavery related human trafficking in canada and there is also human trafficking for purposes of unfree labour chorus of dead human trafficking victims has generally received negative reviews one critic called it play s least successful device adrian chamberlain of victoria times colonist criticised some of script charging that there were implausible plot twists and other fundamental flaws but concluded that it was well intentioned and ambitious and has its heart in right place play s premiere and initial run were mostly critically acclaimed religious community s reviews of initial run were also positive after first performances in 2011 louis hobson of calgary sun said character of marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn t ring true because of how she was written character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well rounded and kind before 2012 cross canada tour in 2012 tour play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals at which critics representing montreal gazette winnipeg free press and cfeq fm said it stood out for its quality and moral content for gazette review see for winnipeg free press review see for cfeq fm review see writing was praised by one critic from victoria news who wrote that play demonstrates that kooman has a gift for creating powerful believable dialogue that can draw an audience in but criticised by chamberlain of times colonist who attested to melodramatic and just plain bad cop show dialogue liz nicholls of edmonton journal called performances compelling karen nelson also of edmonton journal called play sobering in such a way that she was caused to wonder what she could do about this global epidemic of abuse of children women and disenfranchised during 2012 tour kooman was awarded outstanding alumnus provincial award
