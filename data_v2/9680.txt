that really kept me going because i would be ready to go onstage and just be crying hysterically not understanding even how i was feeling i was feeling very dizzy i had a lot of vertigo i had pain but it s like fuck if i know what hurts most because i d been on tour for a year but i didn t want to let them down and i just couldn t cancel because thought of leaving 50 000 kids in arena just broke my

gradual edm stranglehold of pop radio erin coulehan of rolling stone concurred calling it a throwback to lovegame era gaga song s production is primarily centered around hi nrg beats stuttering synthesizers and hard snares robbie daw of idolator noted that opening pulsating synths are a straight up throwback to poker face intro albeit slightly sped up while handclap laden chorus swells and soars with same pop frenzy that made paparazzi such a delight guardians michael cragg described song s composition as brilliantly camp all squelchy synths and juddering beats and likened it to a ridiculous glam rock song given a techno makeover chorus has been noted to contain a solid mixture of edm influenced pop glitchy k pop lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of fame and features gaga singing lines give me thing that i love i ll turn lights on put your hands up make em touch make it real loud her vocal acrobatics during song s verses have been compared to those of david bowie annie lennox and grace jones lyrically applause is about how gaga is dependent upon her fan s adoration and what it means to live your life as a canvas while also serving as a kiss off to critics bradley stern of muumuse opined that unlike born this way applause is about celebrating no one but mother monster herself according to gaga song s lyrics highlight difference between an artist and a celebrity she elaborated i live for applause but i don t live for attention in way that people just love you because you re famous i live for actually performing for people and then them applauding because they ve been entertained artwork and release during process of picking lead single from artpop gaga played numerous songs for jimmy iovine an executive at interscope records of 40

and wearing a transparent visor sound of an audience booing and jeering was heard in background direct quotations from critics and detractors appeared at bottom of video which included lady gaga is over and do not buy lady gaga s new single applause clip was construed as an attempt at reverse psychology due to proximity of single s leak to fellow pop singer katy perry s roar applause was fervently compared to it in addition to rumors spreading of a feud between two gaga received negative press after news arose of her attempting to artificially increase single s placement on billboard hot 100 chart which some sources reported as an attempt to beat sales of roar she was criticized for tweeting fans and encouraging them to purchase numerous copies of single with chance to meet singer in london offered as an incentive tweet provoked criticism from billboards editorial director bill werde who opined that an artist tweeting out and a link that enables a fan to hit play and leave their computer is not in spirit of what we chart following this gaga stated that she would be rewarding fans with most creative ideas and not those who purchased most copies of applause critical reception thumb gaga performing applause during her residency show at roseland ballroom 2014 applause received favorable reviews from music critics chris richards of washington post wrote it s good maybe even slow clap good because while so many too many of gaga s songs have been designed to boost esteem of her flock this song finds her openly pining for mass adulation that all superstars need to survive jason lipshutz of billboard lauded song s hook and remarked as always gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for masses lewis corner from digital spy gave song four out of five stars stating that lady gaga makes no secret that she s after mass adoration and as far as lead singles go her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start carl williot of idolator praised track saying

solid start i d say so on par with bad romance well let s not get ahead of ourselves sal cinquemani of slant magazine believed song lacked bigness of gaga s previous lead singles but noted that it proves she can still craft a catchy hook mof gimmers of quietus noted that song was a bit sticky in places but explained if you stop expecting too much of gaga you ll realise it has a furiously irresistible chorus kevin fallon of daily beast was critical of song s disjointed verses but noted that they were increasingly forgivable every time song s unshakable chorus blasts and praised it as a fitting climax to album melinda newman of hitfix gave song a b rating and labelled it a layered dance twirler positive feedback also came from mike driver from clash who highlighted applause as one of tracks on artpop that ticks all of prerequisite gaga boxes dazzling production a clutch of clever couplets choruses you can demolish a tower block with but found that it did not represent a notable musical progression for singer hilary hughes from esquire offered similar commentary feeling that gaga was playing it safe and that song doesn t break new ground for reigning queen of pop in a mixed review evan sawdey of popmatters called song generic and that were it not for her heady lyrics and warped lead in synth line applause wouldn t stand out all that much in radio which makes it an even more curious choice as a lead single spins marc hogan criticized song s bland dance bot foundations as a bit behind times at a pop moment where biggest song of summer candidates have moved back toward 70s inflected guitars another mixed review came from harry of contactmusic com who wrote i can t give it more than a polite clap chart performance thumb left gaga performing applause during 2014 s

previously collaborated with gaga on a series of fashion films in 2011 and a photoshoot for v magazine video was filmed at paramount pictures studio in hollywood california on two different sets over three days gaga was inspired by silent film and early horror films and explained that concept behind video is that of her passion for shape shifting and transforming she described it as iconography in motion as magic gaga and her team decided to use several different looks for video with each being representative of different facets of her as a performer attires worn in video included designs by gareth pugh vintage john galliano as well as outfits crafted by haus of gaga inez and vinoodh explained that video symbolizes this idea that she goes through this struggle to go back onstage which is in that pink laser tower and she s sort of dragging that leg as a trophy and making it back on stage as a fully realized complete new person jo ratcliffe a london based illustrator known for her hand drawn graphic design was hired to provide animation effects for video she described gaga as really tough during filming and added that she had never seen anyone push themselves so hard gaga spoke of this intensity during an interview with radio station z100 new york explaining that it was difficult for her to quickly mould herself into different personalities portrayed in video release and

superimposed on a swan s neck chris rovzar of vanity fair compared scenes to a photo shoot gaga did for interview magazine video received generally positive reviews glenn gamboa of newsday described it as a barrage of artistic images that continued song s theme of combining art with pop culture erin coulehan of rolling stone magazine noted that video was in typical gaga fashion further calling it a spectacle of flashing lights vivid colors and intricate choreography kyle anderson of entertainment weekly also echoed coulehan s statements about video being in gaga fashion adding that it makes song sound infinitely better it doesn t quite hit high notes of paparazzi or bad romance but it s definitely a step up from middling clips from born this way era a writer of billboard described video as a collection of arty postures and scenarios and compared black glove bra look to janet jackson s 1993 rolling stone magazine cover randall roberts of los angeles times saw video as basically like 20 different vogue shoots documented and spliced there is no plot other than basic lyrical premise i need you to pay more attention to me given heft by a syllabically rocky first person observation about pop culture fame and art that andy warhol noted 50 years ago monde of new york daily news described video as a straight forward profile of artist herself a writer of rolling stone compared black and white look of video with madonna s vogue 1920s german expressionist cinema and ingmar bergman s seventh seal he further noted influences from liza minnelli tom petty and heartbreakers don t come around here no more and sandro botticelli s birth of venus a writer of independent wrote showing gaga in a number of guises as a beatnik performance artist her face smeared with clown make up sporting david bowie esque androgyny while wearing a bra made of black leather gloves and as various winged creatures high energy accompaniment to her new track is a of imagery that seems to highlight pop princess ever changing appearance chris rovzar of vanity fair described video as a moving photo shoot for interview magazine except with more sanity rovzar concluded that it also featured standard gaga nonsense and praised gaga s smile during several scenes of video as a highlight james montgomery of mtv news saw video as gaga pulling curtain back on her creative process showing viewer how she s willing to do anything to please public melinda newman of hitfix felt gaga continues her one woman performance art with very theatrical video and interpreted it as showing that there is nothing lady gaga won t do to get your attention conversely spins march hogan wrote some of us just like to read she sings and hey that includes us but it s easier to clap for something that moves or touches you rather than serves as an advertisement for gaga as incomprehensible high end brand consequence of sound wrote in their review gaga s head appears on a black swan and she down in a clam bikini if this doesn t bump up her sales i no longer believe in art hilary hughes of esquire said that video hits all marks of gaga esque eccentricity glitter boob grabs weird animals space severed limbs devotional imagery nudity neon etc it just doesn t redefine those marks as previous music videos of gaga s namely bad romance paparazzi and judas have spencer kornhaber of atlantic believed that gaga was
