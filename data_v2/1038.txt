service these connections are not depicted context thumb left upright 1 3 alt world trade center transportation hub one block west of fulton center world trade center transportation hub planned for lower manhattan in aftermath of september 11 attacks was originally supposed to connect with fulton street transit center need and funding after several pieces of transit infrastructure in lower manhattan were destroyed or severely damaged during september 11 2001 attacks officials proposed a 7 billion redesign of transit in neighborhood this included fulton street transit center south ferry whitehall street terminal further downtown and reconstruction of west side highway most important of these projects was port authority of new york and new jersey s proposed terminal for path trains at world trade center site which was destroyed when world trade center collapsed a preliminary plan for new terminal included situating it under church street near site of former hudson terminal and close to metropolitan transportation authority mta s broadway nassau fulton street station new terminal would also contain direct connections to subway previously world trade center had been served by three different subway stations at cortlandt greenwich streets cortlandt church streets and church street between chambers and vesey streets money was also to be allocated to study feasibility of commuter rail service to lower manhattan this would later become canceled lower manhattan jamaica jfk transportation project which would have created a railway line between lower manhattan and john f kennedy international airport via long island rail road and airtrain jfk as part of rebuilding process port authority considered putting path terminal at broadway and fulton street however this was deemed to be prohibitively expensive so it ultimately decided to put path terminal near greenwich street two blocks west mta s project to connect different subway stations at broadway nassau fulton street was approved despite fact that path and mta projects would not be built as part of a single project these stations would instead be connected by a series of underground passageways which would stretch from world financial center in west to fulton street transit center in east spanning over half of manhattan s width at this point fulton street transit center would also contain a large retail building at broadway and fulton street serving as main entrance to that complex fulton street project would include new passageways entrances and elevators to provide transfers between area s subway stations and increase capacity of existing station complex at broadway nassau fulton streets in february 2003 new york governor george pataki announced a 5 billion plan for rebuilt transit infrastructure at south ferry fulton street and world trade center by april 2003 mta had released preliminary plans for a 750 million transit hub at fulton street connecting six subway stations in december 2003 federal transit administration allocated a combined 2 85 billion to three lower manhattan transit projects path station received 1 7 billion in aid while fulton street transit center received 750 million and south ferry terminal received 400 million planning and cutbacks compared with other subway stations renovations fulton street transit center s funding was secure because project was financed using money from september 11 recovery fund after funding for transit center had been secured project s environmental impact statement was released in 2004 project was still undergoing revisions as of mid 2005 and was to be completed by october 2005 construction was set to begin later that year funding problems began in june 2005 when original plans were cut back projected cost of fulton street transit center had grown by 75 million to 825 million design had been delayed to may 2006 and proposed completion date was now december 2008 in march 2006 land under corbin building was taken for proposed transit center by eminent domain a block to north mta began process of evicting and relocating 148 store owners near site of transit center s main building budget of real estate acquisition also rose from 50 million to 157 million this cost increase was a key factor in ballooning costs of transit center over next several years by may 2006 budget was nearing 850 million and planned completion date was delayed to june 2009 despite 45 million budget overrun mta denied that fulton center plan would be curtailed in november 2006 mta announced creation of a free transfer between cortlandt church streets and world trade center stations which would cost 15 million more by february 2007 projected cost had risen to 888 million and mta pledged to pay for 41 million gap with its own money completion date was now projected as october 2009 thumb construction site of fulton center main building seen in march 2010 meanwhile costs of other mta capital construction projects were rising as well issue peaked in january 2008 when mta announced that three other capital projects 7 subway extension second avenue subway and east side access were facing a combined cost overrun of 1 billion to remedy overrun plans for fulton center s main building had to be downsized instead of being a structure with a large dome headhouse would now be a simple stainless steel building with a smaller dome project excluding main building was now expected to cost 903 million main building would cost another 250 million if built cost overruns were attributed to fact that mta had received a single 870 million bid for one phase of construction more than twice 408 million mta had originally set aside for that phase date of completion was now set for 2010 and mta had ordered a 30 day review of fulton center plan around same time neighboring world trade center hub s costs also rose from 2 2 billion to 3 4 billion funding reductions also resulted in several design cutbacks free transfer from cortlandt church streets and world trade center stations was dropped from plans but was later restored using mta funds before being dropped and restored again passageway underneath dey street was narrowed from mta deleted main building from plan to reduce costs in march 2008 mta announced that it would spend 295 million on an as yet undetermined structure at location of main building one proposal included constructing main building with a performing arts center rather than a dome on top by this time mta lacked several billion dollars in funding for its 2010 2014 capital spending plan mta did not rule out possibility of converting almost entire plot into a public plaza and constructing a simple subway entrance from plaza new york post columnist steve cuozzo called project folly on fulton street a word play on fulton s folly which was used to describe robert fulton s steamboat 200 years before in june 2008 chris ward executive director of port authority of new york and new jersey prepared a report for new york governor david paterson regarding fulton street and world trade center projects cost overruns despite fulton street transit center s financing deficit federal transit administration refused to fund cost overruns associated with fulton center however mta used 2009 federal stimulus money to help fund project in january 2009 mta received 497 million in additional stimulus money bringing total cost of fulton street transit center to 1 4 billion as part of an exhibit on city s major public construction projects mta described

impetus for may 2012 name change from fulton street transit center to a simpler fulton center to attract leases mta looked to private companies to manage retail section of fulton center attempting to change it to a shopping destination as well as a transit center retail spaces are intended to provide additional revenue for mta in form of real estate in july 2012 mta made a motion to seek proposals from various companies for a master lease for 65 000 square feet of retail and commercial space this space includes corbin building and dey street passageway and headhouse mta made a requests for
