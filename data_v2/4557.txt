schutzstaffel ss leaders held in berlin suburb of wannsee on 20 january 1942 purpose of conference called by director of reich main security office ss obergruppenfuhrer reinhard heydrich was to ensure cooperation of administrative leaders of various government departments in implementation of final solution to jewish question whereby most of jews of german occupied europe would be deported to occupied poland and murdered conference attendees included representatives from several government ministries including state secretaries from foreign office justice interior and state ministries and representatives from ss in course of meeting heydrich outlined how european jews would be rounded up and sent to extermination camps in general government occupied part of poland where they would be killed soon after invasion of poland in september 1939 persecution of european jews was raised to unprecedented levels but systematic killing of men women and children began only in june 1941 after onset of operation barbarossa against soviets on 31 july 1941 hermann goring gave written authorization to heydrich to prepare and submit a plan for a total solution of jewish question in territories under german control and to coordinate participation of all involved government organisations at wannsee heydrich emphasized that once mass deportation was complete ss would take complete charge of a secondary goal was to arrive at a definition of who was formally jewish and thus determine scope of genocide one copy of protocol with circulated minutes of meeting survived war it was found by robert kempner in march 1947 among files that had been seized from german foreign office it was used as evidence in subsequent nuremberg trials wannsee house site of conference is now a holocaust memorial background legalized discrimination against jews in germany began immediately after nazi seizure of power in january 1933 violence and economic pressure were used by nazi regime to encourage jews to voluntarily leave country ideology of nazism brought together elements of antisemitism racial hygiene and eugenics and combined them with pan germanism and territorial expansionism with goal of obtaining more lebensraum living space for germanic people nazi germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking poland and soviet union intending to deport or exterminate jews and slavs living there who were viewed as being inferior to aryan master race discrimination against jews long standing but extra legal throughout much of europe at time was codified in germany immediately after nazi seizure of power on 30 january 1933 law for restoration of professional civil service passed on 7 april of that year excluded most jews from legal profession and civil service similar legislation soon deprived jewish members of other professions of right to practise violence and economic pressure were used by regime to force jews to leave country jewish businesses were denied access to markets forbidden to advertise in newspapers and deprived of access to government contracts citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses 250px thumb 1935 chart shows racial classifications under nuremberg laws german mischlinge and jew in september 1935 nuremberg laws were enacted prohibiting marriages between jews and people of germanic extraction extramarital sexual relations between jews and germans and employment of german women under age of 45 as domestic servants in jewish households reich citizenship law stated that only those of german or related blood were defined as citizens thus jews and other minority groups were stripped of their german citizenship a supplementary decree issued in november defined as jewish anyone with three jewish grandparents or two grandparents if jewish faith was followed by start of world war ii in 1939 around 250 000 of germany s 437 000 jews emigrated to united states palestine great britain and other countries after invasion of poland in september 1939 hitler ordered that polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed polen special prosecution book poland lists of people to be killed had been drawn up by ss as early as may 1939 einsatzgruppen special task forces performed these murders with support of selbstschutz germanic self protection group a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic germans living in poland members of ss wehrmacht german armed forces and ordnungspolizei order police orpo also shot civilians during polish campaign approximately 65 000 civilians were killed by end of 1939 in addition to leaders of polish society they killed jews prostitutes romani people and mentally ill on 31 july 1941 hermann goring gave written authorization to ss obergruppenfuhrer senior group leader reinhard heydrich chief of reich main security office rsha to prepare and submit a plan for a total solution of jewish question in territories under german control and to coordinate participation of all involved government organisations resulting generalplan ost general plan for east called for deporting population of occupied eastern europe and soviet union to siberia for use as slave labour or to be murdered minutes of wannsee conference estimated jewish population of soviet union to be five million including nearly three million in ukraine in addition to eliminating jews nazis also planned to reduce population of conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called hunger plan devised by herbert backe food supplies would be diverted to german army and german civilians cities would be razed and land allowed to return to forest or resettled by german colonists objective of hunger plan was to inflict deliberate mass starvation on slavic civilian populations under german occupation by directing all food supplies to german home population and wehrmacht on eastern front according to historian timothy snyder 4 2 million soviet citizens largely russians belarusians and ukrainians were starved by nazis and nazi controlled wehrmacht in 1941 1944 as a result of backe s plan harvests were poor in germany in 1940 and 1941 and food supplies were short as large numbers of forced labourers had been brought into country to work in armaments industry if these workers as well as german people were to be adequately fed there must be a sharp reduction in number of useless mouths of whom millions of jews under german rule were in light of nazi ideology most obvious example at time of wannsee conference killing of jews in soviet union had already been underway for some months right from start of operation barbarossa invasion of soviet union einsatzgruppen were assigned to follow army into conquered areas and round up and kill jews in a letter dated 2 july 1941 heydrich communicated to his ss and police leaders that einsatzgruppen were to execute comintern officials ranking members of communist party extremist and radical communist party members people s commissars and jews in party and government posts open ended instructions were given to execute other radical elements saboteurs propagandists snipers assassins agitators etc he instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by occupants of conquered territories were to be quietly encouraged on 8 july he announced that all jews were to be regarded as partisans and gave order for all male jews between ages of 15 and 45 to be shot by august net had been widened to include women children and elderly entire jewish population by time planning was underway for wannsee conference hundreds of thousands of polish serbian and russian jews had already been killed initial plan was to implement generalplan ost after conquest of soviet union european jews would be deported to occupied parts of russia where they would be worked to death in road building projects planning conference thumb left upright letter from heydrich to martin luther undersecretary at foreign office notifying him that conference would be delayed on 29 november 1941 heydrich sent invitations for a ministerial conference to be held on 9 december at offices of interpol at am kleinen wannsee 16 he changed venue on 4 december to eventual location of meeting he enclosed a copy of a letter from goring dated 31 july that authorised him to plan a so called final solution to jewish question ministries to be represented were interior justice four year plan propaganda and reich ministry for occupied eastern territories between date invitations to conference went out 29 november and date of cancelled first meeting 9 december situation changed on 5 december 1941 soviet army began a counter offensive in front of moscow ending prospect of a rapid conquest of soviet union on 7 december 1941 japanese attacked united states at pearl harbor causing u s to declare war on japan next day reich government declared war on u s on 11 december some invitees were involved in these preparations so heydrich postponed his meeting somewhere around this time hitler resolved that jews of europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after war which now had no end in sight at reich chancellery meeting of 12 december 1941 he met with top party officials and made his intentions plain on 18 december hitler discussed fate of jews with himmler in wolfsschanze following meeting himmler made a note on his service calendar which simply stated jewish question to be destroyed as partisans war was still ongoing and since transporting masses of people into a combat zone was impossible heydrich decided that jews currently living in general government german occupied area of poland would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of poland as would jews from rest of europe on 8 january 1942 heydrich sent new invitations to a meeting to be held on 20 january venue for rescheduled conference was a villa at am

minister joachim von ribbentrop proceedings thumb eichmann s list in preparation for conference eichmann drafted a list of numbers of jews in various european countries countries were listed in two groups a and b a countries were those under direct reich control or occupation or partially occupied and quiescent in case of vichy france b countries were allied or client states neutral or at war with germany numbers reflect estimated jewish population within each country for example estonia is listed as free of jews since 4 500 jews who remained in estonia after german occupation had been exterminated by end of 1941 occupied poland was not on list because by 1939 country was split three ways among polish areas annexed by nazi germany in west territories of poland annexed by soviet union in east and general government where many polish and jewish had already been resettled heydrich opened conference with an account of anti jewish measures taken in germany since nazi seizure of power in 1933 he said that between 1933 and october 1941 537 000 german austrian and czech jews had emigrated this information was taken from a briefing paper prepared for him previous week by eichmann heydrich reported that there were approximately eleven million jews in whole of europe of whom half were in countries not under german control he explained that since further jewish emigration had been prohibited by himmler a new solution would take its place evacuating jews to east this would be a temporary solution a step towards final solution of jewish question german historian peter longerich notes that vague orders couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of regime were common especially when people were being ordered to carry out criminal activities leaders were given briefings about need to be severe and firm all jews were to be viewed as potential enemies that had to be dealt with ruthlessly wording of wannsee protocol distributed minutes of meeting made it clear to participants that evacuation east was a euphemism for death thumb left conference room at wannsee conference house 2006 heydrich went on to say that in course of practical execution of final solution europe would be combed through from west to east but that germany austria and protectorate of bohemia and moravia would have priority due to housing problem and additional social and political necessities this was a reference to increasing pressure from gauleiters regional nazi party leaders in germany for jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for germans made homeless by allied bombing as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries evacuated jews he said would first be sent to transit ghettos in general government from which they would be transported eastward heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties it was important to define who was a jew for purposes of evacuation he outlined categories of people who would not be killed jews over 65 years old and jewish world war i veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won iron cross might be sent to theresienstadt concentration camp instead of being killed with this expedient solution he said in one fell swoop many interventions will be prevented situation of people who were half or quarter jews and of jews who were married to non jews was more complex under nuremberg laws of 1935 their status had been left deliberately ambiguous heydrich announced that mischlinge mixed race persons of first degree persons with two jewish grandparents would be treated as jews this would not apply if they were married to a non jew and had children by that marriage it would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by highest offices of party and state such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation a mischling of second degree a person with one jewish grandparent would be treated as german unless he or she was married to a jew or a mischling of first degree had a racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a jew or had a political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a jew persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non jews in case of mixed marriages heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually and impact on any german relatives assessed if such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as germans jewish partner would not be killed if they were being raised as jews they might be killed or sent to an old age ghetto these exemptions applied only to german and austrian jews and were not always observed even for them in most of occupied countries jews were rounded up and killed en masse and anyone who lived in or identified with jewish community in any given place was regarded as a jew thumb facsimiles of minutes of wannsee conference and eichmann s list presented under glass at wannsee conference house memorial heydrich commented in occupied and unoccupied france registration of jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty but in end great majority of french born jews survived more difficulty was anticipated with germany s allies romania and hungary in romania government has now appointed a commissioner for jewish affairs heydrich said in fact deportation of romanian jews was slow and inefficient despite a high degree of popular antisemitism in order to settle question in hungary heydrich said it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for jewish questions onto hungarian government hungarian regime of miklos horthy continued to resist german interference in its jewish policy until spring of 1944 when wehrmacht invaded hungary very soon 600 000 jews of hungary and parts of czechoslovakia romania and yugoslavia occupied by hungary were sent to their deaths by eichmann with collaboration of hungarian authorities heydrich spoke for nearly an hour then followed about thirty minutes of questions and comments followed by some less formal conversation otto hofmann head of ss race and settlement main office rusha and wilhelm stuckart state secretary of reich interior ministry pointed out legalistic and administrative difficulties over mixed marriages and suggested compulsory dissolution of mixed marriages or wider use of sterilisation as a simpler alternative erich neumann from four year plan argued for exemption of jews who were working in industries vital to war effort and for whom no replacements were available heydrich assured him that this was already policy such jews would not be killed josef buhler state secretary of general government stated his support for plan and his hope that killings would commence as soon as possible towards end of meeting cognac was served and after that conversation became less restrained gentlemen were standing together or sitting together eichmann said and were discussing subject quite bluntly quite differently from language which i had to use later in record during conversation they minced no words about it at all they spoke about methods of killing about liquidation about extermination eichmann recorded that heydrich was pleased with course of meeting he had expected a lot of resistance eichmann recalled but instead he had found an atmosphere not only of agreement on part of participants but more than that one could feel an agreement which had assumed a form which had not been expected wannsee protocol thumb left view of grosser wannsee lake from villa at 56 58 am grossen wannsee where conference was held at conclusion of meeting heydrich gave eichmann firm instructions about what was to appear in minutes they were not to be verbatim eichmann ensured that nothing too explicit appeared in them he said at his trial how shall i put it certain over plain talk and jargon expressions had to be rendered into office language by me eichmann condensed his records into a document outlining purpose of meeting and intentions of regime moving forward he stated at his trial that it was personally edited by heydrich and thus reflected message he intended participants to take away from meeting copies of minutes known from german word for minutes as wannsee protocol were sent by eichmann to all participants after meeting most of these copies were destroyed at end of war as participants and other officials sought to cover their tracks it was not until 1947 that luther s copy number 16 out of 30 copies prepared was found by robert kempner a u s prosecutor in international military tribunal at nuremberg in files that had been seized from german foreign office interpretation thumb upright reinhard heydrich wannsee conference lasted only about ninety minutes enormous importance which has been attached to conference by post war writers was not evident to most of its participants at time heydrich did not call meeting to make fundamental new decisions on jewish question massive killings of jews in conquered territories in soviet union and poland were ongoing and a new extermination camp was already under construction at belzec at time of conference other extermination camps were in planning stages decision to exterminate jews had already been made and heydrich as himmler s emissary held meeting to ensure cooperation of various departments in conducting deportations observations from historian laurence rees support longerich s position that decision over fate of jews was determined before conference rees notes that wannsee conference was really a meeting of second level functionaries and stresses that neither himmler goebbels nor hitler were present according to longerich a primary goal of meeting was to emphasise that once deportations had been completed implementation of final solution became an internal matter of ss totally outside purview of any other agency a secondary goal was to determine scope of deportations and arrive at definitions of who was jewish who was mischling and who if anybody should be spared representatives of ministerial bureaucracy had made it plain that they had no concerns about principle of deportation per se this was indeed crucial result of meeting and main reason why heydrich had detailed minutes prepared and widely circulated said longerich their presence at meeting also ensured that all those present were accomplices and accessories to murders that were about to be undertaken eichmann s biographer david cesarani agrees with longerich s interpretation he notes that heydrich s main purpose was to impose his own authority on various ministries and agencies involved in jewish policy matters and to avoid any repetition of disputes that had arisen earlier in annihilation campaign simplest most decisive way that heydrich could ensure smooth flow of deportations he writes was by asserting his total control over fate of jews in reich and east and by cow ing other interested parties into line of rsha house of wannsee conference in 1965 historian joseph wulf proposed that wannsee house should be made into a holocaust memorial and document centre but west german government was not interested at that time building was in use as a school and funding was not available despondent at failure of project and west german government s failure to pursue and convict nazi war criminals wulf committed suicide in 1974 on 20 january 1992 on fiftieth anniversary of conference site was finally opened as a holocaust memorial and museum known as haus der wannsee house of wannsee conference museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of holocaust and its planning
