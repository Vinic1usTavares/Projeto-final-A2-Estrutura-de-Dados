thumb 300px passers by observe a wrecked jewish business in magdeburg germany after kristallnacht pogrom of 9 november 1938 events surrounding pogrom inspired tippett to write a child of our time a child of our time is a secular oratorio by british composer michael tippett 1905 1998 who also wrote libretto composed between 1939 and 1941 it was first performed at adelphi theatre london on 19 march 1944 work was inspired by events that affected tippett profoundly assassination in 1938 of a german diplomat by a young jewish refugee and nazi government s reaction in form of a violent pogrom against its jewish population called kristallnacht tippett s oratorio deals with these incidents in context of experiences of oppressed people generally and carries a strongly pacifist message of ultimate understanding and reconciliation text s recurrent themes of shadow and light reflect jungian psychoanalysis which tippett underwent in years immediately before writing work oratorio uses a traditional three part format based on that of handel s messiah and is structured in manner of bach s passions work s most original feature is tippett s use of african american spirituals which carry out role allocated by bach to chorales tippett justified this innovation on grounds that these songs of oppression possess a universality absent from traditional hymns a child of our time was well received on its first performance and has since been performed all over world in many languages a number of recorded versions are available including one conducted by tippett when he was 86 years old background and conception thumb stamford school photographed in 2006 where tippett s musical abilities first became apparent michael tippett was born in london in 1905 to well to do though unconventional parents his father a lawyer and businessman was a freethinker his mother a writer and suffragette he received piano lessons as a child but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at stamford school in lincolnshire between 1920 and 1922 although school s formal music curriculum was slight tippett received private piano tuition from frances tinkler a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been malcolm sargent himself a former pupil at stamford tippett s chance purchase in a local bookshop of stanford s book musical composition led to his determination to be a composer and in april 1923 he was accepted as a student at royal college of music rcm kemp pp 8 13 here he studied composition first under charles wood who died in 1926 and later less successfully with charles kitson he also studied conducting first under sargent and later under adrian boult he left rcm in december 1928 but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer he returned to college in 1930 for a further period of study principally under professor of counterpoint r o morris in economically depressed 1930s tippett adopted a strongly left wing political stance and became increasingly involved with unemployed both through his participation in north yorkshire work camps and as founder of south london orchestra made up of out of work musicians he was briefly a member of british communist party in 1935 but his sympathies were essentially trotskyist inimical to stalinist orientation of his local party and he soon left kemp p 31 32 in 1935 he embraced pacifism but by this time he was becoming overtaken by a range of emotional problems and uncertainties largely triggered by break up of an intense relationship with painter wilfred franks in addition to these personal difficulties he became anxious that political situation in europe was leading inexorably towards war after meeting jungian psychoanalyst john layard tippett underwent a period of therapy which included self analysis of his dreams kemp pp 36 37 according to tippett s biographer geraint lewis outcome of this process was a rebirth confirming for tippett nature of his homosexuality while strengthening his destiny as a creative artist at possible expense of personal relationships encounter with layard led tippett to a lifelong interest in work and teaching of carl jung an influence carried through into many of his subsequent compositions whittall p 32 in mid to late 1930s several of tippett s early works were published including his string quartet no 1 sonata no 1 for piano and concerto for double string orchestra among his unpublished output in these years were two works for voice ballad opera robin hood written for performance at yorkshire work camps and a song of liberty based on william blake s marriage of heaven and hell kemp pp 498 99 as his self confidence increased tippett felt increasingly driven to write a work of overt political protest in his search for a subject he first considered dublin easter rising of 1916 he may have been aware that benjamin britten had written incidental music to montagu slater s play easter 1916 however events towards end of 1938 turned his attention away from irish matters whittall p 71 tippett had made several visits to germany and had acquired a love for its literature and culture he became increasingly distressed by reports of events in that country and in particular persecution of its jewish population steinberg pp 284 85 in november 1938 assassination in paris of a german diplomat ernst vom rath by herschel grynszpan a 17 year old jewish refugee precipitated kristallnacht pogrom across germany over several days of violence synagogues were burned jewish homes and businesses attacked and destroyed thousands of jews were arrested and some jews were stoned or beaten to death kemp pp 150 51 reports from germany of these events affected tippett profoundly and became inspiration for his first large scale dramatic work creation libretto thumb upright left herschel grynszpan whose actions formed basis of a child of our time having found his subject tippett sought advice on preparation of text from t s eliot whom he had met recently through a mutual friend francis morley tippett 1994 pp 50 51 musicologist michael steinberg comments that given his anti semitism eliot may have been an inappropriate choice of collaborator though tippett considered poet his spiritual and artistic mentor and felt that his counsel would be crucial tippett writes i plucked up courage and asked him if he would write it eliot said he would consider matter as long as i provided him with a precise scheme of musical sections and an exact indication of numbers and kinds of words for each stage when tippett produced his detailed draft eliot advised composer to write his own libretto suggesting that his own superior poetry would either distract attention from music or otherwise would be swallowed up by it either way there would be a mismatch tippett accepted this advice henceforth he records he always wrote his own texts tippett resolved that his work would be an oratorio rather than an opera he chose title from a contemporary protest novel by austro hungarian writer odon von horvath text that tippett prepared follows three part structure used in handel s messiah in which part i is prophetic and preparatory part ii narrative and epic part iii meditative and metaphysical in a child of our time general condition of oppression is defined in first part narrative elements are confined to second part while third part contains interpretation and reflection on a possible healing kemp p 157 tippett perceived work as a general depiction of man s inhumanity to man and wanted grynszpan s tragedy to stand for oppressed everywhere golding robin 1986 a child of our time darkness declares glory of light notes on recording compact disc rpo records to preserve universality of work tippett avoids all use of proper names for people and places thus paris is a great city grynszpan becomes boy soprano is boy s mother vom rath is official kemp p 160 commentators have identified numerous works as textual influences including eliot s murder in cathedral and ash wednesday goethe s faust and wilfred owen s poem seed gloag pp 10 14 tippett s biographer ian kemp equates ending of oratorio to closing pages of part i of john bunyan s pilgrim s progress in which christian and hopeful end their journey by crossing a deep and wide river to reach their heavenly home influence of jungian themes is evident in recurrent images of darkness and light and recognition and balancing of opposites steinberg p 286 in a recent analysis of work richard rodda finds a child of our time rooted in essential dialectic of human life that tippett so prized in jung s philosophy winter spring darkness light evil good reason pity dreams reality loneliness fellowship man of destiny child of our time composition tippett completed his jungian psychoanalysis on 31 august 1939 three days later on day that britain declared war on germany he began composing a child of our time his grounding in traditions of european music guided him instinctively towards passions of bach as his basic musical model thus building blocks of work are familiar recitatives arias choruses and ensembles with a male soloist acting as a narrator and chorus as full participants in action tippett also introduced two other formal number types operatic scena and orchestral interlude latter allowing time for reflection on significant events kemp p 168 tippett wished to punctuate his work with an equivalent to congregation chorales which recur in bach s passions however he wanted his work to speak to atheists agnostics and jews as well as to christians he considered briefly whether folk songs or even jewish hymns could provide an alternative but rejected these because he felt that like chorales they lacked universality a solution was suggested to him when he heard on radio a rendering of spiritual steal away in particular he was struck by power of words trumpet sounds within a my soul this led him to recognise spirituals as carrying an emotional significance far beyond their origin as slave songs in 19th century america and as representing oppressed everywhere kemp p 158 having found his substitute for chorales tippett wrote off to america for a collection of spirituals when this arrived i saw that there was one for every key situation in oratorio he chose five steal away nobody knows trouble i see lord go down moses o by and by and deep river first fourth and fifth of these are placed at ends of oratorio s three parts deep river as finale expressing according to tippett hope of a fresh spring after a long dark winter kenneth gloag in his detailed analysis of oratorio writes as well as constructing pathway through dramatic narrative five spirituals also combine to provide moments of focus and repose giving shape to both musical and literary dimensions of work gloag pp 27 30 tippett felt that work encapsulated all his current political moral and psychological preoccupations synopsis and structure according to tippett s description part i of work deals with general state of oppression in our time part ii presents particular story of a young man s attempt to seek justice by violence and catastrophic consequences and part iii considers moral to be drawn if any steinberg p 284 he later extended his summary to following part i general state of affairs in world today as it affects all individuals minorities classes or races that are felt to be outside ruling conventions man at odds with his shadow i e dark side of personality part ii child of our time appears enmeshed in drama of his personal fate and elemental social forces of our day drama is because forces which drive young man prove stronger than good advice of his uncle and aunt as it always

objector after outbreak of war in september 1939 tippett joined peace pledge union with which he had been informally associated since 1935 and applied for registration as a conscientious objector although his case was not considered by tribunal until february 1942 in october 1940 he became director of music at morley college kemp pp 40 41 where previous april he had conducted south london orchestra in premiere of his concerto for double string orchestra kemp p 499 after completing composition of a child of our time in 1941 tippett worked on other projects feeling that oratorio s pacifist message was out of touch with prevailing national mood walter goehr who conducted morley college orchestra advised delaying its first performance until a more propitious time in february 1942 tippett was assigned by tribunal to non combative military duties following his appeal this was changed to service either with air raid precautions arp with fire service or on land he felt obliged to refuse these directions and as a result was sentenced in june 1943 to three months imprisonment of which he served two months before his early release for good behaviour performance history and reception premiere after his release from prison in august 1943 with encouragement from britten and youthful music critic john amis tippett began to make arrangements for oratorio s first performance kemp pp 52 53 goehr agreed to conduct but overrode composer s initial view that morley college s orchestra could handle work and insisted that professionals were needed tippett records that somehow or other money was scraped together to engage london philharmonic orchestra tippett 1994 pp 156 57 morley college choir s choral forces were augmented by london regional civil defence choir britten s connection with sadler s wells opera brought three soloists to project joan cross soprano peter pears tenor and roderick lloyd bass fourth singer margaret macarthur alto came from morley college gloag p 89 premiere was arranged for 19 march 1944 at london s adelphi theatre before this event amis introduced work in an article for february 1944 issue of musical times in which he predicted a noteworthy musical occasion general style of oratorio is simple and direct and music will i think have an immediate effect on both audience and performers later writers would state that a child of our time placed tippett in first rank of composers of his generation and most of early reviews were favourable among these timess critic called work strikingly original in conception and execution and wrote that tippett had succeeded quite remarkably in writing an effective tract for times a second times review written a few days after premiere suggested that oratorio had articulated a key contemporary question how is conflict of inevitable with intolerable to be resolved it pointed to hope expressed in final spiritual deep river and concluded that despite some weak passages work created a successful partnership between art and philosophy william glock in observer was laudatory most moving and important work by an english composer for many years glock found that spirituals suited themes of oratorio perfectly and had been arranged with a profound sense of beauty in musical times edwin evans praised tippett s text simple and direct he has wisely resisted any temptation to use quasi biblical or pilgrim s progress language evans was uncertain whether music was truly reflective of words emotion seemed singularly cool under provocations described in text unlike glock evans was unconvinced by case for inclusion of spirituals t he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment eric blom in music letters thought idea of using spirituals brilliant and analogy with bach s chorales convincing blom was less enthusiastic about text which he found very terse and bald rather poor really though he thought this preferable to such as those that characterise libretti written for handel in his autobiography tippett makes only muted references to premiere noting that event had some mixed reviews but in a letter to his friend francesca allinson he professed himself delighted with breadth of response to work it s got over not only to ordinary listeners but even to intellectuals like matyas seiber who has written to me of some of lovely texture of some of numbers early performances generally positive reception of premiere persuaded arthur bliss then serving as bbc s director of music to arrange a broadcast performance of work this took place on 10 january 1945 shortly after which in february tippett conducted work at royal albert hall tippett 1994 pp 181 and 183 radio broadcast had been heard by howard hartog a music writer and publisher who just after war was in occupied germany attempting to re establish north german radio symphony orchestra in hamburg as part of this endeavour he decided to mount a performance of a child of our time with hans schmidt conducting because of his pacifism and record as a conscientious objector tippett was not allowed into occupied zone and thus missed performance tippett 1994 p 159 however in 1947 he was able to travel to budapest where his friend hungarian composer matyas seiber had organised a performance by hungarian radio local singers problems with english text meant that work was sung in hungarian which tippett who conducted described as a very odd experience tippett 1994 p 192 in early 1950s tippett attended a performance of oratorio at radio hall in brussels after which members of audience expressed to him their gratitude for work which they said exactly represented their wartime experiences in december 1952 he travelled to turin for a radio performance conducted by herbert von karajan and with operatic stars elisabeth schwarzkopf and nicolai gedda among soloists he records that during rehearsals bass soloist mario petri had problems singing his recitatives and that despite some coaching from composer was still at sea during performance karajan asked tippett if he would object to an extra interval in part ii to which tippett replied that he would mind very much karajan nevertheless imposed break thus presenting a four part version of work tippett 1994 p 206 wider audience in may 1962 a child of our time received its israel premiere in tel aviv steinberg p 287 tippett says that this performance was delayed because for a while there were local objections to word jesus in text when it came about among audience was herschel grynszpan s father who tippett wrote was manifestly touched by work his son s precipitate action 25 years earlier had inspired tippett 1994 pp 260 61 performance by kol yisrael orchestra with tel aviv chamber choir was acclaimed by audience of 3000 but received mixed reviews from press times report noted contrasting opinions from two leading israeli newspapers correspondent for haaretz had expressed disappointment every tone is unoriginal and work repeats old effects in a most conventional manner conversely according to times report critic had found that composition had moved everyone to depths of his soul no jewish composer had ever written anything so sublime on theme of holocaust despite its successes in europe a child of our time did not reach united states until 1965 when it was performed during aspen music festival with composer present in his memoirs tippett mentions another performance on that american tour at a women s college in baltimore in which male chorus and soloists were black catholic from a local seminary tippett 1994 pp 250 52 first significant american presentations of work came a decade later at cleveland in 1977 where prince charles who was visiting delayed his departure so that he could attend tippett 1994 p 257 and at carnegie hall new york where colin davis conducted boston symphony orchestra and tanglewood festival chorus reviewing this performance for new york times donal henahan was unconvinced that work s sincerity and unimpeachable intentions add ed up to important music spirituals were sung with passion and fervour but rest was reminiscent of a familiar pious sermon in which words were only intermittently intelligible meanwhile work had achieved its african debut where in 1975 tippett observed a performance with an improvised orchestra which incorporated zambian police band zambian president kenneth kaunda was present and entertained composer afterwards tippett 1994 p 244 later performances in october 1999 in year following tippett s death a child of our time received a belated new york philharmonic premiere at avery fisher hall new york times reviewer paul griffiths expressed some astonishment that this was orchestra s first attempt at work as part of celebrations for centenary of composer s birth in january 2005 english national opera staged a dramatised performance of work directed by jonathan kent coincidentally first performance fell in week of 60th anniversary of liberation of death camps at auschwitz anna picard writing in independent recognised work s sincerity but found dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate do we really need to see a dozen well fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit in order to understand holocaust anthony holden in observer was more positive commenting that if you must stage a work intended for concert performance it is hard to imagine a more effective version than kent s shot through with heavy symbolism of which tippett would surely have approved nevertheless holden found overall result super solemn lurching between over and portentous 2005 holocaust days of remembrance 1 8 may were marked at kennedy center in washington dc by a special performance of a child of our time in which washington chorus was directed by robert shafer piece was performed at bbc proms 2016 on 23 july by bbc national orchestra and chorus of wales a child of our time has survived periods of indifference particularly in america to be ranked alongside britten s war requiem as one of most frequently performed large scale choral works of post second world war period according to meirion bowen tippett s long time companion and a champion of his music work s particular quality is its universal message with which audiences all over world have identified in his notes accompanying performance at 2010 grant park music festival in chicago richard e rodda summarises work s continuing appeal i t deals with issues as timeless as civilization itself man s inhumanity to man place of individual who confronts ruthless power need for learning lessons of history and for compassion and understanding and honesty and equality in our dealings with each other whatever our differences may be tippett s child still speaks profoundly to us in our own deeply troubled time music thumb left upright deep river my home is over jordan final spiritual in oratorio sheet music version 1917 kemp describes tippett s central problem in composing a child of our time as integrating language of spirituals with his own musical style tippett was in kemp s view entirely successful in this respect o by and by he says sounds as if it could almost have been composed by tippett to assist process of integration composer had obtained recordings of american singing groups especially hall johnson choir kemp p 164 which provided him with a three part model for determining relationships between solo voices and chorus in spirituals chorus soloists chorus kemp p 172 tippett s instructions in score specify that spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns but as integral parts of oratorio nor should they be but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly swung brief orchestral prelude to part i introduces two contrasting moods which pervade entire work kemp likens opening snarling trumpet triad to a descent into hades kemp p 170 but it is answered immediately by a gently mournful phrase in strings in general eight numbers which comprise this first part each have says gloag their own distinct texture and harmonic identity often in a disjunctive relationship with each other gloag p 31 although second and third numbers are connected by an orchestral interludium from among diverse musical features steinberg draws attention to rhythms in chorus when shall usurer s city cease that illustrate tippett s knowledge of and feel for english madrigal what kemp describes as one of supreme moments in tippett s music occurs towards end of part as soprano s aria melts into spiritual steal away a transition so poignant as to set off that instant shock of recognition that floods eyes with emotion although soprano continues to grieve in a floating melisma spiritual comes as a relief as well as a release because of its large number 17 of generally short components part ii is most diffuse of three parts texturally and harmonically gloag p 44 narrative is driven largely by alternating choruses and comments from narrator with two brief operatic in which four soloists participate kemp finds in one of choruses an allusion to sei from bach s st john passion and hears traces of elgar in soprano s solo o my son which begins first scena narrative climax is reached with spiritual of anger go down moses which tippett arranges in form of a chorale kemp pp 173 76 this is followed by three short meditations from tenor soprano and alto soloists before a possible redemption is glimpsed in spiritual which ends part o by and by with a soprano descant which steinberg describes as ecstatic part iii consists of only five numbers each rather more extensive than most of those in earlier sections of oratorio part has on whole a greater unity than its predecessors gloag pp 62 63 musical and emotional climax to whole work is penultimate ensemble i would know my shadow and my light kemp writes whole work has been leading to this moment ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction before a modulation leads into deep river in this final spiritual for first time full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed kemp p 177 oratorio ends quietly on an extended pianissimo lord total vocal and instrumental resources required for oratorio are a satb chorus with soprano alto tenor and bass soloists and an orchestra comprising two flutes two oboes english horn two clarinets two bassoons contrabassoon four horns three trumpets three trombones
