jacqueline mckenzie as janice jan higgins michael rapaport as tom scoggins ll cool j as sherman preacher dudley aida turturro as brenda kerns production development story of deep blue sea was conceived by australian screenwriter duncan kennedy after he witnessed a horrific shark attack on a beach near his home tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind this motivated him to write a spec script while acknowledging challenge of approaching a shark film without repeating steven spielberg s 1975 thriller jaws although warner bros bought script in late 1994 actual development on project did not start until two years later when renny harlin was chosen to direct film kennedy s screenplay which had already been re written by several writers at warner bros was presented to donna powers and wayne powers who turned it into film s final script according to wayne movie became essentially what we wrote draft we were first presented by warner bros was much more of a military espionage high tech action movie grenade launchers that kind of thing we wanted our team to include more blue collar types and not to have weapons to fight back to play it more as a horror film deep blue sea had a budget of 82 million and represented a test for harlin who had not made a commercially successful film since cliffhanger in 1993 harlin s main goal was to bring horror genre back to serious and high budget production values of films like exorcist jaws shining as opposed to tongue in cheek style of subsequent films in genre ridley scott s 1979 film alien was an influence on casting process as harlin wanted to cast characters in a way as to make it impossible for audience to know who was going to die or survive to achieve this he combined relatively unknown actors who could deliver solid performances and meet physical demands of diving and stunts with a star academy award nominee samuel l jackson who anchors whole piece harlin also forced studio into hiring rapper ll cool j because he wanted a character who could bring a lot of warmth and humor to film without it being joke type humor filming principal photography for deep blue sea began on august 3 1998 most of film was shot at fox baja studios in rosarito mexico where production team constructed sets above large water tanks that had been built for james cameron s 1997 film titanic some of sets were designed so that they could be submerged while others were built on sound stages with used as windows at fox baja studios cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated as shark used in jaws was 25 feet long harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet jackson recalled when they first brought it into lab we were all in awe of size of this machine it was a real monster i would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark gills moved and it had a mind of its own sometimes as an added homage to jaws license plate pulled from shark s teeth by carter is same plate found in tiger shark carcass from spielberg s film after shoot at fox baja studios wrapped harlin insisted team go to bahamas to shoot with real sharks recounting his experience there actor thomas jane who played shark wrangler carter said first day i was in a cage but next day they swam me 30 feet down then this guy yanks breather off me and water s churning with blood and guts and stuff it was so terrifying that i don t want to remember it idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all to distinguish deep blue sea from jaws where shark is frequently hidden harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then scene where cast is trying to get back to elevator after hooking up actor stellan skarsgard to helicopter is actually an accident that made it into finished film as jackson explained at one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating we scrambled up and kept acting that was not supposed to happen and we didn t have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck jackson was initially offered role played by ll cool j but his management team did not like idea of him playing a chef so harlin created role of russell franklin for him additionally ll cool j s character was supposed to die early on but director ultimately decided to keep him production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for ll cool j s character so they used two parrots one that was good at flying and another that could sit on his shoulder right 150px thumb a deleted scene from film s ending film s ending was changed shortly before its theatrical release originally burrows s character would escape shark infested water and live however test audience who saw film less than a month before its release disapproved of ending because she was behind shark experiments and was seen as film s villain as a result production team did a one day reshoot in universal studios tank and did some computer generated work on sharks to change it in 2009 harlin explained that deep blue sea was hardest film he had ever made because most of shooting days involved team standing in water or being under water for long periods according to him just practicality of putting a wet suit on in morning being in water all day your script all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper and things that you wouldn t think would ever float they float or then things that you hope would float actually sink and you can t find them anywhere music film score for deep blue sea was composed by trevor rabin rabin s music ranges from orchestral and choral arrangements to electronic

linger on special effects some of sharks look like cartoons but it knows how to use timing suspense quick movement and especially surprise he concluded that film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre in a positive review kenneth turan of los angeles times considered deep blue sea a return to form for harlin especially after dismal swamps of cutthroat island and long kiss goodnight he described film as an example of how expert action filmmaking and up to minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material similarly desson howe of washington post remarked that while film s premise feels familiar it knows its audience and knows what ll get them going and even wondering he said that deep blue sea might not be harlin s finest two hours but he managed to build something that if nothing else gives you a great big shock every few minutes in a three and a half out of four review robert of florida times union highly praised film s pacing intense action and chase scenes stating that deep blue sea is a great popcorn movie and what summer at cineplex is all about other reviews were less enthusiastic writing for new york times stephen holden described deep blue sea as a cut rate titanic stripped of romance and historical resonance and fused with jaws shorn of mythic symbolism and without complex characters while barbara shulgasser of chicago tribune criticized it for being an inferior imitation of jurassic park but praised ll cool j s performance and film s realistic setting ian nathan of british magazine empire gave film three out of five stars and criticized its b movie conventions stating that you re never entirely sure whether you re laughing at or with deep blue sea variety
