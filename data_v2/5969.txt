amphicoelias meaning from greek amphi amphi on both sides and koilos koilos hollow concave is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago during tithonian late jurassic period of what is now colorado united states a herbivore amphicoelias was moderately sized at about long roughly same length as diplodocus to which it was related its hindlimbs were very long and thin and its forelimbs were proportionally longer than in relatives namesake fossil of type species amphicoelias altus american museum of natural history 5764 is uncertain in included material when described by edward drinker cope shortly after its discovery in 1877 amphicoelias was noted to include many back vertebrae a single pubis and a femur however after purchase and cataloging of material by amnh henry fairfield osborn and charles mook described that specimen had only two vertebrae a pubis femur tooth scapula coracoid ulna and a second femur additional material not mentioned by cope was found close in proximity to holotype and was similar to diplodocus a relative of amphicoelias their assignment was questioned by subsequent authors emanuel tschopp et al in an analysis of diplodocidae during description of amphicoelias altus in 1877 cope additionally named a latus for a femur and tail vertebrae following its description osborn and mook in 1921 reidentified material as a specimen of camarasaurus an assignment followed by other authors who reviewed material a year later 1878 cope named third species of amphicoelias a fragillimus for a gigantic dorsal vertebra that was subsequently lost measuring approximately if reconstructed based on diplodocus early estimates for length of animal in life were between long due to incomplete nature such lengths longest of any known dinosaur and sauropod were largely ignored in 2018 kenneth carpenter renamed amphicoelias fragillimus as new genus maraapunisaurus and reclassified it from diplodocidae to rebbachisauridae description thumb left restoration of a altus henry fairfield osborn and charles craig mook noted overall close similarity between amphicoelias and diplodocus as well as a few key differences such as proportionally longer forelimbs in amphicoelias than in diplodocus femur of amphicoelias is unusually long slender and round in cross section while this roundness was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of amphicoelias it has since been found in some specimens of diplodocus as well a altus was also similar in size to diplodocus estimated to be about long dorsal vertebrae of amphicoelias are mostly incomplete but their anatomy is discernible from known remains centrum is very compressed in middle in all dimensions with a large pleurocoel set inside a large lateral in amphicoelias is very tall and along its side there is a prominent lamina extending from posterior centrum to articular surfaces with neural arch of preceding vertebra from directly behind prezygapophyses lateral processes for rib articulation project slightly upwards and outwards surrounded by shallow fossae and a large lamina extending up neural spine is thin with a pair of ridges going up along either side on edges end is wide compared to main spine but approximately subequal in length and width a partial forelimb provisionally referred to amphicoelias by osborn mook in 1921 resembles diplodocus but is more robust overall distal end of scapula while only partially preserved show that expansion of was smaller than camarasaurus but larger than apatosaurus long as preserved bone is noticeably thicker than in diplodocus but not quite as thick as in camarasaurus coracoid found alongside scapula is far more similar to diplodocus than camarasaurus being round and longer than tall however it is also thicker than in diplocodus in coracoid is large and centered on short axis of bone ulna is more elongate than any comparable bone known from diplocodus it has prominent articular faces for humerus and radius and narrows toward incomplete distal end pubis of amphicoelias is very fragmentary and only discernible characteristics are that it is long but thick and has a small surface for articulation with a single slender right femur of amphicoelias is known from holotype long it is slightly longer than femur of camarasaurus supremus but significantly less robust being approximately round in cross section and only wide shaft of femur is gently curved towards hip articulation and straight close to prominent articular a second partial left femur was also found in collections of amnh and was assigned to holotype specimen while it was not mentioned by cope it lacks a majority of upper bone but known shaft and end are very similar to one figured by cope and it may be left femur of same individual discovery and history thumb right outdated 1897 restoration of aquatic a altus by charles r knight in 1877 a number of fossils were discovered by william lucas in rock outcrops in colorado close to canyon city these bones including some named laelaps camarasaurus supremus and were assumed to be from cretaceous dakota formation by paleontologist edward drinker cope from same age as other laelaps fossils among assortment of fossils discovered a specimen including multiple dorsal vertebrae a pubis and a femur was found by aaron ripley lucas brother in law in quarry xii they were sent to cope on 21 october 1877 j s mcintosh 1998 new information about cope collection of sauropods from garden park colorado in carpenter k chure d and kirkland j i eds morrison formation an interdisciplinary study part 2 modern geology 23 1 4 481 506 cope concluded they belonged to a new taxon within sauropoda which cope named amphicoelias altus in december 1877 e d cope 1877 on amphicoelias a genus of saurians from dakota epoch of colorado proceedings of american philosophical society 17 242 246 cope determined that taxon would have been a sauropod related to camarasaurus found nearby both being large animals with lightly built vertebrae and solid limbs in 1897 after cope s death his collection was acquired by american museum of natural history amnh where specimen was given accession number amnh 5764 then including two dorsals a pubis a femur a tooth a scapula coracoid and an ulna while forelimb material was not originally assigned to amphicoelias paleontologists henry fairfield osborn and charles mook in 1921 added them to holotype specimen on basis that they were found in same strata not far away and bore differences from camarasaurus they were found alongside because of uncertainty about referral of these remains in 2015 emanuel tschopp and colleagues hesitantly rejected referral of tooth scapula and coracoid but accepted ulna referral based on collection data specimen was determined to have come from late jurassic morrison formation in youngest layers separate from those that held camarasaurus fossils also described by cope cope listed multiple features to separate amphicoelias and a altus from their relatives unlike in camarasaurus of dorsals did not have an where front end has a ball that fits into socket of preceding vertebra instead amphicoelias had vertebrae where both ends are mildly to moderately concave because of this difference cope named two separate families to contain different morphs of vertebral centra one being and other being amphicoeliidae as well camarasaurus possessed openings in side of centrum that were taller than long contrasting to condition in amphicoelias and a more robust pubis and femur however both families also had accessory articulations in which cope termed limiting motion of vertebrae respective to one another amphicoeliidae and amphicoelias were both found to be intermediate and poorly defined by paleontologist othniel charles marsh in 1881 wherein primary feature two mildly concave articular faces was shown to be widespread and also found in sauropods like brontosaurus excelsus previously assigned species amphicoelias latus was named in same description as type species amphicoelias altus it was named for a series of four caudal vertebrae and a femur amnh 5765 in relatively good preservation are bi concave like dorsals of a altus with short centra long prezygapophyses and shallow pleurocoels femur is extremely robust as well as being wide but short front to back femur is long but very end is not fully preserved due to of femur osborn mook in 1921 referred amphicoelias latus to camarasaurus supremus making c supremus valid name for material once called a latus third named amphicoelias species a fragillimus was known only from a single incomplete tall neural arch either last or second to last in series of back vertebrae based only on an illustration published in 1878 this vertebra would have measured tall in life however it has been argued that scale bar in published description contained a typographical error and fossil vertebra was in fact only tall in addition to this vertebra cope s field notes contain an entry for an i distal end of femur located only a few tens of meters away from giant vertebra it is likely that this undescribed leg bone belonged to same individual animal as neural spine but it was never collected or described in 2018 a fragillimus was given its own genus maraapunisaurus and reclassified as a primitive rebbachisaurid left thumb three skeletons informally assigned to a brontodiplodocus in 2010 now labelled as diplodocids in lee kong chian natural history museum singapore in 2010 an article was made available but not formally published by henry galiano and raimund in which they referred to new species a brontodiplodocus to amphicoelias based on several complete specimens found in dana quarry of big horn basin wyoming and held in a private collection specific name referred to their hypothesis based on these specimens that nearly all morrison diplodocid species are either growth stages or represent sexual dimorphism among members of genus amphicoelias but this analysis has been met with skepticism and publication itself has been disclaimed by its lead author explaining that it is obviously a drafted manuscript complete with typos etc and not a final paper in fact no printing or distribution has been attempted osborn and mook in 1921 provisionally synonymized a fragillimus with a altus while sinking a latus into camarasaurus supremus and suggesting also that a fragillimus is just a very large individual of a altus a position that most subsequent studies including mcintosh 1998 foster 2007 and woodruff and foster 2015 have agreed with carpenter 2006 disagreed about synonymy of a altus and a fragillimus however citing numerous differences in construction of vertebra also noted by cope and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for a fragillimus however he went on to caution that validity of a fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without original specimen to study although amphicoelias latus is clearly not amphicoelias it is probably synonymous with camarasaurus grandis rather than c supremus because it was found lower in morrison formation and deeply concave articular faces on caudal vertebrae are more consistent with c grandis classification in 2007 john foster suggested that differences usually cited to differentiate amphicoelias altus from more well known diplodocus are not significant and may be due to individual variation foster argued that amphicoelias is probably senior synonym of diplodocus and that if further research bears this out familiar name diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of amphicoelias as was case with brontosaurus and its senior synonym apatosaurus in 2015 woodruff and foster reiterated this conclusion stating that there is only one species of amphicoelias and that it could be referred to diplodocus as diplodocus altus they considered name amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum this conclusion was disputed by emanuel tschopp et al in 2015 where amphicoelias was analysed as part of an extensive specimen level phylogenetic analysis of diplodocidae there were two strongly supported placements found for amphicoelias as basalmost genus within apatosaurinae and as an apatosaurine nested between brontosaurus excelsus and brontosaurus there were no unambiguous characters found to support an assignment within apatosaurinae so authors instead opted to classify amphicoelias as basalmost diplodocid outside apatosaurinae and diplodocinae having primitive features minimal significant differences from either subfamily a slightly more parsimonious apatosaurine phylogeny but a slightly more diplodocine morphology following cladogram of diplodocidae follows species level agreement tree of tschopp et al 2015 showing a altus as basalmost diplodocid thumb skeletal mount of potentially closely related brontosaurus excelsus holotype ypm 1980 paleoecology in his 2006 re evaluation carpenter examined paleobiology of giant sauropods including amphicoelias and addressed question of why this group attained such a huge size he pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution with very large sized species present as early as late triassic period and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from early origins of group carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores such as elephants and rhinoceros which showed that larger size in plant eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food since larger animals have longer digestive systems food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time allowing large animals to survive on lower quality food sources this is especially true of animals with a large number of fermentation chambers along intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material aiding digestion throughout their evolutionary history sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi arid seasonally dry environments with a corresponding seasonal drop in quality of food during dry season environment of amphicoelias was essentially a savanna similar to arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found supporting idea that poor quality food in an arid environment promotes evolution of giant herbivores carpenter argued that other benefits of large size such as relative immunity from predators lower energy expenditure and longer life span are probably secondary advantages thumb left paleoenvironment restoration of a young diplodocid feeding on ferns morrison formation environment in which amphicoelias lived would have resembled a modern savanna though since grass did not appear until late cretaceous ferns were probably dominant plant and main food source for amphicoelias though engelmann et al 2004 dismissed ferns as a sauropod food source due to their relatively low caloric content carpenter argued that sauropod digestive system well adapted to handle low quality food allows for consumption of ferns as a large part of sauropod diet carpenter also noted that occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate presence of tall trees which would seem to conflict with savanna comparison however trees are rare and since tall trees require more water than savanna environment could generally provide they probably existed in narrow tracts or gallery forests along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate carpenter speculated that giant herbivores like amphicoelias may have used shade of gallery forests to stay cool during day and done most of their feeding on open savanna at night references external links discussion on dinosaur mailing list re re largest dinosaurs category diplodocids category late jurassic dinosaurs of north america category
