to outlying settlements drake p 150 hudson bay territories also known as prince rupert s land were not significantly fought over in this war they had been a scene of much dispute by competing french

french canadian explorer pierre le moyne d iberville had developed a project sur la caroline in aftermath of previous war which called for establishing relationships with indians in mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push english colonists off continent or at least limit them to coastal areas in pursuit of this grand strategy he rediscovered mouth of mississippi

in context of british expansion in nova scotia and also along maine coast where new englanders began moving into abenaki lands often in violation of previous treaties neither abenakis nor mi kmaq were recognized in treaty of utrecht and 1713 portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by new england signatories so mi kmaq and abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands this
