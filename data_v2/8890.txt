battle of porton plantation 8 10 june 1945 took place near village of soraken on bougainville island in solomon islands archipelago during world war ii involving forces from australia new zealand and japan battle was part of wider bougainville campaign which had begun in late 1943 and lasted until end of war in august 1945 battle formed part of australian efforts to liberate northern part of bougainville fighting occurred after a company sized australian force from 31st 51st infantry battalion made an amphibious landing north of porton plantation jetties in an attempt to outflank japanese positions on ratsua front which were holding up advance of 26th and 31st 51st infantry battalions from 11th brigade australians landed unopposed and established a small perimeter but some of their landing craft ran aground and they were unable to bring their heavy weapons and support elements ashore troops from japanese 87th naval garrison force quickly surrounded beachhead and as their supply situation grew desperate australians were forced to withdraw in course of their evacuation by sea another landing craft ran aground over next two days several unsuccessful rescue attempts were made until eventually in early morning of 11 june last australian survivors were picked up battle was a victory for japanese and it proved instrumental in helping them to regain initiative in northern sector of bougainville as a result shortly afterwards australian forces on bougainville changed focus of their operations to southern sector of island where they were able to advance along coastal plain towards main japanese position at buin since end of war there has been considerable criticism of planning undertaken by australians prior to operation and it has been argued that operation failed due to poor intelligence and lack of resources and was ultimately unnecessary background strategic situation japanese forces had landed on bougainville in early 1942 capturing it from small force of australians garrisoning island they had subsequently developed several airbases on island using it to conduct operations in northern solomon islands and to attack allied lines of communication between united states australia and southwest pacific area these bases also helped protect rabaul major japanese garrison and naval base in papua new guinea and throughout 1943 allied planners determined that bougainville was vital for neutralising japanese base around rabaul us marines conducted an amphibious landing at cape torokina on western coast of island north of empress augusta bay in november 1943 after an initial counter attack which had been repulsed us marines had been replaced by a garrison of us army troops who began consolidating their position around torokina establishing a strong perimeter in march 1944 japanese launched a heavy counter attack which was turned back with many casualties after this situation on bougainville became largely static as japanese focused primarily on subsistence and us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining perimeter around torokina thumb upright 0 9 right north west bougainville alt a detailed map showing north western coast line of an island several harbours are depicted along with various locations on 22 november 1944 australian ii corps consisting mainly of militia troops under command of lieutenant general stanley savige took over responsibility for allied operations on bougainville from us xiv corps throughout november and december australian units began relieving americans who were then redeployed on subsequent operations in philippines although japanese forces on bougainville actually numbered around 40 000 men at time allied intelligence failed to determine this accurately estimating that there were only about 17 500 defenders as a result of this error australian planning staff believed that they were opposed by a roughly equal sized force and australian corps commander savige under orders from general thomas blamey commander in chief of australian military forces during war to destroy japanese resistance without committing major forces and limiting casualties consequently decided that he would pursue a limited offensive campaign to clear japanese from bougainville majority of japanese force was believed to be concentrated in south and as a result main effort of australian plan was focused upon driving towards buin supporting operations were also conducted along two other fronts in north it was planned that japanese would be forced into narrow bonis peninsula and contained there while in centre seizure of pearl ridge would give australians control of east west avenues of approach as well as affording them protection against further counter attacks and opening way for a drive to east coast australian troops were largely inexperienced but were according to historian karl james fresh and well equipped for their part according to james japanese force on bougainville had been reinforced from rabaul with troops weapons and equipment and although much of 1944 had been spent foraging and establishing food supplies on island there was only enough food reserves for four months build up of australian forces was hampered by a lack of resources which were focused largely upon us operations in philippines and australian operations in borneo which was considered priority and ultimately these considerations would impact upon australian strategy upon island due to limited amount of amphibious support available after initial moves by australians to take over us perimeter at torokina and garrison outer islands in september and october in november australians took over officially from americans later that month troops from 7th brigade left perimeter and took over from small us forces holding outposts along numa numa trail in centre of island from there a couple of minor skirmishes followed culminating in battle of pearl ridge in late december 11th brigade under command of brigadier john stevenson took over control of northern sector of island from 7th brigade which was transferred to southern sector to take part in main offensive throughout january as part of efforts to liberate northern part of island brigade advanced north along coast from kuraio mission clearing main settlements while sending patrols inland in an effort to flush out japanese from high features in an effort to draw them into fighting in open in mid january lead australian battalion 31st 51st infantry battalion under command of lieutenant colonel joseph kelly came up against a strong japanese position at tsimba ridge and over course of three weeks fought to gain control of feature australians lost 23 killed and 53 wounded while japanese had at least 66 men killed preliminary moves following fighting on tsimba ridge 31st 51st was relieved by 26th infantry battalion and australians continued to advance north towards soraken over course of several months 26th advanced on several axes from downs ridge they crossed nagam river while on coast another element advanced though lalum to compton river between these two forces another linked up with those that had crossed nagam and proceeded north over compton towards soraken plantation elsewhere barges were used to land forces on soraken peninsula in several locations to dislocate japanese forces there and sever their lines of communication while other landings took place on island and torokori island in april 26th was relieved by 55th 53rd infantry battalion which advanced north to ratsua from where australians planned to move along bonis peninsula by late may however casualties amongst 55th 53rd meant that they had to be withdrawn from line and 26th infantry battalion was moved back up to replace them along with 31st 51st at start of june australians were stretched out across a line between ratsua to ruri bay thumb right alt military officers discuss a tactical situation around a map australian commanders on bougainville may 1945 on 4 june 31st 51st infantry battalion began patrolling operations around buoi plantation two companies b and d were committed to these operations with b company focusing upon north eastern part of plantation while d company patrolled to their east clashes followed over next three days australians lost one killed and japanese 10 australian intelligence suggested that japanese had concentrated strongly along approaches to peninsula and in order to deal with these positions it was decided that an amphibious landing would be made by a company of 31st 51st infantry battalion near jetties around porton plantation to north of to outflank them and launch an attack from rear while main force consisting of remainder of 31st 51st and 26th infantry battalion pushed north from ratsua front to establish a new position along a line between porton and during planning phase concerns were raised by several officers about size of force allocated and distance that breakthrough force would be required to advance to link up with force landing at beachhead but these were ultimately discounted on evening of 5 june australian battalion commander outlined his plan and in afternoon of following day rehearsal landings were undertaken final preparations were made on night of 6 7 june and continued throughout next day opposing forces australian landing force consisted of 190 men embarked on six landing craft bulk of force was made up of infantry from a company and a platoon from c company 31st 51st infantry battalion under command of captain clyde downs artillery support was provided by 11th and 12th batteries of 4th field regiment and 2nd mountain battery other supporting units included engineers from 16th field company and 42nd assault landing craft company medical support from 19th field ambulance and logistics support from 223rd supply platoon although aerial reconnaissance indicated that there were strong japanese fortifications in area initially no air support was allocated to operation with requests for preliminary air strikes being denied by ii corps as they were according to james not considered to be suitable air targets japanese force in immediate vicinity initially consisted of about 100 men from imperial japanese navy s 87th naval garrison force which had been formed from men drawn from 211th pioneer unit interspersed with regular naval personnel however over course of battle strength of japanese force grew to between 400 and 500 men japanese force was commanded by senior naval officer at buka captain eikichi kato whose 87th naval garrison force had taken over responsibility for defence of tarlena area when imperial japanese army s 38th independent mixed brigade was transferred south to numa numa area battle initial landing and fighting around beachhead at 3 57 am on 8 june first wave of australian troops landed on beach in three landing craft they came ashore unopposed and after advancing about inland established a small perimeter around beachhead in tree line surrounding plantation a series of forward positions were then established a further inland instead of pushing his rifle platoons further inland however downs decided that he would wait for second wave to arrive this ultimately proved critical as it allowed japanese commander kato time to respond to landing as three landing craft of first wave withdrew another three landing craft came in with reinforcements heavy weapons and other support elements however they ran aground on a coral reef and men aboard were forced to wade ashore although one of these craft was later able to float free two of others remained stuck a short time later they began to take fire from japanese machine guns which stopped australians from unloading their equipment thumb left an aerial photograph showing landing beach and jetty at porton plantation in may 1945 alt an aerial photograph showing

established communications with artillery and a barrage was brought down on suspected japanese positions by artillery forward observation officer lieutenant david spark with assistance of a royal australian air force raaf boomerang that was on station overhead to provide aerial observation by dawn downs company was taking sporadic fire from japanese pill boxes and they began patrolling forward of their perimeter to locate these positions these patrols were unable to progress very far before they were forced back by japanese fire which confirmed how bad company s position was they determined that they had landed about north of where they had been supposed to land and inside what official historian gavin long described as an arc of enemy trenches and pill boxes with a radius of about 400 yards that effectively boxed them in throughout day defenders began pressing against australian forward positions and engaging them with mortar fire as more reinforcements were brought up shortly after landing kato was able to concentrate a force of about 100 japanese defenders in immediate vicinity however throughout day he was able to bring in further reinforcements and by nightfall there were approximately 300 japanese around australian perimeter in order to respond an attempt was made by australians to bring in reinforcements of their own and supplies by sea due to low tide and heavy fire from beach attempt failed as did two subsequent attempts as japanese commander pre empted their arrival and set up ambushes along approaches north and south of landing beach while fighting was going on around porton beginning on 4 june 26th infantry battalion and rest of 31st 51st infantry battalion attempted to break through to australian company from ratsua they were unable to penetrate japanese lines however as they came up against defenders that were determined to resist because they were unable to withdraw any further along peninsula australian evacuation efforts by morning of 9 june supply situation for downs company had become critical and 11th brigade headquarters decided that it would be best to evacuate beach up until that point casualties had been relatively light with only four killed and seven wounded but japanese force which had increased overnight to between 400 and 500 men as reinforcements arrived by barges and trucks from buka passage area launched a strong attack aimed at destroying australian force attacking from three sides of perimeter in order to defend themselves australians called down heavy artillery fire from battery of 25 pounders that was supporting them from its position on soraken peninsula as fighting intensified some of artillery shells were brought down as close as from their own troops air support was also called in with 16 raaf boomerangs and royal new zealand air force corsairs attacking japanese positions around perimeter as a result of these attacks australians were able to hold off japanese attacks until 4 30 pm when three assault landing craft arrived from soraken to take them off beach and ferry them out to two larger vessels that were waiting further out to sea thumb right men from 31st 51st infantry battalion

australians broke contact and made for landing craft bringing wounded out with them embarkation took only five minutes but as vessels attempted to depart two of them overloaded with about 60 men on board ran aground and stuck fast in an effort to lighten load several men volunteered to leave craft which enabled one of vessels to float free other however remained stuck coming under attack from japanese some of whom waded out and attacked men in vessel with grenades casualties mounted with a number of men including downs being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing presumed killed as rations and water dwindled unsuccessful attempts were made on 10 june to rescue men in stranded barge with support from artillery and aircraft while corsairs flew close support missions beaufort and mitchell bombers dropped life rafts but survivors were unable to reach them due to machine gun fire further casualties occurred when in early morning of 11 june a japanese soldier managed to reach vessel and fired upon occupants with a machine gun killing two and wounding others before he was killed himself shortly after this a japanese anti tank gun fired two shells at landing craft destroying its stern further shots were prevented when australian artillery ranged in on gun having been directed by captain john whitelaw an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with canvas assault boats crewed by engineers from 16th field company launching from stranded craft three assault boats set out and over course of two hours ferried survivors back to landing craft which then set out for soraken arriving there at 4 30 am on 11 june other men swam over through shark infested waters to torokori island while others were either rescued at sea or managed to link up with australians along ratsua front who had been attempting to break through to them but found themselves checked from them by sneaking through japanese lines from rear aftermath subsequent operations following failure of landing at porton plantation planned australian advance into bonis peninsula was called off australian high command decided to refocus their efforts upon drive towards buin in south and as a result effort in north was reduced to that of a holding action as further resources were transferred out of sector following withdrawal 31st 51st infantry battalion continued fighting along ratsua front before being relieved on 28 june by 8th infantry battalion and withdrawing to torokina where they remained until end of war 23rd brigade under brigadier arnold potts took over control of sector and for a period of four weeks along ratsua front 8th and 27th infantry battalions carried out patrolling operations before australians decided to withdraw to buoi plantation in mid july by which time japanese forces in area boosted by their victory at porton had begun to seize initiative through use of harassment tactics following this several small scale actions continued along front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 august 1945 as war came to a conclusion analysis left thumb australian wounded are evacuated during battle of porton plantation 12 june 1945 alt wounded men lie on stretchers on deck of a landing craft covered by blankets others are tending wounded since end of war conceptual validity and strategic necessity of australian landing has been called into question by historians both james and davidson state that several aspects of planning undertaken by 11th brigade staff and 31st 51st infantry battalion s commander contributed to defeat particularly in relation to failure of intelligence to adequately identify risks posed by nearby reefs as well as failure to adequately resource operation and an overestimation of ability of neighbouring forces to breakthrough to beachhead charlton also argues that landing was hastily planned under resourced and inadequately supported and that it was part of a strategically unnecessary campaign james agrees that it was under resourced stating that size of assault force was too small to establish a beachhead and push inland as well although ultimately argues that campaign was necessary it has also been speculated that japanese might also have gained prior knowledge of attack in support of this james outlines that in aftermath of fighting blamey visited kelly at his headquarters around ratsua and upon interviewing him stated to ii corps commander savige that he felt that kelly had erred in conducting rehearsals of barge landings during planning stage within view of japanese positions potentially warning them of operation battle of porton plantation ended in defeat for australians as landing was repulsed and japanese remained in possession of beachhead amidst a campaign where largely australians dominated it was only defeat battle represented a shift in momentum in northern sector which was in part due to shift in resources south a fact which continued to impact australian operations in sector until end of war during course of landing and subsequent withdrawal australians suffered 23 killed or missing presumed dead and 106 wounded while japanese lost 26 killed both sides seem to have overestimated casualties that they inflicted with australians believing that they had killed between 147 and 197 japanese and japanese estimating australian losses to have been around 60 killed and 100 wounded commemoration after end of hostilities a reconnaissance party including officers from 31st 51st infantry battalion returned to area and found that japanese defenders had buried australians that had died on beach and had constructed a memorial to them reading australian soldiers buried here died by sea for its part in landing 31st 51st infantry battalion received battle honour of bonis porton as did 26th infantry battalion today this honour is held by both 31st battalion royal queensland regiment and 51st battalion
