menominee county into delta county to end at an intersection with us 2 us 41 east of bark river this extension gave m 69 its current routing in late 1930s state had a general program to abandon some of state highways with a daily traffic level of less than 300 vehicles on july 26 1939 state turned over of m 69 in delta county but delta county road commission immediately filed a protest to block transfer dickinson county road commission had already protested abandonment of of m 69 in that county maps published later that year do not indicate any change in jurisdiction to highway in 1960 section of m 69 east of randville was decommissioned and concurrency with m 95 was removed this truncated highway to approximately one fifth of its previous length transfer to county control was part of a program to reduce total state highway mileage in state after october 5 1970 this section was renamed g 30 with beginning of county designated highway program in michigan at various points road commissions in dickinson menominee and delta counties tried to give roadway back to state for maintenance menominee county made request in 1974 and 1982 both times rejected because road did not carry enough traffic to be a state highway road was a maintenance issue for counties because of its relative isolation and high truck traffic carrying pulpwood to paper mill in escanaba and potatoes from farms near felch roadway was in a relative state of disrepair in 1982 and counties wanted state to fix it menominee county estimated that it would cost 500 000 equivalent to in for their stretch while dickinson estimated that it would cost 1 million equivalent to in for their this county road designation lasted until 1993 that year changes made in 1960 were reversed and m 69 was re extended along m
