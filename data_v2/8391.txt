watched by approximately 1 054 million viewers 60 in 25 54 age demographic higher than both republic of doyle and 18 to life american cable network independent film channel purchased us broadcast rights and began broadcasting it on august 20 2010 in winnipeg free press brad oswald reviewed show cautiously writing it that is decidedly different distinctly weird and definitely an acquired taste kind of great and that some characters and scenes are edgy and uncompromising and sure to shock and offend nearly as many viewers as they amuse in toronto star raju mudhar wrote that humour is classic kids with plenty of visual gags mixed with off colour politically incorrect jokes and that troupe s eye for satire remains sharp as ever john doyle in globe and mail wrote a negative review concluding it was a dismal coda to comedy troupe s outstanding career doyle identified himself as a fan of original kids in hall series but found that this show had excruciatingly awful attempts at humour and no comic rhythm doyle called it appallingly slow witted tv mediocre and maddeningly pointless in times colonist alex strachan provided a qualified positive review writing that it was juvenile sophomoric and deliberately unsophisticated but a joy to watch strachan concludes that death comes to town is easy to dismiss as being lightweight which it is and scattershot which it is there s a genuine joie de vivre at work though death comes to town is silly comedy for smart people home media complete mini series was released on region 1 dvd by alliance home entertainment on august 3 2010 notes
