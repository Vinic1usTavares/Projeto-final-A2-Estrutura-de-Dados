madonna in a glittery top singing by end of 1990 madonna was ready to release her first greatest hits collection immaculate collection according to j randy taraborrelli author of madonna an intimate biography release was much more than a mere collection of madonna s biggest selling and most popular songs singer relegated it as a proud landmark of her career which had progressed upwards since she broke out in music scene in 1983 collection had 15 of madonna s previously released singles along with two new songs justify my love and rescue me former was released as first single from record and was controversial due to its explicit music video which had been banned from airing in television initially there were no plans to release any follow up single to justify my love and so no music video was filmed for rescue me however latter started receiving airplay in radios as an album cut prompting sire records to finally release it as an official single cover artwork featured a still image of

madonna wrote and produced rescue me with shep pettibone with whom she had worked on vogue it was recorded at axis studios in new york city by engineer p dennis mitchell who was assisted by curt frasca and john partham peter schwartz played keyboards and did programming on track with assistance from joe moskowitz and junior vasquez tony shimkin edited song at axis while ted jensen mastered it at sterling sound studio rescue me was mixed by pettibone and goh hotoda at sound works studio in new york mixing was done in qsound which at that time was a new audio filter to create a three dimensional sound effect this was employed on all of madonna s past hits present on immaculate collection rescue me is a dance pop and gospel house track larry flick from billboard described song as a house colored pop dance rave according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by alfred publishing song is composed in key of d major with a moderate tempo of 116 beats per minute it is set in time signature of common time with madonna s vocals ranging from b3 to e5 song follows a sequence of em d e asus4 e a e as its chord progression song opens with a heartbeat and thunder followed by a prominent bass line piano snaps and percussion reminiscent of songs by british synth pop duo yazoo and other 1980s disco acts rescue me has madonna growling lines especially towards end thick arrangement has backing vocals by dian sorel catherine russell and lillies white ending of track has instrumentation fading away to leave just backing vocals and then song ends with sound of thunder and rain lyrically rescue me makes allusions to love rescuing singer author santiago fouz hernandez noted in book madonna s drowned worlds that lines portray second theme prevalent in madonna s work alongside sex that of romantic love singer relegates love as savior in lyrics when she belts i believe in power of love i believe that you can rescue me it references 1967 songs stop her on sight s o s by edwin starr and respect by aretha franklin according to katharine birbalsingh from daily telegraph confessional lyrics found madonna reaching out directly to listener pleading for love and attention needed through lines like you see that i m ferocious you see that i am weak you see that i am silly and pretentious and a freak before it turned to an affirmation of her grit outside of us song was released with madonna s 1987 single spotlight as its b side it was accompanied by eight different remixes by pettibone an extended mix was created called titanic vocal mix alongside a stripped down houseboat vocal mix which used a new beat and instrumentation sound of piano and a sample from madonna s 1986 single true blue lifeboat and s o s mixes incorporate louder and busy beats with former being similar in composition to vogue all of them keep original vocals intact in remix with a dubbed version also being released critical reception larry flick from billboard described madonna s vocals as her most potent to date and pettibone s production stellar flick also commended song s remixes saying pettibone has outdone himself this time creating several new versions that should suit a variety of formats in any mix rescue me proves to be far meatier and long lasting than previous justify my love taraborrelli described track as a standard pulsating dance fare noting it to be opposite of justify my love rikky rooksby found growling vocals by madonna to be ill advised but was positive about ending of track with sound of rain and thunder david browne from entertainment weekly called song as a flimsy vogue rewrite in his review for immaculate collection feeling that it did not break new ground for singer andrew harrison from select relegated song as more usual upfront madonna dance workout with histrionic strings but found it along with justify my love to showcase singer s vulnerability sexual predication and submission all of which gave madonna s records an edge in an album guide for rolling stone track was described as worthy and sensual jose f promis from allmusic reviewed remixes by pettibone and gave a positive review believing them to have held up surprisingly well many years since their release and are good examples of what house pop dance music was like in early 90s a reviewer from sputnikmusic rated song 4 out of 5 finding it similar to justify my love but just not as good it s a shame that this ends album rather than former but that s way it goes i suppose robbie daw from idolator listed rescue me as one of best madonna songs that radio had forgotten noting that track along with justify my love kicked off her early 90s period where she through tracks rather than singing on them eric henderson from slant magazine while reviewing celebration described rescue me as simmering and upside of immaculate collection james rose from daily review noted that with song madonna began a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self exploitation and courageous self expression raunchy videos explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for lady now arguably bearing biggest name in popular music la weeklys michael cooper ranked track at number 14 in his list of madonna s top 20 singles he opined that song heralded singer s future musical endeavors with fifth studio album erotica 1992 and was innovative for its time bridging gap between madonna of 1980s and 1990s chuck arnold from entertainment weekly listed rescue me as madonna s 45th best single writing that if vogue had a gospel choir taking it to church it might sound something like rescue me while ranking madonna s singles in honor of her 60th birthday jude rogers from guardian placed track at number 44 calling it an example of over propulsive early 90s electronica chart performance thumb rescue me was highest debut on billboard hot 100 since beatles let it be debuted at number six in march 1970 alt black and white picture of
