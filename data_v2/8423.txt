development of their onboard weaponry first iowa class ship was laid down in june 1940 in their world war ii configuration each of iowa class battleships had a main battery of guns that could hit targets nearly 20 statute miles 32 km away with a variety of artillery shells designed for anti ship or bombardment work secondary battery of guns could hit targets nearly 9 statute miles 14 km away with solid projectiles or proximity fuzed shells and were equally adept in an anti aircraft role and for damaging smaller ships each of four battleships carried a wide array of 20 mm and 40 mm anti aircraft guns for defense against enemy aircraft when reactivated and modernized in 1980s each battleship retained original battery of nine guns but secondary battery on each battleship was reduced from ten twin gun mounts and twenty guns to six twin gun mounts with 12 guns to allow for installation of two platforms for tomahawk missiles each battleship also received four harpoon missile

as ship sank john asmussen bismarck wreck part 5 aft rudder area accessed 2007 03 25 each turret cost us 1 4 million but this number did not include cost of guns themselves turrets were three gun not triple because each barrel could be elevated and fired independently ship could fire any combination of its guns including a broadside of all nine guns could be elevated from 5deg to 45deg moving at up to 12deg per second turrets could be rotated about 300deg at a rate of about four degrees per second and can even be fired back beyond beam which is sometimes called over shoulder guns were never fired horizontally forward in 1980s refit a satellite up link antenna was mounted at bow to distinguish between rounds fired from different battleships iowa class used dye bags which allowed artillery

interior wall inches from railing marked boundary of barrel s recoil warning crew to keep back thumb right cut away of a gun turret when brought into service during world war ii guns had a barrel life of roughly 290 rounds limited in large part by cellulose nc propellant after world war ii navy switched to smokeless powder spd a cooler burning propellant which increased barrel life from 290 to about 350 rounds this was increased further by introduction of a titanium dioxide and wax compound known as swedish additive on for her tour in vietnam and later used on all four iowas when they were reactivated in 1980s these measures were further augmented by addition of polyurethane jackets which were placed over powder bags to reduce gaseous erosion during firing of guns these measures greatly prolonged barrel life and ultimately resulted in a shift from measuring barrel life in equivalent service rounds esr to measuring barrel life in fatigue equivalent rounds fer after guns were fired each rifle barrel had to be cleaned unlike small caliber guns which can be field stripped guns aboard an iowa class battleship could not be disassembled so gunners mates assigned job of cleaning rifles required a full day or more to ensure that barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned to clean rifles a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into gun barrel where it was pulled through rifle with same equipment used to load shells within turret crewmen checked to ensure that breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated while sailors outside turret scraped off soot

track target s present bearing and range this could be done optically by men inside using sights and rangefinder or electronically with radar fc radar was preferred method present position of target was called line of sight los and it was continuously sent down to mk 8 rangekeeper in plotting room by synchro transmitters also when not using radar s display to determine spots director was optical

technicians fts right thumb mark 8 rangekeeper mk 8 rangekeeper was an electromechanical analog computer whose function was to continuously calculate gun s bearing and elevation line of fire lof to hit a future position of target it did this by automatically receiving information from director los fc radar range ship s gyrocompass true ship s course ship s log ship s speed stable vertical ship s roll and pitch and ship s anemometer relative wind speed and direction also before surface action started fts made manual inputs for average initial velocity of projectiles fired out of battery s gun barrels and air density with all this information rangekeeper calculated relative motion between own ship and target it then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between target s present position los and future position at end of projectile s time of flight to this bearing and range offset it added corrections for gravity wind magnus effect of spinning projectile earth s curvature and coriolis effect result was turret s bearing and elevation orders lof during surface action range and deflection spots and target altitude not zero during gun fire support were manually entered left thumb mark 41 stable vertical mk 41 stable vertical also called gun director was a vertical seeking gyroscope its function was to establish and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane with horizontal plane established mk 41 continuously measured angles between deck and horizontal plane these deck angles were continuously transmitted to rangekeeper so that it could keep guns correctly elevated as ship rolled and pitched mounted waist high on its side were battery s firing keys see picture left key was salvo signal key and it sounded salvo buzzer in each of turrets to warn gun crews that guns were about to fire center key with bumps on its handle for tactile identification was automatic firing key when this key was held closed mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire guns whenever ship s deck was parallel horizontal plane also if sea state was such that turrets elevation power drives could not keep up with ship s motion guns could be held at a fixed elevation and mk 41 could again automatically fire guns as described right key was hand firing key it bypassed mk 41 and fired guns directly mk 13 fc radar supplied present target range and it showed fall of shot around target so gunnery officer could correct system s aim with range and deflection spots put into rangekeeper it could also automatically track target by controlling director s bearing power drive because of radar fire control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during day night or inclement weather this was demonstrated in november 1942 when battleship engaged imperial japanese navy battlecruiser kirishima at a range of at night engagement left kirishima in flames and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew this capability gave united states navy a major advantage in world war ii as japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to level of us navy and were at a significant disadvantage

naval gunfire shells large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16 inch shells an armor piercing round for anti ship and anti structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment a third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently mk 8 apc armor piercing capped shell weighed 2 700 lb 1225 kg and was designed to penetrate hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships at 20 000 yards 18 km mk 8 could penetrate 20 inches 500 mm of steel armor plate william h garzke and robert o dulin jr battleships united states battleships 1935 1992 at same range mk 8 could penetrate 21 feet 6 4 m of reinforced concrete for unarmored targets and shore bombardment 1 900 lb 862 kg mk 13 hc high capacity referring to large bursting charge shell was available mk 13 shell would create a crater 50 feet 15 m wide and 20 feet 6 m deep upon impact and detonation and could defoliate trees 400 yards 360 m from point of impact mk 13 high capacity shells that were made by manufacturers other than naval gun factory received designation mk 14 hc but were otherwise identical final type of ammunition developed for iowa class were katie shells these shells were born from concept of nuclear deterrence that had begun to shape united states armed forces as cold war began to compete with air force and army which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on battlefield us navy began a top secret program to develop mk 23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20 kilotons these shells were designed to be launched from best seaborne artillery platform available which at time were four ships of iowa class shells entered development around 1953 and were reportedly ready by 1956 it is not known whether they were ever deployed on iowa class battleships because us navy does not confirm or deny presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships in 1991 us unilaterally withdrew its nuclear artillery shells from service and russia responded in kind in 1992 us removed around 1 300 nuclear shells from europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2003 secondary battery secondary battery was a dual purpose weapon system it was designed to defend ship from either surface or airborne threats original secondary battery consisted of 10 mark 28 mod 2 twin gun mounts and four mark 37 gun fire control systems at first this battery s effectiveness against aircraft diminished as planes became faster but this changed toward end of world war ii through a combination of an upgrade to mk37 system and development of vt variable time proximity fuze in preparation for reactivations in 1960s and 1980s battery was updated to latest gun and fire control system modifications in 1968 upgrade to uss new jersey for service off vietnam three mark 56 gun fire control systems were installed two on either side just forward of aft stack and one between aft mast and aft mk 38 director tower this increased new jersey s anti aircraft capability because mk 56 system could track and shoot at faster planes in 1980s modernization mk 56 gfcss and four mounts were removed to make room for missiles leaving secondary battery with four mk 37 gfcss and six twin mounts on all iowa class by time of gulf war secondary battery was largely relegated to

pieces each gun in this twin mount had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from upper handling room electric hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to projectile man with nose down and waist high electric hydraulic powder case hoist poked case through a powder scuttle in gun room s deck just next to powder man s feet at load command powder man would slip a primer protector off end of powder case extract case from scuttle and lift it into gun s rammer tray meanwhile projectile man would pull a projectile out of hoist and place it in rammer tray in front of powder case then as he turned to get next projectile out of hoist projectile man would pull down on rammer lever this caused power rammer to ram projectile and powder case into chamber as powder case cleared top of breechblock block would rise to seal chamber gun was ready to fire case combination primer in base of powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion electrical firing was preferred method because firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets or up in director when firing at air targets percussion firing could be executed by pointer man controlling elevation by pushing a foot treadle when gun fired recoil s rearward motion returned rammer lever to up position and rammer would drive back to rear of rammer tray during counter recoil breechblock was automatically lowered and spent powder case was ejected from chamber when gun returned to battery a blast of compressed air was sent down bore to clean it out gun was ready to be reloaded electric hydraulic drives electric hydraulic drives powered mount s motion three modes of drive operation were automatic local and manual in automatic drives would follow bearing and elevation orders of fire control system in local drives would follow motion of trainer s and pointer s hand wheels this is similar to power steering on a car manual was direct gear linkage from hand wheels to move mount with no power assist sights periscopic sights boxes on side of mount allowed trainer and pointer to see target from inside armored enclosure each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to barrel s bore axis these prisms could be controlled by fire control system when mount was in automatic or by mount s sight setter operator when mount was in local local control was not preferred combat method but it could be used if fire control systems were damaged mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting fall of shot upper handling room upper handling room was just below visible part of mount it was armored and reinforced to support weight of mount a person standing in upper handling room could look up and see bottom of gun mount inside training circle on which mount rotated hanging from mount and rotating with it was equipment used to pass ammunition up to mount this included lower ends of projectile and powder case hoists in center of room there was a vertical tube that also turned with mount this tube enclosed electrical power and control cables going up to mount around perimeter of upper handling room were ready service ammunition racks welded to bulkheads close by either in a corner of handling room or in an adjoining compartment was upper end of an ammunition hoist from magazine responsibility of men stationed in upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from ready service racks to hoists while avoiding equipment rotating with mount during quiet spells they would replenish ready service racks with ammunition from magazines mark 37 gun fire control system right thumb mk 37 director c1944 mark 37 gun fire control system gfcs was primary fire control system for secondary battery there were four mk37 gfcss on board one forward above navigation bridge two amidships on either side of forward stack and one aft between aft director and turret three major components of mk 37 gfcs were mk 37 director and equipment in plotting room mark 37 director function of mark 37 director pictured was to track present position of target in bearing elevation and range to do this it had optical sights rectangular windows on front an optical rangefinder tubes sticking out each side and fire control radar antennas on mk 37 director pictured rectangular antenna is for mark 12 fc radar and parabolic antenna on left is for mk 22 fc radar they were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft director officer also had a slew sight that he could use to quickly point director towards a new target plotting room secondary battery plotting rooms were down below waterline and inside armor belt they contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets each set included a mark 1a computer a mark 6 stable element fc radar controls and displays parallax correctors a switchboard and crew to operate it all left thumb mark 1a computer mark 1a fire control computer pictured was an electro mechanical analog ballistic computer its function was to automatically aim guns so that a fired projectile would collide with target this was same function as main battery s mk 8 rangekeeper above except that some of targets mark 1a had to deal with also moved in elevation and much faster for a surface target secondary battery s fire control problem is same as main battery s with same type inputs and outputs major difference between two computers was their ballistics calculations amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5 inch 127 mm shell is different than elevation needed to project a 16 inch shell same distance ballistics calculations in these mechanical analog computers were performed by mechanisms like differential gears levers and small rods riding on surface of three dimensional cams these mechanical adders multipliers and table lookup devices were handmade at factory and were buried deep in workings of computer it was not possible to change a computer s ballistics at sea until advent of fast digital computers anti aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had additional requirement of tracking target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions outputs of mk 1a were same gun bearing and elevation except fuze time was added fuze time was needed because ideal of directly hitting fast moving aircraft with projectile was impractical with fuze time set into shell it was hoped that it would explode near enough to target to destroy it with shock wave and shrapnel towards end of world war ii invention of vt proximity fuze eliminated need to use fuze time calculation and its possible error this greatly increased odds of destroying an air target right thumb mark 6 stable element function of mk 6 stable element pictured in this fire control system was same as function of mk 41 stable vertical in main battery system above it was a vertical seeking gyroscope that supplied system with a stable up direction on a rolling and pitching ship in surface mode it replaced director s elevation signal it also had surface mode firing keys fire control radar used on mk 37 gfcs has evolved in 1930s mk 37 director did not have a radar antenna then in september 1941 naval weapons of ww2 campbell p111 rectangular mk 4 fire control radar antenna was mounted on top soon aircraft flew faster and in c1944 to increase speed and accuracy mk 4 was replaced by a combination of mk 12

above bridge anti aircraft batteries thumb left an oerlikon 20 mm anti aircraft gun aboard battleship since they were designed to escort us fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers iowa class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti aircraft guns to protect us aircraft carriers from japanese fighters and dive bombers this array included up to 20 quad 40 mm mounts and 49 single 20 mm mounts in 1968 uss new jersey re activation for service off vietnam 20 mm and 40 mm batteries were removed in 1980s re activation all ships with 20 mm and 40 mm batteries had them removed and four phalanx ciws mounts were added to all oerlikon 20 mm anti aircraft guns oerlikon 20 mm anti aircraft gun was one of most heavily produced anti aircraft guns of second world war us

aircraft weapon of united states navy until introduction of 40 mm bofors aa gun in 1943 these guns were air cooled and used a gas blowback recoil system unlike other automatic guns employed during world war ii barrel of 20 mm oerlikon gun did not recoil breechblock never locked against breech and actually moved forward when gun fired this weapon lacked a counter recoil brake as force of counter recoil was checked by explosion of next round of ammunition thumb right bofors 40 mm anti aircraft guns on a mk 12 quadruple mount fire from deck of in world war ii between december 1941 and september 1944 32 of all japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon with high point being 48 3 for second half of 1942 in 1943 revolutionary mark 14 gun sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective however 20 mm guns were found to be ineffective against japanese kamikaze attacks used during latter half of world war ii they were subsequently phased out in favor of heavier 40 mm bofors aa guns bofors 40 mm anti aircraft guns left thumb mark 51 director with mark 14 40 mm gun sight arguably best light anti aircraft weapon of world war ii bofors 40 mm anti aircraft gun was used on almost every major warship in us and uk fleet during world war ii from about 1943 to 1945 although a descendant of german and swedish designs bofors mounts used by us navy during world war ii had been heavily americanized to bring guns up to standards placed on them by us navy this resulted in a guns system set to english standards now known as standard system with interchangeable ammunition which simplified logistics situation for world war ii when coupled with electric hydraulic drives for greater speed and mark 51 director pictured for improved accuracy bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary accounting for roughly half of all japanese aircraft shot down between 1 october 1944 and 1 february 1945 when iowa class battleships were launched in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad bofors 40 mm gun mounts which they used for defense against enemy aircraft these heavy guns were also employed in protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in pacific theater of world war ii these guns remained on battleships iowa missouri and wisconsin from time they were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in 1980s uss new jersey had her 40 mm guns removed in 1968 when she was called into action for vietnam war dictionary of american naval fighting ships new jersey retrieved 30 march 2007 as each battleship arrived for modernization during

universe designed in early 1970s by general dynamics and currently produced by raytheon phalanx ciws mount utilizes a 20 mm m61 vulcan gatling gun to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft that manage to escape anti missile and anti aircraft missiles fired from friendly ships phalanx guns worked by using a search radar and a tracking radar to follow targets that approached within 1 to when a target was within this range ciws mount moved to track target while simultaneously evaluating target against several preset criteria to determine next course of action depending on whether target criteria were met phalanx mount automatically engaged incoming target if it was judged to be hostile in nature or system recommended that phalanx operator engage target phalanx ciws mounts were used by missouri and wisconsin during 1991 gulf war wisconsin alone fired 5 200 20 mm phalanx ciws rounds missouri also received phalanx fire during a friendly fire incident in which guided missile frigate mistook chaff fired by missouri for a legitimate target and shot at missouri rounds from this attack struck ship in bulkhead above famed surrender deck and bounced off armor one round penetrated forward funnel and passed completely through it and another round penetrated a bulkhead and embedded in an interior passageway of ship missiles during modernization in 1980s three important weapons

class ships when added to battleships in 1980s tomahawk became longest ranged weapon carried by battleships maximum range for tomahawk land attack missile is maximum range for harpoon was iowa class missile battery battleship org retrieved on 2007 03 25 and maximum range for guns was uss missouri bb 63 faq factplace com retrieved on 2007 03 25 owing to original 1938 design of battleships tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to iowa class unless battleships were physically rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch tomahawks this realization prompted removal of anti aircraft guns previously installed on iowas and removal of four of each of battleships ten 5 38 dp mounts mid and aft end of battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate missile magazines this resulted in construction of two separate platforms one located between first and second funnel and one located behind second funnel to which mk 143 armored box launcher abl canisters could be attached each armored box launcher carried four missiles and each of battleships was outfitted with eight canisters enabling iowa class to carry and fire a total of 32 tomahawk
