is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem city supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team and label unexpected results typical city archive

manchester city s biggest rivalry is with neighbours manchester united against whom they contest manchester derby before second world war when travel to away games was rare many mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves supporters of only one this practice continued into early 1960s but as travel became easier and cost of entry to matches rose watching both teams became unusual and rivalry intensified a common stereotype is that city fans come from manchester proper while united fans come from elsewhere a 2002 report by a researcher at manchester metropolitan university found that while it was true that a higher proportion of city season ticket holders came from manchester postcode areas 40 compared to united s 29 there were more united season ticket holders lower percentage being due to united s higher overall number of season ticket holders 27 667 compared to city s 16 481 report noted that since compiling of data in 2001 number of both city and united season ticket holders had risen expansion of united s ground and city s move to city of manchester stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further man city also has a very notable rivalry with that of liverpool f c in late 1980s city fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches primarily oversized bananas one disputed explanation for craze is that in a match against west bromwich albion chants from fans calling for introduction of imre as a substitute mutated into imre banana terraces packed with inflatable waving supporters became a frequent sight in 1988 89 season as craze spread to other clubs inflatable fish were seen at grimsby town with phenomenon reaching a peak at city s match at stoke city on 26 december 1988 a match declared by
