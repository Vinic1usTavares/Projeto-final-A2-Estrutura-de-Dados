trout creek hill is a small pleistocene basaltic shield volcano in washington united states located in skamania county trout creek hill rises to an elevation of it is part of cascade volcanic arc located in marble mountain trout creek hill volcanic field trout creek hill produced a lava flow about 340 000 years ago that traveled southeast which dammed columbia river for a short period of time a shield volcano it has two cinder cones atop it nearby area is forested and hosts wind river experimental forest and it can be hiked geography and access located in skamania county in washington state in united states trout creek hill rises to an elevation of it is also known as trout hill and was registered with united states geographic names information system in 1979 region has a rugged topography carved by glaciers and cirques which have created glacial valleys trout creek hill and rest of marble mountain trout creek hill field can be accessed by roads in gifford pinchot national forest and mount st helens national volcanic monument washington route 503 and forest service route 90 lie to east of woodland to reach trout creek hill visitors should travel north on wind river highway and follow forest service road 54 ecology thumb left douglas squirrel can be frequently seen in forested area around trout creek hill area around trout creek hill contains wind river experimental forest which contains western hemlock douglas fir and pacific silver fir known as cradle of forest research in pacific northwest wind river forest represents a center for ecological research it lies east of vancouver washington and it is administered by united states forest service pacific northwest research station and gifford pinchot national forest forest encloses ponds streams and wetland marshes with other conifers present including grand firs noble firs and pacific yews western red cedars as well as other tree species consisting of bigleaf maples black cottonwoods pacific and red alders smaller plants include shrubs in understory such as big huckleberry oregon grape pacific rhododendron red huckleberry salal and vine maple other forest floor plants include prince s pine trillium and vanilla leaf with beargrass and huckleberry at higher elevations as far as animal life forest visitors often see douglas squirrels though nine species of bats three shrew species three vole species one species of flying squirrel and townsend s chipmunks can also be seen less frequently black tailed deer and elk are often hunted by predator species predators in forest area consist of american black bears bobcats cougars coyotes martens and weasels bird species include brown creepers dark eyed juncos goshawks hairy woodpeckers northern spotted owls which are a threatened species pileated woodpeckers red breasted nuthatches and winter wrens in trout and panther creeks rainbow trout are residents throughout year as are summer and winter steelhead only anadromous migratory fish in streams eastern brook trout only inhabit trout creek geology thumb right 400px juan de fuca tectonic plate is being subducted under north american plate leading to volcanic activity in cascades like at trout creek hill in southern washington state cascade range sits south of dacitic volcanic belt running from mount garibaldi to lassen peak which spans from british columbia in canada to northern california in united states volcanoes in range have been produced by subduction of juan de fuca tectonic plate under north american plate washington cascades consist of cenozoic era volcanic and intrusive rocks and they can be divided into two segments based on age and rock type western cascades formed between 50 and 5 million years ago and high cascades produced within past 5 million years whereas high cascades have largely been unaffected by geological deformation processes western cascades are more folded and faulted in wind river area cascades sit atop cenozoic era lava flows and volcaniclastic deposits which have a calc alkaline composition divided into ohanapecosh formation eagle creek formation yakima basalt and quaternary basalt flows they show variable thickness and cascade arc formed during oligocene epoch and by late miocene epoch there was a low but broad gap between washington segment of arc and cascade volcanoes in oregon activity picked up during quaternary period in washington as andesitic stratovolcanoes and small olivine basalt cinder cones and shield volcanoes erupted before pleistocene uplift and erosion was widespread which was followed by eruptions from northeastern part of wind river area during early pleistocene like red mountain a shield volcano with cinder cones trout creek hill formed west of wind river area rocks in wind river area have not been altered significantly by orogenic movement large structural deformation of earth s crust and uppermost mantle due to interaction between plate tectonics there are a number of faults but they show relatively little displacement western slope of wind river valley is shaped like a fault scarp and it seems to be aligned with trout creek hill suggesting a potential fault line there that trends to northwest however six or seven emplaced lava flow deposits in area only show small amounts of alteration to west of valley and they show no alteration to east moreover there are only three significantly altered deposits along bear creek trout creek hill lies in quaternary marble mountain trout creek hill volcanic field in southern washington state formed by small basaltic and basaltic andesite shield volcanoes and cinder cones this field runs from marble mountain to area to south of trout creek hill located south of mount st helens it extends for and has a width of it consists of mostly monogenetic scoria cones each of which produced three or four lava flows there are at least 22 cones and all volcanic landforms older than 12 000 years have been glaciated oldest soda peaks basalt lava flows dated to 0 36 million years old trout creek is a shield volcano small in size it is topped by two nearby cinder cones that produced dark gray olivine basalt lava flows with olivine inclusions hornblende andesite can also be found northwest of trout creek hill volcano near west crater eruptive history trout creek hill erupted approximately 340 000 years ago during pleistocene producing a lava flow that extended to southeast and temporarily dammed columbia river this eruption produced high alumina olivine basalt which make up shield volcano and possess a dark gray color lava flows from two cinder cones on trout creek hill did not move far to west from their source vents instead moving to southeast down wind river valley into columbia river and around bunker hill within wind river valley these deposits reach depths of more than at bear creek panther creek and wind river junction shorter flows that extended to west likely exceed thicknesses of with lengths of other lava flows from trout creek hill are also embedded with till from salmon springs and fraser glaciation but their exact age is unknown basaltic lavas from trout creek hill show a lithology of pahoehoe to blocky olivine with pyroxene breccia scoria and cinder deposits within marble mountain trout creek hill field there have been three eruptions during holocene epoch at west crater another cone near hackamore creek and a phreatic vent producing steam and rock fragments near bare mountain these all took place about 8 000 years ago west crater eruption generated an andesitic lava dome and lava flow while bare mountain vent formed a large explosion crater at bare mountain recreation while overnight facilities at wind river forest can only be used by researchers there is camping permitted at panther creek and beaver campgrounds on gifford pinchot national forest area their popularity means that reservations are often necessary motels are also available in carson and stevenson as are restaurants pacific crest national scenic trail 2000 can be hiked moving through trout creek division of wind river forest whistle punk trail 59 runs for through young forest area near experimental forest with a short span of old growth forest it offers views of logging artifacts and an old railroad sedum point located along part of pacific crest trail
