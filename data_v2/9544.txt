thursday and wanted frank loesser to compose a musical based on it when loesser proved unavailable feuer and martin succeeded in interesting rodgers and hammerstein in project as hammerstein adapted sweet thursday he and rodgers had concerns about featuring a prostitute as female lead and setting part of musical in a bordello they signed operatic diva helen traubel to play fauna house madam as show progressed through tryouts hammerstein repeatedly revised it obscuring suzy s profession and nature of fauna s house pipe dream met with poor reviews and rapidly closed once it exhausted its advance sale it had no national tour or london production and has rarely been presented since no movie version of show was made rodgers hammerstein organization which licenses their works once hoped for a film version featuring muppets with fauna played by miss piggy inception thumb left cy feuer following world war ii cy feuer and ernie martin started producing musicals together feuer was former head of music department at low budget republic pictures martin was a television executive having secured rights to farce charley s aunt they produced it as musical comedy where s charley with a score by frank loesser among backers of where s charley were rodgers and hammerstein which helped secure additional investment show was a hit and helped establish feuer and martin on broadway they went on to produce guys and dolls in aftermath of guys and success feuer and martin were interested in adapting john steinbeck s 1945 novel cannery row into a musical they felt that some of characters such as marine biologist doc would work well in a musical but that many of other characters would not steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to cannery row that would feature characters attractive to feuer and martin based on suggestions for story line by feuer and martin steinbeck began to write sweet thursday cannery row is set in monterey california before world war ii in sweet thursday doc

arm as he sleeps bringing two lovers back together at end doc and suzy go off to la jolla to collect marine specimens together originally feuer martin and steinbeck intended work to be composed by loesser but he was busy with a project which eventually became most happy fella with loesser s refusal feuer and martin approached rodgers and hammerstein with their project then titled bear flag cafe from beginning prudish hammerstein was uncomfortable with setting telling feuer we do family shows however hammerstein found himself attracted to characters doc and suzy were culturally mismatched but drawn to each other with doc rather moody and suzy somewhat intense similar pairings had led to success not only in pair s carousel and south pacific but in hammerstein s work before his collaboration with rodgers such as desert song and rose marie during early 1953 steinbeck sent hammerstein early drafts of novel rodgers was also concerned about idea of having a prostitute be female lead but eventually gave in two agreed to write and produce adaptation as they worked with steinbeck rodgers and hammerstein though renowned for such hits as oklahoma carousel and south pacific suffered a relative failure with 1953 musical me and juliet a tale of romance among cast and stagehands backstage at a musical before agreeing to do sweet thursday project duo had considered other projects for their next work together such as an adaptation of film saratoga trunk a proposal made by attorney david merrick to adapt a series of works by marcel pagnol to which merrick held stage rights fell through when duo were not willing to have merrick be an associate producer merrick took project elsewhere and it was developed into hit fanny afterwards hammerstein stated why hell did we give up fanny what on earth were we trying to prove my god that s a great story and look at some of junk we ve done writing and casting thumb upright left alt photo of a bearded aging man in half profile john steinbeck steinbeck continued to write in late 1953 while hammerstein and rodgers went to london to produce west end production of king and i as hammerstein received new material from steinbeck he and rodgers began to map out musical conceiving scenes and deciding where songs should be placed on january 1 1954 following completion of steinbeck s novel hammerstein began to write dialogue and lyrics sweet thursday was published in early 1954 to mixed reviews steinbeck later commented some of critics are so concerned for my literary position that they can t read a book of mine without worrying where it will fit in my place in history who gives a damn by that time rodgers and hammerstein were busy producing film version of oklahoma for part of bordello keeper fauna duo fixed on famous diva helen traubel there was precedent for such casting former opera star ezio had starred as suave frenchman emile de in south pacific and had received rave reviews for his performance traubel in addition to being well known for her wagnerian roles was also noted for her nightclub singing in 1953 new metropolitan opera impresario rudolf bing feeling that she was lowering tone of house declined to renew her contract hammerstein had seen traubel at her first appearance at copacabana nightclub in new york and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to traubel that she would be coming straight to broadway he saw her show again in las vegas several months later and offered her part when offered role traubel eagerly accepted though she later noted that she had never represented herself as much of an actress from beginning of project feuer and martin wanted henry fonda to play doc actor put in months of lessons in an attempt to bring his voice up to standard fonda later stated that at end of six months of singing lessons he still couldn t sing for shit following his first audition for rodgers fonda asked composer for his honest view and rodgers stated i m sorry it would be a mistake cy feuer remembered duo eventually settled for william johnson who had played male lead in a touring company of annie get your gun which they had produced to play role of doc there are conflicting accounts of who was first choice for role of itinerant prostitute suzy by some accounts rodgers and hammerstein attempted to get julie andrews only to find that she had just signed a two year contract to appear in a musical by alan jay lerner and frederick loewe tentatively titled my lady liza andrews s role as eliza doolittle in my fair lady would launch her to stardom another candidate was janet leigh whom rodgers admired greatly but actress proved to be unavailable producers settled on judy tyler auditioned after rodgers spotted her on television while watching howdy doody show in which she appeared as princess to direct play duo engaged harold clurman noted for his work in drama and one of founders of group theatre jo mielziner veteran of several rodgers and hammerstein productions was stage designer in contrast to complex staging of me and juliet mielziner s sets were uncomplicated a system of house frame outlines in front of backdrops representing monterey boris runanin was choreographer robert russell bennett provided orchestrations and salvatore dell isola conducted two producers had hoped to hire prestigious majestic theatre where south pacific had run but writing process took too long and majestic was lost to fanny instead they booked shubert theatre in top rank of broadway theatres but not as prestigious as majestic uniquely for their joint work they solicited no backers but underwrote entire cost themselves feuer later said of bargain he and martin had made with rodgers and hammerstein and deal was pretty good 50 percent of producers end and we thought we re rich and we turned it over to them and they destroyed it rehearsals and tryouts thumb upright left alt photo of hammerstein in middle age seated wearing a suit oscar hammerstein ii when rehearsals opened in september 1955 rodgers assembled cast and told them that he was going into hospital for a minor operation in fact rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of jawbone he spent weekend before operation writing one final song for pipe dream surgery required removal of part of jawbone and tongue and some of lymph nodes operation took place on september 21 1955 within ten days of operation he was back in theatre watching rehearsals though for some time only as a spectator after rehearsals began steinbeck wrote to hammerstein to express his delight at adaptation he became more dismayed as play was slowly revised in rehearsal and during tryouts according to traubel play was being cleaned up as scene after scene became emasculated revisions made suzy s profession less clear and also fudged nature of fauna s house one revision removed suzy s police record for vagrancy these changes were sparked by fact that audience members at tryouts in new haven and boston were uncomfortable with setting and suzy s role by time revisions were completed script could be read to say that suzy was merely boarding at fauna s steinbeck noted this tendency on a page of dialogue changes in another memo steinbeck noted that pathos of suzy being a prostitute had given much of dramatic tension to scene in which doc rejects suzy and later her rejection of him i think if you will finally bring theme of this play into open but wide open you will have solved its great weakness and have raised it to a high level if this is not done i can neither believe nor take pipe dream seriously in end suzy s activities at bear flag were glossed over as hammerstein concentrated on her relationship with doc alluding to hammerstein s emphasis on scene in which suzy makes doc soup

that gallon of good red wine john mcclain of journal american stated this is a far cry from exalted talents of team that produced south pacific they must be human after all steven suskin in his book

of rodgers and hammerstein pipe dream cost them a fortune rodgers later stated it was only one of their works he truly disliked that if you start with a bad idea everything is marred by that we
