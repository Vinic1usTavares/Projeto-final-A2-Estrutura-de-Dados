voluntary human extinction movement vhemt is an environmental movement that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause gradual voluntary extinction of humankind vhemt supports human extinction primarily because in group s view it would prevent environmental degradation group states that a decrease in human population would prevent a significant amount of human caused suffering extinctions of non human species and scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by group as evidence of harm caused by human overpopulation vhemt was founded in 1991 by les u knight an american activist who became involved in environmental movement in 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was best solution to problems facing earth s biosphere and humanity knight publishes group s newsletter and serves as its spokesman although group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme though other writers have applauded vhemt s perspective in response to vhemt some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels others maintain that whatever merits of idea human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction history voluntary human extinction movement was founded by les u knight a high school substitute teacher living in portland oregon after becoming involved in environmental movement as a college student in 1970s knight attributed most of dangers faced by planet to human overpopulation he joined zero population growth organization and chose to be at age 25 he later concluded that extinction of humanity would be best solution to earth s environmental problems he believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history thumbnail voluntary human extinction movement cartoon by nina paley in 1991 knight began publishing vhemt s newsletter known as these exit times in newsletter he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating vhemt has also published cartoons including a comic strip titled bonobo baby featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a bonobo in 1996 knight created a website for vhemt it was available in 11 languages by 2010 vhemt s logo features letter v for voluntary and a picture of earth with north at bottom organization and promotion vhemt functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization and does not compile a list of members daniel metz of willamette university stated in 1995 that vhemt s mailing list had just under 400 subscribers six years later fox news said list had only 230 subscribers knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of movement and that this includes millions of people knight serves as spokesman for vhemt he attends environmental conferences and events where he publicizes information about population growth vhemt s message has however primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets rather than events and its newsletter vhemt sells buttons and t shirts as well as bumper stickers that read thank you for not breeding in 2018 a supporter of movement appeared on popular youtube channel in a video called chatting with a supporter of voluntary human extinction movement ideology knight argues that human population is far greater than earth can handle and that best thing for earth s biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing he says that humans are incompatible with biosphere and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about extinction of humans as well as other organisms according to knight vast majority of human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to earth and many of its non human organisms voluntary human extinction is promoted on grounds that it will prevent human suffering and extinction of other species knight points out that many species are threatened by increasing human population james ormrod a psychologist who profiled group in journal psychoanalysis culture society notes that most fundamental belief of vhemt is that human beings should stop reproducing and that some people consider themselves members of group but do not actually support human extinction knight however believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves residents of first world countries bear most responsibility to change according to knight as they consume largest proportion of resources knight believes that earth s non human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments such as art plays of shakespeare and work of einstein can t hold a candle to a tiger he argues that species higher in food chain are less important than lower species his ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology and he sometimes refers to earth as gaia he notes that human extinction is unavoidable and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing extinction of other animals potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit knight sees abstinence from reproduction as an altruistic choice a way to prevent involuntary human suffering and cites deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering knight claims that non reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to garden of eden and maintains that last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include end of abortion war and starvation knight argues that procreation today is de facto child abuse he maintains that standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues he speculates that if people ceased to reproduce they would use their energy for other pursuits and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children vhemt rejects government mandated human population control programs in favor of voluntary population reduction supporting only use of birth control and willpower to prevent pregnancies knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower human population citing fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars famines and viruses though their newsletter s name recalls suicide manual final exit idea of mass suicide is rejected and they have adopted slogan may we live long and die out a 1995 survey of vhemt members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect earth distrusted ability of political processes to prevent harm to environment and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause vhemt members who strongly believed that civilization is headed for collapse were most likely to embrace these views however vhemt does not take any overt political stances vhemt promotes a more extreme ideology than population action international a group that argues humanity should reduce but not eliminate its population to care for earth however vhemt platform is more moderate and serious than church of euthanasia which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism 1995 survey found that 36 considered themselves members of earth first or had donated to group in previous five years reception knight states his group s ideology runs counter to contemporary society s he believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting or even discussing population control he admits that his group is unlikely to succeed but contends that attempting to reduce earth s population is only moral option reception of knight s idea in mainstream media has been mixed writing in san francisco chronicle gregory states that there is an undeniable logic to vhemt s arguments but he doubts whether knight s ideas can succeed arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded stephen jarvis echoes this skepticism in independent noting that vhemt faces great difficulty owing to basic human reproductive drive at guardians website guy applauds movement s aim as in many ways laudable but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction freelance writer abby o reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success vhemt s goal is difficult to attain knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural human desire for children is a product of enculturation roman catholic archdiocese of new york has criticized knight s platform arguing that existence of humanity is divinely ordained ormrod claims that knight arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy he notes that knight s claim that last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on benefits accruing to humans ormrod sees this type of argument as counter intuitive arguing that it borrows language of late modern consumer societies he faults knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology economist characterizes knight s claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as malthusian bosh paper further states that compassion for planet does not necessarily require pursuit of human extinction sociologist frank furedi also deems vhemt to be a malthusian group classifying them as a type of environmental organization that thinks worst about human species writing in spiked josie appleton argues that group is indifferent to humanity rather than anti human brian bethune writes in maclean s that knight s logic is as absurd as it s unassailable however he doubts knight s claim that last survivors of human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a collective loss of will to live would prevail in response to knight s platform journalist sheldon richman argues that humans are active agents and can change their behavior he contends that people are capable of solving problems facing earth alan weisman author of world without us suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction katharine of salon com recommends that childless people adopt vhemt s arguments when facing probing questions about their childlessness writing in journal for critical animal studies carmen dell aversano notes that vhemt seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress she casts movement as a form of queer oppositional politics because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation she argues that movement seeks to come to a new definition of civil order as lee edelman suggested that queer theory should dell aversano believes that vhemt fulfills edelman s mandate because they embody death drive rather than ideas that focus on reproduction of past although knight s organization has been featured in a book titled kooks a guide to outer limits of human belief guardian journalist oliver notes that in a phone conversation knight seems rather sane and self deprecating weisman echoes this sentiment characterizing knight as thoughtful soft spoken articulate and quite serious philosophers steven best and douglas kellner view vhemt s stance as extreme but they note that movement formed in response to extreme stances found in modern humanism see also anti environmentalism antinatalism carrying capacity david benatar an advocate of
