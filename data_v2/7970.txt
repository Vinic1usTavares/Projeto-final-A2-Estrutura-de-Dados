hey venus is eighth album by welsh band super furry animals it was released on 27 august 2007 in united kingdom hey venus is band s first full length release on current label rough trade records and at just over 36 minutes is also their shortest running studio release title is taken from first line of song into night album was conceived as a rowdy pop record both in response to rough trade s request for one of those pop records like you used to make and as a result of very different atmosphere band encountered at shows on love kraft tour when slow songs from that album were played in contrast with many super furry animals albums no samplers were used during recording of hey venus as group made a conscious decision to create a simple record which capture d spirit of band playing live in a room dave newfeld took over production duties from mario caldato jr who had worked on both phantom power and love kraft as band didn t want to repeat their past two records as with love kraft all members of band contributed songs at recording stage but besides chief songwriter gruff rhys only guitarist huw bunford battersea odyssey and keyboard player cian ciaran carbon dating ended up with their tracks on finished album album follows life and adventures of a character called venus as she moves from a small town to a big metropolis band have given several explanations for appearance of this narrative arc in record claiming variously that hey venus was conceived as a concept album that similar themes in songs were only noticed after they had been written and were used as a way of structuring and compiling album and that venus concept was thought up after album s completion in order to give sleeve designer keiichi tanaami a reference point to make an illustration from after working with pete fowler since 1997 s radiator band asked tanaami to produce artwork for hey venus having been blown away by his work on a japanese tour critical response was generally positive with some reviews claiming hey venus is band s most satisfying work and exhibits a full fledged return to pop power some critics however pointed out that album has faint whiff of musical conservatism and must rank as super furry animals least adventurous record background in an interview with tiny mix tapes in january 2008 band s vocalist gruff rhys stated that hey venus was deliberately conceived as a pop record following a request from band s new record label rough trade rhys has also stated that after love kraft band were kind of thinking of making a loud record following very different atmosphere at initial shows on love kraft tour when group played slow songs from that album towards end of tour setlist had become full of fast songs from super furry animals back catalogue and this had an effect as band entered into studio for hey venus sessions it s definitely first time our audience has influenced our music in that sense rhys used his second solo album as an outlet for quiet acoustic songs that he had written rather than put them forward for inclusion on hey venus recording majority of album was recorded at miraval studios france picked at keyboardist cian ciaran s request because of its large live room which enabled all band to set up and play as a group super furries wanted to go somewhere new and have a cultural experience while they recorded what is their eighth album together recording in france also enabled band to get away from distractions such as clean ing house additional recording took place at rockfield studios monmouth while string instruments were recorded at metropolis studios london after working with producer mario caldato jr on their previous albums phantom power and love kraft band were looking for someone new to work with as they didn t want to repeat these records they chose dave newfeld to produce hey venus after hearing his work with canadian indie rock supergroup broken social scene rhys has praised newfeld for his knowledge of pop and what makes people react stating that most of time he just stood there by desk and wouldn t accept a take until he was physically moved by it as with love kraft rhys was not sole writer guitarist huw bunford wrote battersea odyssey inspired by battersea power station while keyboard player cian ciaran wrote carbon dating other members of band contributed songs that do not appear on hey venus but might end up on next record newfeld also encouraged group to improvise songs two of which semi pro and hot nutz appear briefly on footage of recording process streamed at band s website and included with american editions of album rhys claimed these tracks along with 32 other improvised songs recorded during hey venus sessions would probably never be released but give a glimpse into magic of super furry animals in studio and kind of atmosphere that dave created however hot nutz was reworked as moped eyes for their next album dark days light years some of songs recorded barely resemble their earlier demo versions including baby ate my eightball which originally had this sort of miami based rhythm with babies crying and glasses smashing and was very abrasive finished track which features huw bunford impersonating a police or ambulance siren with backing vocals was mixed three or four times and barely resembles original 200px right thumb huw bunford performing with super furry animals at great american music hall san francisco california on 9 february 2008 in support of hey venus hey venus reflected group s desire to capture spirit of band playing live in a room album was recorded very quickly and as band did not feel need to experiment so much with such a simple record is not particularly sonically adventurous in gruff rhys s words hey venus is a straight up album of songs with key changes and a live band playing them with more emphasis on songs than arrangement according to rhys nobody brought samplers into studio so there s far less electronics than on a lot of our records a lot of electronic music is quite a solitary pursuit you sit at your computer or sampler and sometimes it s more of an individual kind of thing whereas with this record we were trying to play as a band a five people at once kind of record along with bass drums and guitar several other instruments were used during recording including a dulcimer for its sixties spy movie sound an electric saz on into night an electric sitar box like a drum machine for indian musicians and a harpsichord which according to guto pryce was used on a lot of songs because it was there miraval studios and it was more in tune than pianos latter had a strong influence on album with rhys stating when we found harpsichord everything started to go 1960s and we kind of followed that feeling although gruff rhys had initially told fans to expect a speaker blowing lp addition of instruments such as harpsichord meant this was not case album instead highlights band s musical sweet tooth band enlisted help of several musicians when making album including string arranger sean o hagan of high llamas percussionist kris jenkins and others who group have built up relationships with over years brass players we ve toured with a lot sean o hagan brought his string section in they ve played on almost all our records sixteen songs were recorded for album with only 11 making final cut band made a conscious decision to keep number of tracks and therefore running time of hey venus down because last three albums have been almost an hour long at just over 36 minutes album is shortest full length release by band some of songs left off record were really heavy and raw as a result of which gruff rhys feels hey venus is more consistent with our back catalogue both lead single show your hand and suckers were originally cut from album for being too generic and too obvious melodically respectively until band were persuaded to reconsider rough trade records boss geoff travis told group that show your hand was his favourite song and following tracks reworking to include a french horn part it was reinstated similarly suckers was really pushed by producer dave newfeld until it too took its place on hey venus album was mixed by chris shaw and super furry animals at rockfield studios and band s own studio pleasurefoxxx in cardiff with dave newfeld performing additional mixing duties on suckers mastering was undertaken by greg calbi at sterling sound new york rhys has claimed to be particularly pleased with into night which was kind of where my head was at which is quite a ridiculous place to be and carbon dating probably most beautiful song on record while huw bunford has described album as one of best records we ve ever made themes album documents life and adventures of a character called venus as she moves from a small town to a big metropolis band have been consistent when describing this central story of running away from relationships breaking up in a small town moving to big city losing yourself having your innocence completely corrupted and living to tell tale as a wiser person however several conflicting explanations have been given for appearance of this narrative arc chief songwriter gruff rhys has claimed that hey venus was conceived as a concept album however both drummer dafydd ieuan and rhys himself have contradicted this statement ieuan stating that although there are a number of crossovers between songs similarities are more because all songs were written during a certain period of time while rhys claimed in an interview with chicago sun times that he only noticed similar themes running through songs after he had written them a third explanation was provided by rhys during an interview with american music magazine alarm when he claimed that concept only came about when sleeve designer keiichi tanaami asked what album was about after super furry animals had decided to call album hey venus they remembered slightly too late that name had already been used by northern irish band that petrol emotion for a single taken from their lp however as rhys and guto pryce in particular were fans of band they reasoned that it wasn t necessarily a bad thing to share a name with song cover hey venus is first super furry animals studio album since 1996 s fuzzy logic without a cover designed by pete fowler instead band hired japanese artist keiichi tanaami to produce artwork for album according to bassist guto pryce band were blown away by tanaami s art during a tour of japan a few years before release of hey venus story of venus character helped band give something to tanaami that he could read and maybe translate into a visual representation after hearing album artist came up with something quite mental according to huw bunford who went on to state it s amazing what he obviously heard in music album cover received some criticism from journalists but gruff rhys has called it great and claims to love fact that graphics and words are placed in kind of what seem to be random places it s not a predictable record cover it doesn t look like an album by editors or something

fit to challenge rings around world and phantom power as their most satisfying work and artrocker calling it super furry animals eighth excellent album in a row allmusic hailed hey venus as a full

described hey venus as a treasure trove of left of centre sun pop that by rights should see them back on radio all day every day and nme claimed that melodies on hey venus are certain to ensnare new hearts in a way hardly any bands who ve been around as long as furries can however some reviews pointed out that album has faint whiff of musical conservatism with both uncut and q calling it a missed opportunity former going on to describe record as a consolidation of affairs rather than a step forward and suggesting that while no means a stinker it must rank as their least adventurous lp allmusic countered this opinion stating that hey venus contains kind of subtle innovations that prove that furries can still surprise as they enter their second decade track run away was singled out for praise by several publications with independent on sunday calling song outstanding culture deluxe claiming track showed super furries at their pop best and proved they could do no wrong and nme stating that with a chorus as big as guitarist huw bunford s new serial killer beard it s up there with most finely polished weapons in sfa armoury baby ate my eightball received some criticism with independent claiming that it falls short of expectations its limp disco groove providing uncertain footing for rhys s rococo confection of harmonies and uncut stating that song along with neo consumer doesn t
