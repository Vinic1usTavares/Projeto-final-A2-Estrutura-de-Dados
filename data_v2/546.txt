particularly somewhere at bottom of river between vega and altair and here hear iii and genres such as screamo progressive rock and post rock album features lyrical themes that while making several references to band s home town of grand rapids focus on personal loss anger and despair and in vision of band is a collection of unpublished short stories from a hypothetical author complete with author s notes and sectioned thematically by use of four monologues album debuted at number 135 on us billboard 200 chart selling 3 140 copies in its first week it spent one week on chart and charted only in united states prior to its release wildlife was promoted with two singles harder harmonies and most beautiful bitter fruit album was well received by critics who mainly praised its conceptual lyrics and more melodic approach to band s style writing and recording writing of album did not start until a year after la dispute s debut album somewhere at bottom of river between vega and altair was released part of reason for delay was band s continuous touring and promotion of debut across united states and canada with rare tour and festival appearances in europe and australia when commenting on delay between band s album releases singer jordan dreyer said he and rest of band members require an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and then we have to really sit down and be as meticulous as we all want to be band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at time while writing la dispute band had very specific goals they projected album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song la dispute wrote and recorded wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers andrew everding and joe pedulla they started with instrumentation of six tracks at studios in chicago this recording process took place over two weeks songwriting featured on album is distinct from la dispute s previous releases dreyer wrote stories or concepts behind each song and then band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them in an interview dreyer was asked how songwriting differs he said that lyrics were written before music was composed he was quoted as saying this time around we switched process up entirely previous to wildlife we d always start music first and add vocals later based on way song felt this time around because we had a more concrete concept going into it and because we wanted to work even more as a single unit dreyer and rest of la dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record but with ambiguity so it would not limit listener s experience oftentimes i think records with a linear narrative narrow ways in which a person can enjoy it and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back when they returned from their touring in australia in february 2011 they dropped off face of earth for two months during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day la dispute recorded remainder of album in a month in stadiumred in new york city in april 2011 dreyer wanted to give album most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give album a synthesized quality joe pedulla stated that he wanted to give album a more raw and authentic sound we were just trying to capture what it would be like for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room he also credited dreyer s vocal range jordan dreyer has this crazy dynamic range a swing from how loud and quiet he gets so there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all where he s speaking singing softly room is not echoing and he sounds close and in your face then dynamic swing happens and we would see how big it can get when recording vocals dreyer makes very long takes trying to emulate sound of his voice in live performances album s recording features what band considers auxiliary instrumentation including trumpet and rhodes piano and even improvised instruments that sterenburg s brother created out of scrap metal title and packaging title wildlife is not derived from lyrics from album but from themes that connect songs dreyer regards wildlife as an all encompassing word to sum everything up and he has said that we all witness tragedy and change it s summation of our existence on inside of album cover words to for everything are written as a dedication with a word being crossed out it has been speculated by some that word is name helen drummer brad vander lugt when asked about dedication replied that s jordan s story to tell and not mine it does have significance to a story he is telling you will probably hear a little bit more about that in future work jordan has been known to continue stories or themes onto future albums composition music music on wildlife akin to band s first album incorporates elements of post hardcore screamo progressive rock and post rock described as having bluesy quirks and experimental touches by alex reeves of 1st five compared with first album wildlife has melodic tendencies and a more synchronized approach to musicianship and vocals with fewer unusual time signatures and more emphasis on chord progressions there is less hardcore punk style screaming but as in band s earlier work vocal style alternates between singing and speaking song structures are often unconventional wildlife utilizes instrumental passages to complement lyrics reeves described it by saying that music expertly builds tension creating a sense of visceral emotion and releasing this tension in a well timed burst lyrics dreyer had always stated that band s second album would feature a lot of storytelling a lot of groove and a more of an organic feel than their debut album when describing sound of album band wrote that they believe it is musically more heavy and more soft more fast and more slow more complicated and more straight forward and i know my band mates would agree so there isn t really a thing this record sounds like at least not that we can hear with writer vladimir nabokov s works pale fire and lolita being considered as biggest external influence on wildlife album features dark lyrical themes that focus on personal loss and anger and despair felt from watching one s hometown decay as well as dealing with personal loss whether it is faith a friend or a family member in vision of band album is a collection of unpublished short stories from a hypothetical author complete with author s notes and sectioned thematically by use of four monologues stories are told in parallel to author s own ambiguous loss and struggle and lyrics are a combination of dreyer s fictional stories and his interactions in life including true stories from la dispute s home town grand rapids four monologues in question project loss and struggle of artist with introduction a departure and three interludes a letter a poem and a broken jar first two monologues of wildlife were used to capture a general feeling a poem and a broken jar are noted for using spoken word and alternative folk influenced melodies to spark melodramatic feelings st paul missionary baptist church blues focuses on decaying value of a real life abandoned church in grand rapids and how that was a striking contrast to popularity of other churches edit your hometown has been described as treading boundary between melodrama and actual drama by ben of rock sound most beautiful bitter fruit deals with hypothetical author s sexuality by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex king park a seven minute ballad focuses on inner city gang culture and follows perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive by shooting and also follows how drive by shooter plagued by guilt commits suicide dreyer described true story behind song a year or two ago down street from where brad and i work a kid was shot it s an area that s been riddled with gang violence which has been really sad to witness edward benz 27 times is story of a father dealing with pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son while i see everything
