in organization argued that it feasibly could apply to any information regarding sexual orientation or gender identity that does not fit with what state considers as in line with tradition term among minors was also criticized as being ambiguous since it is unclear whether it refers to being in presence of minors or any place where minors could be present they argued that predicting presence of

sentiment describing their response as being both hysterical and hypocritical he acknowledged that countries had been inconsistent on their treatment of other countries for their stances on lgbt
