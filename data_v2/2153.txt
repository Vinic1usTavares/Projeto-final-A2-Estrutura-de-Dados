thescelosaurus ancient greek theskelos theskelos meaning godlike marvelous or wondrous and sauros sauros lizard was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur that appeared at very end of late cretaceous period in north america it was a member of last dinosaurian fauna before cretaceous paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago preservation and completeness of many of its specimens indicate that it may have preferred to live near streams this bipedal ornithopod is known from several partial skeletons and skulls that indicate it grew to between 2 5 and 4 0 meters 8 2 to 13 1 ft in length on average it had sturdy hind limbs small wide hands and a head with an elongate pointed snout form of teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal this genus of dinosaur is regarded as a specialized basal ornithopod traditionally described as a hypsilophodont but more recently recognized as distinct from hypsilophodon several species have been suggested for this genus three currently are recognized as valid type species t neglectus t garbanii and t assiniboiensis genus attracted media attention in 2000 when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in south dakota united states was interpreted as including a fossilized heart there was much discussion over whether remains were of a heart many scientists now doubt identification of object and implications of such an identification discovery history and species left thumb t neglectus holotype at smithsonian museum with skull and neck restored after camptosaurus type specimen of thescelosaurus usnm was discovered in 1891 by paleontologists john bell hatcher and william h utterback from beds of late maastrichtian age upper cretaceous lance formation of niobrara county at time part of converse county wyoming usa skeleton however remained in its shipping crates for years until charles w gilmore of smithsonian institution s national museum of natural history had it prepared and described it in a short paper in 1913 naming it t neglectus neglectus neglected at time he thought it was related to camptosaurus he provided a detailed monograph in 1915 describing well preserved skeleton type specimen was found largely in natural articulation and was missing only head and neck which were lost due to erosion name comes from surprise gilmore felt at finding such a good specimen that had been unattended to for so long he considered it to be a light agile creature and assigned it to hypsilophodontidae a family of small bipedal dinosaurs thumb charles gilmore s 1915 reconstruction of t neglectus type specimen other remains of similar animals were found throughout late 19th century and 20th century another well preserved skeleton from slightly older horseshoe canyon formation in alberta canada was named t by william parks in 1926 this skeleton had notable differences from t neglectus and so charles m sternberg placed it in a new genus parksosaurus in 1937 sternberg also named an additional species t edmontonensis based on another articulated skeleton this time including a partial skull nmc 8537 and drew attention to genus heavy build and thick bones due to these differences from regular light hypsilophodont build he suggested that genus warranted its own subfamily thescelosaurinae t edmontonensis has since peter galton s 1974 review generally been considered a more robust individual possibly opposite sex of type individual of t neglectus however boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of thescelosaurus and regarded specimen as of uncertain placement within genus other point of contention regarding t edmontonensis is its ankle which galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted but which was regarded by william j morris 1976 as truly different from t neglectus thumb left cast of cmn 8537 described as type specimen for t edmontonensis t sp per boyd et al 2009 in his paper morris described a specimen sdsm 7210 consisting of a partial skull with heavy ridges on lower jaw and cheek four partial vertebrae and two finger bones as an unidentified species of thescelosaurus from late maastrichtian age hell creek formation of harding county south dakota usa he drew attention to its premaxillary teeth and deeply inset which he interpreted as supporting presence of muscular cheeks morris also pointed out outwardly flaring premaxilla which would have given it a wide beak and large palpebrals this skull was recognized as an unnamed hypsilophodont for many years until galton made it type specimen of new genus and species bugenasaura infernalis large cheeked lizard belonging to lower regions infernalis being a reference to hell creek formation morris also named a new possible species of thescelosaurus for specimen lacm 33542 t garbanii with a question mark because he was uncertain that it belonged to genus lacm 33542 comprised a large partial hindlimb a third larger than described specimens of t neglectus and parksosaurus or nearly twice as large as hypsilophodon including a foot tarsus shin bones and partial thigh bone along with five cervical neck and eleven dorsal back vertebrae from hell creek formation of garfield county montana usa specimen was discovered by amateur paleontologist harley hence name t garbanii would have been about 4 5 meters 15 feet long greater than average specimens of t neglectus aside from size morris drew attention to way ankle was constructed which he considered to be unique except in comparison with thescelosaurus edmontonensis which he regarded as a separate species because morris believed that ankles of t garbanii compared favorably to those of t edmontonensis he tentatively assigned it to thescelosaurus however scientific literature has favored galton s view that t edmontonensis was not different from t neglectus see above in same paper that he described bugenasaura galton demonstrated that features morris had thought connected t garbanii and t edmontonensis were result of damage to latter s ankle so t garbanii could also be considered distinct from thescelosaurus to better accommodate this species galton suggested that it belonged to his new genus bugenasaura as b garbanii although he also noted that it could be belong to similarly sized pachycephalosaurid stygimoloch or be part of a third unknown dinosaur thumb thescelosaurus with skin impressions museum of rockies specimen 979 clint boyd and colleagues published a reassessment of thescelosaurus bugenasaura and parksosaurus in 2009 using new cranial material as a starting point they found that parksosaurus was indeed distinct from thescelosaurus and that skull of bugenasaura infernalis was essentially same as a skull found with a postcranial skeleton that matched thescelosaurus because b infernalis could not be differentiated from thescelosaurus they regarded genus as a synonym of thescelosaurus species as dubious and sdsm 7210 as an example of t sp they found that lacm 33542 although fragmentary was a specimen of thescelosaurus and agreed with morris that ankle structure was distinct returning it to t garbanii finally they noted that another specimen rsm p 1225 1 differed from t neglectus in some anatomical details and may represent a new species thus thescelosaurus per boyd et al 2009 is represented by at least two and possibly three valid species type species t neglectus t garbanii and a possible unnamed species in december 2011 rsm p 1225 1 was assigned to its own species thescelosaurus assiniboiensis it was named by caleb m brown clint a boyd and anthony p russell and is known only from its holotype a small articulated and almost complete skeleton from frenchman formation late maastrichtian stage of saskatchewan description thumb left size of two thescelosaurus species right compared to its relatives parksosaurus center and orodromeus left as well as a human overall skeletal anatomy of this genus is well documented and restorations have been published in several papers including skeletal restorations and models skeleton is known well enough that a detailed reconstruction of hip and hindlimb muscles has been made animal s size has been estimated in 2 5 4 0 m range for length 8 2 13 1 ft for various specimens and a weight of 200 300 kilograms 450 660 pounds with large type specimen of t garbanii estimated at 4 4 5 meters 13 1 14 8 feet long as discussed more fully under discovery history and species it may have been sexually dimorphic with one sex larger than other juvenile remains are known from several locations mostly based on teeth thescelosaurus was a heavily built bipedal animal probably herbivorous but potentially not there was a prominent ridge along length of both maxillae tooth bearing cheek bones and a ridge on both dentaries tooth bearing bone of lower jaw ridges and position of teeth deeply internal to outside surface of skull are interpreted as evidence for muscular cheeks aside from long narrow beak skull also had teeth in premaxilla or upper beak a primitive trait among ornithopods long rod like bones called palpebrals were present over eyes giving animal heavy bony eyebrows its teeth were of two types small pointed premaxillary teeth and leaf shaped cheek teeth six small teeth were present in both premaxillae with a toothless section at tip of beak thumb t neglectus reconstruction had short broad five fingered hands four toed feet with hoof like toe tips and a long tail braced by ossified tendons from middle to tip which would have reduced flexibility of tail rib cage was broad giving it a wide back and limbs were robust animals may have been able to move on all fours given its fairly long arms and wide hands but this idea has not been widely discussed in scientific literature although it does appear in popular works charles m sternberg reconstructed it with upper arm oriented almost perpendicular to body another idea that has gone by wayside as noted by peter galton upper arm bone of most ornithischians articulated with shoulder by an articular surface that consisted of entire end of bone instead of a distinct ball and socket as in mammals orientation of shoulder s articular surface also indicates a vertical and not horizontal upper arm in dinosaurs large thin flat mineralized plates have been found next to ribs sides their function is unknown they may have played a role in respiration however muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for plates which argues against a respiratory function recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as animal aged such plates are known from several other ornithopods and their relatives nature of this genus integument be it scales or something else is currently unknown although potential evidence exists charles gilmore described patches of carbonized material near shoulders as possible epidermis with a punctured texture but no regular pattern and william j morris suggested that armor was present in form of small scutes he interpreted as located at least along midline of neck of one specimen scutes have not been found with other articulated specimens of thescelosaurus though and morris s scutes could be crocodilian in origin classification thumb left front of reconstructed skeleton rocky mountain dinosaur resource center thescelosaurus has generally been allied to hypsilophodon and other small ornithopods as a although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build unusual hindlimbs and more recently its unusually long skull peter galton in 1974 presented one twist to classic arrangement suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build not cursorial or built for running by his definition it should be included in iguanodontidae this has not been followed with morris arguing strongly against galton s classification scheme at any rate galton s iguanodontidae was polyphyletic and not a natural group and so would not be recognized under modern cladistic usage although hypsilophodontidae was interpreted as a natural group in early 1990s this hypothesis has fallen out of favor and hypsilophodontidae has been found to be an unnatural family composed of a variety of animals more or less closely related to iguanodontia paraphyly with various small clades of closely related taxa hypsilophodontidae and hypsilophodont are better understood as informal terms for an evolutionary grade not a true clade thescelosaurus has been regarded as both very basal and very derived among hypsilophodonts one issue that has potentially interfered with classifying thescelosaurus is that not all of remains assigned to t neglectus necessarily belong to it clint boyd and colleagues found that while clade thescelosaurus included genus bugenasaura and species that had been assigned to that genus there were at least two and possibly three species within thescelosaurus and several specimens previously assigned to t neglectus could not yet be assigned to a species within genus it appears to be closely related to parksosaurus dissolution of hypsilophodontidae has been followed by recognition of distinct family thescelosauridae this area of dinosaur family tree has historically been complicated by a lack of research but papers by clint boyd and colleagues and caleb brown and colleagues have specifically addressed these dinosaurs boyd et al 2009 and brown et al 2011 found north american hypsilophodonts of cretaceous age to sort into two related clusters one consisting of orodromeus oryctodromeus and zephyrosaurus and other consisting of parksosaurus and thescelosaurus brown et al 2013 recovered similar results with addition of new genus to orodromeus clade and several long snouted asian forms previously described under to thescelosaurus clade they also formally defined thescelosauridae thescelosaurus neglectus orodromeus their most recent common ancestor and all descendants and smaller clades and thescelosaurinae below cladogram is that of brown et al thumb skull of t neglectus ncsm 15728 willo in left and right view paleobiology thumb t neglectus scaly restoration thescelosaurus would have browsed in first meter or so from ground feeding selectively with food held in mouth by cheeks while chewing thescelosaurus was probably slower than other hypsilophodonts because of its heavier build and leg structure compared to them it had unusual hindlimbs because upper leg was longer than shin opposite of hypsilophodon and running animals in general one specimen is known to have had a bone pathology with long bones of right foot fused at their tops hindering swift movement supposed fossilized heart thumb left willo specimen with possible heart left of shoulder blade in 2000 a skeleton of this genus specimen ncsm 15728 informally known as willo now on display at north carolina museum of natural sciences was described as including remnants of a four chambered heart and an aorta it had been originally unearthed in 1993 in northwestern south dakota authors had found internal detail through computed tomography ct imagery they suggested that heart had been saponified turned to grave wax under airless burial conditions and then changed to goethite an iron mineral by replacement of original material authors interpreted structure of heart as indicating an elevated metabolic rate for thescelosaurus not reptilian cold bloodedness their conclusions have been disputed soon after initial description other researchers published a paper where they asserted that heart is really a concretion as they noted anatomy given for object is incorrect for example aorta narrows coming into heart and lacks arteries coming from it it partially engulfs one of ribs and has an internal structure of concentric layers in some places and another concretion is preserved behind right leg original authors defended their position they agreed that it was a type of concretion but one that had formed around and partially preserved more muscular portions of heart and aorta thumb willo s supposed heart a study published in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry to question of object s identity including more advanced ct scanning histology x ray diffraction x ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy from these methods authors found following object s internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material and is not comparable to structure of an ostrich s heart walls are composed of sedimentary minerals not known to be produced in biological systems such as goethite feldspar minerals quartz and gypsum as well as some plant fragments carbon nitrogen and phosphorus chemical elements important to life were lacking in their samples and cardiac cellular structures were absent there was one possible patch with animal cellular structures authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from burial environment not heart with possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved question of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot though regardless of object s identity both modern crocodilians and birds closest living relatives of dinosaurs have four chambered hearts albeit modified in crocodilians so dinosaurs probably had them as well structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate and willem j 2004 physiology of dinosaurs

for channels is based on relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones representing channel environments in comparison to mudstones representing floodplain environments no or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported dale russell in a popular work noted that thescelosaurus was most common small herbivore in hell creek formation of fort peck area he described environment of time as a flat floodplain with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees to bald cypress to ferns and although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete possibly due to low preservation potential of forests thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels thus when a thescelosaurus died it may have been in or near a river making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization russell tentatively compared it to capybaras and tapirs other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include ceratopsids triceratops and torosaurus hadrosaurid edmontosaurus ankylosaurid ankylosaurus pachycephalosaurian pachycephalosaurus and theropods ornithomimus
