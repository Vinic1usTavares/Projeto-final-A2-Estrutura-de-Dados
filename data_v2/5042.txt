intelligent teammates who may be given tactical commands conceived by looking glass after completion of their first game ultima underworld stygian abyss terra nova was subject to a long and difficult development process caused in part by production of its full motion video cutscenes game s ted engine can render 3d outdoor environments and simulate physics latter enables such effects as procedural animation terra novas critical reception was highly positive reviewers praised its tactical elements and several compared it to 1995 video game mechwarrior 2 31st century combat however reception of its graphics was mixed and many noted game s steep system requirements despite critical acclaim and sales in excess of 100 000 units game was a commercial failure it did not recoup its development costs while it was intended to be first in a series its low sales led company to cancel plans for a sequel gameplay left thumb player and two squadmates engage two enemies near a lake left multi

of squad include sarah walker daughter of a centauri council member ernest schuyler who is known for his sense of humor and frank and abrasive simon ashford each member was given a personality so that player would form connections with squad commander arlen macpherson assumes overall charge of squad and he has regular dealings with hegemony ambassador creon pentheus live action full motion video cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions story as game begins pirates steal a shipment of highly destructive grenades a reconnaissance mission by nikola identifies grenades at a heavily defended pirate base and they are recovered en route to a transport ship without grenades base is assaulted by strike force centauri and hegemony equipment is found there when macpherson confronts pentheus about incident he denies involvement proof of hegemony s intentions is later found at a thatcher smuggling base and pentheus declares war on centauri colonies now knowing pirates are funded by hegemony macpherson suspects that a previous information leak was in fact work of a hegemony spy nikola questions brandt who responds with after a series of missions against hegemony nikola s aircraft is ambushed and shot down and he is captured by pentheus during this time pentheus tells him that a traitor within strike force centauri is responsible for ambush squad rescues nikola but schuyler is killed in assault at his funeral ashford accuses nikola as traitor it soon becomes clear that macpherson is being poisoned nikola believes that brandt is responsible because of his recent disappearances but is proven wrong after macpherson dies sarah walker takes his place as commander of strike force centauri walker sends nikola disguised as a pirate on an espionage mission to discover traitor s identity nikola finds information that incriminates ashford who when confronted boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay squad continues

denies involvement in war declares pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to system while angered by announcement strike force centauri celebrates its victory as game ends development terra nova was conceived in 1992 around time that looking glass technologies first game ultima underworld stygian abyss was completed company co founder paul neurath wrote a design document for a tactical squad based game with a science fiction setting and he helped team initiate its development artist robb waters created concept art it was originally titled freefall because of way soldiers enter combat by dropping from aircraft development was initially led by a newly hired programmer who envisioned game as an exact simulation in which every element was as realistic as possible programmer dan schmidt created game s artificial intelligence and he attempted to make squadmates intelligently follow orders and provide assistance instead of merely staying out of your way schmidt hired eric brosius and terri brosius then members of band tribe to compose game s music which was called orchestrally flavored by boston herald as with their 1995 video game flight unlimited looking glass technologies self published terra nova game began production alongside company s second project ultima underworld ii labyrinth of worlds and remained in development after that game s 1993 release it then continued through creation of their titles system shock released in 1994 and flight unlimited game was subject to numerous delays which schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline he stated that team was trying to go with same philosophy as company s earlier games in that they would develop systems and game would come out of it however team s development priorities regularly changed and programmer who led project left several years into production according to schmidt his departure meant that there was no one left who was psyched about making this really realistic simulation despite this fact team continued using idea even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it schmidt said that game s development status was uncertain after programmer left and that he inherited role of lead programmer around that time merely because position had to be filled he later assumed role of project leader in january 1995 looking glass showed terra nova alongside flight unlimited at winter consumer electronics show under their immersive reality marketing label in team s original plan terra nova consisted of missions that were bookended by simplistic cutscenes akin to those of 1990 origin systems video game wing commander however in 1994 origin released wing commander iii heart of tiger which features live action full motion video fmv cutscenes this pressured looking glass into incorporating fmv into terra nova schmidt later said lots of a list games were including more and more fmv and it was felt by management that if terra nova didn t have any it would look second rate decision to include it came when game was already overdue and a large portion of game s funding was redirected toward cutscene production a scriptwriter from outside company was hired to write cutscenes because of interplay between cutscenes and missions script underwent numerous rewrites game s delays and large budget resulted in removal of a planned online multiplayer component and fmv cutscenes which were expensive to produce increased number of sales needed to recoup development costs a patch was planned to release post launch in september 1996 and add online multiplayer functionality but it did not materialize schmidt called cutscenes a giant distraction for team and himself as project leader he later described them as than most of those from period and noted that i wince a lot looking back on them schmidt believed that they were likely an error from a business standpoint as they further increased game s budget and production length but ultimately did not increase sales roughly a year before its release team concluded that terra novas realistic simulation style gameplay was not enjoyable however schmidt said that game s already lengthy development meant that it had to be released otherwise he believed that it would be canceled or that its high cost would bankrupt company as a result game was completely redesigned to be much more arcadey only a few months before release schmidt said that in new game you were going around blowing people up and your enemies have brackets on them showing their health and it s very bright and glowy and green he believed that these elements drastically increased game s enjoyability he summarized six months before it shipped game wasn t fun at all and we actually ended up shipping something that was at least somewhat enjoyable to play after previously being slated to launch in second quarter of 1995 game was released on march 5 1996 by this time its graphical technology had been surpassed by other video games according to schmidt lead programmer art min later expressed dissatisfaction with game he believed that while team coalesced at end of development they shipped game too soon because of an overexcited vp of product development technology unlike looking glass previous first person games ultima underworld ultima underworld ii and system shock terra nova takes place in outdoor environments game s engine named ted supports weather conditions day and night environments real time water reflections and moving clouds among other effects most of work on outdoor renderer was done by programmer eric however contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three dimensional 3d outdoor environments problem was solved by programmer james fleming game s engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3d graphics but according to pc gamer us it displays a bitmapped background in distance to provide illusion of detail as with flight unlimited and cd rom release of system shock terra nova was designed to support head mounted displays game features qsound technology describing qsound s effect before game s release suzanne kirschner of popular science wrote that you ll hear rustle of leaves from right speaker a split second before you hear it in left signaling you that enemy is approaching from right game s characters are procedurally animated via simulated physics models and inverse kinematics ik a system designed by programmer seamus blackley basic physics are used to move character models through environment and models are animated by ik system in accordance with this movement designer richard wyckoff later compared character physics to those of a marble and schmidt described technique as akin to putting each character in a hamster ball system s imperfect nature can result in animation glitches a more realistic simulation of bipedal movement was originally planned but it was simplified before release because of coding difficulties schmidt later said that original method almost always worked but that every thirty minutes someone would put their foot down slightly wrong and then go flying off across map a physics model is also used to simulate weapon recoil arc of projectiles and gravity of each planet for example projectiles travel farther in low gravity environments reception although terra nova sold more than 100 000 units it was a commercial failure because it did not recoup its development costs designer tim later characterized its performance as a disaster despite this game was acclaimed by critics and several publications drew comparisons to 1995 video game mechwarrior 2 31st century combat edge compared game favorably to system shock due to its balanced combination of action and strategy stating that in just two years looking glass has metamorphosed from one of industry s secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right john payne of washington post wrote depending on your point of view terra nova is either a stripped down mechwarrior or a souped up doom however he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken while he described game s animation as fluid he found its graphics in general to be fairly blocky even at a distance he finished his review by stating that game requires more practice than action fans are used to but provides a nice payoff next generation magazine wrote looking glass has always been known for breaking barriers of conventional gameplay and it has done it again with terra nova magazine considered game to be an all around stunning effort sunday star times peter eley found game to be extremely complex and he noted originality of its real time full motion and 3d combat simulation he called its sound and music stunning but found that its graphics aren t as crisp as some other games and he described performance issues lee perkins of age also found game s performance and graphics lacking but he said in spite of its visual shortcomings terra nova has same level of inherent player appeal as system shock he concluded that game s tactical demands are probably its strongest point and that it isn t quite up in mechwarrior 2 league but it s making some very loud noises with avid mech combat fans computer games strategy plus tim royal offered similar praise for its strategic elements however like other two he noted game s performance issues and he called its graphics above average but not mind boggling he finished i won t say it beats system shock it doesn t but terra nova offers a wonderful variety of terrain mission types and scenarios william wong of computer shopper called it a great game that is backed by good graphics and sound and will keep you going for hours he also praised its cutscenes he concluded if upcoming multiplayer pack is as good as standalone version terra nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with pc gamer uks james flynn praised game s graphics sense of realism and free form missions about latter he wrote there s no right or wrong way to complete any of missions in terra nova and this is one of its strongest assets he noted that it was virtually impossible to recommend game to those with lower end computers but he believed that it was also impossible to condemn looking glass for programming game this way because it feels so real and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun daniel jevons of maximum approved of graphics but disliked focus on long range combat and use of mouse to move a crosshair rather than entire viewpoint however he concluded that game has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack plot is strangely involving and despite initial control difficulties with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around battlefields michael e ryan of pc magazine praised game s artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality spectacular but found its movement controls to be awkward he concluded terra nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic fast paced action with real time squad level tactics it doesn t get much better than this terra nova was named 15th best computer game ever by pc gamer uk in 1997 editors called it exactly kind of dynamic risk taking intelligent game we ve been asking for in 2000 computer games strategy plus named it one of 10 best sci fi simulations of all time legacy new york times has cited terra nova as one of first 3d games with squad oriented gameplay gamespy s bill hiles said that game preceded tactical squad based first person shooter action genre by a full two years and that in 1996 terra nova didn t feel like any other game out there hiles called tribes 2 a spiritual of terra nova if there ever was one project leader dan schmidt later said that he had a bit of a negative experience overall because thing dragged on forever but he noted that there are people who regard it highly so it can t have been that terrible 1998 video game jurassic park trespasser features a procedural animation system very similar to one used in terra nova while schmidt said before game s release that team wanted to develop a whole series of games that take place in terra nova world game s poor sales made creation of a sequel impractical according to paul neurath as game s publisher looking glass took on full burden of its commercial underperformance which contributed to company s bankruptcy and closure in may 2000 neurath later said if we could do terra nova over i would have dumped cinematics and done online team play instead who knows maybe then tribes ii and halo teams would be talking about influence of terra nova on their games notes external links terra nova on gamespot s best games you never
