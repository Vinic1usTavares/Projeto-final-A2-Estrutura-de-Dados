shouldn t happen on a tv soap a bloopers programme which returned itv s ratings to above five million mark writing in guardian a fortnight later itv head of drama david liddiment defended decision stating that network had planned to let making waves profit from bill s lead in high ratings at a time when bbc one wednesday night ratings were suffering but series just wasn t good enough to hold an audience ted childs later responded that making waves had received little publicity compared to channel4 s ratings smash supernanny which aired opposite his series and that because that programme had ended its run ratings for last three episodes might have improved he went on to question why itv had spent ps5 million on a series they knew would not be a hit making waves had been another in a line of expensive series which had been cancelled because they performed below itv s expectations in ratings following sweet medicine and family previous year cancellation of series also drew criticism from royal navy with a source telling sun that it was a kick in teeth to our sailors in its end of year review itv described series as having quality and distinctiveness but failing to find a mass audience critical reception due to series coming from producer of soldier soldier and kavanagh qc close involvement of royal navy and lead being taken by alex ferns there was a strong media interest in series which only intensified as series went through its many positive previews were run by manchester evening news and sun times predicted itv has a ratings winner and called series a classic military soap opera tabloid press was keen for series to succeed daily mirror described it as promising and conjectured that it would be defining role of alex ferns s career although its sunday equivalent did not share sentiment it described series as a seabed bound disaster same writer criticised script and directing of episode three and suggested that viewers were not interested in a naval series set in peacetime scotsman dismissed it as little more than a six part recruitment video comparing scenes of refugees being lifted to real advertisements that showcased navy s role in humanitarian crises and concluded that drama was a collection of cliches and stilted dialogue independent on sunday compared series to sea based soap opera triangle and noted an overdependence on claustrophobic interiors however series was wryly praised for casting alex ferns instead of ross kemp in lead role bucking trend of recent itv military series and commented on difficult time slot series had been given over two years after series was pulled alex ferns admitted that it was formulaic but blamed its failure on constant rescheduling dvd release bbfc passed series for video release
