in late may and early june 1942 during world war ii submarines belonging to imperial japanese navy made a series of attacks on cities of sydney and newcastle in new south wales australia on night of 31 may 1 june three ko hyoteki class midget submarines each with a two member crew entered sydney harbour avoided partially constructed sydney harbour anti submarine boom net and attempted to sink allied warships two of midget submarines were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any allied vessels and crews scuttled their submarines and killed themselves these submarines were later recovered by allies third submarine attempted to torpedo heavy cruiser but instead sank converted ferry killing 21 sailors this midget submarine s fate was unknown until 2006 when amateur scuba divers discovered wreck off sydney s northern beaches immediately following raid five japanese fleet submarines that carried midget submarines to australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern australian waters over next month submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors during this period between midnight and 02 30 on 8 june two of submarines bombarded ports of sydney and newcastle midget submarine attacks and subsequent bombardments are among best known examples of axis naval activity in australian waters during world war ii and are only occasion in history when either city has come under attack physical effects were slight japanese had intended to destroy several major warships but sank only an unarmed depot ship and failed to damage any significant targets during bombardments main impact was psychological creating popular fear of an impending japanese invasion and forcing australian military to upgrade defences including commencement of convoy operations to protect merchant shipping forces thumb left crews of japanese midget submarines that attacked sydney and diego suarez japanese imperial japanese navy originally intended to use six submarines in attack on sydney harbour b1 type submarines and and c1 type submarines and six submarines made up eastern attack group of 8th submarine squadron under command of captain hankyu sasaki on 8 june 1942 i 21 and i 29 each carrying a yokosuka e14y1 glen floatplane for aerial reconnaissance scouted various australasian harbours to select ones most vulnerable to attack by midget submarines i 21 scouted noumea in new caledonia suva in fiji then auckland in new zealand while i 29 went to sydney australia on 11 may i 22 i 24 i 27 and i 28 were ordered to proceed to japanese naval base at truk lagoon in caroline islands to each receive a ko hyoteki class midget submarine i 28 failed to reach truk she was torpedoed on surface by us submarine on 17 may three remaining submarines left truk around 20 may for a point south of solomon islands i 24 was forced to return a day later when an explosion in her midget submarine s battery compartment killed midget s navigator and injured commander midget submarine intended for i 28 replaced damaged midget allies thumb uss chicago in sydney harbour on 31 may 1942 naval officer in charge of sydney harbour at time of attack was rear admiral gerard muirhead gould of royal navy on night of attack three major vessels were present in sydney harbour heavy cruisers and and light cruiser other warships in harbour included destroyer tender auxiliary minelayer corvettes and armed merchant cruisers and and dutch submarine k ix a converted ferry hmas kuttabul was alongside at garden island where she served as a temporary barracks for sailors transferring between ships hospital ship oranje had also been in harbour but departed an hour before attack harbour defences at time of attack static sydney harbour defences consisted of eight anti submarine indicator loops six outside harbour one between north head and south head and one between south head and middle head as well as partially constructed sydney harbour anti submarine boom net between george s head on middle head and green point on inner south head central section of net was complete and support piles were in place to west but wide gaps remained on either side material shortages prevented completion of boom net prior to attack on day of attack six outer indicator loops were inactive two were not functioning and there were not enough trained personnel to man both inner and outer loop monitoring stations north head south head indicator loop had been giving faulty signals since early 1940 and as civilian traffic regularly passed over loop readings were often ignored harbour defence craft included anti submarine vessels and auxiliary minesweepers hmas and pleasure launches converted to channel patrol boats and armed with depth charges namely lolita steady hour and and four unarmed auxiliary patrol boats prelude thumb nobuo fujita with a plane of type he flew over sydney on 17 february 1942 seaplanes aboard i 29 and i 21 were of same type japanese navy used five ko hyoteki class midget submarines in an unsuccessful operation against us battleships during attack on pearl harbor navy hoped that upgrades to submarines intensified crew training and selection of a less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of crews of midgets to return alive from their mission therefore on 16 december 1941 navy initiated plans for a second midget submarine operation plans called for two simultaneous attacks against allied naval vessels in indian and south pacific oceans these attacks were intended as diversions ahead of attack on midway island in north pacific with japanese hoping to convince allies that they intended to attack to south or west of their conquests eleven submarines of 8th submarine squadron were to carry out two attacks five submarines of western attack group in indian ocean and six submarines of eastern attack group in pacific ocean submarine groups were to select a suitable port of attack based on their own reconnaissance western attack group selected port of diego suarez in madagascar this attack which occurred at nightfall on 30 may and resulted in damaging of battleship and sinking of tanker british loyalty came 22 days after british captured port from vichy france at beginning of battle of madagascar four potential targets for eastern attack group were noumea suva auckland and sydney identified by reconnaissance flights conducted by warrant flying officer nobuo fujita of imperial japanese navy flying from i 25 commencing 17 february over sydney harbour and eastern australian harbours of melbourne and hobart 1 march followed by new zealand harbours of wellington 8 march and auckland 13 march i 21 and i 29 were sent to select final target with i 29 sailing to sydney on evening of 16 may i 29 fired on soviet merchant vessel wellen from newcastle new south wales although wellen escaped with minimal damage shipping between sydney and newcastle was halted for 24 hours while aircraft and all available anti submarine ships from sydney including dutch light cruiser hnlms tromp australian destroyer and us destroyer searched unsuccessfully for submarine muirhead gould concluded that submarine had operated alone and had left area immediately after attack i 29s floatplane made a reconnaissance flight over sydney on 23 may a secret radar unit set up in iron cove detected flight but authorities dismissed its report as a glitch as there were no allied aircraft operating over sydney aircraft was damaged or destroyed on landing although its two crew survived they reported presence of several capital ships including two battleships or large cruisers five other large warships several minor war vessels and patrol boats and prolific merchant shipping report which allied frumel signals intelligence network partially intercepted resulted in japanese navy selecting sydney as target three midget carrying submarines rendezvoused with i 29 and i 21 approximately north east of sydney heads with all five submarines in position by 29 may midget submarine operation final reconnaissance before dawn on 29 may i 21s floatplane piloted by ito susumu performed a final reconnaissance flight over sydney harbour with mission of mapping locations of major vessels and of anti submarine net multiple observers spotted floatplane but assumed it was a us navy curtiss seagull no alarm was raised until 05 07 when it was realised that only ship in area carrying seagulls was u s cruiser chicago and all four of her aircraft were on board richmond air force base launched raaf wirraway fighters which failed to locate i 21 or floatplane therefore reconnaissance flight did not result in authorities in sydney taking any special defence measures floatplane was seriously damaged on landing and had to be scuttled but both aircrew survived plan of attack japanese planned to launch midgets one after other between 17 20 and 17 40 from points outside sydney harbour first midget was to pass through heads just after 18 30 but heavy seas delayed her by over an hour other two midgets followed at twenty minute intervals and were similarly delayed choice of targets was left up to midget commanders with advice that they should primarily target aircraft carriers or battleships with cruisers as secondary targets sasaki telegraphic order 3 reproduced in midgets were to operate to east of harbour bridge although if no suitable targets were to be found in this area they were to move under bridge and attack a battleship and large cruiser believed to be in inner harbour when second reconnaissance flyover revealed that expected british battleship was nowhere to be found uss chicago became priority target after completing their mission midgets were to depart sydney harbour and head south for to recovery point off port hacking four of mother submarines would be waiting in an east west line long with fifth waiting further south attack midget submarine m 14 launched from i 27 was first to enter sydney harbour middle head south head loop detected it at 20 01 but dismissed reading due to heavy civilian traffic at 20 15 a maritime services board watchman spotted midget after it passed through western gap collided with pile light then reversed and trapped its stern in net submarine s bow broke surface watchman rowed toward it to determine what it was and then rowed to nearby patrol boat to report his finding despite efforts by yarroma to pass on this information sydney naval headquarters did not receive report until 21 52 hmas yarroma and were dispatched to investigate upon confirming that object in net was a baby submarine lolita dropped two depth charges while commander requested permission from sydney naval headquarters to open fire depth charges failed to detonate as water was too shallow for hydrostatic fuse setting at 22 35 while yarroma was waiting for permission to fire and lolita was setting up to deploy a third depth charge two crewmen on m 14 activated one of submarine s scuttling charges killing themselves and destroying submarine s forward section muirhead gould gave general alarm along with orders for ships to take anti submarine measures at 22 27 alarm was repeated at 22 36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack as an enemy submarine might be in harbour at time of first alarm sydney harbour was closed to external traffic but muirhead gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged midget submarine m 24 was second to enter harbour hmas grazed m 24s hull and reported contact to command report was not followed up m 24 crossed indicator loop undetected at 21 48 and at approximately 22 00 followed a manly ferry through anti submarine net at 22 52 m 24 was spotted by a chicago searchlight operator less than to moored cruiser s starboard and on a course roughly parallel to ship s facing chicago opened fire with a gun and a quadruple machinegun mount but inflicted minimal damage as weapons could not depress far enough some of shells skipped off water and hit fort denison s martello tower while fragments were later found in suburbs of cremorne and mosman senior officer present aboard chicago ordered crew to begin preparing for departure and for uss perkins to begin an anti submarine screening patrol around cruiser orders that were revoked by sceptical captain howard bode when he arrived on board at around 23 30 and also fired upon m 24 as it fled west toward sydney harbour bridge before midget was able to submerge and escape when it returned to periscope depth midget found itself west of fort denison it turned and sailed east for about then took up a firing position south west of bradley s head from where its commander could see chicagos stern silhouetted against construction floodlights at garden island s new captain cook graving dock midget submarine m 21 from i 22 probably entered harbour at same time that uss chicago opened fire on m 24 unarmed auxiliary patrol boat hmas spotted m 21 and illuminated submarine s conning tower while sending an alert signal to port war signal station at south head and nearby anti submarine vessel hmas yandra yandra attempted to ram submarine lost contact regained contact at 23 03 and dropped six depth charges at time of attack it was assumed that depth charges had destroyed or disabled midget but m 21 survived historians believe that midget took refuge on harbour floor and waited until allied vessels had moved away before it resumed attack at 23 14 muirhead gould ordered all ships to observe blackout conditions just after 23 30 he set off on a barge towards boom net to make a personal inspection admiral reached lolita at about midnight and indicated to her crew that he did not take reports of enemy submarines seriously reportedly saying what are you all playing at running up and down harbour dropping depth charges and talking about enemy subs in harbour there s not one to be seen crew reiterated that a submarine had been seen but muirhead gould remained unconvinced and before he left added sarcastically if you see another sub see if captain has a black beard i d like to meet him thumb left hmas kuttabul following japanese attack despite blackout order garden island floodlights remained on until 00 25 about five minutes later m 24 fired first of its two torpedoes it delayed firing second torpedo for several minutes as midget submarines would lose longitudinal stability immediately after firing a torpedo historians are divided as to exact paths of torpedoes relative to chicago although all agree that us cruiser was intended target both torpedoes missed chicago while one torpedo may have also passed close to perkins starboard bow one of torpedoes continued underneath dutch submarine k ix and hmas kuttabul then hit breakwater kuttabul was tied up against explosion broke kuttabul in two and sank her and damaged k ix attack killed 19 royal australian navy and two royal navy sailors and wounded another 10 explosion shook residences in area and damaged garden island s lights and telecommunications other torpedo ran aground on eastern shore of garden island without exploding m 24 then dived and moved to leave harbour thumb upright unexploded torpedo at garden island several days after attack a crossing over indicator loop that was recorded at 01 58 was initially believed to be another midget submarine entering harbour although later analysis showed that reading indicated an outbound vessel and was therefore most likely represented m 24s exit m 24 did not return to its mother submarine and its fate remained unknown until 2006 ships were ordered to make for open ocean chicago left her anchorage at 02 14 leaving a sailor behind on mooring buoy in her haste to depart bombay whyalla canberra and perkins began their preparations to depart just before 03 00 as chicago was leaving harbour lookouts spotted a submarine periscope passing alongside cruiser at 03 01 indicator loop registered an inbound signal m 21 was re entering sydney harbour after recovering from attack four hours previously fired on m 21 in neutral bay at 03 50 and at 05 00 three auxiliary patrol boats hmas steady hour sea mist and yarroma spotted submarine s conning tower in taylors bay patrol boats had set their depth charge fuses to and when sea mist passed over where submarine had just submerged and dropped a depth charge she had only five seconds to clear area blast damaged m 21 which inverted and rose to surface before sinking again sea mist dropped a second depth charge which damaged one of her two engines in process and prevented her from making further attacks steady hour and yarroma continued attack dropping seventeen depth charges on believed visual sightings and instrument contacts of midget over next three and a half hours at some point during night crew of m 21 killed themselves at 04 40 hmas canberra recorded that japanese may have fired torpedoes at her this may have been one of many false alarms throughout night however m 21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes but failed because of damage to bow either from hmas ramming or depth charges or a possible collision with uss chicago making it possible that m 21 attempted to attack cruiser observer aboard canberra may have seen bubbles from compressed air released to fire torpedoes secondary missions as per operation plan five mother submarines waited off port hacking on nights of 1 and 2 june for midget submarines to return frumel picked up wireless traffic between five submarines leading raaf to task three lockheed hudsons and two bristol beauforts with finding source of communications they were unsuccessful on 3 june sasaki abandoned hope of recovering midget submarines and submarines dispersed on their secondary missions attacks on allied merchant shipping four of submarines began operations against allied merchant shipping i 21 patrolled north of sydney while i 24 patrolled south of sydney i 27 began searching off gabo island for ships departing melbourne and i 29 travelled to brisbane i 22 left group to conduct reconnaissance operations first at wellington and auckland in new zealand and then at suva in fiji between 1 and 25 june when four submarines arrived at kwajalein atoll in marshall islands to re supply before proceeding to japanese shipyards for maintenance four submarines attacked at least seven allied merchant vessels three of these were sunk iron chieftain by i 24 on 3 june iron crown by i 27 on 4 june and guatemala by i 21 on 12 june first two attacks resulted in 12 and 37 fatalities respectively though third attack killed no one attacks forced authorities to institute changes in merchant traffic travel north of melbourne was restricted until a system of escorted convoys was established i 21 was only submarine to return to australian waters where she sank three ships and damaged two others during january and february 1943 during her two deployments i 21 sank of allied shipping which made her most successful japanese submarine to operate in australian waters bombardment thumb a house in sydney s eastern suburbs damaged by a japanese shell on morning of 8 june i 24 and i 21 briefly bombarded sydney and newcastle just after midnight i 24 surfaced south south east of macquarie lighthouse submarine s commander ordered gun crew to target sydney harbour bridge they fired 10 shells over a four minute period nine landed in eastern suburbs and one landed in water i 24 then crash dived to prevent successful retaliation by coastal artillery batteries only one shell detonated and only injuries inflicted were cuts and fractures from falling bricks or broken glass when unexploded shells hit buildings a united states army air forces pilot 1st lieutenant george cantello based at bankstown airport disobeyed orders and took off to try and locate source of shelling but was killed when engine failure caused his airacobra to crash in a paddock at in 1988 following efforts by residents and us consulate in sydney city of liverpool established a memorial park lt cantello reserve with a monument in his honour at 02 15 i 21 shelled newcastle from north east of stockton beach she fired 34 shells over a 16 minute period including eight star shells target of attack was bhp steelworks in city however shells landed over a large area causing minimal damage and no fatalities only shell to detonate damaged a house on parnell place while an unexploded shell hit a tram terminus fort scratchley returned fire only time an australian land fortification has fired on an enemy warship during wartime but submarine escaped unscathed analysis attack on sydney harbour ended in failure on both sides and revealed flaws in both allied defences and japanese tactics during primary attack japanese lost all three midget submarines in exchange for sinking of a single barracks ship subsequent operations were no more successful as five large japanese submarines sank only three merchant ships and caused minimal property damage during two bombardments performance of allied defenders was equally poor however one historian states that lack of damage in sydney harbour was due to a combination of good luck and aggressive counter attack main impact of midget submarine attack and subsequent operations was psychological dispelling any belief that sydney was immune to japanese attack and highlighting australia s proximity to pacific war there was no official inquiry into attacks despite demand from some sections of media as there was concern that an inquiry would lead to defeatism and reduce faith in john curtin s government particularly after damaging inquiry into australian defences that had followed japanese aerial attack on darwin three months earlier failures in allied defences allies failed to respond adequately to several warnings of japanese activity off east coast of australia prior to attack they simply ignored warnings or explained them away they attributed unsuccessful attack on freighter wellen on 16 may to a single submarine and assumed it had departed australian waters immediately after attack first reconnaissance flight went unnoticed and although frumel intercepted report and distributed it to allied commanders on 30 may muirhead gould apparently did not react new zealand naval authorities detected radio chatter between japanese submarines on 26 and 29 may and although they could not decrypt transmissions radio direction finding indicated that a submarine or submarines were approaching sydney allies considered dispatching an anti submarine patrol in response to 29 may fix but were unable to do so as all anti submarine craft were already committed to protecting a northbound troop convoy only response to second reconnaissance flight on 29 may was launching of search planes no other defence measures were put into place although midget attack on diego suarez in madagascar occurred on morning of 31 may sydney time allies sent no alert to other command regions as they believed that vichy french forces had launched attack thumb left upright muirhead gould in may 1941 historians have questioned competence of senior allied officers muirhead gould had been hosting a dinner party on night of attack and one of main guests was senior united states navy officer in sydney harbour captain howard bode of uss chicago both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place muirhead gould arrived aboard hmas lolita at approximately midnight an action he described as attempting to learn about situation but members of lolita s crew later recounted that when muirhead gould came aboard he immediately chastised patrol boat s skipper and crew and quickly dismissed their report junior officers on chicago provided similar descriptions of bode s return on board and members of both crews later claimed that muirhead gould and bode were intoxicated it was only after destruction of hmas kuttabul that both officers began to take attack seriously during attack there were several delays between events and responses to them over two hours passed between observation of m 14 in boom net and muirhead gould s first order for ships to commence anti submarine actions it took another two hours to mobilise auxiliary patrol boats which did not leave their anchorage for a further hour part of these delays was due to a lack of effective communications none of auxiliary patrol craft in harbour had radio communications so all instructions and reports came from signal lights via port war signal station or garden island or by physical communication via launches in muirhead gould s preliminary report on attack he stated that port war signal station was not designed for volume of communications traffic attack caused reproduced in telephone communications with garden island were unreliable during early part of attack and then first torpedo explosion disabled them completely need to keep information secret may also have contributed to delays and defenders scepticism as auxiliary patrol boat crews indicator loop staff and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside need to know and would not have been informed about any of incidents prior to attack they would not have been alert contributing to disbelief demonstrated in early hours of attack flaws in japanese tactics thumb m 21 being raised by a floating crane on 10 june 1942 thumb wreckage of m 21 main flaw in japanese plans was use of midget submarines for primary attack midget submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to run amok through enemy fleet this concept went out of favour as changing japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier supported aerial combat as a result midget program s focus changed to infiltration of enemy harbours where they would attack vessels at anchor this concept failed completely during attack on pearl harbor where midgets had no effect and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further midget submarine attacks on sydney and diego suarez proved a waste of resources moreover failures at sydney harbour and diego suarez demonstrated that improvements to midget submarines made after pearl harbor had not increased overall impact of midget program modifications had various effects ability to man and deploy midgets while mother ships were submerged prevented army coastal radars from detecting mother submarines however midgets were still difficult to control unstable and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably these manoeuvrability issues contributed to m 14s entanglement in anti submarine net and repeated detection of m 21 and m 24 beyond use of unreliable midgets historians have identified areas in plan of attack where japanese could have done significantly more damage if japanese midget submarines had conducted a simultaneous co ordinated attack they would have overwhelmed defences a chance for more damage came following destruction of kuttabul when several naval vessels headed to sea including uss chicago uss perkins dutch submarine k ix hmas whyalla and hmis bombay five mother submarines were already en route to port hacking recovery position and although sasaki s plan at pearl harbor had been to leave some submarines at harbour mouth to pick off fleeing vessels he did not repeat this tactic uss chicagos survival several factors beyond control of any of combatants contributed to survival of uss chicago at time of m 24s attack on chicago latter had spent some time preparing to depart from sydney harbour and although still moored and stationary was producing large volumes of white smoke as boilers warmed up this smoke streaming aft under influence of wind and contrasting against dark low lying cloud may have given impression that chicago was moving causing m 24 to lead target when firing its torpedoes and consequently sending its torpedoes across bow another factor that may have influenced chicagos survival was extinguishing of garden island s floodlights minutes before m 24 fired its first torpedo impeding targeting bombardment impact thumb a crowd looking at a shell hole at woollahra on 8 june 1942 bombardments failed to cause significant physical damage but had a major psychological impact on residents of sydney and newcastle due to inaccuracy of submarines range finding equipment coupled with unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea specific targeting was impossible intention of submarine bombardment was to frighten population of target area failure of majority of shells to detonate may have had various causes as submarines fired armour piercing shells intended for use against steel ship hulls relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger impact fuses sea water may have degraded shells which japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks age of shells may also have been a factor some of shells recovered from newcastle bombardment were found to be of english manufacture surplus munitions from world war i in sydney fear of an impending japanese invasion caused people to move west housing prices in eastern suburbs dropped while those beyond blue mountains rose significantly attack also led to a significant increase in membership of volunteer defence organisations and strengthening of defences in sydney harbour and port newcastle aftermath papers did not publish news of submarine attack until 2 june as most of attack occurred after newspapers went to press on morning of 1 june instead on morning after attack front pages carried news of operation millennium royal air force s first 1 000 bomber raid although several newspapers included a small interior article mentioning final reconnaissance flyover federal censor ordered total censorship of events issuing an official statement on afternoon of 1 june which reported that allies had destroyed three submarines in sydney harbour and described loss of kuttabul and 21 deaths as loss of one small harbour vessel of no military value smith s weekly finally released real story on 6 june and follow up material in 13 june issue caused more political damage prompting royal australian navy to attempt to charge newspaper with releasing defence information thumb left burial service for australian sailors killed during raid on sydney it was several days before 21 dead sailors aboard kuttabul could all be recovered on 3 june muirhead gould and over 200 navy personnel attended a burial ceremony for these sailors on 1 january 1943 navy base at garden island was commissioned as in commemoration of ferry and lives lost australians recovered bodies of four japanese crew of two midget submarines sunk in sydney harbour and had them cremated at rookwood cemetery for cremation allies draped japanese flag over each coffin and rendered full naval honours muirhead gould was criticised for this but defended his actions as respecting courage of four submariners regardless of their origin australian politicians also hoped that japanese government would notice respect paid to sailors and improve conditions australian prisoners of war were experiencing in japanese internment camps japanese authorities noted funeral service but this did not lead to any major improvement in conditions for australian pows following use of midget submariners funeral by japanese for propaganda purposes australian high command forbade similar funerals for enemy personnel in future an exchange of japanese and allied diplomatic personnel stranded in opposing nations occurred in august 1942 which allowed tatsuo kawai japanese ambassador to australia to return home with ashes of four japanese submariners when exchange ship kamakura maru arrived in yokohama several thousand people were present to honour four men thumb left upright relatives of four of japanese sailors killed in midget submarines which raided sydney harbour greet kamakura maru as she arrives at yokohama with ashes of four submariners in october 1942 two main targets of attack uss chicago and hmas canberra were both lost within next year canberra sinking on 9 august 1942 during battle of savo island and chicago on 30 january 1943 following battle of rennell island none of japanese submarines involved in attack survived war and sank i 21 on 5 february 1944 off marshall islands an american torpedo boat sank i 22 on 25 december 1942 off new guinea an american patrol craft sank i 24 on 10 june 1943 near aleutian islands and sank i 27 on 12 february 1943 off maldives lastly sank i 29 on 26 july 1944 in philippines m 14 and m 21 thumb composite midget submarine at australian war memorial in 2007 allies located and recovered m 21 on 3 june and m 14 on 8 june although both were damaged during attack it was possible to assemble a complete submarine from two vessels centre section of rebuilt submarine was mounted on a trailer and taken on a tour throughout southern new south wales victoria and western south australia purpose of tour was twofold it allowed australians to see a japanese midget submarine up close and was used to raise 000 for naval relief fund and other charities submarine arrived at australian war memorial in canberra on 28 april 1943 flying white ensign and a paying off pennant submarine was originally displayed outside museum in three separate pieces but was moved inside in 1980s due to heavy vandalism on one occasion in 1966 a group of university students painted it bright yellow in response to beatles song yellow submarine composite submarine was restored and remains on display inside memorial as part of a permanent exhibition on attack next to recovered wheelhouse of hmas kuttabul conning tower from m 21 is on display at royal australian navy heritage centre on garden island leftover material from m 21 was melted down and made into souvenirs following construction of combined vessel m 24 thumb left submarine m 22 conning tower on display at ran heritage centre sydney over 64 years following disappearance of m 24 after attacks more than 50 people approached royal australian navy claiming to have found submarine all of these claims were found to be false one early theory about midget s fate was that it was damaged or destroyed along with m 21 in or around taylors bay which would account for reports from steady hour and yarroma of multiple submarines during their three hour attack against m 21 a second theory was that midget attempted to return to mother submarines but exhausted its battery power before reaching port hacking recovery point and would therefore be outside and to south of sydney heads third theory was that midget s crew decided to avoid endangering five larger submarines during recovery process and either ran straight out to sea or headed north a group of seven amateur scuba divers solved mystery in november 2006 when they found a small submarine sitting upright on seabed below sea level and approximately from head off sydney s northern beaches commander shane moore officer responsible for royal australian navy s heritage collection confirmed that wreck was m 24 after viewing footage from multiple dives along with measurements group had taken wreck had several bullet holes in it most likely from chicagos quadruple machine gun mount location of wreck was kept secret by both divers and navy with defence minister brendan nelson promising to have wreck protected as a war grave wreck was gazetted on 1 december 2006 as a heritage site a exclusion zone was established around wreck site and any vessel entering zone is liable to a fine under new south wales law of up to a 1 1 million with additional fines and confiscation of equipment under commonwealth law shore and buoy mounted surveillance cameras and a sonar listening device further protect site on 7 february

survivors from kuttabul and dignitaries and military personnel from australia and japan attended another ceremony on 6 august 2007 at hmas kuttabul then carried relatives of m 24s crew to wreck site where they poured sake into sea before being presented with sand taken from seabed around submarine in may 2012 nsw state government announced that with approval of japanese government and submariners
