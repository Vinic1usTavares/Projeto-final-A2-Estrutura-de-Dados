near end of scene marino turns a cartoonish character into something real and menacing in addition he thought that marino s performance in scene effectively blurred lines of comedy and drama on show of vice and men was one of highlights of season three for thomas he was especially proud of scene in which veronica is drugged which was created to give show an interesting visual sequence an aspect of production which thomas thought was too often neglected on veronica mars episode also marks final appearance in series by laura san giacomo who appeared on three episodes of veronica mars in total

of ign gave episode an 8 out of 10 indicating that it was great while calling veronica not likable at all in episode he praised second half of episode particularly final sequence involving a drugged veronica he wrote veronica mars seems to slowly be getting back on track there are still some problems to be sure but this week s episode was a good one and most notably built towards some very strong scenes in second half price peterson writing for tv com was also positive towards episode writing this was good i liked all of scenes of piz sleeping on floor and as much as it freaks me out to see veronica in harm s way i shouldn t be watching tv apparently i appreciated forward momentum in this plotline television without pity gave episode an a alan sepinwall on his blog what s alan watching was mixed towards of vice and men writing that episode s focus on mystery of week did not work thematically as veronica did not have a stake in its solving better we get to know supporting characters and closer each arc gets to its conclusion harder it gets to care about stories that don t have a really personal connection for veronica rowan kaiser writing for a v club was very critical of episode naming five ways in which he thought veronica was unlikable in episode simply put veronica spends most of of vice and men acting like she s better and smarter than everyone else of course she is smarter than everyone so that s okay but better sometimes that s justified sometimes it s not elaborating that veronica became increasingly unlikeable in episode he was also negative towards final sequence writing it feels slightly manipulative commenting that show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape references external links of vice and men at mars investigations category 2006
