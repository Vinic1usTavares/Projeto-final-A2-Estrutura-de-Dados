johann sebastian bach composed cantata with peace and joy i depart for use in a lutheran service he composed this chorale cantata in leipzig in 1725 for feast for purification of mary which is celebrated on 2 february and is also known as candlemas cantata is based on martin luther s 1524 hymn and forms part of bach s chorale cantata cycle written to provide sundays and feast days of liturgical year with cantatas based on a related lutheran hymn gospel for feast day presentation of jesus at temple includes simeon s canticle which luther paraphrased in his hymn providing an unusually close relation of hymn and liturgical occasion bach had used single stanzas of hymn in his early funeral cantata and in cantatas of his first leipzig cycle in format of chorale cantata cycle an unknown librettist retained first and last of luther s four stanzas while he paraphrased inner stanzas in this cantata he also used original text of second stanza interspersed with his words as third movement a recitative after he paraphrased same ideas for second movement an aria librettist derived text for two more movements from luther s third stanza bach structured cantata in six movements framing four movements for soloists by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale he scored work for three vocal soloists a four part choir and a baroque ensemble consisting of horn flauto traverso oboe oboe d amore strings and basso continuo opening chorus has been compared to opening movement of bach s st matthew passion in third movement bach sets single lines from hymn s second stanza differently from commentary in librettist s words but unifies both elements by a continuous motif of joy in accompaniment background chorale cantata cycle in 1723 bach was appointed as thomaskantor director of church music in leipzig he was employed by town of leipzig to this position which made him responsible for music at four churches and for training and education of boys singing in thomanerchor cantata music had to be provided for two major churches thomaskirche st thomas and nikolaikirche st nicholas simpler church music for two others neue kirche new church and st peter bach took office in middle of liturgical year on first sunday after trinity in leipzig cantata music was expected on sundays and on feast days except during silent periods tempus clausum of advent and lent in his first twelve months in office bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events these works became known as his first cantata cycle year after he continued that effort composing a cycle of chorale cantatas with each cantata based on one lutheran hymn including mit fried und freud ich fahr dahin for these occasions choice of hymns to use in series of chorale cantatas was probably made according to wishes of a local minister who based choice upon prescribed readings and his plans for sermons luther s hymns thumb upright alt portrait of luther by painter

todes banden bwv 4 probably in 1707 during his chorale cantata cycle bach used a hymn by luther as basis for a cantata on nine occasions additionally he performed christ lag in todes banden again

during his career he had included earlier in a cantata for advent alles was von gott bwv 80a which he reworked as a chorale cantata for reformation day bwv 80 he finally composed for fourth sunday after epiphany in 1735 bach s chorale cantata structure bach followed a specific structure for most of cantatas in this cycle he deviated from using strophic hymn text and tune in all stanzas per omnes versus as he had in instead he retained original text and melody only in outer stanzas typically treating first as a chorale fantasia and last as a four part chorale setting while inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as basis for recitatives and arias often with music independent of hymn tune andreas 1653 1725 a former headmaster of thomasschule may have been this librettist readings

celebrated annunciation 25 march visitation 2 july and purification 2 february prescribed readings for feast of purification german were from book of malachi s lord will come to his temple and gospel of luke s version of purification of mary and presentation of jesus at temple which includes simeon s canticle when luther wrote his hymn on simeon s canticle with peace and joy i depart in god s will he devoted one stanza to each of four verses of biblical text first verse discusses peaceful acceptance of death second gives as a reason for that meeting with saviour third is focused on christ s return for all people fourth sees second coming as a light for heathen and glory for israel lines are of different length with a metre of 8 4 8 4 7 7 stressing single statements in short lines tune first appeared in 1524 in johann walter s choral hymnal luther wrote commentary on his hymn bach first used hymn as part of his early funeral cantata alto singing first stanza juxtaposed to a bass arioso heute du mit mir im paradies sein he returned to it twice for his first leipzig cantata cycle first stanza was basis for his cantata for 16th sunday after trinity of 1723 along with first stanza of funeral hymn in opening movement for tenor second occasion was in 1724 in purification cantata which he closed with fourth and final stanza for mit fried und freud ich fahr dahin a librettist retained first and last stanza and paraphrased two inner stanzas to four movements second movement based on luther s second stanza is focused on simeon s perspective as a means of how to anticipate one s own death third movement interweaves luther s complete text with a free recitative bach scholar klaus hofmann notes that librettist had room to add his own text because luther s hymn is rather short allusion to light for heathen from gospel and hymn refers to he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved luther s third stanza forms basis for fourth and fifth movements fourth movement refers to paul s teaching about grace of god whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for remission of sins that are past through forbearance of god it declares lutheran teaching of justification by grace alone through faith alone because of christ alone even more clearly than luther s song bach led first performance with thomanerchor in morning service at nikolaikirche on 2 february 1725 and reprised it in vesper service in thomaskirche as was usual in leipzig on high holidays bach performed it at least one more time

gesangbuch of 1545 with an illustration of presentation at temple opening chorus with peace and joy i depart in god s will begins with a concertante ritornello in which flute and oboe play opposed to strings a motif in triplets has first a leap of a fifth related to first interval of chorale tune fifth and triplet motion dominate entire movement soprano sings in long notes hofmann notes that dorian mode within instrumental concerto in e minor adds a slightly archaic flavour lower voices participate in instrumental motifs for lines 1 2 3 and 5 but lines 4 and 6 are treated differently in accordance to text und stille calm and quiet and der tod ist mein schlaf worden death has become my sleep they are performed softly piano in homophony chromatic and modulating to distant keys durr notes movement s extremely dense highly expressive texture with motifs independent from hymn tune but derived from its beginning bach scholar richard d p jones observes that movement foreshadows opening chorus of bach s st matthew passion in key 12 8 metre and much else 2 alto aria even with broken eyes i will look for you my loving savior is a sarabande with slow dotted rhythms vocal line is accompanied by flute and oboe d amore on a foundation of repeated notes in continuo marked legato phrase broken eyes is pictured by a broken vocal line flute and oboe d amore play dotted rhythm to almost trembling declamation of voice hofmann notes movement s emotions of grief and lamentation while durr writes rich suspension appoggiaturas and other ornaments reveal that an expressive interpretation of this movement lay particularly close to composer s heart 3 bass recitative begins with a thought of librettist o wonder that a heart before flesh abhorred tomb and even pain of death does not recoil text continues with beginning of hymn s second stanza christ god s true son does this loving savior pattern of comment and original is retained throughout movement in a hybrid text that holds in single lines complete text of second stanza bach sets elements recitative and chorale differently rendering librettist s text in rhythmically free diction of recitative and chorale as arioso he unifies movement by a continuous motif in strings called by durr which always indicates an underlying mood of happiness chorale tune is unadorned but for last line in death and also in dying where music is extended by two measures and coloured in chromatic and rich ornamentation and strings cease to play constant motif and accompany in tranquil notes 4 tenor and bass duet an unfathomable light fills entire orb of earth is focused on light mentioned by simeon expressed in a joyful mood hofmann notes playful character is shown by extended circling coloratura on word kreis circle or orb and baroque sound effect of statement and response unfolds to words es fort und fort powerfully there rings out time after time jones comments that trio sonata of two violins and continuo which accompanies voices in its vigour and fluency perhaps represents powerful continuous sound to which text refers 5 alto expresses in a secco recitative o uncreated hoard of goodness which hofmann calls a concise theological analysis 6 closing chorale he is salvation and blessed light is a four part setting of hymn tune horn flute an octave higher oboe and first violin all reinforce soprano part
