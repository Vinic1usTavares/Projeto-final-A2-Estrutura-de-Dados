egyptian mythology it concerns murder of god osiris a primeval king of egypt and its consequences osiris s murderer his brother set usurps his throne meanwhile osiris s wife isis restores her husband s body allowing him to posthumously conceive their son horus remainder of story focuses on horus product of union of isis and osiris who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes set s rival for throne their often violent conflict ends with horus s triumph which restores maat cosmic and social order to egypt after set s unrighteous reign and completes process of osiris s resurrection myth with its complex symbolism is integral to ancient egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession conflict between order and disorder and especially death and afterlife it also expresses essential character of each of four deities at its center and many elements of their worship in ancient egyptian religion were derived from myth osiris myth reached its basic form in or before 24th century bce many of its elements originated in religious ideas but struggle between horus and set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in egypt s early dynastic or prehistoric egypt scholars have tried to discern exact nature of events that gave rise to story but they have reached no definitive conclusions parts of myth appear in a wide variety of egyptian texts from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories story is therefore more detailed and more cohesive than any other ancient egyptian myth yet no egyptian source gives a full account of myth and sources vary widely in their versions of events greek and roman writings particularly on isis and osiris by plutarch provide more information but may not always accurately reflect egyptian beliefs through these writings osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient egyptian beliefs was lost and it is still well known today sources ancient egyptian narrative of osiris speaks of deity being deeply influential in ancient egyptian religion and he was popular among ordinary people one reason for this popularity is its primary religious meaning which implies that any dead person can reach a pleasant afterlife another reason is that characters and their emotions are more reminiscent of lives of real people than those in most egyptian myths making story more appealing to general populace in particular myth conveys a strong sense of family loyalty and devotion as egyptologist j gwyn griffiths put it in relationships between osiris isis and horus with this widespread appeal myth appears in more ancient texts than any other myth and in an exceptionally broad range of egyptian literary styles these sources also provide an unusual amount of detail ancient egyptian myths are fragmentary and vague religious metaphors contained within myths were more important than coherent narration each text that contains a myth or a fragment of one may adapt myth to suit its particular purposes so different texts can contain contradictory versions of events because osiris myth was used in such a variety of ways versions often conflict with each other nevertheless fragmentary versions taken together give it a greater resemblance to a cohesive story than most egyptian myths thumb right 300px alt wall covered with columns of carved hieroglyphic text pyramid texts in pyramid of teti earliest mentions of osiris myth are in pyramid texts first egyptian funerary texts which appeared on walls of burial chambers in pyramids at end of fifth dynasty during 24th century bce these texts made up of disparate spells or utterances contain ideas that are presumed to date from still earlier times texts are concerned with afterlife of king buried in pyramid so they frequently refer to osiris myth which is deeply involved with kingship and afterlife major elements of story such as death and restoration of osiris and strife between horus and set appear in utterances of pyramid texts funerary texts written in later times such as coffin texts from middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bce and book of dead from new kingdom c 1550 1070 bce also contain elements of myth other types of religious texts give evidence for myth such as two middle kingdom texts dramatic ramesseum papyrus and stela papyrus describes coronation of i whereas stela alludes to events in annual festival of khoiak rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of osiris myth most complete ancient egyptian account of myth is great hymn to osiris an inscription from eighteenth dynasty c 1550 1292 bce that gives general outline of entire story but includes little detail another important source is memphite theology a religious narrative that includes an account of osiris s death as well as resolution of dispute between horus and set this narrative associates kingship that osiris and horus represent with ptah creator deity of memphis text was long thought to date back to old kingdom c 2686 2181 bce and was treated as a source for information about early stages in development of myth since 1970s however egyptologists have concluded that text dates to new kingdom at earliest rituals in honor of osiris are another major source of information some of these texts are found on walls of temples that date from new kingdom ptolemaic era 323 30 bce or roman era 30 bce to fourth century ad some of these late ritual texts in which isis and nephthys lament their brother s death were adapted into funerary texts in these texts goddesses pleas were meant to rouse osiris and thus deceased person to live again magical healing spells which were used by egyptians of all classes are source for an important portion of myth in which horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened and isis heals him spells identify a sick person with horus so that he or she can benefit from goddess s efforts spells are known from papyrus copies which serve as instructions for healing rituals and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus people seeking healing poured water over these cippi an act that was believed to imbue water with healing power contained in text and then drank water in hope of curing their ailments theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from middle kingdom which were made centuries before more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with osiris myth episodes from myth were also recorded in writings that may have been intended as entertainment prominent among these texts is contendings of horus and set a humorous retelling of several episodes of struggle between two deities which dates to twentieth dynasty c 1190 1070 bce it vividly characterizes deities involved as egyptologist donald b redford says horus appears as a physically weak but clever puck like figure seth set as a strong man buffoon of limited intelligence re horakhty ra as a prejudiced sulky judge and osiris as an articulate curmudgeon with an acid tongue despite its atypical nature contendings includes many of oldest episodes in divine conflict and many events appear in same order as in much later accounts suggesting that a traditional sequence of events was forming at time that story was written ancient greek and roman writers who described egyptian religion late in its history recorded much of osiris myth herodotus in 5th century bce mentioned parts of myth in his description of egypt in histories and four centuries later diodorus siculus provided a summary of myth in his bibliotheca historica in early 2nd century ad plutarch wrote most complete ancient account of myth in on isis and osiris an analysis of egyptian religious beliefs plutarch s account of myth is version that modern popular writings most frequently retell writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of egyptian beliefs for instance on isis and osiris includes many interpretations of egyptian belief that are influenced by various greek philosophies and its account of myth contains portions with no known parallel in egyptian tradition griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from greek mythology and that work as a whole was not based directly on egyptian sources his colleague john baines on other hand says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths which later were lost and that plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative synopsis death and resurrection of osiris at start of story osiris rules egypt having inherited kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to creator of world ra or atum his queen is isis who along with osiris and his murderer set is one of children of earth god geb and sky goddess nut little information about reign of osiris appears in egyptian sources focus is on his death and events that follow osiris is connected with life giving power righteous kingship and rule of maat ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient egyptian culture set is closely associated with violence and chaos therefore slaying of osiris symbolizes struggle between order and disorder and disruption of life by death some versions of myth provide set s motive for killing osiris according to a spell in pyramid texts set is taking revenge for a kick osiris gave him whereas in a late period text set s grievance is that osiris had sex with nephthys who is set s consort and fourth child of geb and nut murder itself is frequently alluded to but never clearly described egyptians believed that written words had power to affect reality so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as osiris s death sometimes they denied his death altogether even though bulk of traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered in some cases texts suggest that set takes form of a wild animal such as a crocodile or bull to slay osiris in others they imply that osiris s corpse is thrown in water or that he is drowned this latter tradition is origin of egyptian belief that people who had drowned in nile were sacred even identity of victim is changeable in texts as it is sometimes god haroeris an elder form of horus who is murdered by set and then avenged by another form of horus who is haroeris s son by isis by end of new kingdom a tradition had developed that set had cut osiris s body into pieces and scattered them across egypt cult centers of osiris all over country claimed that corpse or particular pieces of it were found near them dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty two each piece being equated with one of forty two or provinces in egypt thus god of kingship becomes embodiment of his kingdom thumb right 300px alt relief of a man wearing a tall crown lying on a bier as a bird hovers over his phallus a falcon headed man stands at foot of bier and a woman with a headdress like a tall chair stands at head isis in form of a bird copulates with deceased osiris at either side are horus although he is as yet unborn and isis in human form osiris s death is followed either by an interregnum or by a period in which set assumes kingship meanwhile isis searches for her husband s body with aid of nephthys when searching for or mourning osiris two goddesses are often likened to falcons or kites possibly because kites travel far in search of carrion because egyptians associated their plaintive calls with cries of grief or because of goddesses connection with horus who is often represented as a falcon in new kingdom when osiris s death and renewal came to be associated with annual flooding of nile that fertilized egypt waters of nile were equated with isis s tears of mourning and or with osiris s bodily fluids osiris thus represented life giving divine power that was present in river s water and in plants that grew after flood goddesses find and restore osiris s body often with help of other deities including thoth a deity credited with great magical and healing powers and anubis god of embalming and funerary rites osiris becomes first mummy and gods efforts to restore his body are mythological basis for egyptian embalming practices which sought to prevent and reverse decay that follows death this part of story is often extended with episodes in which set or his followers try to damage corpse and isis and her allies must protect it once osiris is made whole isis conceives his son and rightful heir horus one ambiguous spell in coffin texts may indicate that isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning while in other sources isis still in bird form fans breath and life into osiris s body with her wings and copulates with him osiris s revival is apparently not permanent and after this point in story he is only mentioned as ruler of duat distant and mysterious realm of dead although he lives on only in duat he and kingship he stands for will in a sense be reborn in his son cohesive account by plutarch which deals mainly with this portion of myth differs in many respects from known egyptian sources set whom plutarch using greek names for many of egyptian deities refers to as typhon conspires against osiris with seventy two unspecified accomplices as well as a queen from ancient nubia set has an elaborate chest made to fit osiris s exact measurements and then at a banquet declares that he will give chest as a gift to whoever fits inside it guests in turn lie inside coffin but none fit inside except osiris when he lies down in chest set and his accomplices slam cover shut seal it and throw it into nile with osiris s corpse inside chest floats out into sea arriving at city of byblos where a tree grows around it king of byblos has tree cut down and made into a pillar for his palace still with chest inside isis must remove chest from within tree in order to retrieve her husband s body having taken chest she leaves tree in byblos where it becomes an object of worship for locals this episode which is not known from egyptian sources gives an etiological explanation for a cult of isis and osiris that existed in byblos in plutarch s time and possibly as early as new kingdom plutarch also states that set steals and dismembers corpse only after isis has retrieved it isis then finds and buries each piece of her husband s body with exception of penis which she has to reconstruct with magic because original was eaten by fish in river according to plutarch this is reason egyptians had a taboo against eating fish in egyptian accounts however penis of osiris is found intact and only close parallel with this part of plutarch s story is in tale of two brothers a folk tale from new kingdom with similarities to osiris myth a final difference in plutarch s account is horus s birth form of horus that avenges his father has been conceived and born before osiris s death it is a premature and weak second child harpocrates who is born from osiris s posthumous union with isis here two of separate forms of horus that exist in egyptian tradition have been given distinct positions within plutarch s version of myth birth and childhood of horus thumb left alt small statue of a seated woman with a headdress of horns and a disk holding an infant across her lap isis nursing horus in egyptian accounts pregnant isis hides from set to whom unborn child is a threat in a thicket of papyrus in nile delta this place is called akh meaning papyrus thicket of king of lower egypt in egyptian greek writers call this place and indicate that it is near city of buto but in myth physical location is less important than its nature as an iconic place of seclusion and safety thicket s special status is indicated by its frequent depiction in egyptian art for most events in egyptian mythology backdrop is minimally described or illustrated in this thicket isis gives birth to horus and raises him and hence it is also called nest of horus image of isis nursing her child is a very common motif in egyptian art there are texts in which isis travels in wider world she moves among ordinary humans who are unaware of her identity and she even appeals to these people for help this is another unusual circumstance for in egyptian myth gods and humans are normally separate as in first phase of myth she often has aid of other deities who protect her son in her absence according to one magical spell seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard isis as she seeks help for horus they even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help isis by stinging woman s son making it necessary for isis to heal blameless child this story conveys a moral message that poor can be more virtuous than wealthy and illustrates isis s fair and compassionate nature in this stage of myth horus is a vulnerable child beset by dangers magical texts that use horus s childhood as basis for their healing spells give him different ailments from scorpion stings to simple adapting tradition to fit malady that each spell was intended to treat most commonly child god has been bitten by a snake reflecting egyptians fear of snakebite and resulting poison some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of set isis may use her own magical powers to save her child or she may plead with or threaten deities such as ra or geb so they will cure him as she is archetypal mourner in first portion of story so during horus s childhood she is ideal devoted mother through magical healing texts her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient conflict of horus and set next phase of myth begins when adult horus challenges set for throne of egypt contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before ennead an assembled group of egyptian deities to decide who should inherit kingship judge in this trial may be geb who as father of osiris and set held throne before they did or it may be creator gods ra or atum originators of kingship other deities also take important roles thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in dispute or as an assistant to divine judge and in contendings isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son rivalry of horus and set is portrayed in two contrasting ways both perspectives appear as early as pyramid texts earliest source of myth in some spells from these texts horus is son of osiris and nephew of set and murder of osiris is major impetus for conflict other tradition depicts horus and set as brothers this incongruity persists in many of subsequent sources where two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in same text thumb right alt relief of a falcon headed man standing on a hippopotamus and driving a spear into its head as a woman stands behind them horus spears set who appears in form of a hippopotamus as isis looks on divine struggle involves many episodes contendings describes two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate dispute and competing in different types of contests such as racing in boats or fighting each other in form of hippopotami to determine a victor in this account horus repeatedly defeats set and is supported by most of other deities yet dispute drags on for eighty years largely because judge creator god favors set in late ritual texts conflict is characterized as a great battle involving two deities assembled followers strife in divine realm extends beyond two combatants at one point isis attempts to harpoon set as he is locked in combat with her son but she strikes horus instead who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage thoth replaces isis s head with that of a cow story gives a mythical origin for cow horn headdress that isis commonly wears in a key episode in conflict set sexually abuses horus set s violation is partly meant to degrade his rival but it also involves homosexual desire in keeping with one of set s major characteristics his forceful and indiscriminate sexuality in earliest account of this episode in a fragmentary middle kingdom papyrus sexual encounter begins when set asks to have sex with horus who agrees on condition that set will give horus some of his strength encounter puts horus in danger because in egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance akin to poison according to some texts set s semen enters horus s body and makes him ill but in contendings horus thwarts set by catching set s semen in his hands isis retaliates by putting horus s semen on lettuce leaves that set eats set s defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk he has been impregnated with his rival s seed and as a result gives birth to disk in contendings thoth takes disk and places it on his own head other accounts imply that thoth himself was produced by this anomalous birth another important episode concerns mutilations that combatants inflict upon each other horus injures or steals set s testicles and set damages or tears out one or occasionally both of horus s eyes sometimes eye is torn into pieces set s mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength removal of horus s eye is even more important for this stolen eye of horus represents a wide variety of concepts in egyptian religion one of horus s major roles is as a sky deity and for this reason his right eye was said to be sun and his left eye moon theft or destruction of eye of horus is therefore equated with darkening of moon in course of its cycle of phases or during eclipses horus may take back his lost eye or other deities including isis thoth and hathor may retrieve or heal it for him egyptologist herman te velde argues that tradition about lost testicles is a late variation on set s loss of semen to horus and that moon like disk that emerges from set s head after his impregnation is eye of horus if so episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story in which set assaults horus and loses semen to him horus retaliates and impregnates set and set comes into possession of horus s eye when it appears on set s head because thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions it would make sense according to te velde for thoth to emerge in form of eye and step in to mediate between feuding deities in any case restoration of eye of horus to wholeness represents return of moon to full brightness return of kingship to horus and many other aspects of maat sometimes restoration of horus s eye is accompanied by restoration of set s testicles so that both gods are made whole near conclusion of their feud resolution as with so many other parts of myth resolution is complex and varied often horus and set divide realm between them this division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that egyptians saw in their world horus may receive fertile lands around nile core of egyptian civilization in which case set takes barren desert or foreign lands that are associated with it horus may rule earth while set dwells in sky and each god may take one of two traditional halves of country upper and lower egypt in which case either god may be connected with either region yet in memphite theology geb as judge first realm between claimants and then reverses himself awarding sole control to horus in this peaceable union horus and set are reconciled and dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole through this resolution order is restored after tumultuous conflict a different view of myth s end focuses on horus s sole triumph in this version set is not reconciled with his rival but utterly defeated and sometimes he is exiled from egypt or even destroyed his defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of egyptian history when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil and egyptians no longer saw him as an integral part of natural order with great celebration among gods horus takes throne and egypt at last has a rightful king divine decision that set is in wrong corrects injustice created by osiris s murder and completes process of his restoration after death sometimes set is made to carry osiris s body to its tomb as part of his punishment new king performs funerary rites for his father and gives food offerings to sustain him often including eye of horus which in this instance represents life and plenty according to some sources only through these acts can osiris be fully enlivened in afterlife and take his place as king of dead paralleling his son s role as king of living thereafter osiris is deeply involved with natural cycles of death and renewal such as annual growth of crops that parallel his own resurrection origins as osiris myth first appears in pyramid texts most of its essential features must have taken shape sometime before texts were written down distinct segments of story osiris s death and restoration horus s childhood and horus s conflict with set may originally have been independent mythic episodes if so they must have begun to coalesce into a single story by time of pyramid texts which loosely connect those segments in any case myth was inspired by a variety of influences much of story is based in religious ideas and general nature of egyptian society divine nature of kingship succession from one king to another struggle to maintain maat and effort to overcome death for instance lamentations of isis and nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning there are however important points of disagreement origins of osiris are much debated and basis for myth of his death is also somewhat uncertain one influential hypothesis was given by anthropologist james frazer who in 1906 said that osiris like other dying and rising gods across ancient near east began as a personification of vegetation his death and restoration therefore were based on yearly death and re growth of plants many egyptologists adopted this explanation but in late 20th century j gwyn griffiths who extensively studied osiris and his mythology argued that osiris originated as a divine ruler of dead and his connection with vegetation was a secondary development meanwhile scholars of comparative religion have criticized overarching concept of dying and rising gods or at least frazer s assumption that all these gods closely fit same pattern more recently egyptologist rosalie david maintains that osiris originally personified annual rebirth of trees and plants after nile inundation thumb right alt relief of a man with an elaborate crown between two figures who gesture toward crown figure on left has head of an animal with square ears and a long nose while one on right has a falcon s head horus and set as supporters of king another continuing debate concerns opposition of horus and set which egyptologists have often tried to connect with political events early in egypt s history or prehistory cases in which combatants divide kingdom and frequent association of paired horus and set with union of upper and lower egypt suggest that two deities represent some kind of division within country egyptian tradition and archaeological evidence indicate that egypt was united at beginning of its history when an upper egyptian kingdom in south conquered lower egypt in north upper egyptian rulers called themselves followers of horus and horus became patron god of unified nation and its kings yet horus and set cannot be easily equated with two halves of country both deities had several cult centers in each region and horus is often associated with lower egypt and set with upper egypt one of better known explanations for these discrepancies was proposed by kurt sethe in 1930 he argued that osiris was originally human ruler of a unified egypt in prehistoric times before a rebellion of upper egyptian set worshippers lower egyptian followers of horus then forcibly reunified land inspiring myth of horus s triumph before upper egypt now led by horus worshippers became prominent again at start of early dynastic period in late 20th century griffiths focused on inconsistent portrayal of horus and set as brothers and as uncle and nephew he argued that in early stages of egyptian mythology struggle between horus and set as siblings and equals was originally separate from murder of osiris two stories were joined into single osiris myth sometime before writing of pyramid texts with this merging genealogy of deities involved and characterization of horus set conflict were altered so that horus is son and heir avenging osiris s death traces of independent traditions remained in conflicting characterizations of combatants relationship and in texts unrelated to osiris myth which make horus son of goddess nut or goddess hathor rather than of isis and osiris griffiths therefore rejected possibility that osiris s murder was rooted in historical events this hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as jan assmann and george hart griffiths sought a historical origin for horus set rivalry and he posited two distinct predynastic of egypt by horus worshippers similar to sethe s theory to account for it yet issue remains unresolved partly because other political associations for horus and set complicate picture further before even upper egypt had a single ruler two of its major cities were nekhen in far south and naqada many miles to north rulers of nekhen where horus was patron deity are generally believed to have unified upper egypt including naqada under their sway set was associated with naqada so it is possible that divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between cities in distant past much later at end of second dynasty c 2890 2686 bce king peribsen used set animal in writing his serekh name in place of traditional falcon hieroglyph representing horus his successor khasekhemwy used both horus and set in writing of his serekh this evidence has prompted conjecture that second dynasty saw a clash between followers of horus king and worshippers of set led by peribsen khasekhemwy s use of two animal symbols would then represent reconciliation of two factions as does resolution of myth noting uncertainty surrounding these events herman te velde argues that historical roots of conflict are too obscure to be very useful in understanding myth and are not as significant as its religious meaning he says that origin of myth of horus and seth is lost in mists of religious traditions of prehistory influence effect of osiris myth on egyptian culture was greater and more widespread than that of any other myth in literature myth was not only basis for a retelling such as contendings it also provided basis for more distantly related stories tale of two brothers a folk tale with human protagonists includes elements similar to myth of osiris one character s penis is eaten by a fish and he later dies and is resurrected another story tale of truth and falsehood adapts conflict of horus and set into an allegory in which characters are direct personifications of truth and lies rather than deities associated with those concepts osiris and funerary ritual thumb right alt fresco of a crowned man holding a curved stick like implement in front of a man in mummy wrappings opening of mouth ceremony a key funerary ritual performed for tutankhamun by his successor ay deceased king takes on role of osiris upon whom horus was supposed to have performed ceremony from at least time of pyramid texts kings hoped that after their deaths they could emulate osiris s restoration to life and his rule over realm of dead by early middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bce non royal egyptians believed that they too could overcome death as osiris had by worshipping him and receiving funerary rites that were partly based on his myth osiris thus became egypt s most important afterlife deity myth also influenced notion which grew prominent in new kingdom that only virtuous people could reach afterlife as assembled deities judged osiris and horus to be in right undoing injustice of osiris s death so a deceased soul had to be judged righteous in order for his or her death to be undone as ruler of land of dead and as a god connected with maat osiris became judge in this posthumous trial offering life after death to those who followed his example new kingdom funerary texts such as amduat and book of gates liken ra himself to a deceased soul in them he travels through duat and unites with osiris to be reborn at dawn thus osiris was not only believed to enable rebirth for dead he renewed sun source of life and maat and thus renewed world itself as importance of osiris grew so did his popularity by late in middle kingdom centuries old tomb of first dynasty ruler near osiris s main center of worship in city of abydos was seen as osiris s tomb accordingly it became a major focus of osiris worship for next 1 500 years an annual festival procession traveled from osiris s main temple to tomb site kings and commoners from across egypt built chapels which served as cenotaphs near processional route in doing so they sought to strengthen their connection with osiris in afterlife another major funerary festival a national event spread over several days in month of khoiak in egyptian calendar became linked with osiris during middle kingdom during khoiak djed pillar an emblem of osiris was ritually raised into an upright position symbolizing osiris s restoration by ptolemaic times 305 30 bce khoiak also included planting of seeds in an osiris bed a mummy shaped bed of soil connecting resurrection of osiris with seasonal growth of plants horus eye of horus and kingship myth s religious importance extended beyond funerary sphere mortuary offerings in which family members or hired priests presented food to deceased were logically linked with mythological offering of eye of horus to osiris by analogy this episode of myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in divine realm in temple offering rituals officiating priest took on role of horus gifts to deity became eye of horus and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with osiris myth influenced popular religion as well one example is magical healing spells based on horus s childhood another is use of eye of horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose as a general symbol of well being ideology surrounding living king was also affected by osiris myth egyptians envisioned events of osiris myth as taking place sometime in egypt s dim prehistory and osiris horus and their divine predecessors were included in egyptian lists of past kings such as turin royal canon horus as a primeval king and as personification of kingship was regarded as predecessor and exemplar for all egyptian rulers his assumption of his father s throne and pious actions to sustain his spirit in afterlife were model for all pharaonic successions to emulate each new king was believed to renew maat after death of preceding king just as horus had done in royal coronations rituals alluded to osiris s burial and hymns celebrated new king s accession as equivalent of horus s own set osiris myth contributed to frequent characterization of set as a disruptive harmful god although other elements of egyptian tradition credit set with positive traits in osiris myth sinister aspects of his character predominate he and horus were often juxtaposed in art to represent opposite principles such as good and evil intellect and instinct and different regions of world that they rule in myth egyptian wisdom texts contrast character of ideal person with opposite type calm and sensible silent one and impulsive disruptive hothead and one description of these two characters calls them horus type and set type yet two gods were often treated as part of a harmonious whole in some local cults they were worshipped together in art they were often shown tying together emblems of upper and lower egypt to symbolize unity of nation and in funerary texts they appear as a single deity with heads of horus and set apparently representing mysterious all encompassing nature of duat overall set was viewed with ambivalence until during first millennium bce he came to be seen as a totally malevolent deity this transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by osiris myth nevertheless in these late times widespread temple rituals involving ceremonial annihilation of set were often connected with myth isis nephthys and greco roman world both isis and nephthys were seen as protectors of dead in afterlife because of their protection and restoration of osiris s body motif of isis and nephthys protecting osiris or mummy of deceased person was very common in funerary art khoiak celebrations made reference to and may have ritually reenacted isis s and nephthys s mourning restoration and revival of their murdered brother as horus s mother isis was also mother of every king according to royal ideology and kings were said to have nursed at her breast as a symbol of their divine legitimacy her appeal to general populace was based in her protective character as exemplified by magical healing spells in late period she was credited with ever greater magical power and her maternal devotion was believed to extend to everyone by roman times she had become most important goddess in egypt image of goddess holding her child was used prominently in her worship for example in panel paintings that were used in household shrines dedicated to her isis s iconography in these paintings closely resembles and may have influenced earliest christian icons of mary holding jesus in late centuries bce worship of isis spread from egypt across mediterranean world and she became one of most popular deities in region although this new multicultural form of isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal horus and osiris being central figures in her story spread along with her greek and roman cult of isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to isis and osiris based on earlier greco roman mystery rites but colored by egyptian afterlife beliefs initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into underworld elements of this ritual resemble osiris s merging with sun in egyptian funerary texts isis s greek and roman devotees like egyptians believed that she protected dead in afterlife as she had done for osiris and they said that undergoing initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife it was to a greek priestess of isis that plutarch wrote his account of myth of osiris through work of classical writers such as plutarch knowledge of osiris myth was preserved even after middle of first millennium ad when egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of writing systems that were originally used to record myth were lost myth remained a major part of western impressions of ancient egypt in modern times when understanding of egyptian beliefs is informed by original egyptian sources story continues to influence and inspire new ideas from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and new religious movements citations works cited
