at university college southampton salmon pool at south stoneham was retained by montagu family becoming part of townhill park estate tradition prevailed in house with a collegiate atmosphere as gowns were expected to be worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced by 1924 there was distinct pressure on space in halls of residence and it was clear that more rooms were needed existing halls were full and so south stoneham and south hill were extended by covering their outbuildings during second world war highfield location of college meant it was directly in war zone itself with southampton being attacked halls of residence were also at risk at south stoneham windows were blown in by bombs school of navigation at college was relocated to communal rooms of south stoneham house for duration of war and afterwards was moved to warsash in 1970 school became independent of university instead it is affiliated to southampton solent university and is known as warsash maritime

ate originally in south stoneham s own dining hall part of 1960s extension and later in galley restaurant in neighbouring connaught hall residents shared small kitchen and bathroom facilities in 2002 accommodation in tower was criticised partly due to overcrowding but also regarding state of building itself with inhabitants living in what daily telegraph described as damp and squalid conditions complex was last fully occupied in 2005 but was partially occupied until 2009 with dining hall staying in use until 2015 dereliction restoration and redevelopment proposals 2005 to present day much controversy has surrounded continuous use of south stoneham tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar was added to base of tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below tower s construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of south stoneham site physical disassembly would be hugely expensive while explosives cannot be used due to proximity of private houses and grade ii listed original building indeed because tower and kitchen dining hall complex are physically linked to original house by a glazed connection whole site including tower shares listed building status nevertheless university commissioned a firm of architects to create a listed building consent application for tower and kitchen and dining hall complex to be demolished with resulting report being published in 2004 application stated that demolition was part of a master plan which seeks to establish reinstatement of south stoneham house to a standard befitting its listed building status key part of master plan is to refurbish and change use of listed building to enable it to function as a conference facility application stated that this would replace university s conference centre at manor to pay for demolition of 1960s extension consent application indicated that university planned to sell off another part of current south stoneham estate currently occupied by a tennis court and caretakers house for a residential scheme comprising 65 flats in addition to replace student accommodation that demolition would remove plan was for another building containing 64 student flats plus staff accommodation to be constructed on eastern part of site thumb tower with scaffolding being erected around it in october 2012the plan also indicated provision of better access to site including new footpaths alongside monks brook and river itchen as well as possibility of handing part of site to city council as a nature conservation area university also planned a series of repairs and alterations to original house listed building consent application for demolition was recommended for approval although some concerns were raised regarding proposed new constructions which were to be detailed in a separate application other applications made at time for demolition of other buildings on site and for refurbishment and change of use of house itself were also recommended for approval thumb house boarded up and derelict in 2018 a 2007 promotional leaflet revealed that
