flashes of silver in this episode she added that she liked moment when hans moleman is hit by homer s car and frantically hammers dislike button as he sails through air hayden childs of a v club thought episode was less successful at satirizing facebook compared to episode holidays of future passed he explained that there is a moment in holidays when lisa steps into future version of internet and is immediately besieged by a mountain of friend requests that was a small yet sharp parody of facebook s ubiquity but d oh cial network lays into same topic with a less deft touch childs added that episode has a few good jokes to keep proceedings moving along but not enough to rescue it from mediocrity he concluded that he thought story ended too fast with lisa shutting down her website and citizens of springfield returning to their everyday technology lacking life that s a bit too quick a turn slapping a moralistic tone onto all of preceding satire david crawford of radio times
