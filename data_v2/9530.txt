up in vegas and lost from one of boys a cover of hackensack by american power pop band fountains of wayne and a new song titled brick by brick perry explained why she sang it during mtv unplugged saying that she related to lyrics of having a loyal lover or friend back home when she s on road though directly song does not narrate any event of perry s life versions performed incorporate lighter

of five stars praising katy for being a hard working music act and seeming more likeable here than she did on her debut though he noted that her flaws were amplified during performance from blogcritics was more positive about set writing that although perry was not best singer out there she made up for it in catchiness and contributor was more negative of acoustic version of i kissed a girl and fact that mtv cut out parts from video recording what i d like to have seen is for mtv to make katy perry enter into an unscripted dialog with fans that are there film whole thing and put that on a dvd then you will really have something unplugged for how can you truly know an artist if we don t see such interactions becky bain from website idolator favored perry s live voice and her natural presentation though she was ambivalent towards decision of giving songs an acoustic treatment she went on to say that mtv unplugged versions of perry s songs were not able to substitute glossy originals simon vozick levinson from entertainment weekly gave live album a d opining that stripped down treatment of mtv unplugged does perry s yowling voice no favors and that songs just aren t solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production catherine lewis of washington post praised perry s translate her more rambunctious numbers into an acoustic format and wrote album
