thumb a contemporary model of udema ingeborg built in 1776 from collections of maritime museum in stockholm an udema also was a type of warship built for swedish archipelago fleet in late 18th and early 19th centuries it was developed for warfare in archipelago sea in baltic and along coasts of and finland against russian navy udema was designed by prolific naval architect fredrik henrik af chapman for use in an area of mostly shallow waters and groups of islands and islets that extend from stockholm all way to gulf of finland udema was of an innovative new design with a single line of guns along ship s centerline a foreshadowing of dreadnought battleships of early 20th century design proved impractical for its time however and only three udemas were built between 1760 and 1776 background alt a side view of a model of a small galley with two masts rigged with lateen triangular sails its outrigger folded up and oars stowed on deck hull above waterline is painted red with decorative details in gold and blue bow has a raised platform armed with 3 small cannons thumb contemporary model of an early 18th century swedish galley from collections of maritime museum in stockholm small galleys like this one were a mainstay of first swedish coastal fleets in early 18th century establishment of russian naval power in baltic challenged interests of sweden one of major powers in baltic swedish empire at time included territory in northern germany all of modern finland and most of baltic states a dominion held together by baltic sea routes russian tsar peter great had established a new capital and naval base in saint petersburg in 1703 during great northern war sweden lost its baltic state territories and suffered from russian raiding in finland and along chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched all way from gulf of finland to capital of stockholm swedes began building inshore flotillas of shallow draft vessels beginning with smaller versions of traditional mediterranean warships galleys most of these were more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams disastrous war with russia 1741 43 and minor involvement in prussia in seven years war 1757 62 showed need for further expansion and development of inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels berg skargardsflottans fartyg typer och utveckling under 1700 och 1800 talet in norman 2012 pp 50 59 traditional galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations but were severely under gunned especially in relation to their large crews a galley with a 250 man crew most of whom were rowers would typically be armed with only one 24 pounder cannon and two 6 pounders all in bow however they were undecked and lacked adequate shelter for rower soldiers great numbers of which succumbed to illness in war of 1741 43 glete 1992 pp 115 116 118 swedish military invested heavily in an archipelago fleet skargardsflottan a separate branch of armed forces that organizationally belonged to army in 1756 it was even officially designated flotta navy of army it was in many ways a highly independent organization that attracted a social and cultural elite and enjoyed protection of gustav iii after his 1772 coup that empowered him as an absolute monarch glete 1992 p 118 several new ships were designed by naval architect fredrik henrik af chapman to bolster hitting power of new swedish maritime forces to provide it with better naval defense and to improve its fire support capabilities during amphibious operations result was four new vessels that combined maneuverability of oar powered galleys with superior rigs and more comfortable living conditions of sailing ships udema pojama turuma and hemmema named after finnish regions of uusimaa in genitive form and tavastia anderson 1962 pp 93 94 all four have been referred to as archipelago frigates in swedish and english historical literature though smaller udema and pojama were also described as archipelago corvettes originally berg describes only turuma and hemmema as frigates 1993 p 35 norman 2012 while glete 1992 and anderson 1962 use same term for all four ship types design thumb right contemporary model of udema thorborg built in 1772 at maritime museum in stockholm centerline armament of thorborg was housed under a deck structure that covered guns while leaving rowing positions open to elements first udema was built in 1760 and had two masts mainmast and foremast that were originally rigged with lateen sails it was later provided with a square sail rig similar to that of a polacca bark without topgallant sails it had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12 pound guns along centerline of ship and two 12 pounders in bow facing forwards centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either side of ship similar to main guns of dreadnought battleships of 20th century anderson 1962 p 95 first udema gamla was c 30 m 100 ft long and with a draft of 1 5 m 5 ft later udemas torborg and ingeborg carried a mizzen mast and were both longer and wider 37 m 121 ft long and almost 9 m 29 ft wide with a draft of just over 3 m 10 ft nikula 1933 pp 364 65 torborg built in 1772 had three additional 12 pounders eleven in centerline and two in bow facing forwards housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports but with rowing seats left undecked this arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke she was also a poor sailer and slow under oars earning udema a poor reputation nikula 1933 p 132 ingeborg built in 1776 had an eight 12 pounder centerline armament which was open to elements but two heavy 18 pounders in bow and two 6 pounder chase guns in stern nikula 1933 pp 364 65 according to berg 1993 p 33 bow guns were 24 pounders though only specified source appears to be nikula rowing benches with room for three men per bench were on either side of centerline battery but had to swing forwards and outwards to allow guns to pivot to either side glete 1992 p 119 for additional maneuverability udema carried 14 to 18 pairs of oars rowers sat on weather deck on either side of main armament with oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage however they were positioned on either side of centerline battery and could not row under fire in action udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion berg 1993 pp 33 34 concept of hybrid frigates with oar propulsion capabilities was not new small galleasses had been built for english tudor navy as early as mid 16th century royal navy its successor later equipped equivalent of sixth rates with oar ports on or below gundeck as early as 1660s anderson 1962 pp 84 89 baltic variations on mediterranean xebecs had been introduced in russian navy for inshore duties during 18th century both of these have been suggested as possible inspirations for af chapman s new designs service thumb contemporary swedish painting of battle of svensksund where an udema was one of few swedish vessels lost only three udemas were built for swedish navy berg skargardsflottans fartyg typer och utveckling under 1700 och 1800 talet in norman 2012 p 61 russian ship builders copied swedish designs particularly around time of war of 1788 90 and it is believed by some historians that a type named simply secret vessel could have been a russian udema other historians question this conclusion number of guns 44 in total may suggest a considerably larger turuma one of larger archipelago frigates anderson 1962 p 96 three swedish udemas served in finnish archipelago squadrons throughout war of 1788 90 by supporting amphibious operations raiding opposing russian archipelago fleet and protecting left flank of swedish army s operations on finnish mainland udemas fought in both first and second battles of svensksund glete 1992 pp 152 53 163 64 latter battle one of largest naval battles ever fought was a disastrous defeat for russians and one of sweden s greatest naval victories ever udema ingeborg was among few swedish vessels lost hardstedt 2009 p 244 like other specialized archipelago vessels udema proved to have only limited advantages while it had superior firepower its sailing qualities were poor even compared with galleys and were slow even under oars unconventional artillery layout was also deemed to be too weak and radical second battle of svensksund showed that smaller gunboats and were far more efficient for same operations and had almost entirely replaced archipelago frigates by finnish war of 1808 09 where sweden finally lost all of its finnish possessions berg 1993 pp 35 36 influence historian lars olof berg suggests that radical new design of rotating gun mounts though somewhat of a disappointment in swedish service may have influenced shipbuilders in other countries russian floating batteries were equipped with similar mounts by 1790 designs were also presented and built in great britain and us pivoting mounts were used in us gunboat navy under thomas jefferson even in much smaller craft though they often proved risky since recoil could destabilize vessels with a small displacement especially if guns were fired over side genuine breakthrough for true centerline armament layouts however did not come until advent of armored steamships in late 19th century berg 1993 p 34 name udema has been carried on in uninflected
