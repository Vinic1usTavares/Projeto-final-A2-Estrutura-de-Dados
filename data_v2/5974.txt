young man with god like powers falls in love with her and miri where she is infected with a deadly disease while on an away mission and is kidnapped by jealous children rand was portrayed by american actress grace lee whitney who had previously worked with star trek creator gene roddenberry in both lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called police story whitney as rand was involved in promoting star trek before it aired but did not appear in first two pilots roddenberry set out role of rand to whitney saying that she and kirk were meant to have feelings for one another but should never act on them part way through first season whitney was released from her contract official explanation was that production team wanted to free up kirk to have relationships with other women but it was actually necessitated because series was over budget and was looking to cut costs it is unclear who suggested that her contract should be terminated or who made final decision roddenberry later blamed nbc for her release and said he regretted it after whitney was reintroduced to star trek through conventions she came back into contact with roddenberry who wanted to include her in new series in development at time star trek phase ii this was subsequently cancelled but rand did reappear in star trek motion picture whitney made further appearances as rand in star trek iv voyage home and star trek vi undiscovered country she later returned to star trek for memory sequences set in latter film but shown as part of star trek voyager episode flashback whitney made further appearances as rand in star trek new voyages and star trek of gods and men while rand was also portrayed by meghan king johnson in new voyages prior to start of original series whitney was used to promote series and was popular with media critics later called character a stereotype in her initial appearances but expansion of role in flashback was praised concept and development gene roddenberry s original pitch for star trek featured a female captain s yeoman named colt she was described as blonde and with a shape that even a uniform could not hide in this first version of star trek she worked as captain robert april s secretary reporter bookkeeper and undoubtedly wishes she could serve him in more personal departments roddenberry s description of her ended with she is not dumb she is very female disturbingly so this character was cast for first pilot of series cage with laurel goodwin cast in that role a similar character was created for second pilot where no man has gone before this time called smith and she was played by model andrea dromm however during discussions with casting director on star trek roddenberry stood up in casting process for three women he had worked with before majel barrett nichelle nichols and grace lee whitney whitney had previously appeared in roddenberry s lieutenant and was then cast in his unsold pilot police story where she played police lieutenant lily monroe she was available to appear in series and was promptly cast in role being paid 750 per episode and being guaranteed to appear in seven episodes out of first thirteen casting led to rumours that she and roddenberry had been previously involved romantically something she strenuously denied later saying that i never had a romantic relationship with gene roddenberry before star trek during star trek or after star trek she admitted that he had made numerous passes at her but she wanted their relationship to remain professional only thumb upright left alt a black and white photo of a caucasian man roddenberry wanted kirk and rand to have an undercurrent of affection but never to act on it roddenberry explained to whitney that he wanted rand to be captain kirk s confidante but never wanted them to express their affection for one another instead he wanted it to be played as an ongoing undercurrent in early publicity photos whitney was dressed in same manner that women had been in two pilots a loose gold colored tunic and black trousers she complained to roddenberry about them hiding her dancer s legs so he had william ware theiss design a short skirt and tunic for her to wear a uniform which was adopted by other female characters on series she said outfit was sensational and that it stopped traffic despite outfit being designed specifically for whitney theiss was concerned and would tell her to lose weight she was subsequently prescribed amphetamines by her doctor for purpose of weight loss whitney stated that this was start of her addiction to them and in order to come down off them at night she began drinking in evening to take away edginess he also developed her hair styles for series which roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic so that viewers could believe they were seeing future on television she originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos but this was changed to a beehive which was so solid looking that bob justman joked that you could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent it was created by weaving two max factor wigs into a mesh cone whitney described application of wig saying they nailed it to my head every morning it was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that whitney said she was unrecognizable without it in press she explained that on show rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly wig was later stolen from desilu lot after whitney was no longer on series it was never recovered when interviewed by media at time whitney expressed enthusiasm in role and about science fiction in general she described rand s role on board enterprise as she s in charge of other women aboard space ship she s miss efficiency she also added that character didn t go into space to catch a man at time media described rand s position on enterprise as chief female executive officer and her image was used to promote series before it began to air whitney enjoyed several of episodes she appeared in and found it hard to choose between enemy within charlie x and miri she was particularly affectionate towards latter because it allowed her to appear on camera with her two children and said it was her favorite certain elements of rand s characterization were developed by whitney and shatner whitney would go to shatner s side when their characters were put in danger in response shatner would put his arms around her such as in balance of terror character was written out of episode dagger of mind which whitney attributed to romantic liaison that kirk has with female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots this was because script had kirk and female lead sleep with each other although whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from episode she understood why part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase duties of captain s yeoman on screen in order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera he also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls this was part of development process that led to creation of tricorder departure grace lee whitney was released during filming of first season official reason given for whitney s departure from show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for captain kirk this idea was supported by whitney saying they didn t want to give fans idea kirk was in love with janice rand that would limit him they wanted him to go out and fool around so i was axed but real reason was that production had financial issues with acquisition of new crew members and increase in popularity of doctor leonard mccoy meaning that those salaries needed to come out of original budget in justman and herb solow s 1996 book inside star trek they stated that following a discussion between roddenberry solow and bernie weitzman in which they discussed her contract they decided to terminate it because of whitney s limited appearances and financial issues that series was having decision was attributed elsewhere in david alexander s 1995 authorized biography of gene roddenberry star trek creator which said that during first batch of episodes casting director joseph d agosta reviewed contracts for main actors due to rising costs at time whitney was guaranteed to appear in seven of first 13 episodes and contracted for four days work on each however she was used for nine additional days leading d agosta to suggest to roddenberry that if guest stars instead played similar role but with different characters then they would cost less and hold as much value he added that they should instead look to using whitney on a free lance basis instead of under permanent contract by september 8 1966 whitney s agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated which was around a week prior to shoot of her penultimate episode conscience of king roddenberry told whitney that he didn t want to lose rand as he wanted her relationship with kirk to continue in a memo to gene coon on october 27 1966 roddenberry suggested bringing whitney back as rand albeit with a different hairstyle similar to way she wore it in police story as this made her look much younger and softer but she was never invited back to series because of whitney s termination drafts of episode galileo seven were revised to replace rand with a new yeoman mears writer paul schneider was not informed of whitney s departure when he submitted his first draft of squire of gothos in early october 1966 so another character yeoman ross was then subsequently created for that episode and robert hamner s september 1966 outlines for a taste of armageddon also included rand that part was then given to another new character tamura in solow and justman s book there was also a reference to a rift between whitney and roddenberry that occurred just prior to her departure and was expected to ensure that she never returned to series in her autobiography whitney states that an unnamed television executive sexually assaulted her on august 26 1966 while working on episode miri and she draws a link between this and her sacking a few days later whitney s departure was around time when she was an alcoholic in an interview in 1988 whitney blamed her alcoholism and anorexia at time for being released by series she later explained in an interview with starlog magazine to promote star trek iv voyage home that due to being adopted she had a fear of rejection when she was younger which stemmed from her mother giving her away and linked this to star trek saying when i was let go from star trek it was a psychic pain which pushed me into alcoholism i couldn t stand pain so i drank to get away from it return thumb left upright alt a blonde caucasian woman kneels while wearing a light blue flowing 70 s style outfit whitney at a star trek convention in mid 1970s whitney returned to set on several occasions during production of series and was also invited to come back for cast parties but over time these visits decreased gradually as she found it painful to be on set with her friends but not able to appear on show she was continuing to take amphetamines and had developed a drinking problem despite this and despite whitney being let go from show harlan ellison wrote character into his original script for city on edge of forever roddenberry rewrote script resulting in a feud between writers but writer was also very disappointed in general that rand had been removed from series after whitney had left star trek she dated ellison for a time whitney had no further involvement with star trek until 1976 when she happened to meet deforest kelley at an unemployment office in van nuys los angeles he informed her about a star trek convention coming up that was organised by bjo and john trimble called she received such a reception upon making an appearance there that she was inspired to think more about series and wanted to appear at more events in 1977 after reading back cover of book letters to star trek by susan sackett and finding that whatever happened to grace lee whitney was one of ten most frequently asked queries whitney got in touch with sackett and was invited to meet at roddenberry s office at paramount when he entered he was happy and excited to see her and immediately offered to bring back rand for new television series star trek phase ii roddenberry told her that removing rand was biggest mistake he d made saying that character should have stayed so that when captain kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets he d have to deal with rand what a great plot that would have been instead he blamed decision on executives at nbc but apologized for it to whitney thumb right upright alt a black and white photo of a woman handing a piece

duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in final film following reappearance whitney was enthusiastic about returning as rand saying i think janice rand is
