towers beside vincent commenting how she s starting to like this town development 200px thumb right an example of lolita fashion legrow theorizes that her pacing style and drawings of characters and clothes styled after lolita fashion is why her work is categorized as manga as a young girl mary alice legrow was not interested in comics since she grew up in germany where comics were not readily available in her freshman year of high school she discovered comics and anime she heard about tokyopop s rising stars of manga competition from a friend at 2003 otakon an anime convention in baltimore maryland stort story legrow submitted won a runner up place in competition and was published in 2003 rising stars of manga anthology she successfully pitched bizenghast to tokyopop editors and became second rising stars of manga winner to have an original series published by tokyopop legrow worked on series from 2004 to 2011 she began bizenghast when for an art class assignment she drew an open door and added hooded angel statue in another class in her initial designs dinah had simple features and short black hair and vincent was one of dinah s friends legrow later removed other friends from story she later lengthened dinah s hair and depicted her dressed in lolita fashion clothing influenced by rococo and victorian eras other changes included dinah s hair being altered from straight to curly and addition of an exoskeleton like armour to edrear tired of thin female characters in comics legrow designed edaniel s girlfriend as super full figured when deciding on names for her protagonist legrow considered molly charlotte moira sally and diana before choosing dinah a reference to pet cat of protagonist of lewis carroll s novel alice in wonderland 1984 comedy film johnny dangerously inspired her last name wherever vincent monroe takes his name from vincent price and actress marilyn monroe jane dinah s aunt shares her name with legrow s sister edaniel takes his name from name daniel in a middle school yearbook which legrow picked at random she noted that editors let her keep him in story although he appeared a risky character to them edrear was initially named mordred after character from arthurian myths name of his sister elala comes from character lala orange of rainbow brite an animated television series minor character prince ironbound takes his name from city ironbound new jersey while a holy town in northern ethiopia inspired bali s another minor character dr morstan takes his name from mary morstan dr watson s wife russian word for marionette inspired name of antagonist maphohetka legrow comments that series is about life death and fabulous outfits not in that order and notes that there are a lot of religious themes present town of bizenghast represents a world cut off from that sort of constant access of technology series was initially written to span about fourteen volumes and be divided into three seasons first seven volumes would make up first story arc second season volumes eight through eleven would center on mausoleum s relationship with other guilds and season three would focus on afterlife and consist of last three volumes legrow also considered writing a spin off based on bizenghast with a guest artist after she finished first story arc of bizenghast spin off would contain chapters not present in original series and after her other series was completed she would continue bizenghast legrow concluded bizenghast at eight volumes minor controversy a minor controversy occurred over a statement published in july 2007 issue of tokyopop publication and in back of first bizenghast volume written by a former tokyopop editor and not authorized by legrow it read legrow called it worded in a way that i felt was offensive to me and to cosplayers and noted that none of it reflects my opinions fan reaction to learning that statement was inaccurate was generally relief since they felt it didn t mesh with her

sheena mcneil of sequential tart praised first volume as a highly enjoyable read coolstreak cartoons s leroy douresseaux described series as belong ing to a fantasy subgenre sometimes referred to as pop gothic and relying on atmosphere and looks critics praised art of bizenghast as detailed but did not see it as manga styled anime jump s chad clayton called series heavily steeped in gothic tradition and commented that series successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own it seems to owe more to classical art gothic comics and even artists like edward gorey than it does to manga johanna draper carlson a longtime reviewer for publishers weekly found art reminiscent of classic fantasy indy comics and noted stock elements in story reviewers found dinah s character design striking and with potential to appeal to fans of gothic lolita fashion criticism focused on writing uneven pacing flat characters and varying quality of art anime news network s zac bertschy heavily criticized bizenghast for slightly modified generic monster of week cliche plot one dimensional characters and art david welsh compared bizenghast to a cosplay of a horror manga and wrote it s got a handle on cosmetics but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped in his review of novel adaption mania entertainment s greg disliked large amount of description inconsistent narration and felt that novel was more of a novelization in most literal sense of word reading much less like an adaptation in spirit of legrow s work than a 1 to 1 copy of source material conversely sabrina fritz wrote that novel adaption was well written and engaging and called it one of best light novels on market another reviewer for mania entertainment danielle van enjoyed t he detail and perspective in architectural drawings and incredibly detailed costumes of art book falling into fear notes and references notes references external links bizenghast at tokyopop s
