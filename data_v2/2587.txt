michael i komnenos doukas latinized as comnenus ducas or albanian mikhael komnenos doukas and in modern sources often recorded as michael i angelos a name he never used was founder and first ruler of despotate of epirus from until his assassination in 1214 15 born michael was a descendant of alexios i komnenos and a cousin of emperors isaac ii angelos and alexios iii angelos he began his public career in 1190 as a hostage to third crusade and went on to serve as governor of province of mylasa and melanoudion in 1190s and again in during latter tenure he rebelled against alexios iii but was defeated and forced to flee to seljuk turks in aftermath of sack of constantinople by fourth crusade in 1204 he attached himself to boniface of montferrat soon however he abandoned crusader leader and went to epirus where he established himself as ruler apparently through marriage with daughter or widow of a local magnate michael s domain in epirus became a refuge and centre of resistance of greeks against latin crusaders at about same time according to some modern scholars he may have led abortive greek resistance to crusaders in peloponnese which was crushed at battle of olive grove of kountouras according to other views he may have led a campaign there between 1207 and 1209 in order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in epirus michael soon entered into negotiations with pope innocent iii and concluded treaties with latin empire and republic of venice in meantime his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed deposed alexios iii from captivity according to later chroniclers alexios iii conferred hereditary rule of epirus to michael and his descendants by 1210 michael was secure enough to launch an attack against latin kingdom of thessalonica in conjunction with bulgarians repelled by intervention of latin emperor henry of flanders michael quickly switched sides and joined latins to prevent city from falling into bulgarian hands in 1212 he conquered most of thessaly from lombard lords of thessalonica at about same time his troops briefly took over lordship of salona he then went on to recover dyrrhachium and island of corfu from venetians in 1213 1214 but was thwarted in his attempt to push further north into zeta he was assassinated soon after in his sleep and was succeeded by his half brother theodore komnenos doukas early life thumb 300px alt black and white sketch of a seal showing a winged archangel on obverse and a greek inscription on reverse seal of michael doukas of blossoming branch of sebastokrator michael was illegitimate son of sebastokrator john doukas his paternal grandparents were constantine angelos and theodora a daughter of emperor alexios i komnenos michael s uncle andronikos was father of future emperors isaac ii angelos and alexios iii angelos who were thus michael s first cousins despite this kinship he never used surname angelos which has been applied by some modern scholars to michael and his dynasty few documents surviving from his own hand and a couple of lead seals show his name as michael doukas or michael komnenos doukas mikhael komnenos o doukas evidently in an effort to emphasize his relation to revered doukas and komnenos dynasties rather than disastrous reign of angeloi only medieval sources to use surname angelos to refer to michael were later pro palaiologos historians hostile to him and epirote state s rival claims to byzantine inheritance it is unknown when michael was born only relevant information is statement of niketas choniates that he was a young man in 1201 greek scholar konstantinos varzos places his birth approximately in 1170 michael is first mentioned on 14 february 1190 when he along with other imperial relatives served as a hostage to frederick i barbarossa during passage of third crusade through byzantine territory he then went on to serve as governor doux and of theme of mylasa and melanoudion in asia minor during last years of isaac ii s first reign many scholars assign him rank of sebastos from a seal attributed to him but this is disputed by lucien stiernon as he is nowhere else mentioned with this title alexios iii re appointed him to same province probably in 1200 demetrios polemis in his study on doukas family reports that he was reappointed to post by alexios iv but as varzos remarks this is evidently an error by polemis in early 1201 for unknown reasons michael rose in revolt against emperor alexios iii campaigned against him in summer 1201 and defeated him forcing michael to seek refuge at court of seljuk turk sultan of rum suleymanshah ii in his service he led turkish raids into byzantine territory around maeander river valley thumb right alt medieval miniature showing a fortress assaulted by riders

of de la conquete de constantinople at time of fall of constantinople to forces of fourth crusade michael was present in city having possibly returned from exile in period after deposition of alexios iii and restoration of isaac ii and his son alexios iv in 1203 04 michael then entered into service of boniface of montferrat who received kingdom of thessalonica and overlordship over greece in division of spoils among crusaders and followed boniface west as latter went to take up his kingdom in september 1204 villehardouin reports that boniface trusted michael but latter soon abandoned boniface and went to epirus where he installed himself as leader of local greeks against latin crusaders process of michael s establishment in epirus is obscure hagiography of st theodora of arta written in late 13th century maintains that alexios iii had appointed michael as governor in peloponnese and a certain senachereim who was michael s relative by marriage they both had married first cousins from melissenos family as governor of theme of nicopolis in epirus when local inhabitants rose in revolt against him senachereim called upon michael for aid michael rushed to nicopolis but not before locals had killed senachereim after that michael himself widowed took senachereim s widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor although generally regarded as inaccurate due to many errors it contains this part of hagiography is at least partially corroborated by villehardouin s account that he married daughter of a local magnate it is certain that michael was never appointed governor of peloponnese but hagiography s reference to peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with michael who led peloponnesian greeks in battle of olive grove of kountouras against crusaders in summer of 1205 this commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by historian raymond joseph loenertz who suggests that michael leaving epirus which still was not securely under his control to go on campaign in peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave epirus open to attack by boniface loenertz does however consider that michael may indeed have led another expedition into peloponnese a few years later in 1207 09 see below ruler of epirus from his base at arta michael proceeded to expand his control over most of region of epirus including much of modern albania quickly establishing an independent domain encompassing lands between dyrrhachium durazzo in north and naupactus in south bordering latin kingdom of thessalonica in east possessions of republic of venice to north and west and bulgarians and serbs to north and east state michael established is commonly known in historiography as despotate of epirus and it was long thought that michael was first epirote ruler to claim title of despotes it being surmised that he was granted title by deposed emperor alexios iii after his ransoming see below in reality as modern research has shown neither michael nor his half brother and successor theodore komnenos doukas bore title it was michael s bastard son michael ii komnenos doukas who became first ruler of epirus to be titled a despotes in 1230s while designation of epirote state as a despotate first appears in western rather than byzantine sources in 14th century rapprochement with latin powers thumb right 300px alt map of balkans and asia minor with latin states in yellow venetian possessions in green greek states in red and seljuks and bulgarians in brown map of latin principalities and greek successor states after fourth crusade ca 1210 along with other major greek successor state empire of nicaea in western asia minor epirus became main greek centre resisting latin rule michael s chief preoccupation therefore was threat posed by latin crusader states and republic of venice in treaty of partition of byzantine empire among crusaders epirus had been allotted to venice but although it had occupied dyrrhachium in 1205 and island of corfu in 1207 maritime minded republic had shown little interest in rest of epirote mainland to insure himself against a latin attack michael began negotiations with pope innocent iii hinting at a possible union of orthodox church of his domains with roman catholic church relationship was not untroubled in a letter of 17 august 1209 pope asked of michael komnenos of romania that if he were truly pope s servant as he claimed in his letters he should allow latin archbishop of dyrrhachium access to estates owned by archbishopric in michael s domains but it did serve for moment to earn michael pope s goodwill as well as precious time according to loenertz it also appears that at some point michael had paid homage to kingdom of thessalonica as its vassal despite these diplomatic manoeuvrings according to a series of letters of innocent iii dated to autumn 1210 michael engaged in combat with prince of achaea geoffrey i of villehardouin and his barons letters do not give any further details modern researchers have linked this reference either with his supposed leadership in battle of kountouras or more plausibly with an abortive campaign in peloponnese sometime in 1207 09 in order to aid beleaguered ruler of argos and corinth leo sgouros who was being besieged by crusaders in his citadel on acrocorinth traditionally several scholars such as karl hopf and antoine bon have furthermore identified a certain theodore who appears as lord of argos and sgouros successor in leading resistance against crusaders with michael s half brother theodore komnenos doukas loenertz points out however that not only is there no evidence for such an assumption but that theodore komnenos doukas is known to have been in service of nicaean emperor theodore i laskaris at time in summer 1209 after latin emperor henry of flanders quelled a revolt of lombard barons of thessalonica and brought kingdom of thessalonica under his effective control michael sent envoys to propose an alliance henry distrusted michael s sincerity but sent an embassy to epirus with his terms which amounted to michael declaring himself a vassal of latin empire michael was able to sidestep an outright declaration of submission by offering hand of his eldest daughter to emperor s brother eustace and a third of his lands as her dowry henry accepted and peace agreement was sealed with marriage of eustace and michael s daughter finally in early 1210 michael s envoys bishop of theodore and symeon met with venetian duke of dyrrhachium marino and negotiated a treaty confirmed by oath on 20 june thereby michael accepted to become a vassal of venice holding his lands in fief from venice as confirmed in a charter issued by doge pietro michael granted venetians extensive trading privileges and tax exemptions just as they had enjoyed under of emperor manuel i komnenos promised to expedite grain exports to venice and to assist in any shipwreck of a venetian vessel off epirote coast in addition as a sign of his vassalage he would pay to venetian duke of dyrrhachium an annual tribute of 42 of gold hyperpyra in two instalments and send annually a rich brocade for altar of st mark s basilica and one for doge ransoming of alexios iii at about same time michael s rule received a boost in legitimacy through his ransoming of emperor alexios iii after his deposition by crusaders in july 1203 alexios with his wife euphrosyne doukaina had been roaming greece seeking protection a marriage alliance with leo sgouros failed due to latter s hasty retreat before advance of boniface of montferrat left stranded in thessaly alexios was captured by boniface former emperor was initially held in comfortable captivity but at some point he fell foul of boniface sources differ on whether he tried to flee to michael s domains and was captured by boniface s knights en route or whether boniface simply came to distrust him as a potential rival focal point for loyalties of greek population he and his wife were then imprisoned either in thessalonica or according to other sources in montferrat learning of their fate michael offered to ransom former imperial couple and eventually secured their release welcoming them at port of arta where they arrived by ship michael treated couple with every courtesy but alexios did not remain long in arta deposed emperor was eager to regain his throne by taking over empire of nicaea with aid of seljuk sultan kaykhusraw i leaving his wife behind and accompanied by michael s half brother constantine komnenos doukas alexios took sail for asia minor his attempt ended in complete failure in battle of antioch on maeander in 1211 where theodore i laskaris killed kaykhusraw and took alexios prisoner hagiography of st theodora of arta claims that on his departure alexios granted michael and his descendants hereditary possession of his domain while 14th century aragonese version of chronicle of morea claims that alexios left michael as his lieutenant in west from these references some earlier scholars erroneously inferred that michael received title of despotes from alexios lucien stiernon followed by varzos places ransoming of alexios in 1206 7 loenertz on other hand considers it a result of michael s rapprochement with latins and places it in 1210 when interests of latin empire in curbing growing power of nicaea coincided with michael s intention to ransom alexios territorial expansion thumb 300px alt map of balkans with original core of epirus and its conquered territories shown in various shades of orange expansion of epirote state during reigns of michael i and theodore komnenos doukas michael seized opportunity of henry s focus on his planned campaign against nicaea to attack thessalonica at head of latin mercenaries he captured constable of kingdom of thessalonica and baron of domokos lombard ame buffa and a hundred of his companions he is alleged to have been excessively cruel to his prisoners killing or whipping many of them while buffa his confessor and three other nobles were crucified michael s army proceeded to capture several fortresses and kill latin garrisons including priests enraged henry sped to thessalonica s aid covering distance from constantinople in only twelve days michael in meantime had allied himself with bulgarian ruler strez but they were defeated by henry it is possible that during this campaign henry was assisted by his vassals from achaea thereby explaining reference in pope s correspondence of achaean barons fighting against michael rather than assuming an epirote expedition to peloponnese latin emperor wrested lands from both allies but was forced to cut short his campaign and return to constantinople which was being threatened by bulgarian emperor boril henry left thessalonica in charge of his brother eustace and of berthold of katzenelnbogen who then defeated another invasion by strez supported with troops from his brother boril disquieted by bulgarian attacks on thessalonica michael switched sides and joined latins in defeating bulgarians at pelagonia it is commonly assumed that during these conflicts michael terminated his vassalage to latin empire historian philip van tricht however points out that there are no sources for this and that this vassalage may have survived until 1217 when michael s brother theodore captured latin emperor peter ii of courtenay near dyrrhachium sometime between 1210 and 1214 according to chronicle of galaxeidi michael came into conflict with latin lord of salona thomas i d autremencourt when d autremencourt seized a few islands in corinthian gulf off galaxeidi inhabitants of latter called upon michael for aid and in ensuing battle thomas was killed and salona modern was occupied epirote rule there proved short lived however as d autremencourt s son thomas ii soon recovered his father s lordship in 1212 his troops invaded thessaly in force overrunning resistance of local lombard nobles epirotes took larissa where they deposed latin archbishop and restored local see to an orthodox metropolitan fief of berthold of katzenelnbogen and reached shores of gulf at demetrias newly gained thessalian territories were entrusted to michael s son in law constantine maliasenos as a hereditary appanage soon after probably in 1213 he took dyrrhachium from venice followed in 1214 by corfu very little is known about details of these successes as generally hostile stance of pro nicaean byzantine historians towards michael means that his achievements were often ignored according to local tradition castle of angelokastro was built by michael michael continued to push northward into albania and macedonia taking kruja and ending independence of principality of arbanon and its ruler dimitri but his attempt to seize zeta was stopped by serbs at skadar death and legacy thumb 300px alt photo of a hilltop fortress with sea in background castle of angelokastro in corfu whose construction is sometimes attributed to michael michael himself did not long outlive these successes in late 1214 or in 1215 he was assassinated in his sleep at by a servant called rhomaios according to historian john v a fine whether he was hired to do act and if so by whom is unknown as his only surviving son was illegitimate and underage michael was succeeded by his half brother theodore theodore had been in service of nicaea and michael had requested laskaris to send him to epirus because his own son s position was weak in event theodore not only sidelined young michael ii but according to hagiography of st theodora of arta sent him and his mother to exile in peloponnese for duration of his reign theodore proved a powerful and warlike ruler greatly expanding epirote state and capturing thessalonica in 1224 where he was crowned emperor rise of theodore s empire of thessalonica ended abruptly with his defeat and capture by bulgarians at battle of klokotnitsa in 1230 that allowed exiled michael ii to return to epirus and recover his father s domain michael laid foundations of epirote state and initiated a dynasty komnenoi doukai who would rule over epirus until 1318 when italian orsini family took over members of family also ruled over thessaly and for a while claimed imperial title as rulers of thessalonica from 1224 until its capture by nicaeans in 1246 it appears that during his lifetime michael was a popular ruler with his subjects contemporary metropolitan bishop of naupactus john apokaukos lauded michael as a new noah at whose side refugees of latin cataclysm found refuge contemporary archbishop of ohrid demetrios chomatianos even estimated that at least half if not most of those who fled from constantinople found refuge in epirus including many of senatorial aristocracy more still came from peloponnese fleeing latin rule there apokaukos also praises him for his refoundation and refortification of city of ioannina where many of refugees were settled city thenceforth chose archangel michael as its patron saint in his honour family exact identity of michael s wife or wives is unknown according to hagiography of st theodora of arta he married twice his first wife was a lady of aristocratic melissenos family who died at an unknown time her first cousin likewise a melissenos married governor of nicopolis senachereim see above after his murder by locals michael avenged him took his place and married his widow despite unreliability of hagiography its account is partially confirmed by villehardouin s reference to daughter of an epirote magnate furthermore as michael s second wife was a first cousin of his first their marriage was uncanonical in eyes of church and of hostile historians it is therefore likely that concubine referenced by latter as mother of michael ii komnenos doukas was in reality michael s second wife michael had five children three by his first wife and two by his second wife or concubine an unnamed daughter who in 1209 married eustace brother of latin emperor henry of flanders theodora komnene doukaina only mentioned briefly by demetrios chomatianos in 1216 constantine komnenos doukas mentioned only in latin text of 1210 treaty with venice where he is designated as his father s successor he must have died at a young age before michael s own death maria komnene doukaina who married constantine maliasenos michael ii komnenos doukas an illegitimate son who succeeded as ruler of epirus in 1230 until
