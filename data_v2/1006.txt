time in paris and associated herself with young italy movement italian exiles who were in favour of italian independence and unification one revolutionary in particular attracted her ferdinando gatteschi to assist him financially shelley decided to publish rambles however gatteschi became discontented with shelley s assistance and tried to blackmail her she was forced to obtain her personal letters from gatteschi through intervention of french police shelley differentiates her travel book from others by presenting her material from what she describes as a political point of view in so doing she challenges early nineteenth century convention that it was improper for women to write about politics following in tradition of her mother mary wollstonecraft and lady morgan shelley s aim was to arouse sympathy in england for italian revolutionaries such as gatteschi she rails against imperial rule of austria and france over italy and criticises domination of catholic church she describes italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom though shelley herself thought work poor it found favour with reviewers who praised its independence of thought wit and feeling shelley s political commentary on italy was specifically singled out for praise particularly since it was written by a woman for most of nineteenth and twentieth centuries

italians when napoleon conquered parts of italy during french revolutionary wars 1792 1802 and napoleonic wars 1803 15 he unified many of smaller principalities he centralised governments and built roads and communication networks that helped to break down barriers between and among italians not all italians welcomed french rule however giuseppe capobianco founded a secret society called carbonari to resist both french rule and roman catholic church after napoleon was defeated at battle of waterloo in 1815 and congress of vienna left much of northern italy in hands of austrians carbonari continued their resistance carbonari led revolts in naples and piedmont in 1820 and 1821 and in bologna papal states parma and modena in 1830s after failure of these revolts giuseppe mazzini

described him as a hero an angel martyr qtd in moskal travel writing 247 jeanne moskal most recent editor of rambles argues that mary shelley was attracted to gatteschi because he resembled percy

early stages of pregnancy in a white dress rambles is a travel narrative part of a literary tradition begun in seventeenth century through sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth centuries continental travel was considered educational young aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning european languages abroad and visiting foreign courts smith 155 in early seventeenth century however emphasis shifted from classical learning to a focus on gaining experience in real world such as knowledge of topography history and culture detailed travel books including personal travel narratives began to be published and became popular in eighteenth century over 1 000 individual travel narratives and travel miscellanies were published between 1660 and 1800 empiricism that was driving scientific revolution spread to travel literature for example lady mary wortley montagu included information she learned in turkey regarding smallpox inoculation in her travel letters smith 156 by 1742 critic and essayist samuel johnson was recommending that travellers engage in a moral and ethical study of men and manners in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography over course of eighteenth century grand tour became increasingly popular travel to continent for britain s elite was not only educational but also nationalistic all aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites with intention of developing an appreciation of britain from abroad grand tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with intellectual elite learning about other cultures and preparing for leadership however it was condemned as trivial when tourist simply purchased curio collectibles acquired a superficial social polish and pursued fleeting sexual relationships during napoleonic wars continent was closed to british travellers and grand tour came under increasing criticism particularly from radicals such as mary shelley s father william godwin who scorned its aristocratic associations young romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity they celebrated madame de s novel corinne 1807 which depicts proper travel as immediate sensitive and above all an enthusiastic experience smith 157 travel literature changed in 1840s as steam powered ships and trains made continental journeys accessible to middle class guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller who was unfamiliar with tradition of grand tour most famous of these was john murray s handbook for travellers on continent 1836 by 1848 murray had published 60 such works which emphasised comprehensiveness presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology history and art galleries moskal gender and nationalism 190 whereas during romantic period travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions during victorian period travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a discourse of authenticity that is they claimed to have experienced true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal as opposed to writers of generic guidebooks whose response was specifically impersonal smith 163 rambles as a travel narrative mary shelley s rambles both resembles and attempts to separate itself from other travel narratives of time elizabeth nitchie in her description of text writes for example that there is little novelty either in what shelley saw or in her account of alps rhine or italy nitchie 34 and moskal notes that shelley s book participates in travel book convention of museum going moskal travel writing 254 although shelley drew on murray s famous handbooks and other guidebooks she specifically attempted to differentiate her work from these while murray s guidebooks for example were generally apolitical shelley argues in preface to rambles that uniqueness of her work is in its portrayal of italian people from a political point of view moskal gender and nationalism 188 90 shelley had sold her publisher on idea of a travel narrative by describing forthcoming book as light and amusing in style of samuel rogers whose travel narrative of italy accompanied by illustrations by j m w turner had been a best seller in late 1820s rogers s text had avoided politics and focused on picturesque and sublime scenery although shelley dedicated rambles to rogers her preface acknowledged influence of lady morgan whose travel work italy 1821 had been vocal in its criticism of austria s rule over italy and had been placed on papal list of prohibited books seymour 489 to make her politics more palatable to her audience however shelley often uses analyses of literature and art to reinforce her points moskal gender and nationalism 197 shelley s travel narrative with its informal and subjective focus on her personal experiences reflects romantic emphasis on individual kautz 167 unlike augustus granville s spas of germany 1837 which exudes a victorian respect for order political authority and careful documentation shelley focuses on her own reactions to these experiences she

mary shelley violated mid nineteenth century taboo against women discussing politics particularly in public sphere moskal gender and nationalism 188 89 after mid 1790s partly as a result of french revolution britain experienced an antifeminist reaction and women were increasingly discouraged from writing on so called masculine topics moskal gender and nationalism 188 as moskal explains there was a massive cultural prejudice that equate d masculinity with mobility making travel writing itself a masculine genre there was even a masculinist aesthetic vocabulary moskal gender and nationalism 189 women in late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century wrote travel narratives anyway but at a cost wollstonecraft is described as asking men s questions when she is curious about her surroundings and both lady morgan s and elizabeth barrett browning s travel narratives received hostile reviews because they discussed political issues both shelley and her mother mary wollstonecraft exceeded bounds of what would have been considered normal purview of female writer in their travel narratives shelley excitedly describes running rapids in a canoe for example and describes economic status and technological development of areas she visits in paris she comments on lack of drains in streets in berlin she visits a steel mill and throughout text she describes how new railways are impacting on travel bennett 116 17 shelley s travel narrative is marked by a specific ethic of travel that one must learn to sympathise both physically and emotionally with those one encounters her travels are sentimental and travel writing for her is an exploration of self through an encounter with other schor 237 39 her language even mirrors that of her mother wollstonecraft describes frontier of sweden as bones of world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty while shelley describes simplon pass as having a majestic simplicity that inspired awe naked bones of a gigantic world were here elemental substance of fair mother earth qtd in dolan 154 also like her mother whose letters from sweden was foundational to writing of both history of a six weeks tour and rambles shelley emphasised her maternal role in text she describes herself as a conventional figure worrying about her son rather than scandal ridden young woman of her youth which she wrote about

addresses her readers as english citizens arguing that they in particular ought to sympathise in italians struggles for aspiration for free institutions all over world has its source in england qtd in bennett 114 on a general level she articulates an opposition to monarchical government disapproval of class distinction abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties similar to that in her historical novels valperga 1823 and perkin warbeck 1830 bennett 118 central theme of second journey is tyranny of austrian and french imperialism and abuses of papal and priestly authority schor 244 solution to italy s problems according to shelley is neither subjugation nor revolution but rather peaceful mediation ultimately it is lessons learned from history that shelley feels are most important which is why she compares past and present smith 170 rambles articulates whiggish ideology of political gradualism smith 169 and is similar to wollstonecraft s vindication of rights of woman 1792 in that it argues that a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations schor 246 shelley s political frame for her travel narrative was a difficult one to sell to readers her audience wanted to support revolutionaries especially exiles living among them such as mazzini but they were also fearful of violence of carbonari and its nationalist ideology they connected nationalism to their historic enemy napoleonic france in fact other travel works published at time made argument that napoleon was responsible for italian unification moskal gender and nationalism 191 92 shelley therefore contends that risorgimento is primarily inspired by english and only secondarily by french she never names napoleon moskal gender and nationalism 194 shelley writes a history of italian nationalism acceptable to english readers in which french are tyrants oppressing rising nation of italy which carbonari although violent has inspired and created her readers could therefore comfortably support italian nationalism without supporting policies reminiscent of napoleon moskal gender and nationalism 196 she also placed most of her political commentary at end of text as moskal explains shelley creates a structure in which reader having already befriended traveller for some pages receives this political matter from a friend not from a stranger moskal gender and nationalism 195 she also praises italian literature particularly works of alessandro manzoni pietro and michele amari connecting it to italian nationalism moskal travel writing 249 50 in writing about italian situation shelley is also advocating a general liberal agenda of rights for working and middle classes which had been crushed by reign of terror and napoleon british reformers could look with hope towards italy moskal travel writings 247 national character throughout rambles shelley describes national character of peoples she visits she describes italians as having an untapped potential for greatness particularly peasants shelley frequently laments poor education on offer to italians although she hopes this will spur them to revolt nitchie 39 she does not think much of germans in her earlier travels she had described germans as rude and disgusting in 1842 she wrote to her half sister claire clairmont i do dislike germans never wish to visit germany again but i would not put this in print for surface is all i know qtd in nitchie 37 38 rambles contains little commentary on germans therefore except to say that she was impressed by public education system of germany sunstein 357 it was how political events affected people that shelley was most interested in bennett 117 in her history of a six weeks tour she had paused several times to discuss effects of

needed to recover from a damaging trauma dolan 133 34 shelley writes about this in rambles using trope of a pilgrimage she believes that travelling to italy and revisiting scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression writing besides all that rome itself affords of delightful to eye and imagination i revisit it as bourne of a pious pilgrimage treasures of my youth lie buried here qtd in moskal travel writing 252 shelley s pilgrimage follows in tradition of chaucer as well as nineteenth century trend to visit spas for healing moskal travel writing 253 and like most pilgrimage narratives hers does not relate journey home moskal travel writing 255 for shelley ultimately most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing beautiful scenery in rambles shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal body both 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically kautz 171 72 dolan 143 44 she opens rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her mind will renew outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed qtd in dolan 136

of narrative moskal travel writing 256 it tells story of recovery of paradise and fears of a mother orr her maternal sorrow is generalised for example in discussing death of her daughter in 1818 she writes i was agitated again by emotions by passions and those deepest a woman s heart can harbour a dread to see her child even at that instant expire which then occupied me qtd in orr connecting

of thought wit and feeling nitchie 29 shelley s commentary on social and political life of italy which was generally thought superior to german sections caused one reviewer to call book work of a
