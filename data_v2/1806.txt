sir john ponsonby conroy 1st baronet kch 21 october 1786 2 march 1854 was a british army officer who served as comptroller to duchess of kent and her young daughter princess victoria future queen of united kingdom conroy was born in wales to anglo irish parents in 1817 after holding several ranks in army he became equerry of prince edward duke of kent and strathearn edward died two years later leaving a widow and infant daughter holding position of comptroller of duchess of kent s household for next nineteen years conroy also acted as her confidant and political agent among other roles together they designed kensington system an elaborate and strict system of rules for upbringing of young victoria designed to render her weak willed and utterly dependent upon them in hope of allowing them one day to wield power through her princess victoria grew to hate conroy thanks to oppressive system and he was also unpopular among rest of british royal family his efforts to place duchess in role of regent were ultimately unsuccessful as victoria ascended throne after reaching her majority in 1837 conroy was immediately expelled from victoria s household though he remained in duchess of kent s service for several more years given a pension and a baronetcy conroy retired to his estate near reading berkshire in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later historians have often referred to conroy as someone with strong ambition with varying degrees of positive or negative opinion rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps duchess of kent s lover queen victoria was shocked to hear this stating that her mother s piety would have prevented it early life conroy was born on 21 october 1786 in maes y castell wales he was one of six children born to john ponsonby conroy esq and margaret wilson both native to ireland his father was a barrister and younger conroy was privately educated in dublin on 8 september 1803 he was commissioned in royal artillery as a second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 september in 1805 conroy enrolled in royal military academy at woolwich he made his career during napoleonic wars though his ability to avoid battle attracted disdain from other officers conroy did not participate in peninsular war or waterloo campaign further advancement of rank was facilitated with conroy s marriage to elizabeth fisher on 26 december 1808 in dublin though not as far as conroy felt he deserved elizabeth was daughter of colonel later major general benjamin fisher and conroy served under him in ireland and england while performing various administrative duties conroy was promoted to second captain on 13 march 1811 and appointed adjutant in corps of artillery drivers on 11 march 1817 conroy and elizabeth had six children together sir edward conroy 2nd baronet 6 december 1809 3 november 1869 married lady alice parsons daughter of laurence parsons 2nd earl of rosse they were parents of analytical chemist sir john conroy 3rd baronet elizabeth jane conroy 1811 1855 arthur benjamin conroy 1813 1817 stephen rowley conroy 15 august 1815 1841 served with coldstream guards henry george conroy 4 june 1817 5 october 1890 served with grenadier guards aide de camp to commander of forces in ireland victoria maria louisa conroy 1819 9 february 1866 married sir wyndham edward hanmer 4th baronet employment with kents thumb upright conroy s relationship with duchess of kent pictured was subject to rumours that they were lovers through connection of his wife s uncle conroy came to attention of prince edward duke of kent and strathearn fourth son of king george iii conroy was appointed as an equerry in 1817 shortly before duke s marriage to princess victoria of saxe coburg saalfeld an efficient organiser conroy s planning ensured duke and duchess speedy return to england in time for birth of their first child child was princess alexandrina victoria of kent later queen victoria while kent had promised conroy military advancement he was still a captain by time of duke s death in 1820 conroy was named an executor of duke s will though he was unsuccessful in persuading dying man to name him victoria s guardian aware that he needed to find another source of revenue quickly conroy offered his services as comptroller to now widowed duchess of kent and her infant daughter he retired from military service on half pay in 1822 kensington system together in a hostile environment conroy s relationship with duchess was very close with him serving as her comptroller and private secretary for next nineteen years as well as holding unofficial roles of public relations officer counsellor confidant and political agent while it is not clear which of two was more responsible for devising kensington system it was created to govern young victoria s upbringing an elaborate and oppressive system of rules regulating every facet of victoria s life it kept her in reclusive isolation most of time with goal of making her weak compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and conroy intention was for duchess to be appointed regent upon victoria s assumed youthful ascension and for conroy to be created victoria s private secretary and given a peerage aware of reasons behind king george iv s unpopularity conroy promoted a public image of duchess that was pure modest and decorous while at same time increasing her paranoia against british royal family particularly duke of cumberland princess victoria soon came to hate conroy who bullied and insulted her mocking her economical habits some historians have conjectured that conroy s arrogant behaviour towards victoria may have stemmed from a personal belief that his wife elizabeth was secretly illegitimate child of duke of kent while rumour was later proven false conroy s strong ambition may have stemmed from this self perceived connection to aristocracy ambition may also have been influenced by conroy s claim of descent from ancient kings of ireland regardless of his claims of grandeur conroy belonged to middle class and recognised growing power of this group within british society conroy effectively barred victoria from anyone other than duchess or his relatives and princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family enforced isolation meant only companions of her own age whom she frequently came into contact with were conroy s daughters who included victoire a girl a few months older than victoria victoria does not appear to have been fond of either conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals young princess depended on her devoted governess louise lehzen who defended her against conroy s machinations as victoria grew older attempts were made by conroy and duchess to secure lehzen s removal or at least lessening of her influence such tactics proved unsuccessful as princess became more devoted to lehzen than before as evident in her journals early in his stay at kensington palace conroy made an effort to become close to princess sophia an elderly sister of george iv who also resided at palace sophia is described by christopher hibbert as an impressionable and mentally unstable woman and conroy had little difficulty in persuading her to let him take control of her finances in return for making sophia a member of duchess s social circle princess reported back to conroy on activities at st james s palace and kensington when he was absent victoria as heir presumptive right thumb upright princess victoria 1833 she grew up in controlling kensington system devised by her mother and conroy in 1827 duke of york died making duke of clarence heir presumptive and victoria second in line to throne conroy complained that princess should not be surrounded by commoners leading king george iv to appoint conroy a knight commander of hanoverian order and a knight bachelor that year duchess and conroy continued to be unpopular with royal family and in 1829 duke of cumberland spread rumours that they were lovers in an attempt to discredit them duke of clarence referred to conroy as king john while duchess of clarence wrote to duchess of kent to advise that she was increasingly isolating herself from royal family and that she must not grant conroy too much power duke of clarence became king william iv in 1830 by which point conroy felt very confident of his position his control of household was secure duchess prevented her daughter from attending william s coronation out of a disagreement of precedence a decision attributed by duke of wellington to conroy by then it had become clear to victoria that she would succeed to throne new king and queen attempted to gain custody of their niece but conroy quickly replied that victoria could not be tainted by moral atmosphere at court conroy solidified stance that mother and daughter could not be separated and continued to promote duchess virtue as a fit regent as king william intensely disliked duchess and conroy he vowed to wait until victoria came of age to die simply to keep them from a regency in 1831 year of william s coronation conroy and duchess embarked on a series of royal tours with victoria to expose her to people and solidify their status as potential regents on one trip conroy was awarded an honorary degree by university of oxford their efforts were ultimately successful and in november 1831 it was declared that duchess would be sole regent in event of victoria s young queenship while conroy could claim to be closest adviser to duchess and her daughter aware that a regency was becoming increasingly unlikely conroy and duchess began promoting view of victoria as a weak minded frivolous and foolish girl in need of guidance while increasing their bullying of princess they implied that victoria desired a regency even if she succeeded later than her majority at eighteen victoria was forbidden to be alone with her beloved lehzen either duchess s ally lady flora hastings or a conroy sister now appointed as companions were required to accompany her in 1835 victoria became seriously ill of typhoid fever on last of royal tours exploiting her weakened state duchess and conroy unsuccessfully tried to force her into signing a document this document would have appointed conroy her personal secretary upon her accession victoria emerged from incident more determined than ever to become self reliant her increased intransigence alarmed duchess at her behest family adviser baron stockmar investigated recommending to duchess that she dismiss conroy and make peace with her daughter but conroy easily convinced duchess to ignore stockmar s advice even after victoria s eighteenth birthday on 24 may 1837 conroy continued to pressure her to appoint him as her private secretary or acknowledge her need for a regent until she turned twenty one victoria in power thumb upright victoria s ascension to throne in 1837 led to conroy s banishment from her household king died just weeks after victoria s eighteenth birthday and she succeeded him as sovereign conroy was subject of numerous discussions victoria had with stockmar on first day of her reign at same time conroy created a list of demands to give to stockmar with intent that he pass them on to prime minister lord melbourne conroy demanded a pension of ps3 000 a year grand cross of bath a peerage and a seat on privy council victoria left negotiating to melbourne who agreed to most of conroy s demands most likely to avoid a scandal on advice of melbourne conroy was granted a baronetcy and a pension of ps3 000 per annum this did not satisfy conroy who continued in following years to petition victoria for an irish peerage each request was refused as peerage would have enabled him to attend court one of victoria s first acts as queen was to dismiss conroy from her own household though she could not dismiss him from her mother s queen victoria as an unmarried young woman was still expected to live with her mother but she relegated duchess and conroy to remote apartments at buckingham palace cutting off personal contact with them duchess unsuccessfully insisted that conroy and his family be allowed at court victoria disagreed saying i thought you would not expect me to invite sir john conroy after his conduct towards me for some years past in 1839 duke of wellington convinced conroy to leave duchess s household and take his family to continent in effective exile times reported that he no longer had official duties though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed that year rumours abounded that lady flora hastings whose abdomen had grown large was pregnant by conroy a subsequent medical investigation concluded that lady flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later this scandal in tandem with bedchamber crisis damaged victoria s reputation in 1842 conroy settled at his family home in arborfield hall near reading berkshire and became a gentleman farmer winning prizes for his pig breeding he founded montgomery regiment of militia in 1849 despite his pensions and ownership of properties and lead mines in wales conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 march 1854 at arborfield his eldest son edward succeeded him to baronetcy after his death duchess of kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing she was moved to admit that conroy had swindled her while at same time hurting her relationship with victoria for his own benefit a rapprochement followed between mother and daughter finances of princess sophia princess sophia s substantial income provided from civil list had allowed conroy to enjoy a wealthy lifestyle princess died in 1848 leaving only ps1 607 19s 7d in her bank accounts despite a lifestyle of savings and low expenses duke of cambridge and duchess of gloucester had a lawyer write to conroy demanding that he account for rest of their sister sophia s funds but conroy simply ignored it according to flora fraser most recent biographer of george iii s daughters princess sophia had in fact personally spent huge sums on conroy including heavy contributions to purchase prices of his residences and supporting his family in a style he judged appropriate to their position conroy ultimately received 000 in gifts and money from sophia in 1850 duchess of kent s new comptroller sir george couper studied old accounts he found huge discrepancies no records for her household or personal expenses had been kept after 1829 there was also no record of nearly ps50 000 duchess had received from her brother leopold nor of an additional ps10 000 from william iv historiography after conroy s departure from victoria s service in 1837 a popular song read following his death in 1854 times published a positive obituary that declared name person and character of sir john conroy are so well and in many respects so favourably known in british society that we have no doubt announcement of his death will be received with feelings of general regret article briefly summarised his lifetime and praised conroy for considerable shrewdness no small knowledge of human nature and a very winning address as well as devoting himself with great zeal and to members of royal family described in his own lifetime as a ridiculous fellow conroy has not been recipient of much recent positive historical opinion twentieth century historian christopher hibbert writes that conroy was a good looking man of insinuating charm tall imposing vain clever unscrupulous plausible and of limitless ambition for her part 21st century historian gillian gill describes conroy as a career adventurer expert manipulator and domestic martinet who came to england with small means some ability and mighty ambition in 2004 elizabeth longford wrote that conroy was not arch villain victoria painted but victim of his own inordinate ambition suspected lover of duchess conroy s relationship with duchess was subject of much speculation both before and after his death in 1854 when duke of wellington was asked if duchess and conroy were lovers he replied that he supposed so in august 1829 wellington reported to court diarist charles greville that victoria then ten years old had caught conroy and her mother engaged in some familiarities victoria told her governess baroness lehzen who in turn told madame de spaeth one of duchess s ladies in waiting de spaeth confronted duchess about relationship and was immediately dismissed all of this was recorded by greville his subsequent diary entry has led to persistent belief that duchess and conroy were lovers later as an aged queen victoria was aghast to discover that many people did indeed believe that her mother and conroy were intimate and stated that duchess piety would have prevented this rumour that conroy was queen victoria s father thumb upright subject of victoria s paternity has been a matter of debate with candidates ranging from duke of kent pictured to john conroy during victoria s lifetime and after her death in 1901 there have been rumours that conroy or someone else and not duke of kent was her biological father historians have continued to debate accuracy and validity of these claims in his 2003 work victorians biographer a n wilson suggests that victoria was not actually descended from george iii because several of her descendants had haemophilia which was unknown among her recognised ancestors haemophilia is a genetic disease that impairs body s ability to control blood clotting which is used to stop bleeding when a blood vessel is broken it is carried in female line but symptoms manifest mostly in males wilson proposes that duchess of kent took a lover not necessarily conroy to ensure that a coburg would sit on british throne likewise medical historian w t w potts considers it a possibility that duchess took a lover under pressure from her brother leopold he cites rarity of genetic mutations as evidence as well as remarkable circumstances surrounding victoria s conception potts makes no mention of conroy specifically only that father would have been a himself or would have had a mutated gene haemophilia b has been known to arise spontaneously in children of older fathers and duke of kent was fifty one when victoria was born nicholas wright proposes that haemophilia mutation could have first occurred with either victoria or duke of kent gillian gill and her son christopher an infectious disease specialist also view a genetic mutation as most likely possibility gillian gill writes that a few historians in recent years have found it seductive to doubt victoria s stated paternity because a random mutation is an unexciting solution helen rappaport concurs remarking that best and most logical explanation is that haemophilia first appeared in victoria as a mutation alan rushton adds that no one in household of newly married duchess of kent including conroy is known to have had haemophilia and that her probable awareness of scandals surrounding behaviour of caroline of brunswick and caroline matilda of great britain would have deterred her from seeking an affair elsewhere furthermore princess victoria was said to have borne a strong family resemblance to her father and grandfather george iii there is evidence that some of victoria s descendants did have mild porphyria although some historians now think it could have been bi polar disorder http www com shows 292 george html most notably princess feodora of saxe meiningen this disease probably affected her grandfather george iii and this could give credence to victoria s legitimate birth there is more reliable documentation that one of her great great grandsons prince william of gloucester was diagnosed with disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race concrete evidence on origins of disease and paternity of victoria could be achieved with a dna test of her or her parents remains but no such study has been sanctioned by royal family in popular culture conroy has been portrayed numerous times in film and television herbert wilcox s victoria great 1937 depicted conroy as a smarmy character who is not well developed in film baronet was played by stefan in 1954 s story of vickie and herbert hubner in einer konigin 1936 patrick malahide played conroy in victoria albert a 2001 tv miniseries that depicted victoria s early influences english actor mark strong played him in 2009 film young victoria film depicts conroy as a maniacal controlling pseudo father to young victoria during year preceding her accession even going so far as depicting him assaulting princess twice film goes on to depict conroy s expulsion from queen victoria s household conroy also appears in numerous historical fiction novels about queen victoria writing under pen names jean plaidy and eleanor burford author eleanor hibbert published a series of novels in 1970s and
