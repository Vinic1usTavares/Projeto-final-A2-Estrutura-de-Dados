holly crew encounters phenomena such as time distortions faster than light travel mutant diseases and strange lifeforms all evolved from earth because series has no aliens that had developed in

due for a 2020 release concept and commission concept for show was originally developed from sketch series dave hollins space cadet on bbc radio 4 show son of cliche in mid 1980s written by rob grant and doug naylor their influences came from films and television programmes such as star trek 1966 silent running 1972 alien 1979 dark star 1974 and hitchhiker s guide to galaxy 1981 but also had a large element of british style comedy and satire thrown into mix ultimately moulded into form of a sitcom many visual and character elements bear similarities to trident nuclear submarine bbc documentary defence of realm having written pilot script in 1983 former spitting image writers pitched their unique concept to bbc but it was rejected on fears that a science fiction sitcom would not be popular it was finally accepted by bbc north in 1986 a result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of happy families that would never arise and producer paul jackson s insistence that red dwarf should be filmed instead show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut entire production down title sequence was filmed in january 1987 filming was rescheduled for september and pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 february 1988 casting alan rickman and alfred molina auditioned for roles in series with molina being cast as rimmer however after molina had difficulties with concept of series and of his role in particular role was recast and filled by chris barrie a professional voice actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both writers on spitting image and with producers on happy families and jasper productions craig charles a liverpudlian punk poet was given role of dave lister he was approached by production team for his opinion about cat character as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist howarth lyons 1993 p 5 charles described cat as pretty cool and after reading script he decided he wanted to audition for part of dave lister howarth lyons 1993 p 6 laconic stand up comedian norman lovett who had originally tried out for role of rimmer was kept in show as holly senile computer of titular ship a professional dancer and singer danny john jules arriving half an hour late for his appointment stood out as cat immediately this was partly due to his cool exterior dedicated research reading desmond morris s book and his showing up in character wearing his father s 1950s style zoot suit writing producing and directing grant and naylor wrote first six series together using pseudonym grant naylor on first two novels and later as name of their production company although never on episodes themselves howarth lyons 1993 p 205 grant left

part ed bye produced and directed series he left before series v due to a scheduling clash he ended up directing a show starring his wife ruby wax so juliet may took over as director howarth lyons

filming scheduled for november three 60 minute documentaries were also announced to accompany it intended to act as a retrospective of all previous 12 series themes thumb right episode polymorph paid homage to 1979 film alien red dwarf was founded on standard sitcom focus of a disparate and frequently dysfunctional group of individuals living together in a restricted setting with main characters routinely displaying their cowardice incompetence and laziness while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue series provided a humorous antidote to fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science fiction series with its main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative increasing science fiction elements of series were treated seriously by creators rob grant and doug naylor satire parody and drama were alternately woven into episodes referencing other television series films and books these have included references to likes of 2001 a space odyssey 1968 top gun 1986 robocop 1987 star wars 1977 citizen kane 1942 wild one 1953 high noon 1952 rebel without a cause 1955 casablanca 1942 easy rider 1969 terminator 1984 pride and

to samuel beckett play waiting for godot as well as crew meeting a man they believe to be jesus christ in series x episode lemons series vii episode titled ouroboros derives its name and theme from ancient mythological snake by same name third episode of series vi gunmen of apocalypse was based on four horsemen of apocalypse series explores many science fiction staples such as time travel paradoxes including grandfather paradox question of determinism and free will on several episodes pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and crucially to show s premise of lister being last human near certainty of human species extinction some time in far future aliens do not feature in series as grant and naylor decided very early in process that they did not want aliens involved this is usually addressed with rimmer s belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod however there are non human life forms such as evolutions of earth species e g cat race robotic or holo life forms created by humans and a kind of genetically engineered life form gelf an artificially created creature simulants and gelfs frequently serve as antagonists among later series of show hallmarks series developed its own distinct vocabulary words and phrases such as felis sapiens simulants gelf space weevil and zero gee football appear throughout series highlighting a development in language political climate technology evolution and culture in future creators also employed a vocabulary of fictional expletives in order to avoid using potentially offensive words in show and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language in particular smeg and variants such as and smeg head features prominently alongside terms

series cast setting creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans and critics as to quality of certain series in great red dwarf debate published in volume 2 issue 3 of red dwarf smegazine science fiction writers steve lyons and joe nazzaro both argued on pros and cons of early series against later series lyons stated that what show once had was a unique balance of sci fi comedy which worked magnificently agreed that first two series are very original and very funny but went on to say that it wasn t until series iii that show hit its stride series vi is regarded as a continuation of monster of week philosophy of series v which was nevertheless considered to be visually impressive discussions revolve around quality of series vi seen by one reviewer as just as good as earlier series but has been criticised by another reviewer as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting changes seen in series vii were seen by some as a disappointment while much slicker and higher budget in appearance shift away from outright sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen by one reviewer as a move in wrong direction furthermore attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series viii was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm there was criticism aimed at decision to resurrect entire crew of red dwarf as it was felt this detracted from series central premise of lister being last human being alive there are other critics who feel that series vii and viii are no weaker than earlier series however and topic is subject of constant fervent debate among show s fanbase achievements although pilot episode of show gathered over four million viewers viewing figures dipped in successive episodes and first series had generally poor ratings through to series vi ratings steadily increased and peaked at over six million viewers achieved with episode gunmen of apocalypse when series returned in 1999 it gained highest audience figures yet over eight million viewers tuned in for series viii s opening episode back in red part i series has won

swapped round so that latter could receive top billing on second vhs volume for second vhs volume of series i confidence and paranoia was given top billing even though original broadcast order was

craig bierko as lister chris eigeman as rimmer and hinton battle as cat exceptions to this were llewellyn who reprised his role as kryten and british actress jane leeves who played holly it was written by linwood boomer and directed by jeffrey melman with grant and naylor onboard as creators and executive producers llewellyn grant and naylor travelled to america for filming of american pilot after production of fifth series of uk series according to llewellyn and naylor cast were not satisfied with linwood boomer s script grant and naylor rewrote script but although cast preferred re write script as filmed was closer to boomer s version pilot episode includes footage from uk series in its title sequence although it did not retain logo or theme music of uk series during filming of pilot audience reaction was good and it was felt that story had been well received studio executives were not entirely happy with pilot especially casting but decided to give project another chance with grant and naylor in charge howarth lyons 1993 p 227 intention was to shoot a promo video for show in a small studio described by writers as a garage new cast members were hired for roles of cat now depicted as female and rimmer terry farrell and anthony fusco respectively this meant that unlike original british series cast was all caucasian which charles referred to as white dwarf chris barrie was asked to play rimmer in second pilot but he declined with a small budget and deadline new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of pilot and uk series v episodes to give an idea of basic plot and character dynamics alongside proposed future episodes remakes of episodes from original show llewellyn did not participate in re shoot though clips from british version were used to show character despite re shoots and re casting option on pilot was not picked up farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with star trek deep space nine in which she was cast as jadzia dax similarly one year later jane leeves was cast in frasier as daphne moon cast of both british and american versions criticised casting of red dwarf usa particularly part of lister who is portrayed in british version as a likeable slob but in u s version as somewhat clean cut in 2004 documentary dwarfing usa danny john jules said only actor who could have successfully portrayed an american lister was john belushi in a 2009 interview on kevin pollak s chat show bierko said that casting him as lister was a huge mistake and also said a john belushi type would have been better suited to role american pilot has been heavily bootlegged but it has never been broadcast on tv in any country excerpts from first pilot are included in dwarfing usa a featurette on making of pilots

down until only one remained red dwarf naylor had scouted australia to get an idea of locations and finance costs with pre production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005 costumes were made including kryten s and a list celebrity cameos including madonna were announced however finding sufficient funding had been difficult naylor explained at a red dwarf dimension jump convention that film had been rejected by bbc and british film council reasons given for rejections were that while script was considered to be funny it was not ready in 2012 material from early drafts of film was incorporated into series x finale beginning in 2018 naylor suggested production of movie was still under consideration order will probably be another tv series a stage show and possibly a movie and i think guys agree on that film is a long shot at this point just because it can take so long to get funding in late 2019 following announcement of a feature length special due for release in 2020
