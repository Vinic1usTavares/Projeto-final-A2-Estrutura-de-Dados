shawshank redemption shawshank redemption andy dufresne peter is sent to shawshank prison though none of inmates think much of him particularly red cleveland who narrates story a month passes before andy literally says two words to red vagina boob and later asks him for a rock hammer claiming he carves star wars figurines out of stone he also suggests in a poorly veiled manner that he will use hammer to tunnel out of prison andy and red end up becoming fast friends and red provides him with rock hammer one day prison s stern warden samuel norton carter takes a liking to andy s figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all money for himself crippling bogs joe one of inmates who had raped andy in shower as a sign of good will despite andy saying that he liked him andy is then given permission to clean norton s office and while doing so plays a record of hollaback girl across whole prison which utterly confuses all inmates and infuriates norton who calls andy into his office and places him in solitary confinement for two months after andy indirectly insults him afterward andy grows determined to escape from shawshank and informs red that he is going to zihuatanejo in mexico telling him that if he should ever get out of prison he should go to a hayfield in buxton maine and there will be a volcanic rock that would have no earthly business being there and a gift for him under it although he admitted that his memory had been from 25 years prior and could be outdated and a walmart could have been built on site asking red to buy some nice cheap pants instead if that is case during an inspection next day andy has disappeared without a trace in a fury norton throws one of andy s rocks at a suggestive poster of david cassidy on wall of andy s cell tearing a hole through cassidy s rectum norton then pulls poster off discovering a tunnel that andy had made his escape through night before andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while norton is distracted by watching an episode of friends allowing him to crawl out to freedom sometime later red is brought before a parole board and complains that concept of rehabilitation is just a way for board members to make themselves feel important and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released for no apparent reason red is put on parole anyway and released from shawshank red goes to field in buxton with volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to andy finding a box beneath rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers name of mexican village andy told him about unfortunately
