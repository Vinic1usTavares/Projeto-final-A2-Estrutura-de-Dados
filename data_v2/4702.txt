between owners led by commissioner david stern and players led by director billy hunter and president patrick ewing of labor union national basketball players association nbpa was reached as cba was set to expire on june 30 2005 two sides began to negotiate in early 2005 there were several issues obstructing new agreement which included adding an age limit for rookies toughening existing drug testing program and limiting length of long term contracts however negotiations went smoothly and two sides were able to reach a deal in june 2005 avoiding lockout that deal guaranteed players 57 percent of basketball related income bri and lasted for six years until june 30 2011 a year after signing deal eight owners signed a petition requesting stern address disparity between small market and large market teams they wrote that hard truth is that our current economic system works only for larger market teams and a few teams that have extraordinary success rest of us are looking at significant and unacceptable annual financial losses derek fisher succeeded ewing as nbpa president in 2006 in early 2011 negotiations on a new cba began league claimed that it was losing 300 million a year 22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season and proposed to reduce 40 of players salary about 800 million and institute a hard salary cap at 45 million per team as opposed to a soft cap at 58 million currently in use union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout in may 2011 nbpa filed a complaint with national labor relations board nlrb accusing league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players nba quickly rejected complaint saying that league complies fully with federal labor laws union also considered option of decertification which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against nba with time winding down negotiations continued in may and june on salary cap owners in their newest proposal call for a system called flex cap that limits payroll at 62 million but penalizes teams if teams payroll exceeds league s average payroll of that season union argued that it is still a hard cap because ceiling would kick in eventually on salary reduction players offered to cut 500 million over next five years their share of bri would be reduced from 57 to 54 3 percent owners instead proposed to cut 2 billion over next 10 years as a last ditch effort to avert a lockout owners and players met again on june 30 2011 to negotiate but both sides failed to reach a resolution on key issues like salary cap and bri splits both stern and hunter said that two sides remained far apart owners demanded a larger share claiming that they were losing money players on other hand were willing to make concessions but they refused to completely cave in to owners demands negotiations broke off and cba expired at midnight lockout initial months lockout was officially started by owners on july 1 2011 during which teams could not trade sign or contact players and players could not access nba team facilities trainers or staffs negotiations resumed at an august 1 bargaining session but it fell apart after three hours on august 2 2011 nba filed two unfair labor practice claims against nbpa one at nlrb and another at a federal district court in new york league accused players of being uncooperative in negotiations by threatening to dissolve their union and file antitrust lawsuits hunter in a statement released by union called lawsuits without merit and that union would seek to dismiss it in court on august 4 hunter said that he thought entire would likely be canceled thumb 160px right derek fisher was players union president during lockout nbpa and owners returned to negotiate again on august 31 with a sense of urgency no specifics were disclosed although both sides hoped to meet again soon everyone loses if we don t reach an agreement that s something that i think has always been understood said union president derek fisher i will say we are not apart in terms of an agreed urgency on getting a deal done said nba deputy commissioner adam silver union and owners met again on september 13 but negotiation soon collapsed salary cap structure remained main source of disagreement owners wanted to create a hard cap for team payroll union wanted to keep current structure intact referring to it as a blood issue players were willing to cut salary only if owners agree to compromise on salary cap but owners were unwilling to concede saying that there must be a system in place that allows all teams to compete five of sports agents arn bill duffy mark bartelstein jeff schwartz and dan who represent one third of nba players spoke with each other about decertifying union they believed owners have most of leverage in negotiation and viewed decertification as a way for players to take control hunter said however that players had not considered decertification at this point on september 15 fisher sent an email to 400 plus players asking for unity in email he said that recent meetings were effective he suggested that failure of having a deal was not due to disagreement between players and owners but due to disagreement among owners fisher also used opportunity to counter agents suggestion of disbanding union saying that they were not making a drastic move that leaves players without a union according to sources there was indeed disagreement among owners some thought players proposal of taking 52 of bri was fair and were willing to compromise on things like tying players future earnings to nba s future revenue growth and maintaining current salary level cavaliers dan gilbert and suns robert sarver were among hardliners who oppose deal while knicks james dolan and lakers jerry buss were among group in favor of it stern denied that there was a rift among owners following day saying i don t know what basis of derek s belief is cancellations on september 23 2011 nba canceled training camp which was to begin october 3 and first week of preseason games which were to run october 9 through 15 nba postpones camps indefinitely espn retrieved september 23 2011 incident marks only second time in league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage both owners and union had planned to meet on september 30 in new york and pledged to continue through weekends if progress was being made a source close to situation leaked to espn that stern plans to threaten cancellation of season if no deal is made but union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat commentators speculated that stern wants to put pressure on players and prevent negotiation from dragging through fall meeting on september 30 was tense as dwyane wade reportedly yelled at stern after he pointed his finger at wade players nearly stormed out but they remained in meeting only after hunter asked them to stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel season if there is no deal thumb left 160px lakers owner jerry buss was open to sharing a larger share of revenues with players on october 4 nba canceled remainder of preseason stern said league would lose 200 million by canceling preseason and warned that first two weeks of season would be in jeopardy if no deal is reached by october 10 players proposed that they receive 53 of bri while owners countered with 47 two sides then discussed a 50 50 split of bri with owners offering players 49 of bri with incentives that would raise value to 51 players countered by asking for 51 which would increase to 53 percent using those same incentives it was rejected by owners attempts for sides to meet on october 7 failed union said nba demanded a 50 50 revenue split prior to meeting while league refuted making any such demands after talks on october 9 and 10 two sides were unable to reach a deal and stern subsequently canceled first two weeks of regular season games which were originally scheduled to begin on november 1 bri remained main issue but other differences included luxury tax player contract length and mid level exception owners proposed a 2 tax for every 1 that a team spends above tax threshold for player salaries tax would rise to as high as 4 for every 1 above limit for teams that are repeat offenders previous cba in comparison called for a 1 tax for every 1 over limit players refused to accept a hard salary cap which they felt more punitive luxury taxes would effectively create stern said owners felt a harsher luxury tax would make league more competitive wade countered that a small market team like san antonio spurs had won multiple championships andrew zimbalist an economist at smith college said that statistical correlation between payroll and win percentage is practically nonexistent in nba espn concluded that a team s draft efficiency accounted for 34 of its winning percentage in past decade while payroll showed only a 7 correlation new york times noted that a fairer system was needed for small market teams but league s popularity historically relied on predictably successful teams with multiple superstars nbpa leaders met with around 30 players on october 14 and stressed unity washington wizards player javale mcgee left meeting early and told reporters there were some players saying that they re ready to fold but majority was united mcgee later denied mentioning that players were ready to fold but his comment was recorded by reporters fisher said mcgee had no ability to make that statement based on limited time he spent at meeting owners and players met again on october 18 20 for 30 hours of talks over three days they met before a federal mediator george cohen director of federal mediation and conciliation service cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve 2011 nfl lockout at conclusion of meetings sides remained split on revenue split and structure of salary cap league proposed a 50 50 split of bri and players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50 of bri to a maximum of 53 depending on league s revenues gilbert told players to trust that salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted 50 50 proposal hunter responded i can t trust your gut i got to trust my own gut silver and san antonio spurs owner peter holt told reporters that players refused to negotiate after 50 50 proposal fisher told press that you guys were lied to by owners hunter said owners told them take it or leave it cohen decided that there was no useful purpose to continue mediation tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues allowing a one time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against salary cap granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and impact to salary cap over multiple years and a mid level exception of 5 million hunter characterized small market owners as being inflexible in negotiation however new york times wrote that views of individual owners cannot be easily categorized by market size revenue personal wealth or championship aspirations dallas mavericks owner mark cuban whose team is in fifth largest market and has one of highest payrolls and portland trail blazers owner paul allen 23rd wealthiest person in america are as interested as small market owners in changing economy of nba in an effort to increase competition while owners of profitable teams like buss and dolan are willing to accept modest changes to cba they remain united with small market teams based on concerns for league s long term health despite earlier cancellation announcement players and league hoped that a full 82 game schedule could be salvaged if a deal is reached in time on october 28 stern announced cancellation of all games through november 30 after negotiations regarding division of revenue ended without an agreement he said that hunter was unwilling to go a penny below 52 on bri while hunter said we made a lot of concessions but unfortunately at this time it s not enough stern indicated that an 82 game season was no longer possible he added that tentative agreement was reached for maximum contract lengths of five years for players staying with their teams or four years when signing with another team thumb right 160px hornets owner michael jordan a former player was among hardline owners during negotiations reports of division among players and owners surfaced jason whitlock of foxsports com wrote that fisher was privately working with stern on 50 50 split and that hunter confronted fisher about issue fisher and stern denied a private meeting took place in a letter to players fisher called reports absurd and demanded a retraction for libelous and defamatory stories through his attorneys hunter said his relationship with derek is very good there was no confrontation fisher as union president is not empowered to make unilateral decisions for union while fisher believed a 50 50 deal could be considered hunter maintained that owners should never make same or more than players miami heat owner micky arison one of owners willing to settle with players responded to a fan complaining about greedy owners and players on twitter saying that you are barking at wrong owner he was fined 500 000 by stern five times larger than any previous amount against an owner for publicly commenting on labor situation washington wizards owner ted leonsis and charlotte bobcats owner michael jordan had been fined 100 000 each for public comments on lockout leonsis had commented about owners desire for a hard salary cap while jordan told an australian newspaper that league s business model was broken citing owners desire for revenue sharing a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners led by jordan wanted to cap players share of bri at 50 and as low as 47 during labor dispute in 1998 then player jordan told washington wizards then owner abe if you can t make a profit you should sell your team whitlock called jordan a sellout wanting current players to pay for his incompetence he cited jordan s executive decisions to draft disappointing players kwame brown and adam morrison in early november about 50 players renewed talks of union decertification if union went lower than 52 5 of bri or agreed to additional restrictions on contracts salary cap exceptions or free agency decertifying would require that 30 of union about 130 players sign a petition allowing an election under auspices of nlrb by all nbpa members to with a simple majority nlrb traditionally does not consider a decertification petition while a charge is pending such as nbpa s unfair labor practice charges filed in august owners and players union met on november 6 and they were joined again by federal mediator cohen players proposed that they receive 51 of bri with a 1 portion taken out for retired players owners offered a band that would pay players 49 to 51 depending on revenue growth jeff kessler union s attorney said league s proposal was really 50 2 and called possibility of reaching 51 an illusion league also proposed restrictions for teams that pay luxury tax banning them from sign and trade deals and limiting their use of mid level exception they also proposed a repeater tax for teams that exceed tax threshold thrice in a five year

were his boys keeping hired hands in their place nba owners are predominantly white while players are mostly black espn noted that william c rhoden in his book 40 million slaves had earlier dealt with topic of players as slaves in spite of earning millions of dollars stern dismissed gumbel s comments as an occupational hazard of being nba commissioner in early november nbpa attorney jeffrey l kessler criticized owners take it or leave it bargaining approach instead of treating players like partners they re treating them like plantation workers hall of famer magic johnson called comments ridiculous and defended stern s record of promoting blacks espn magazine said that nbpa did not condone kessler s statements and they had intentionally avoided getting involved with gumbel s earlier

to nba commissioner david stern and nbpa chief billy hunter requesting that they end lockout based on perspective of city residents and negative impact a canceled season might have on them our cities

compelling league built a new schedule from scratch based on available arena dates in october league had allowed arenas in los angeles and chicago to reassign nba dates for other events number of games between conferences was affected as was case in 1999 lockout when each team played only five or six games in a 50 game schedule normally each team plays teams in other conference twice each

more games per month and also played three consecutive games at least once in season in total league had 42 sets of back to back to back games with 11 teams playing two such sets three game set or triple had not occurred since shortened 1999 season which featured 64 triples and play due to tired players before that last occurrence was two decades earlier during season there were 29 occasions when teams played five games in six days with fewer off days during season level of play was lower due to fatigue and some older players rested to avoid burnout and recuperate from injuries when san
