new melones dam is an earth and rock filled embankment dam on stanislaus river about west of jamestown california united states on border of calaveras county and tuolumne county water impounded by tall dam forms new melones lake california s fourth largest reservoir in foothills of sierra nevada east of san joaquin valley dam serves mainly for irrigation water supply and also provides hydropower generation flood control and recreation benefits dam was authorized in 1944 as a unit of federal central valley project a system designed to provide irrigation water to fertile agricultural region of central valley it would be built by u s army corps of engineers corps and transferred to u s bureau of reclamation reclamation upon completion in 1966 work began to clear foundations for a high dam that would replace an earlier much smaller structure built by two irrigation districts construction of main embankment began in 1976 and was topped out in late 1978 filling of new melones lake commenced in 1978 and dam s hydroelectric station produced its first power in mid 1979 new melones was focus of a long environmental battle during 1970s and early 1980s critics protested flooding of a long scenic stretch of stanislaus river which flowed over whitewater rapids through deepest limestone canyon in western united states protestors employed a variety of methods some extreme to prevent filling of new melones lake until 1983 when record setting floods filled reservoir and nearly breached dam s emergency spillway fight over new melones galvanized river conservation movement in california and influenced major water policy changes on state and federal levels since its completion no other dams of its size or importance have been built in united states new melones project has continued to generate controversy due to water yield from project being lower than expected and use of new melones water to meet federal environmental standards at expense of farming reservoir is considered over allocated in an average year it is unable to meet all demands placed on it debate over water rights continues today with environmentalists seeking to further increase fishery flows and stanislaus irrigation districts asserting their senior rights to river specifications new melones dam and its reservoir comprise independent new melones unit of central valley project dam s primary purpose is to control runoff from or about 92 percent of watershed of stanislaus river a major tributary of san joaquin river at high from foundations and long and containing of material new melones is second tallest earthfill dam in united states after oroville dam and sixth tallest dam overall with a crest elevation of dam rises for above streambed flood waters are released through an unlined spillway about a mile 1 6 km northwest of dam with a capacity of dam also has an outlet works which can release up to thumb left new melones dam and lake looking north impounded water behind dam forms new melones lake which at full pool of above sea level encompasses of surface water and a volume of about 19 percent of reservoir s capacity is reserved for flood control during flooding events dam is operated to keep flows on stanislaus river below although this figure may be lowered depending on flow conditions in san joaquin river between 1978 and 2010 dam prevented a total of 505 million in flooding damages adjusted for inflation including 231 million during new year s flood of 1997 alone however manteca bulletin noted that dam was operated carelessly during 1997 flood almost of farmland was flooded near confluence of stanislaus and san joaquin rivers and a further 80 million of damage could have been prevented had reservoir been kept at a safe level dam s hydroelectric power plant is located at its base on north side of river and has a rated hydraulic head of plant houses two 150 0 mw francis turbines for a total capacity of 300 mw daily releases are made on a peaking basis seasonal totals are dictated by irrigation in summer and flood control in winter requirements below dam release from new melones is re regulated by smaller downstream reservoir of tulloch dam ensuring a stable flow in stanislaus river for period 2001 to 2015 plant produced an average of 418 million kilowatt hours kwh annually this ranged from a high of 910 million kwh in fiscal year 2006 to a low of 130 million kwh in 2015 plant replaced old 22 mw power station at original melones dam on average it generates about four times as much electricity as original did by controlling flows of stanislaus river dam and reservoir make available of additional water each year about of land along stanislaus river are irrigated using water from new melones according to bureau of reclamation increase in water supply from new melones dam has translated into prosperity for region allowing growth of cities including tracy and manteca and irrigating high value crops including almonds walnuts and grapes in addition new melones lake is one of major tourist draws of region providing activities such as boating fishing and shoreline camping an estimated 800 000 people visit lake each year however droughts can cause closure of lake facilities due to low water levels history background thumb right original melones dam modern development of stanislaus river began with oakdale and south san joaquin irrigation districts which were created in 1909 under wright act to serve farmers in area early irrigation along stanislaus river was dependent on natural flow of river which was never enough to water crops during late summer and fall in 1926 two irrigation districts jointly completed original melones dam a high concrete arch dam with a storage capacity of this reservoir was still not big enough for all demands placed on it especially during long droughts of 1930s storage capacity of these early reservoirs was limited and irrigation districts sought to increase size of melones reservoir federal flood control act of 1944 authorized u s army corps of engineers to build a arch dam with a capacity of as a primary flood control structure it would protect of farmland as well as towns of oakdale riverbank and ripon from flooding it would generate electricity using original 22 megawatt melones hydroelectric plant however cost benefit analysis conducted for project then known as new melones i did not justify construction of dam for flood control alone if other benefits such as irrigation fishery conservation and recreation were included cost benefit ratio became positive corps downplayed these additional benefits intending to keep it primarily as a flood control structure because an irrigation project would then fall under authority of u s bureau of reclamation during 1950s irrigation districts built two more dams donnells and beardsley along upper stanislaus river forming along with tulloch dam below melones dam tri dam project corps objected to tri dam project because additional storage provided by these smaller dams further decreased potential flood control benefit of new melones with corps unable to provide a sound economic justification new melones i was ultimately shelved in 1954 meanwhile oakdale and south san joaquin irrigation districts had conducted their own study in late 1940s and proposed a bigger dam tall with a capacity of 1 1 million acre feet 1 4 km3 or approximately one year s worth of stanislaus river runoff thumb left map of stanislaus river watershed showing today s major dams and reservoirs bureau of reclamation first surveyed melones dam site in 1950s and initially supported proposed 1 1 million acre foot reservoir but soon increased size of project to be known as new melones ii twofold as part of central valley project bureau cited numerous benefits to a larger reservoir which it estimated would capture of extra water per year to increase irrigation supply other units of central valley project and maintain a minimum flow in stanislaus river to protect fish before new melones was built diversions often dried river completely in summer this water would be provided above and beyond fulfilling previously existing water rights to irrigation districts although 1944 version of project had been abandoned bureau and corps continued to argue over who would construct dam flood control act of 1962 authorized final design of dam changing it from an arch to an embankment dam increasing size of projected reservoir to and requiring construction of a new power plant it also settled interagency dispute by authorizing corps to construct dam and direct flood control operations and bureau to operate dam for its other intended purposes such as irrigation and hydroelectricity in early 1960s there was some local opposition to project on grounds that it was too big with a reservoir more than twice as large as annual flow of stanislaus river it might never fill and would be a waste of federal central valley project funds there was also concern that water from new melones ii might be exported outside stanislaus river basin and sold elsewhere therefore a rider attached to 1962 act reserved water for use within basin with export of excess water only two years later christmas flood of 1964 caused considerable damage along stanislaus river that a large dam could have prevented congressman john j mcfall seized political leverage that only floods could provide and urged drenched farmers to support new melones dam with opposition having largely turned to support congress approved funding in 1965 with construction starting following year initial construction and controversy actual construction began in july 1966 with clearing of dam and reservoir site construction of access roads foundation preparations and excavations for future outlet works a diversion tunnel to allow river to bypass dam site was excavated between 1966 and december 1973 corps opened bids for construction of main dam on october 10 1972 melones contractors a consortium formed by guy f company gordon h ball and arundel corp won primary construction contract for 109 7 million while allis chalmers and general electric took an 11 5 million contract to provide turbines and hydroelectric generating equipment during reservoir clearing operations usace spent about 28 million relocating roads and bridges in future reservoir space foundation work for dam itself began on march 6 1974 with first embankment material placed in january 1976 much of embankment fill came from an excavation shortly northwest of dam which would later serve as dam s spillway during height of construction in summer total workforce reached about 800 while averaging between 500 600 in winter months although 1964 floods had initially generated support for new melones a spirited opposition to dam arose from both river recreation industry and environmentalists who saw stanislaus river canyon as having greater value than a reservoir river runners protested threat to stanislaus river which was becoming one of most popular whitewater runs in united states with first commercial rafting company established in 1962 see images of river rafting and canyon at stanislaus river archive river flowed through deepest limestone canyon in us with cliffs rising above water in places other natural features of area included extensive limestone caves and endemic species such as melones melones cave in addition more than one hundred archaeological and historical sites left over from native american inhabitation and gold rush period were all situated in reservoir flood zone environmental group friends of river for was formed in early 1970s to push a statewide ballot measure proposition 17 which would have designated of stanislaus river between stanislaus powerhouse and parrott s ferry as a national wild and scenic river and stopped construction of new melones dam development related interests such as pg e california chamber of commerce and contractors working on dam spent millions of dollars lobbying against prop 17 see images on stanislaus river archive one of their slogans stop wild river hoax argued that this part of stanislaus river was not untouched wilderness as dams already existed both upstream and downstream of 9 mile segment and therefore was ineligible for wild and scenic designation this statement was misleading since language of wild and scenic rivers act does not disqualify rivers with dams only portions already inundated by reservoirs dam supporters also argued that stanislaus river in its natural state was only accessible to a small group of people that rafting companies held a monopoly on river recreation and a reservoir would open up area for far more tourists than would have visited otherwise bringing more economic benefits to area after prop 17 lost by a voter margin of 53 47 project s opponents which had grown to include other environmental groups such as friends of river and sierra club shifted their focus on limiting amount of water reservoir could hold rather than trying to stop dam altogether in meantime construction on dam continued to progress on april 1 1978 gates of diversion tunnel were closed and new melones lake began to fill soon inundating old melones dam as reservoir filled work moved ahead on power plant and generating units which were all completed by end of 1978 main embankment of dam was topped out on october 28 1978 protests and filling of lake on may 22 1979 mark dubois one of founders of for hiked into stanislaus river canyon and chained himself to a boulder forcing corps to stop filling lake or risk drowning him dubois hid in canyon for five days while local authorities tried unsuccessfully to find him he had written letters to corps and governor jerry brown telling them of his plans in advance see documents and images of this event on stanislaus river archive ultimately dam operators opened gates halting rising reservoir at an elevation of or about below its maximum design level corps was delayed in handing project over to bureau of reclamation as testing could not be completed on hydroelectric turbines until water level increased further on may 29 governor brown vetoed assembly bill which would have allowed filling new melones lake to its full capacity thumb left kayakers in stanislaus at bailey falls one of normally flooded areas above parrott s ferry bridge this area was briefly exposed during drought in 2014 which lowered lake level in meantime environmental groups lobbied for a compromise to stay lake level at old parrott s ferry bridge above sea level corresponding to a storage capacity of we can have a working dam and a wild river irrigation districts reclamation officials and local representatives including john garamendi and norman s waters argued that to complete dam only to not fill it was absurd state of california initially sided with opposition on november 20 1980 state water resources control board set temporary upper limit for lake level at old parrott s ferry bridge with that limit in place operations of dam and reservoir were handed to reclamation over next two years state continued to delay allowing reservoir to fill because bureau of reclamation had not convincingly demonstrated that irrigation need will outweigh any damage that results to fish wildlife and recreation in watershed above new melones dam further studies by california department of fish and wildlife and bureau of reclamation itself showed that completely filling new melones lake would in fact offset some of benefits of project for example if additional water were provided for farms even more water would have to be released into stanislaus river to wash out polluted return flows from new irrigation a larger reservoir would also halt stanislaus spring flooding to such an extent that it would harm salmon populations that dam was intended to benefit also a higher reservoir would allow for less flood control space in emergencies state determined that optimal reservoir volume was which would provide enough water to fulfill existing rights and fishery flows as well as provide a hedge against droughts and floods although it would inundate about of river above parrott s ferry for agreed to this compromise ultimately it was nature not political maneuvering that led to filling of new melones lake winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of wettest recorded in 20th century stanislaus river swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through dam s outlets and reservoir rapidly surpassed temporary limit winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached lip of emergency spillway but did not flow over it a level that has not been surpassed since with lake full state of california lifted temporary limit in march 1983 a deciding factor in rescinding of water level limit was prevention of 50 million in damages by new melones dam in 1982 and 1983 which demonstrated dam s value for flood control water rights disputes thumb right low water levels at new melones 2012 new melones dam has a very large storage capacity relative to watershed that feeds it as compared to other major reservoirs in california potential water yield and thus supply contracts of melones project were calculated based on stream flow data between 1922 and 1978 however this period may have been somewhat wetter than long term average bureau of reclamation estimated additional water yield per year as but actual yield has been closer to as a result reservoir is often at a low water level because in most years demand is greater than supply in 38 years between 1978 and 2016 new melones has only reached capacity five times and only once in 1983 has it reached level of spillway between 1987 and 1992 reclamation was forced to purchase water from other agencies to fulfill new melones water obligations even so reservoir fell to a record low level of 3 5 of capacity on october 1 1992 conversely great storage capacity also means that new melones can capture more flood runoff while other major california reservoirs must release it to maintain flood control space original contracted water supply from new melones dam was of which was allocated to oakdale and south san joaquin irrigation districts who owned original melones dam and have oldest water rights for stanislaus river water quality and fishery conservation and for stockton east water district originally reclamation had planned to extend water supply to other users but even from start melones project was barely able to meet these existing targets new melones releases are important for regional groundwater recharge a vital water source for farmers when surface water supplies are cut off due to drought and to protect water quality in stanislaus and san joaquin rivers by diluting pollutants during late summer and fall dry season fishery flows after central valley project improvement act in 1991 and bay delta water quality control plan in 1995 much more water was required to meet target environmental flows in stanislaus and san joaquin rivers and delta which conflicts with original language of 1962 act authorizing dam which stated that only excess water could be appropriated for these uses one of new requirements was for spring and autumn pulse flows intended to help migration of anadromous fish chinook salmon and steelhead trout in particular this policy has been criticized by local irrigation districts as a waste of water during dry years as fish populations have continued to struggle despite additional flows reclamation officials argue that flows are needed to meet state and federal requirements as well as earlier endangered species act of 1972 as a result melones project is now only able to meet all its contracts in above average water years local water users have coined somewhat derisive nickname of green dam because policy has shifted to favor fish rather than farmers thumb left a pair of chinook salmon in stanislaus river a further constraint is that water released in autumn must be cold enough for anadromous fish to survive and thus must be made from lower level outlets at new melones dam however old melones dam was not demolished during construction of new dam original dam remains submerged far below reservoir surface only rarely re emerging when water level is low old dam partially blocks movement of cold water from deepest parts of reservoir causing warmer surface water to be drawn out instead as a result in certain years amount of irrigation water has been reduced in order to maintain enough depth in new melones lake in fall to preserve cold water pool a 2016 study by independent environmental consulting group fishbio showed that artificial spring pulse flows from new melones dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out migration in stanislaus river rather fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall as they naturally would have before many dams on stanislaus river were built in spring of 2016 about 12 500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to sea during april and may but less than 1 percent migrated during pulse flow in years of drought when lake level is low releasing water during spring creates consequences later in year because there is not enough cold water left for autumn spawning run state of california has further proposed that between 20 and 60 percent of unimpaired or natural flow of stanislaus river be allowed to run downstream during spring to support ailing fish populations in addition minimum level of new melones lake would be set at 29 percent capacity at all times in order to preserve cold water pool this would essentially limit usable storage in reservoir to between cold water pool and flood control pool further handicapping ability of reservoir to manage water this plan has been met with outcry from local cities and irrigation districts which contend that it would heavily damage farming economy and cause thousands of seasonal jobs to disappear furthermore it does not address other major problems including introduced striped bass in san joaquin river which eat many if not most of juvenile salmon and steelhead before they even reach sea conflict and compromise in 2015 congressman tom mcclintock introduced hr 1668 save our water act which amends endangered species act of 1973 esa to suspend during droughts application of esa to water releases from water storage facilities by federal and state agencies in a navigable river basin mcclintock specifically cited release of from new melones lake over several weeks in spring 2015 when new melones lake was approaching its lowest level on record since 1992 drought that year very few fish had returned to stanislaus to spawn in an editorial for mark wrote biologists estimate that it will affect offspring of about 29 steelhead trout in stanislaus river a few hundred sic almost all of which will be eaten by predators long before they reach ocean and that assumes they won t swim toward ocean on their own as they have been doing without our helpful assistance since time immemorial however bill did not pass one potential solution has been outlined in a 2016 agreement between bureau of reclamation local water districts and a number of other state and federal agencies local water districts would provide of water for fishery flows during spring this water would be sold to san luis delta mendota water authority instead of draining into ocean it would be captured by large central valley project and state water project pumping stations in delta for eventual re use on authority lands previously reclamation had been taking stanislaus irrigation districts water without paying for it essentially agreement allows for water to be re used for agriculture while still maintaining fishery flows in stanislaus river legacy controversy over new melones dam was one of most heated environmental disputes in u s at time dam was constructed at a time of growing public support for environmental preservation as compared to development or utilitarian conservation of natural resources friends of river describes campaign against dam as probably biggest citizen effort to save a river and stop a dam in american history bureau of reclamation itself has called new melones a case study of all that can go wrong with a project although opponents of dam were ultimately unsuccessful campaign greatly strengthened political power of river conservation movement in california and rest of united states in california a number of later dam projects were defeated by citizen opposition including a hydroelectric project on nearby tuolumne river which was canceled less than two years after new melones dam was completed thumb right 320px aerial view of new melones dam lower center and lake looking northeast in dam politics restoring america s rivers william r lowry writes new melones debate influenced eventual protection of a number of other northern california rivers eel klamath and others under national wild and scenic rivers system starting in 1980 it considerably changed california state government s approach to water resources development switching focus from massive dam projects to conservation and policy improvements in 1982 same year that new melones lake filled reclamation reform act set more stringent standards for vetting federal reclamation projects essentially distancing federal policy from dams everywhere approach of past however relative lack of new storage has severely strained california s water system which now serves 15 million more people than it did when new melones dam was
