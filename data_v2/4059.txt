for abuse maxine also said that when she went to work for wwf moolah was taking at least half of maxine s earnings debbie johnson another former trainee of ellison s stated that she was required to give ellison 30 of her booking fee and her paycheck was further reduced as ellison deducted travel expenses food rent and utilities before paying her as a result johnson worked for ellison for two

big push by vince mcmahon but left wwf shortly afterwards as ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings maxine said that moolah never told her about wwf s plans for maxine s character to be included on hulk hogan s rock n wrestling numerous other former trainees defected from ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with ellison women wrestlers including

later interviews that moolah would collect women wrestlers pay from promoters and after taking out her own pay would only give girls half of money they were owed keeping half of their pay for herself plus her own pay and telling them that was all promoter gave her to give them martin stated that shortly before ellison left wwf in 1988 shortly after falling out with martin and kai due to ellison no longer receiving their booking fees she sabotaged duo while they were touring japan martin stated that ellison contacted japanese promoters and informed them that jumping bomb angels were supposed to drop wwf women s tag team championship to glamour girls before martin and kai returned to united states this was contrary to booking decision made by pat patterson before japanese tour began unable to reach patterson by telephone kai and martin agreed to win titles from angels since ellison had already misinformed japanese promoters martin stated that upon returning to united states patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within wwf made decision for title change and that due to her long standing relationship with company wwf refused to listen to their explanation of ellison s deceit shortly thereafter wwf phased out wwf women s tag team championship in a later shoot interview leilani kai told that had things gone as wwf originally planned glamour girls would have had a title match against jumping bomb angels at wrestlemania iv and that ellison s actions had cost four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday women that chose to continue

couple of pay per view matches for wwf in 1985 but demanded she receive half of sing s pay check a stipulation sing was unwilling to accept penny banner stated that her retirement was due in large
