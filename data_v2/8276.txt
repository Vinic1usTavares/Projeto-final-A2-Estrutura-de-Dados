production development when last filming schedule for mani ratnam s directorial debut kannada film pallavi anu pallavi 1983 was delayed inordinately he began work on his next script divya which eventually became mouna ragam his fifth film divya was originally a short story about a couple s wedding night that ratnam did not plan to film but after writing story he realised it had cinematic possibilities ratnam took a break for a month from pallavi anu pallavi due to its delays and wrote script for divya for first time he was able to write in his native language tamil unlike pallavi anu pallavi where he wrote script in english and had it translated into kannada new title mouna ragam was derived from song naan mouna ragam from ratnam s fourth film idaya kovil 1985 he considered mouna ragam second film after pallavi anu pallavi to be made exactly as he wanted in contrast to idaya kovil where there was interference ratnam initially read script of mouna ragam when it was titled divya to producer n g john but latter wanted a political film which eventually became malayalam film unaru 1984 also directed by ratnam he then pitched divya to g thyagarajan of sathya jyothi films but thyagarajan wanted an action film and ratnam made pagal nilavu 1985 with him of motherland pictures too rejected divya saying it was not kind of film motherland would produce and ratnam instead made idaya kovil with them film was eventually picked up by ratnam s brother g venkateswaran under his sujatha films banner ending its five year development hell it was company s first film production until then it was only distributing and financing films mouna ragam was also ratnam s first collaboration with cinematographer p c sreeram film was edited by b lenin and v t vijayan with art direction by thota tharani casting ratnam cast his idaya kovil hero mohan as male lead chandrakumar and pagal nilavu heroine revathi as female lead divya he initially had someone like anant nag and supriya pathak in mind when he finished writing mouna ragam between finishing story and making film he decided to include revathi whose performance in mann 1983 impressed him claims she was also considered for role but declined due to prior commitments ra sankaran was cast as divya s father chandramouli kanchana as lawyer and v k ramasamy as chandrakumar s boss vani plays divya s mother and bhaskar her brother kalaiselvi and sonia play her sisters prabhu deva who became a successful dance choreographer made his acting debut in film with an appearance in song panivizhum iravu as a boy playing a flute according to ratnam only difference between divya and mouna ragam was inclusion of karthik s character manohar which was not part of earlier screenplay divya did not explore girl s past it just dealt with how she settles into an arranged marriage ratnam realised that story needed to satisfy a wider audience and decided to give them something that would make them accept character without questioning divya s actions then film could depict arranged marriage two strangers suddenly thrown together and how they adjust he originally resisted this but reconsidered because it provided a clear rationale for divya s resistance to arranged marriage karthik said he was a last minute addition to cast and described his role as a cameo filming principal photography began at p c sreeram s house in madras now chennai film s introductory credits feature photographs of revathi from her childhood through her teenage years her mother gave thota tharani pictures although film was primarily set indoors in delhi ratnam and sreeram wanted indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors since cast was relatively small ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for interior scenes tharani found a house in residential area of which admitted a great deal of sunlight making it similar to houses in delhi to reduce production costs food for film s crew was cooked at venkateswaran s home sreeram made extensive use of frontal and profile close ups set against long shots with out of focus foregrounds while filming manohar s introductory scene he had to lie on a bed sheet to film crew pulled sheet with sreeram and camera scene where manohar plays a prank on divya s father which later became known as mr chandramouli scene was shot at tic tac an open air restaurant in filming was also done at madras presidency college schmidt memorial on edward elliot s beach and madras literary society while filming song oho megam vandhadho which shows divya dancing in rain revathi tied a handkerchief around her wrist to cover her watch because she felt divya would actually do that crew filmed in delhi for two days and scenes set in agra were shot in one day portions of panivizhum iravu were shot at taj mahal in agra and those from mandram vandha were shot at india gate scenes involving karthik were last parts to be filmed being shot in either a week or two in post production mohan s voice was dubbed by s n surendar film s final length was themes and influences mouna ragam provides insight into issues faced by married couples exploring plight and perception of divorce how societies need to view desires of women and questions agency of women film critic baradwaj rangan compared it to killathe 1980 another story of a woman torn between man she loves and man she marries antha ezhu naatkal 1981 and its hindi remake woh saat din 1983 rakesh of news minute noted that one thing differentiating mouna ragam from antha ezhu naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on divya writing for popmatters described mouna ragam as a chick flick because like other chick flicks film allowed romance to blossom between divya and chandrakumar rather than let divorce separate them according to him chick flicks center on romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a warm and fuzzy denouement manohar was part of a group involved in anti government activities rangan drew similarities between his motives and those of characters in italian film night of shooting stars 1982 and unaru connection to night of shooting stars is referenced when a poster of it appears in a scene where manohar and his anarchist friends plan an event according to rangan scene where divya is looking after chandrakumar at hospital reflects her traditional qualities with her strengths she is humane and vulnerable divya s mischievous nature is shown in a scene where she teaches a sardar offensive tamil phrases which he says to chandrakumar s boss revathi compared herself to divya saying that divya believes in living life to fullest and she was once like that sujatha narayanan writing for new indian express described chandrakumar as a patient understanding and poised at all times man contrasting him with manohar who she described as a dashing brave and epitome of word dude she noted that divya like female leads in most of ratnam s films is practical with strong convictions and characters go through their confusions unapologetically according to ratnam line when you touch me it feels as if caterpillars are crawling on me spoken by divya to chandrakumar expressed how she would feel on her wedding night many critics have mentioned that mouna ragam background score suits its scenes and themes according to martin clayton trevor herbert and richard middleton s 2003 book cultural study of music a critical introduction oho megam vandhadho resembled broadway and mtv styles of singing and dancing and main songs combine american music with indian vocals by s janaki sangeetha devi dundoo of hindu considered that ratnam used rain in film to accentuate childlike free spirited nature of divya sarangi and are used in music accompanying chandrakumar and divya s wedding in scenes of couple sightseeing in delhi light synth based music depicts them as modern tourists in their own country restaurant scene with manohar and divya includes awkwardly played sitar music indicating couple s emotions spanish music is used for fight scene when manohar attacks mp s son radhakrishnan of hindu described panivizhum iravu as one of those only 80s songs that served as a stand in for sexual tension where you d have two people looking intensely at each other raveena joseph of hindu noted that films in 1980s and 1990s which featured men stalking women hoping to get them were reflective of times where romances were covert and such discretion was necessary even in consensual encounters citing manohar stalking divya in mouna ragam as an example film was ratnam s first to follow theme of a person moving to a strange place where they do not know local language divya has a dilemma because she does not know language in delhi she can barely socialise with local people and is in conflict with chandrakumar only person with whom she can socialise rangan believed manohar to be first character in a tamil film to invite a girl for a cup of coffee a form of dating he contrasted it with oru ragam 1980 in which protagonists barely spoke ratnam said that although it was not uncommon to invite a girl for a cup of coffee in 1980s it was not reflected in mainstream tamil cinema of time soundtrack mouna ragam soundtrack album consists of five songs composed by ilaiyaraaja with lyrics by vaali sung by s janaki and s p balasubrahmanyam it was released by echo records according to cultural study of music a critical introduction oho megam vandhadho featuring divya dancing with several teenage girls is a reworking of gene kelly s singin in rain nilaave vaa is second song on both sides of soundtrack s original lp record instrumental theme which does not appear on that lp record was partially inspired by love theme from flashdance from 1983 film flashdance majority of songs are set in carnatic ragas mandram vandha is set in keeravani with natabhairavi notes chinna chinna vanna is set in nilaave vaa is set in and panivizhum iravu is set in natabhairavi all songs attained immense popularity mandram vandha was later adapted by ilaiyaraaja and used twice in 2007 hindi film cheeni kum as its title
