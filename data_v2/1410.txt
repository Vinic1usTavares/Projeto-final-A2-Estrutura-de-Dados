avenue varick street and west broadway to serve west side of manhattan construction of this line in conjunction with construction of lexington avenue line would change operations of irt system instead of having trains go via broadway turning onto 42nd street before finally turning onto park avenue there would be two trunk lines connected by 42nd street shuttle system would be changed from looking like a z system on a map to an h system one trunk would run via new lexington avenue line down park avenue and other trunk would run via new seventh avenue line up broadway in order for line to continue down varick street and west broadway these streets needed to be widened and two new streets were built seventh avenue extension and varick street extension it was predicted that subway
