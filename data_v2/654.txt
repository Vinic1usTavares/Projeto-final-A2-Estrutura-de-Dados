tropical cyclone sose was a moderate storm system that chiefly impacted island nation of vanuatu in early april 2001 developing cyclone was first detected on april 3 while situated well to northeast of vanuatu as atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward west southwest after receiving name sose on april 5 cyclone was driven southeastward passing just west of espiritu santo and neighboring islands although it never made landfall sose was particularly expansive producing a wide area of gale force winds cyclone peaked in strength between april 7 and 8 with maximum 10 minute sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph and 1 minute sustained winds of 130 km h 80 mph placing it at category 2 intensity on australian tropical cyclone intensity scale ultimately stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper air pattern took their toll on cyclone as it progressed due south sose lost tropical characteristics to northeast of norfolk island by april 12 extratropical remnants of sose continued into tasman sea occurring just two months after cyclone paula affected vanuatu sose compounded damage already done by previous storm especially to crops and farmlands throughout island chain two people lost their lives to storm roadways were blocked by debris and floodwaters while schools and classrooms on several islands were damaged or ruined storm destroyed about 200 homes around nation and damaged many more particularly on southern espiritu santo storm s large fetch generated enormous swells as far away as australia s eastern seaboard where surfers took advantage of abnormally intense conditions and two swimmers drowned on mare island in new caledonia a man was swept away by a large wave and presumed dead storm later produced torrential rainfall and strong winds over north island of new zealand sparking damaging freshwater floods and downing trees and power lines hazardous driving conditions in waikato region led to a fatal traffic accident in which three people died another individual drowned in a swollen river sose reportedly contributed to coastal flooding as far away as tonga in all sose killed nine people total monetary damage is unknown as a result of storm s destruction its name was later retired meteorological history cyclone sose originated in a broad area of disturbed weather first identified on april 3 well to east northeast of vanuatu system initially drifted generally toward west under an improving upper level wind shear pattern that began to catalyze favorable outflow late on october 4 joint typhoon warning center jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on disturbance noting strong banding features and a well defined low level center of circulation tropical depression 13f formed at 1200 utc next day as examined by fiji meteorological service fms local regional specialized meteorological center at time new cyclone was situated about to northwest of espiritu santo jtwc s official best track entry on storm designated 19p first lists it as a tropical depression at 1800 utc on april 4 though operationally agency did not issue its first tropical cyclone warning until late on april 5 storm proceeded slowly westward and gradually continued to organize its intensification hindered by residual wind shear and its proximity to mountainous terrain of espiritu santo however convection over center continued to develop and consequently fms upgraded 13f to tropical cyclone sose at 1800 utc sose remained nearly stationary for a period of 24 hours blocked by a strong subtropical ridge to south over course of april 6 an approaching mid level trough of low pressure created a weakness in ridge allowing sose to accelerate southeastward storm s environment steadily improved in both lower and upper levels triggering consolidation of deep convection around center as a result early on april 7 a central dense overcast formed according to fms sose reached its peak strength at 1800 utc with maximum 10 minute sustained winds of 110 km h 70 mph and a central barometric pressure of cyclone passed just to west of islands of vanuatu as its outer bands contracted around well defined central dense overcast a large feeder band persisted on eastern side of circulation bridging northwestern southeastern quadrants feature became a notable aspect of cyclone s satellite presentation jtwc estimated that 19p reached its peak intensity at 1200 utc on april 8 possessing 1 minute sustained winds of 130 km h 80 mph and gusts up to 170 km h 105 mph tropical rainfall measuring mission imaged storm shortly thereafter and revealed a distinct eye about 44 km 27 mi across bounded on southern semicircle by strong convection activity sose made its closest approach to new caledonia early on april 8 passing about 280 km 175 mi to northeast a strong area of high pressure over new zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient well to south of sose s center contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale force winds in turn cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path despite never having made landfall as it progressed on its southeastward track cyclone began to show signs of weakening at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough at same time a mid level ridge to east forced storm to turn due south conflicting wind patterns undermined cyclone s circulation causing its center at surface to separate from deep convection both fms and jtwc reflected steady weakening and by early on april 10 center had become exposed and ill defined sose then entered area of responsibility of tropical cyclone warning center in wellington new zealand where it continued to deteriorate jtwc issued its last warning on 19p at 0600 utc on april 11 while system was located about 335 km 210 mi northeast of norfolk island tcwc wellington soon downgraded sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition drifting south southwestward cyclone lost its tropical identity early on april 12 remnant low ultimately moved over tasman sea where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over new zealand s north island abundant residual tropical moisture acted on low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern new zealand impact and aftermath right thumb annotated map of vanuatu click to enlarge prior to storm s passage of new caledonia residents there were advised to take basic precautions such as remaining indoors during bouts of inclement weather storm warnings were hoisted over loyalty islands and south province vanuatu s department of meteorology began posting official alerts on april 7 warnings for heavy rains and strong winds were posted throughout northern new zealand in anticipation of storm s remnants with easter weekend more motorists were already expected to be traveling longer distances and officials grew concerned of dangerous effects on traffic from cyclone police increased their presence to unprecedented levels in an attempt to control speeding and other hazardous behaviors due to storm s negative impact on one or more countries sose was retired from cyclical list of tropical cyclone names vanuatu sose predominately affected western islands of vanuatu starting from north most severely impacted were islands of espiritu santo malakula aoba efate tanna and shepherd islands in several locations sose compounded or worsened destruction wrought by cyclone paula in late february and early march storm produced significant precipitation heavy seas and sustained winds exceeding 100 km h 60 mph a resident of malakula was struck and killed by a falling coconut while seeking shelter from worsening conditions agriculture on nearby island already impaired by paula was further compromised all crops both those remaining after paula and those planted in intervening time were destroyed four classrooms on small island were also damaged beyond use buildings on aoba incurred appreciable damage while on efate storm brought down utility poles severely damaged local schools and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters flooding in nation s capital city of port vila forced 50 residents to leave their homes in search of higher ground espiritu santo particularly island s south shore around bore brunt of cyclone sose several types of crops also weakened by paula took a heavy beating and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods in total storm demolished 59 houses on island and in some way damaged another 101 a young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway just offshore m v succumbed to heavy seas all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore overall vanuatu national disaster management office estimated at least 50 each of food crops and buildings in hardest hit provinces were left in a state of damage united nations office for coordination of humanitarian affairs considered about 200 residences throughout island nation lost to storm national disaster committee met on april 9 to discuss potential emergency aid for residents of areas hardest hit by cyclones sose and paula around same time vanuatu red cross stated that it would distribute supplies such as materials for makeshift shelters and water purification tablets red cross was also to provide 500 bags of rice to villages in shepherd islands political unrest on a national level limited government s attention to initial recovery it did not immediate declare a state of emergency or file any requests for international aid new zealand and australia remnants of cyclone sose were a significant factor in stormy weather over north island of new zealand between april 12 and april 14 numerous locations received 10 to 20 cm 3 9 to 7 9 in of rainfall and of precipitation fell at glenbervie northland region in just seven hours heavy rainfall rates caused significant flooding of low lying roads and farmlands in region floodwaters inundated township of kaeo and entered several local businesses swollen kaeo river temporarily rendered new zealand state highway 10 impassable to most vehicles at a bridge over waterway a hospital became isolated from rest of town further to west state highway 1 was blocked by flooding at as was state highway 2 between te puke and te junction at former rains triggered a landslide and polluted local supply of drinking water several residences throughout region sustained damage a 22 year old man drowned in high waters along wairoa river rising waters from kerikeri river threatened to affect mission house nation s oldest surviving building where staff were on standby to relocate furnishings if necessary left thumb satellite image taken at 0000 utc on april 12 of weakening tropical cyclone as it approached north island of new zealand a severe traffic accident occurred on state highway 28 at waikato on morning of april 13 head on collision was attributed to slick roads resulting from storm three individuals were killed and two more were hospitalized several other accidents were reported around same time in addition to rainfall strong winds brought down trees and utility poles across island and as far south as marlborough on south island there strong winds fanned a large fire ignited by sparks from downed power lines fire covered more than 70 hectares 175 acres of land and prompted several families to evacuate their homes three people were injured at after a temporary tent collapsed at a local festival along coast swells triggered by sose reached in height tight pressure gradient between cyclone sose and ridge to its south generated extremely rough seas along eastern coast of australia especially queensland along state s southern shore normally protected from strong swells waves were as high as 8 m 26 ft and frequently between 4 5 m 13 16 ft a 53 year old man and his 9 year old son both drowned in heavy surf near gladstone on april 8 offshore new south wales a yacht capsized forcing its two occupants to swim to land large swells proved popular with experienced surfers looking for a challenge although event became infamous within local surfing circles at least one surfer was hospitalized after being swept against rocks and several others required rescue some beach erosion was reported in several locations leading to minor sandbagging efforts to hamper erosion elsewhere a large wave breaking on cliffs of mare island in new caledonia swept away a spectator who was presumed dead after rough conditions delayed searching efforts storm disrupted classes and school activities in parts of archipelago but little to no damage
