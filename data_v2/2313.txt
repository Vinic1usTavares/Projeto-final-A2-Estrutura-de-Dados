peck of hull publisher of local newspaper hull packet on completing his seven year apprenticeship he moved at age of 18 to london with intention of becoming a history painter in tradition of old masters strongly influenced by works of titian and rubens he submitted paintings to royal academy of arts and british institution all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited in 1821 royal academy accepted and exhibited one of etty s works arrival of cleopatra in cilicia also known as triumph of cleopatra painting was extremely well received and many of etty s fellow artists greatly admired him he was elected a full royal academician in 1828 at that time most prestigious honour available to an artist he became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones in decade following exhibition of cleopatra etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical literary and mythological settings although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private english collections country had no tradition of depicting unclothed figures and display and distribution of such material to public had been suppressed since 1787 proclamation for discouragement of vice etty was first british artist to specialise in paintings of nudes and reaction of uneducated audiences to these paintings caused concern throughout 19th century many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent although his portraits of males in a similar state of undress were generally well received subject world before flood illustrates lines 580 97 from book xi of john milton s paradise lost among visions of future archangel michael shows to adam is world after expulsion from garden of eden but before great flood this section of paradise lost reflects a passage from sixth chapter of book of genesis that sons of god saw daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose an act which would shortly cause god to regret creating humanity and to cleanse earth in great flood painting shows stages of courtship as described by milton as men are seduced by women and pass from enjoying company of other men into married life etty worked through various configurations for characters in painting before settling on his final design composition world before flood is strongly influenced by a bacchanalian revel before a term of pan 1632 33 by nicolas poussin whom etty greatly admired and of whose works he had previously made several copies this painting had been bought by national gallery in 1826 adam and michael are not visible in painting instead viewer sees scene from adam s point of view left thumb etty reused figure

dance their interlocked arms and hands create a pattern at centre of canvas which acts as focus of painting to right of central group of dancers a young man drags another woman away from group of dancers to join a pair of lovers who lie down together at right of painting across entire width of background a darkening sky and oncoming storm clouds presage destruction that dancers are unwittingly about to bring upon themselves in a preliminary study for world before flood now in york art gallery broad structure is similar to that of finished work but focus is more strongly on central group of women in etty s oil sketch and in preliminary drawings right most of dancing figures wearing a green skirt faces outward with her arms behind her back forming a closed circle together with central group of dancers in finished work she gestures outwards from circle creating a clear narrative flow in positions of figures from single men on left to man choosing a wife to group of dancing women to couple leaving circle of dancers to join reclining lovers on far right as was case with most of his works etty did not give painting a title it was initially exhibited as a composition taken from eleventh book of milton s paradise lost and was referred to by etty himself as bevy of fair women and origin of marriage by 1862 when it was shown at international exhibition it had acquired its present title reception left thumb a bacchanalian revel before a term of pan nicolas poussin 1632 33 etty was a great admirer of poussin and world before flood is heavily influenced by his work alt group of dancing figures critical opinion concerning world before flood was divided when painting along with two other of etty s works was exhibited at 1828 royal academy summer exhibition some reviewers were intensely critical of piece a writer in literary gazette called painting a deadly sin against good taste describing background as unnecessarily harsh and crude with much to blame and lament and dancing figures outrageous complaining that women reminded him not of paradise lost but of scantily clad witches in robert burns s tam o shanter an anonymous critic in monthly magazine disparaged and twinings of painting s subjects describing them as as close to unpardonable limits as anything that has lately appealed to public eye this same writer disapproved of dark skin tones of some of figures arguing that brown visage of gives but a dingy image of roses and lilies that from time immemorial have made charm of british beauty correspondent for london magazine felt that although painting was in many respects worthy of admiration there is a spirit a boldness and a startling effect work was poorly executed overall its depiction of women drew particular ire expression of faces is vapid features rather homely limbs though not ill drawn have not that finish and play of muscles which alone give lightness and elasticity they seem lifted up with difficulty and ready to fall review etty as an artist who had advanced half way on his road to classic excellence and there when he should have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful exactness from being in view of his object he has stopped short etty s fellow artist john constable privately described work as a revel rout of satyrs and lady bums as usual other critics offered a more positive impression of piece examiner celebrated etty s having outdone his former self and most of his contemporaries a reviewer in mirror of literature amusement and instruction said that few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production describing figures as graceful and elegant athenaeum thought it decidedly most attractive picture in whole exhibition noting that their review was delayed because in opening week of exhibition crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to get such a view of it as would enable us to do it justice colburn s new monthly magazine considered it another instance of rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by john taylor who in september 1828 imagined that if milton and nicolas poussin were both alive to see painting milton would view it with proud delight while poussin would suffer an envious thorn with realization that etty s abilities had surpassed his own later history world before flood was bought at its 1828 exhibition by marquess of stafford for 500 guineas about ps in terms to add to his collection of nudes by titian etty was delighted with his success at exhibition at which all three of paintings he had exhibited were successfully sold to prestigious buyers from 1832 onwards needled by repeated attacks from press on his supposed indecency and tastelessness etty often made a conscious effort to project a moral dimension into his work although he continued to be a prominent painter of nudes he died in 1849 working and exhibiting up until his death despite consistently being regarded by many as a pornographer charles robert leslie observed shortly after etty s death that himself thinking and meaning no evil was not aware of manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds interest in his work declined as new movements came to characterise painting in britain and by end of 19th century cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices world before flood was sold to f e sidney in 1908 for 230 guineas about ps in terms and sold on to southampton city art gallery in 1937 for 195 guineas
