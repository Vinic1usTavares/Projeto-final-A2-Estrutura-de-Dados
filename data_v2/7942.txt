goldstone ground just to stay afloat on pitch club were facing a battle for their league status his first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as club finished a respectable 11th whilst adams signed talent such as star striker bobby zamora ps100 000 spent on zamora was only transfer outlay adams made in building his squad in his second season as manager 2000 01 adams guided brighton to promotion as division three champions after club had spent five seasons in league s basement division a late chase for title proved to be unnecessary as high flying chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities leaving brighton ten points clear at season s end he was named as third division manager of season for a second time also picking up third division

director of football adams said i m not expecting to produce a miracle i m still working with same group of players in july 2002 he appointed alan cork as his number two losing just one of their opening eleven games his side made an excellent start to campaign seeing adams rewarded with manager of month award for september 2002 despite leicester going into receivership with debts of ps30 million and being banned from transfer market until a takeover was completed adams was able to guide them to promotion back to premiership at first attempt they ended 2002 03 season as division one runners up behind champions portsmouth at end of campaign he signed a new three year contract he was in charge for first game at walkers stadium despite a good start to their campaign club fell into relegation zone in new year adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long term contracts dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign leicester slipped back down again in 2003 04 to 18th place bracketed together with two other relegated sides leeds united and wolverhampton wanderers whose goal difference was inferior to leicester s foxes were becoming a yo yo club and adams blamed this on a lack of investment during march 2004 nine leicester players were arrested for various offences

in prison if found guilty of rape and trio s bail totalled 500 club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years with stan arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000 and dennis wise breaking callum davidson s jaw in a row over a card game in 2002 adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline going so far as to enforce random breathalyser tests adams said that in a lot of people s eyes players are guilty before they have had a fair trial which is not case incident also cast doubt over adams future at club as reports surfaced that he planned to quit club he did in fact offer his resignation which was rejected by club however he kept faith in his players innocence and claimed if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional of being drunk to excess his faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against players were false club lost their talismanic turk muzzy in summer of 2004 adams had previously stated his concern that they would be unable to regain their top tier status before he resigned as leicester manager in october 2004 after a poor start to championship campaign dashed club s hopes of an instant return to premiership coventry city in january 2005 adams made a return to management in championship with struggling coventry city a club he had been at during his playing career adams managed to save club from relegation by end of season winning championship manager of month award for april in process he was expected by some to mount a challenge for promotion to premiership in 2005

excellent home form he could only guide coventry as high as 8th missing out on a play off place by only two league places though several points adrift of that year s standard he spent ps300 000 on midfielder chris birchall for start of 2006 07 season his team started well however midway through campaign following a run of five games without defeat coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form a 5 0 defeat at west bromwich albion began a sequence of eight games without a win including six defeats this culminated in a 2 0 home defeat to bristol city in fa cup a game which also

fans also bringing fourth tier club to national attention he later admitted he merely played a psychological game with them and i don t think they fell for it i don t think anybody fell for it three

announced he had reluctantly given adams permission to talk to sheffield united six days later it was announced that he would be taking position and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation to then challenge for promotion and finally to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team former united player alan cork was installed as his assistant cork had worked as adams assistant at fulham swansea leicester and coventry fourth manager at club that season he brought in dave bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing club a bigger task than he had previously assumed as adams explained when you re manager at port vale you probably get three calls a day and one of those is from wife asking me what time i m coming home for my tea his honeymoon period dissipated quickly as united failed to win in his first eleven games in charge four draws and seven defeats and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two goal lead to lose 3 2 to fellow relegation strugglers scunthorpe united adams told press that fans were singing you re not fit to wear shirt i cannot disagree

came from behind to beat nottingham forest 2 1 sheffield united were relegated to league one at end of season finishing six points short of safety adams and united parted company after a meeting with

be a blade return to port vale after losing his job at bramall lane he was immediately offered a three year contract at former club port vale he signed contract within days saying it was time to finish job i started upon hearing news star defender gareth owen reversed his decision to leave club and promptly signed a two year deal as player coach in a shock move adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at club as club s constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed his first signings of season were former glenn hoddle academy youngsters ryan burge and ben williamson he followed this by tying gary roberts to club for another season and signing walsall centre half clayton mcdonald left back mike green and sheffield united teenagers kingsley james and phil roe days before start of season he let justin richards leave on a free transfer to burton albion and replaced him with rotherham

win which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal he signed guy madjo jennison myrie williams and shane o connor on loan these proved to be inspired signings as a madjo hat trick meant that two stevenage loanees scored a total of five goals between them in their first three games however in december he admitted that club s off field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being kept very much in dark nominated for manager of month award for three wins in four december games adams revealed that due to club s precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in january transfer window despite chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets he did though manage to sign chris shuker and paul marshall on non contract terms he would also have signed chris birchall however before deal was finalised football league placed club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid club were unable to pay player s wages in february club entered administration on 9 march ending what had been a genuine push for promotion talks between administrator and adams did not seem constructive as adams told press that he was taking legal advice however he stayed put and steered valiants to a 12th place finish they would have been only 3 points off play offs had club not entered administration in may he was linked with vacant management position at gillingham with his friendship with gills chairman paul scally cited in his favour in media reports with club still unable to sign new players due to administration in may 2012 adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for 2012 13 campaign however he lost four of his best players in lee collins anthony griffith sean rigg and captain and top scorer marc richards all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere leaving adams needing to rebuild team largely from scratch he duly signed midfielder darren murphy and winger jennison myrie williams from stevenage colchester united attacker ashley vincent shrewsbury town goalkeeper chris neal crewe alexandra centre back david and former wales international richard duffy he was named as manager of month in september 2012 after his side beat tranmere rovers in league trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in league to take administration hit club to second in league new owners took club out of administration and allowed adams to strengthen his squad in january by signing four experienced players striker lee hughes midfielder chris birchall and centre back darren purse other signings included left back daniel jones centre back liam chilvers striker calvin andrew and midfielder sean mcallister however vale slipped to five defeats in seven games and adams claimed that idiots in a certain section of crowd were giving him personal abuse following run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite ryan burge for disciplinary reasons vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion finishing as division s top scorers as wingers jennison myrie williams and ashley vincent provided quality service to prolific striker tom pope throughout campaign in preparation for league one football adams signed winger mohamed to replace departing ashley vincent he also signed defenders chris robertson and carl dickinson midfielders chris lines and anthony griffith and forward gavin tomlin on 22 september rob page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at vale park after adams took decision to take time off work to have hip replacement surgery club overstretched itself financially meaning that as they lay outside play offs in january adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan their promotion push fell away but they ended season in ninth place far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation during this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender daniel jones for physically attacking captain doug loft during training and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman norman smurthwaite took until may before offering him a new one year rolling contract he signed contract following month after eleven players left club in 2014 adams rebuilt for 2014 15 campaign by signing left sided player colin daniel northern ireland internationals ryan mcgivern and michael o connor pacey winger mark marshall crewe alexandra attacker byron moore veteran midfielder michael brown and midfielder steve jennings and also took in three loanees in swiss full back freddie highly rated striker jordan slew and french target man achille campion defeat to local rivals crewe alexandra marked
