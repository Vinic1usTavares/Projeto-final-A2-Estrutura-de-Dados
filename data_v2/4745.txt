with people related to featured issue topics have varied widely during early years of show they tended toward character driven human interest stories such as bigfoot enthusiasts since stewart began hosting in 1999 focus of show has become more political and field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates under kilborn and early years of stewart most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of comedic nature of daily show however as show began to gain popularity particularly following its coverage of 2000 and 2004 presidential elections most of subjects now interviewed are aware of comedic element recurring segments some segments have recurred periodically throughout different tenures such as back in black segments hosted by comedian lewis

and premiered on comedy central on july 22 1996 having been marketed as a replacement for politically incorrect a successful comedy central program that had moved to abc earlier that year madeleine smithberg was co creator of daily show as well as former executive producer a graduate of binghamton university she was an executive producer of steve harvey s big time and a talent coordinator for late night with david letterman aiming to parody conventional newscasts it featured a comedic monologue of day s headlines from anchor craig kilborn a well known co anchor of espn s sportscenter as well as mockumentary style on location reports in studio segments and debates from regular correspondents winstead brian unger beth littleford and a whitney brown common segments common segments

as celebrity birthdays another commercial lead out featured winstead s parents on her answering machine reading that day s final jeopardy question and answer olivia life of lizz winstead city pages may 8 2013 retrieved 2015 06 12 in each show kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews ending with a segment called five questions in which guest was made to answer a series of questions that were typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion these are highlighted in a 1998 book titled daily show five questions which contains transcripts of kilborn s best interviews each episode concluded with a segment called your moment of zen that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to alligators originally show was recorded without a studio audience featuring only laughter of its own off camera staff members a studio audience was incorporated into show for its second season and has remained since differences between kilborn s version and stewart s version show was much less politically focused than it later became under jon stewart having what stephen colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character driven humor as opposed to news driven humor winstead recalls that when show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what show s focus should be while she wanted a more news driven focus network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean spirited particularly towards interview subjects of field pieces a criticism acknowledged by some of show s cast describing his time as a correspondent under kilborn colbert says you wanted to take your soul off put it on a wire hanger and leave it in closet before you got on plane to do one of these pieces one reviewer from new york times criticized show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology describing it as bereft of an ideological or artistic center precocious but empty craig kilborn s departure there were reports of backstage friction between kilborn and some of female staff particularly show s co creator lizz winstead winstead had not been involved in hiring of kilborn and disagreed with him over what direction show should take i spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers somebody else put him in place there were bound to be problems i viewed show as content driven he viewed it as host driven she said in a 1997 esquire magazine interview kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about winstead comedy central responded by suspending kilborn without pay for one week and winstead quit soon after in 1998 kilborn left daily show to replace tom snyder on cbs s late late show he claimed five questions interview segment as intellectual property disallowing any future daily show hosts from using it in their interviews correspondents brian unger and a whitney brown left show shortly before him but majority of show s crew and writing staff stayed on kilborn s last show as host aired on december 17 1998 ending a 386 episode tenure reruns were shown until jon stewart s debut four weeks later kilborn made a short appearance on jon stewart s final edition of daily show saying i knew you were going to run this thing into ground jon stewart s tenure 1999 2015 shift in content thumb jon stewart right hosting an episode of daily show in 2010 with admiral michael mullen comedian jon stewart took over as host of show which was retitled daily show with jon stewart on january 11 1999 stewart had previously hosted short attention span theater on comedy central two shows on mtv you wrote it you watch it and an eponymous talk show as well as a syndicated late night talk show and had been cast in films and television in taking over hosting from kilborn stewart initially retained much of same staff and on air talent allowing many pieces to transition without much trouble while other features like god stuff with john bloom presenting an assortment of actual clips from various televangelists and backfire an in studio debate between brian unger and a whitney brown evolved into similar pieces of this week in god and stephen colbert and steve carell s even after change a number of new features were developed ending segment your moment of zen previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in show show s theme music dog on fire by bob mould was re recorded by they might be giants shortly after stewart joined show stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of series he recalls that he initially struggled with kilborn holdover writers to gain control of show and put his own imprint on show s voice a struggle that led to departure of a number of holdover writers instrumental in shaping voice of show under stewart was former editor of onion ben karlin who along with fellow onion contributor david joined staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer their experience in writing for satirical newspaper which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events would influence comedic direction of show stewart recalls hiring of karlin as point at which things started to take shape describing his approach to show karlin said main thing for me is seeing hypocrisy people who know better saying things that you know they don t believe 250px thumb left logo used for stewart s tenure under stewart and karlin daily show developed a markedly different style bringing a sharper political focus to humor than show previously exhibited then correspondent stephen colbert recalls that stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy colbert says that whereas under kilborn focus was on human interest y pieces with stewart as host show s content became more issues and news driven particularly after beginning of 2000 election campaign with which show dealt in its indecision 2000 coverage stewart himself describes show s coverage of 2000 election recount as point at which show found its editorial voice that s when i think we tapped into emotional angle of news for us and found our editorial footing he says following september 11th attacks daily show went off air for nine days upon its return stewart opened show with a somber monologue that according to jeremy gillick and nonna gorilovskaya addressed both absurdity and importance of his role as a comedian commented stewart gillick and gorilovskaya point to september 11 attacks and beginning of wars in afghanistan and iraq as point at which jon stewart emerged as a trusted national figure robert thompson director of bleier center for television and popular culture at syracuse university recalled of this period when all news guys were walking on eggshells jon was hammering those questions about wmds broadening role of correspondent during stewart s tenure role of correspondent broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in studio exchanges under kilborn colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved character driven field pieces like you know guys who believe in bigfoot however as focus of show has become more news driven correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces either as experts discussing issues at anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with show as it has permitted them to work more closely with host and writers popularity and critical respect show s 2000 and 2004 election coverage combined with a new satirical edge helped to catapult stewart and daily show to new levels of popularity and critical respect since stewart became host show has won 23 primetime emmy awards and three peabody awards and its ratings steadily increased in 2003 show was averaging nearly a million viewers an increase of nearly threefold since show s inception as comedy central became available in more households by september 2008 show averaged nearly two million viewers per night senator barack obama s interview on october 29 2008 pulled in 3 6 million viewers in political spectrum move towards greater involvement in political issues and increasing popularity of show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where views of show fit in political spectrum adam clymer among many others has argued that daily show is more critical of republicans than democrats stewart who voted democratic in 2004 presidential election acknowledged that show has a more liberal point of view but that it is not a liberal organization with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny he acknowledges that show is not necessarily an equal opportunity offender explaining that republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because i think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it not in an interview in 2005 when asked how he responded to critics claiming that daily show is overly liberal stephen colbert also a self proclaimed democrat said in an interview during bush administration when republicans held a majority in house and senate we are liberal but jon s very respectful of republican guests and listen if liberals were in power it would be easier to attack them but republicans have executive legislative and judicial branches so making fun of democrats is like kicking a child so it s just not worth it stewart is critical of democratic politicians for being weak timid or ineffective he said in an interview with larry king prior to 2006 elections i honestly don t feel that democrats make an impact they have forty nine percent of vote and three percent of power at a certain point you go guys pick up your game he has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues such as war in iraq describing them as incompetent and unable to locate their asses even when presented with two hands and a special ass map karlin then show s executive producer said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among staff which when filtered through jon and correspondents feels uniform principal goal of show is comedy if you have a legitimately funny joke in support of notion that gay people are an affront to god we ll put that motherfucker on on september 15 2003 senator john edwards became first candidate to announce that they were running for president on show causing jon stewart to jokingly inform him that their show was fake and he might have to elsewhere on november 17 2009 vice president joe biden appeared on show making him first sitting vice president to do so on october 27 2010 president barack obama became first sitting u s president to be interviewed on show wherein obama commented he loved show obama took issue with stewart s suggestion that his health care program was timid after united states senate failed to pass

figure for cable television by end of 2013 daily show s ratings hit 2 5 million viewers nightly in demographic terms viewership is skewed to a relatively young and well educated audience compared to traditional news shows a 2004 nielsen media research study commissioned by comedy central put median age at 35 during 2004 u s presidential election show received more male viewers in 18 to 34 year old age demographic than nightline meet press hannity colmes and all of evening news broadcasts for this reason commentators such as howard dean and ted koppel posited that stewart served as a real source of news for young people regardless of his intentions in 2016 a new york times study of 50 tv shows with most facebook likes found that daily show was most popular in cities and other more liberal leaning areas along coasts peak popularity is in san francisco it s least popular in alabama as a news source show s writers reject idea that daily show has become a source of news for young people stewart argues that americans are living in an age of information osmosis in which it is close to impossible to gain one s news from any single source and says that his show succeeds because viewers already have some knowledge about current events our show would not be valuable to people who didn t understand news because it wouldn t make sense he argues we make assumptions about your level of knowledge that if we were your only source of news you would just watch our show and think i don t know what s happening a 2006 study published by indiana university tried to compare substantive amount of information of daily show against prime time network news broadcasts and concluded that when it comes to substance there is little difference between daily show and other news outlets study contended that since both programs are more focused on nature of infotainment and ratings than on dissemination of information both are broadly equal in terms of amount of substantial news coverage they offer as lines between comedy show and news show have blurred jon stewart has come under pressure in some circles to engage in more serious journalism tucker carlson and daily show co creator lizz winstead have chastised stewart for criticizing politicians and in his solo segments and then in interviews with same people rarely taking them to task face to face in 2004 winstead expressed a desire for stewart to ask harder satirical questions saying when you are interviewing a richard or a kissinger if you give them a pass then you become what you are satirizing you have a war criminal sitting on your couch to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary she has argued that daily show success and access to youth vote should allow stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to show in 2010 winstead had changed her views commenting that since 2004 stewart did some of hardest hitting interviews on tv stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer during stewart s appearance on cnn s crossfire stewart criticized that show and said that it was hurting america by sensationalizing debates and enabling political spin when co host carlson argued that stewart himself had not asked john kerry substantial questions when kerry appeared on daily show stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard hitting interviews and that a fake news comedy program should not be held to same standards as real journalism you re on cnn stewart said show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls what is wrong with you media critic dan kennedy says that stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because you can t interview bill clinton richard clarke bill o reilly bob dole etc etc and still say you re just a comedian a 2004 study into effect of daily show on viewers attitudes found that participants had a more negative opinion of both president bush and then democratic presidential nominee john kerry participants also expressed more cynical views of electoral system and news media political scientists jody baumgartner and jonathan morris who conducted study state that it is not clear how such cynicism would affect political behavior of show s viewers while disillusionment and negative perceptions of presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting baumgartner and morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following show viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters with a broader political knowledge rachel larris who has also conducted an academic study of daily show disputes findings of baumgartner and morris larris argues that study measured cynicism in overly broad terms and that it would be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing daily show and thinking or acting in a particular way bloggers such as marty kaplan of huffington post argue that so long as stewart s comedy is grounded in truth responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to political and media figures themselves not comedian who satirizes them stewart himself says that he does not perceive his show as cynical it s so interesting to me that people talk about late night comedy being cynical he says what s more cynical than forming an ideological news network like fox and calling it fair and balanced what we do i almost think is adorable in its idealism stewart has said that he does not take any joy in failings of american government despite comedic fodder they provide we re not guys at craps table betting against line he said on larry king live if government suddenly became inspiring we would be happiest people in world to turn our attention to idiots like you know media people no offense in july 2009 time magazine held an online poll entitled now that walter cronkite has passed on who is america s most trusted newscaster jon stewart won with 44 of vote 15 points ahead of brian williams in second place with 29 stewart downplayed results on show stating it was an internet poll and i was none of above option in december 2013 tv guide ranked jon stewart s run on show at 53 on its list of 60 best series of all time effectiveness in late 2004 national annenberg election survey at university of pennsylvania ran a study of american television viewers and found that fans of daily show had a more accurate idea of facts behind 2004 presidential election than most others including those who primarily got their news through national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers national annenberg election survey press release september 21 2004 pdf file however in a 2004 campaign survey conducted by pew research center those who cited comedy shows such as daily show as a source for news were among least informed on campaign events and key aspects of candidates backgrounds while those who cited internet national public radio and news magazines were most informed even when age and education were taken into account people who learned about campaigns through internet were still found to be most informed while those who learned from comedy shows were least informed in a survey released by pew research center in april 2007 viewers who watch both colbert report and daily show tend to be more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources approximately 54 of colbert report and daily show viewers scored in high knowledge range followed by jim lehrer s program at 53 and bill o reilly s program at 51 significantly higher than 34 of network morning show viewers survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much public knows about national and international affairs but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know project for excellence in journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that daily show comes close to providing complete daily news episodes awards and
