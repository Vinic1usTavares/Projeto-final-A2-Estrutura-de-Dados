titania is largest of moons of uranus and eighth largest moon in solar system at a diameter of discovered by william herschel in 1787 titania is named after queen of fairies in shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream its orbit lies inside uranus s magnetosphere titania consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle a layer of liquid water may be present at core mantle boundary surface of titania which is relatively dark and slightly red in color appears to have been shaped by both impacts and endogenic processes it is covered with numerous impact craters reaching up to in diameter but is less heavily cratered than oberon outermost of five large moons of uranus titania probably underwent an early endogenic resurfacing event which obliterated its older heavily cratered surface titania s surface is cut by a system of enormous canyons and scarps result of expansion of its interior during later stages of its evolution like all major moons of uranus titania probably formed from an accretion disk which surrounded planet just after its formation infrared spectroscopy conducted from 2001 to 2005 revealed presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide on surface of titania which in turn suggested that moon may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about 10 10 13 bar measurements during titania s occultation of a star put an upper limit on surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 1 2 mpa 10 20 nbar uranian system has been studied up close only once by spacecraft voyager 2 in january 1986 it took several images of titania which allowed mapping of about 40 of its surface history titania was discovered by william herschel on january 11 1787 same day he discovered uranus s second largest moon oberon he later reported discoveries of four more satellites although they were subsequently revealed as spurious for nearly fifty years following their discovery titania and oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than william herschel s although moon can be seen from earth with a present day high end amateur telescope thumb left 250px size comparison of earth moon and titania all of uranus s moons are named after characters created by william shakespeare or alexander pope name titania was taken from queen of fairies in a midsummer night s dream names of all four satellites of uranus then known were suggested by herschel s son john in 1852 at request of william lassell who had discovered other two moons ariel and umbriel year before titania was initially referred to as first satellite of uranus and in 1848 was given designation by william lassell although he sometimes used william herschel s numbering where titania and oberon are ii and iv in 1851 lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from planet by roman numerals and since then titania has been designated shakespeare s character s name is pronounced but moon is often pronounced by analogy with familiar chemical element titanium adjectival form is homonymous with that of saturn s moon titan name titania is ancient greek in origin meaning daughter of titans orbit titania orbits uranus at distance of about being second farthest from planet among its five major moons titania s orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to equator of uranus its orbital period is around 8 7 days coincident with its rotational period in other words titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite with one face always pointing toward planet titania s orbit lies completely inside uranian magnetosphere this is important because trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by magnetospheric plasma which co rotates with planet this bombardment may lead to darkening of trailing hemispheres which is actually observed for all uranian moons except oberon see below because uranus orbits sun almost on its side and its moons orbit in planet s equatorial plane they including titania are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness and another 42 years in continuous sunlight with sun rising close to zenith over one of poles at each solstice voyager 2 flyby coincided with southern hemisphere s 1986 summer solstice when nearly entire southern hemisphere was illuminated once every 42 years when uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects earth mutual occultations of uranus s moons become possible in 2007 2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of titania by umbriel on august 15 and december 8 2007 composition and internal structure file titania jpg

canyon runs from darkness at lower right side to visible center of body titania is largest and most massive uranian moon and eighth most massive moon in solar system its density of 1 71 g cm3 which is much higher than typical density of saturn s satellites indicates that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non ice components latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001 2005 which have revealed crystalline water ice on surface of moon water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on titania s leading hemisphere than on trailing hemisphere this is opposite of what is observed on oberon where trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures cause of this asymmetry is not known but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from magnetosphere of uranus which is stronger on trailing hemisphere due to plasma s co rotation energetic particles tend to sputter water ice decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics leaving a dark carbon rich residue behind except for water only other compound identified on surface of titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide which is concentrated mainly on trailing hemisphere origin of carbon dioxide is not completely clear it might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under influence of solar ultraviolet radiation or energetic charged particles coming from magnetosphere of uranus latter process would explain asymmetry in its distribution because trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than leading hemisphere another possible source is outgassing of primordial co2 trapped by water ice in titania s interior escape of co2 from interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon titania may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle if this is case radius of core is about 66 of radius of moon and its mass is around 58 of moon s mass proportions are dictated by moon s composition pressure in center of titania is about 0 58 gpa 5 8 kbar current state of icy mantle is unclear if ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze titania may have a subsurface ocean at core mantle boundary thickness of this ocean if it exists is up to and its temperature is around 190 k however present internal structure of titania depends heavily on its thermal history which is poorly known surface features thumb titania with surface features labeled south pole is situated close to unidentified bright crater below and left of crater jessica among uranus s moons titania is intermediate in brightness between dark oberon and umbriel and bright ariel and miranda its surface shows a strong opposition surge its reflectivity decreases from 35 at a phase angle of 0deg geometrical albedo to 25 at an angle of about 1deg titania has a relatively low bond albedo of about 17 its surface is generally slightly red in color but less red than that of oberon however fresh impact deposits are bluer while smooth plains situated on leading hemisphere near ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder there may be an asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres former appears to be redder than latter by 8 however this difference is related to smooth plains and may be accidental reddening of surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and over age of solar system however color asymmetry of titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of uranian system possibly from irregular satellites which would be deposited predominately on leading hemisphere scientists have recognized three classes of geological feature on titania craters chasmata canyons and rupes scarps surface of titania is less heavily cratered than surfaces of either oberon or umbriel which means that surface is much younger crater diameters reach 326 kilometers for largest known crater gertrude there can be also a degraded basin of approximately same size some craters for instance ursula and jessica are surrounded by bright impact ejecta rays consisting of relatively fresh ice all large craters on titania have flat floors and central peaks only exception is ursula which has a pit in center to west of gertrude there is an area with irregular topography so called unnamed basin which may be another highly degraded impact basin with diameter of about titania s surface is intersected by a system of enormous faults or scarps in some places two parallel scarps mark depressions in satellite s crust forming grabens which are sometimes called canyons most prominent among titania s canyons is messina chasma which runs for about from equator almost to south pole grabens on titania are wide and have a relief of about 2 5 km scarps that are not related to canyons are called rupes such as rousillon rupes near ursula crater regions along some scarps and near ursula appear smooth at voyager s image resolution these smooth plains were probably resurfaced later in titania s geological history after majority of craters formed resurfacing may have been either endogenic in nature involving eruption of fluid material from interior cryovolcanism or alternatively it may be due to blanking by impact ejecta from nearby large craters grabens are probably youngest geological features on titania they cut all craters and even smooth plains geology of titania was influenced by two competing forces impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing former acted over moon s entire history and influenced all surfaces latter processes were also global in nature but active mainly for a period following moon s formation they obliterated original heavily cratered terrain explaining relatively low number of impact craters on moon s present day surface additional episodes of resurfacing may have occurred later and led to formation of smooth plains alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of nearby impact craters most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused formation of canyons which are actually giant cracks in ice crust cracking of crust was caused by global expansion of titania

characters from shakespeare s works atmosphere presence of carbon dioxide on surface suggests that titania may have a tenuous seasonal atmosphere of co2 much like that of jovian moon callisto other gases like nitrogen or methane are unlikely to be present because titania s weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space at maximum temperature attainable during titania s summer solstice 89 k vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 mpa 3 nbar on september 8 2001 titania occulted a bright star hip with a visible magnitude of 7 2 this was an opportunity to both refine titania s diameter and ephemeris and to detect any extant atmosphere data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1 2 mpa 10 20 nbar if it exists it would have to be far thinner than that of triton or pluto this upper limit is still several times higher than maximum possible surface pressure of carbon dioxide meaning that measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of atmosphere peculiar geometry of uranian system causes moons poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions because vapor pressure of co2 is a steep function of temperature this may lead to accumulation of carbon dioxide in low latitude regions of titania where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of surface in form of ice during summer when polar temperatures reach as high as 85 90 k carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to opposite pole and to equatorial regions giving rise to a type of carbon cycle accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles which sputter it from surface titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4 6 billion years ago origin and evolution titania is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula a disc of gas and dust that either existed around uranus for some time after its formation or was created by giant impact that most likely gave uranus its large obliquity precise composition of subnebula is not known however relatively high density of titania and other uranian moons compared to moons of saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water poor significant amounts of nitrogen and carbon may have been present in form of carbon monoxide and n2 instead of ammonia and methane moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice with co and n2 trapped as a clathrate and more rock explaining their higher density titania s accretion probably lasted for several thousand years impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of moon s outer layer maximum temperature of around was reached at a depth of about after end of formation subsurface layer cooled while interior of titania heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks cooling near surface layer contracted while interior expanded this caused strong extensional stresses in moon s crust leading to cracking some of present day canyons may be a result of this process lasted for about 200 million years implying that any endogenous activity ceased billions of years ago initial heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably strong enough to melt ice if some antifreeze like ammonia in form of ammonia hydrate or salt was present further melting may have led to separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle a layer of liquid water ocean rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at core mantle boundary eutectic temperature of this mixture is if temperature dropped below this value ocean would have subsequently frozen freezing of water would have caused interior to expand which may have been responsible for formation of majority of canyons however present knowledge of titania s geological evolution is quite limited exploration so far only close up images of titania have been from voyager 2 probe which photographed moon during its flyby of uranus in january 1986 since closest distance between voyager 2 and titania was only best images of this moon have a spatial resolution of about 3 4 km only miranda and ariel were imaged with a better resolution images cover about 40 of surface but only 24 was photographed with precision required for geological mapping at time of flyby southern hemisphere of titania like those of other moons was pointed towards sun so northern dark hemisphere could not be studied no other spacecraft has ever visited uranian system or titania and no mission is currently planned one possibility now discarded was to send cassini on from saturn to uranus in an extended mission another mission concept proposed was uranus orbiter and probe concept evaluated
