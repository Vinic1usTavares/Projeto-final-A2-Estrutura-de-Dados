project dream was codename of a role playing video game rpg that served as basis for 1998 game banjo kazooie developed by rare it was aimed for release on super nintendo entertainment system snes and later nintendo 64 n64 plot revolved around a young boy edson who caused trouble with pirates snes version of dream used an isometric perspective and had a fairy tale like theme after transitioning to n64 project became a more complex 3d rpg that had a greater emphasis on pirate theme eventually dream was scaled back to a linear platform game in vein of donkey kong country 1994 that starred banjo bear who became protagonist of banjo kazooie game was developed by rare s donkey kong country 2 diddy s kong quest 1995 team over course of 16 months it was inspired by japanese rpgs and lucasarts adventure games and name dream emphasized its fantastical themes dream was not completed because rare believed it was too ambitious and different from their previous games team s admiration for super mario 64 1996 and game that became conker s bad fur day 2001 led them to retool it into a platformer eventually all work on dream was scrapped and its concepts were re integrated into banjo kazooie which released to critical and commercial success premise thumb left a screenshot of gameplay from nintendo 64 version during most of its development period project dream was a role playing video game rpg that focused on a boy named edson and his pets dinger dog and billy parrot in its story a band of pirates led by captain blackeye searched for floaty a substance that would allow their ships to fly edson got into trouble with pirates and set off on a journey with his girlfriend to escape them super nintendo entertainment system snes version of game employed an isometric perspective and had a fairy tale like theme edson used a wooden sword to fight trolls and dinger performed actions to assist him such as going ahead and digging holes to find items occasionally a dinosaur would appear and attempt to crush edson by stepping on him falling leaves and virtual camera system shaking warned player when it was approaching when development transitioned to nintendo 64 n64 dream became a larger rpg rendered in 3d computer graphics pirate theme became more dominant than fairy tale one as development progressed on n64 game went through radical changes edson was replaced twice first by a rabbit and later by banjo bear who became main character of banjo kazooie final version of game was a linear platformer in vein of rare s donkey kong country games and bore little resemblance to earlier versions development after nintendo released snes rare decided to use profits they made from nintendo entertainment system games to invest in silicon graphics workstations rare used this high end technology to develop donkey kong country 1994 which received critical acclaim and became second bestselling snes game behind super mario world 1990 after finishing donkey kong country rare staff decided to apply technology to a new game that was not a platformer they settled on developing a rpg as they were all fans of genre codename dream was chosen because they wanted their rpg to have a fantastical magical feel dream used donkey kong countrys graphics technology to an advanced level it was inspired by japanese rpgs and lucasarts adventure games team wanted to combine those games to create one with a rare flavour dream was developed by rare s donkey kong country 2 diddy s kong quest 1995 team and was announced in 1995 as development progressed game became too large for an snes cartridge and introduction of n64 rendered silicon graphics technology obsolete thus rare made decision to switch development to n64 after this transition fantasy theme gradually was dropped according to rare s gregg mayles team did not want game to be too childish pirate theme became dominant as rare staff felt they could have a lot of fun with it and believed it would have a broad appeal while some aspects were kept in transition to n64 dream became a much larger rpg as game changed rare began to feel edson was losing his relevance and began looking for an alternate protagonist he was replaced with rabbit and eventually banjo decision to use banjo who was already in game as a minor side character was made by rare cofounder tim stamper banjo was designed to have human qualities and was given a backpack to put items in some time passed and team began to believe game was too ambitious and different from their previous games they also could not find how it would be enjoyable to play composer grant kirkhope noted rare struggled to get game running at a decent frame rate meanwhile another rare team was working on what would become conker s bad fur day 2001 a platformer impressed by how this game was looking dream team retooled their game into a donkey kong country esque platformer something they felt more comfortable with at this point few elements from earlier incarnations remained overall dream was in development for sixteen months and development restarted four times soundtrack was primarily composed by kirkhope david wise also contributed but left partway through development to compose diddy kong racing 1997 kirkhope wrote 107 tracks with strong themes some were reused in later games kirkhope scored aftermath and legacy when dream staff saw an early version of nintendo s super mario 64 1996 they realized it was going to set standard for 3d games and make their project look outdated they proceeded to scrap all their work on dream and began developing a new game inspired by super mario 64 banjo was kept because team liked character fantasy theme was restored and within another 16 months rare had finished banjo kazooie game was released in 1998 and topped united kingdom all format charts a feat a rare game did not accomplish again until its 30th anniversary game rare replay in 2015 and attracted critical acclaim antagonist of dream
