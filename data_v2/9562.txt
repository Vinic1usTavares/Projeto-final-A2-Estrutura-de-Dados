my father cast tom hanks as michael sullivan tyler hoechlin as michael sullivan jr paul newman as john rooney jude law as harlen maguire daniel craig as connor rooney stanley tucci as frank nitti jennifer jason leigh as annie sullivan liam aiken as peter sullivan dylan baker as alexander rance ciaran hinds as finn mcgovern david darlow as jack kelly kerry rossall as rooney s henchman uncredited production development when max allan collins wrote graphic novel road to perdition his book agent saw potential in story as a film adaptation and showed it to a film agent by 1999 novel had reached dean zanuck who was vice president of development at company owned by his father producer richard d zanuck novel was sent to elder zanuck in morocco who was there producing rules of engagement 2000 agreed on story s prospect and sent it to director producer steven spielberg shortly afterward spielberg set up project at his studio dreamworks though he did not pursue direction of film due to his full slate mendes sought a new project after completing american beauty 1999 and explored prospects including a beautiful mind k pax shipping news and lookout dreamworks sent mendes road to perdition as a prospect and mendes was attracted to story considering it narratively very simple but thematically very complex one theme that he saw in story was of parents world that is inaccessible to their children mendes considered story s theme to be about how children deal with violence and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves mendes described script as having no moral absolutes a factor that appealed to director writing spielberg first contacted screenwriter david self to adapt story into a feature film self wrote an initial draft that remained close to source material and retained most of its dialogue screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers distancing script from graphic novel and leaving core elements of story some of harsher aspects of story were toned down as script became more streamlined for example in some early drafts of screenplay sullivan became an alcoholic but this element was ultimately absent from final version story itself is deeply informed by lone wolf and cub manga series novelist max allan collins acknowledged influence of lone wolf and cub on his graphic novel road to perdition in an interview to bbc declaring that road to perdition is an unabashed homage to lone wolf and cub allan collins max interviewed by daniel etherington bbc collective 2002 09 19 some of characters names were slightly changed from their original versions from graphic novel surname of real life gangsters john looney and his son connor were changed to rooney and surname of tom hanks character and his family was streamlined from original o sullivan to simply sullivan one significant addition to script was creation of maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to sullivans departure from old world hanks and cinematographer conrad hall requested mendes to limit violence in film to meaningful acts rather than gratuitous carnage hanks character michael sullivan is known as angel of death in graphic novel and invokes fear in those around him but his infamy is downplayed in film mendes who described graphic novel as much more pulpy sought to reduce graphic novel s background to its essence seeking nonverbal simplicity of films like once upon a time in america 1984 pat garrett and billy kid 1973 and films by akira kurosawa that lack dialogue duplicate language in characters confrontations in road to perdition was trimmed to absolute minimum mendes described road to perdition as a poetic elegiac story in which pictures tell story an example of one such unspoken scene in film was piano duet between rooney and michael sr intended to convey their relationship without words in final 20 minutes of road to perdition script was written to have only six lines of dialogue max allan collins originally wanted to write adapted screenplay but was not given opportunity he chose to stay out of scripting process out of respect for different style of writing for a different medium though he served as a consultant in process collins praised addition of maguire and considered minimalist use of dialogue to be appropriate author also applauded film s version of rooney as more overtly a father figure to sullivan collins opposed profanity in script as vulgar language did not fit his vision of 1930s he also contested path of sullivan s son in film in graphic novel son kills once and in film he does not kill anyone collins also disagreed with narration technique of film in novel son narrates story as an adult becoming a priest while in film he narrates while still a young boy casting tom hanks was sent a copy of graphic novel by steven spielberg while he was filming cast away initially too busy to make sense of story he later received david self s adapted screenplay to which he became attached hanks a father to four children described michael sullivan s role i just got this guy if you re a man and you ve got offspring emotionally it s devastating tyler hoechlin was chosen from over 2 000 candidates to portray michael sullivan s son actor was 14 years old at time of filming for scenes in which hoechlin s character assisted his father as a getaway driver hoechlin was trained by a driving instructor paul newman was unanimously first choice for role of john rooney actor prepared by requesting frank mccourt irish american author of angela s ashes to record a tape of his voice david self who created maguire character explained he gets so jaded from exposure to this world he steps over line from being storyteller to being story maker to capture seedy countenance of character jude law was given a sallow skin tone that reflected wear from working in a darkroom law s teeth also received a lower and had a rotted look he was also given a weak thinning hairline maguire s apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies some of them actual police stills from 1930s stanley tucci was selective about roles in gangster films believing that hollywood stereotyped italian americans as gangsters however attracted by prospect of working with mendes actor accepted role of nitti a real life mob boss from chicago anthony lapaglia was cast as al capone and filmed a single scene which was omitted from final cut and can be found in dvd s deleted scenes mendes believed that capone was more menacing as an unseen presence actor alfred molina was approached to portray capone but molina was forced to turn role down due to scheduling conflicts with frida 2002 filming before filming mendes sought to produce a period film that would avoid cliches in gangster genre he chose to film road to perdition on location in downtown at university club of chicago chicago neighborhood of pullman charles g dawes house in evanston as well as chicago suburb of geneva illinois armory state s largest location mainstay which houses illinois state national guard was provided to studio by illinois state film commission sets were built inside armory including interiors of sullivan family s home and rooney mansion availability of an inside location provided crew complete control over lighting environment which was established with rigging of scaffoldings mendes collaborated with costume designer albert wolsky production designer dennis gassner and cinematographer conrad hall to design film s style wolsky designed costumes that were very controlled with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes gassner built sets that could capture cold look of era mendes sought a muted palette for film having dark backgrounds and sets with dark muted greens and grays mendes filmed road to perdition using super 35 format director filmed exterior scenes in illinois in winter and spring of 2001 using real weather conditions such as snow rain and mud for scenes mendes considered usage of bleak weather conditions and intended coldness of gassner s exterior locations to define characters emotional states pullman became a key location to reflect this theme having several settings including town s historic florence hotel easily redressed by crew for film filming concluded in june 2001 cinematography right thumb 250px cinematographer conrad hall set up atmospheric lighting similar to that found in paintings of edward hopper to establish lighting of scenes in road to perdition mendes drew from paintings of edward hopper as a source of inspiration particularly hopper s new york movie 1939 mendes and cinematographer conrad hall sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for film s scenes applying a less is more mantra hall also shot at wide apertures that retained one point in depth of field sharply focused hall considered technique to provide an emotional dimension to scenes cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects one of hall s methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter light enough to create an in shade look hall purposely distanced camera from hanks character michael sullivan sr at beginning of film to establish perspective of sullivan s son who is unaware of his father s true nature hanks character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways and his entrances and exits took place in shadows a wide lens was used to maintain a distance from character shots in film were drawn directly from panels in graphic novel illustrated by richard piers rayner an instance of direct influence is scene in which michael jr looks up at chicago skyline from vehicle with skyline reflected in vehicle s glass a seamless 40 second driving scene in which michael sullivan and his son travel into chicago from countryside was aided by visual effects live action part of scene was filmed at lasalle street and due to lack of scenery for part of drive down lasalle street background of balbo drive was included with use of visual effects themes consequences of violence film s title road to perdition is both michael sullivan and his son s destination town and a euphemism for hell a road that sullivan desires to prevent his son from traveling sullivan who chooses his violent path early on in life considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate said mendes sullivan is in a battle for soul of his son can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child taking road production notes road to perdition 2002 retrieved 2007 06 06 hanks described sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means whose likely repercussions he ignored sullivan is a good father and husband but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer film explores this paradoxical dichotomy when sullivan is faced with consequences hanks says at moment we re dropped into story it is literally last day of that false perspective fathers sons production notes road to perdition 2002 retrieved 2007 06 06 to keep sullivan from justifying his violent actions in film mendes omitted scenes in final cut that had sullivan explaining his background to his son in film most of numerous acts of violence are committed off screen violent acts were also designed to be quick reflecting actual speed of violence in real world focus was not on direct victims of perpetuated violence but impact of violence on perpetrators or witnesses to act fathers and sons film also explores father son relationships not only between michael sullivan and his son but between sullivan and his boss john rooney and between rooney and connor sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears rooney and sullivan s son feels same about his own father rooney s son connor has none of sullivan s redeeming qualities and rooney is conflicted about whom to protect his biological son or his surrogate son connor is jealous of his father s relationship with sullivan which fuels his actions ultimately causing a domino effect that drives film because sullivan shields his background from his son his attempt to preserve father son relationship is actually harmful tragedy brings sullivan and his son together sullivan escapes from old world with his son and boy finds an opportunity to strengthen relationship with his father tyler hoechlin who portrayed michael jr explained his dad starts to realize that michael is all he has now and how much he s been missing i think journey is of a father and son getting to know each other and also finding out who they themselves are water water served as a motif in film it was developed after researching wake scene at beginning of film informed director that corpses were kept on ice in 1930s to keep bodies from decomposing notion was interwoven into film which linked presence of water with death circa 1931 production notes road to perdition 2002 retrieved 2007 06 06 mendes reflected on theme linking of water with death speaks of mutability of water and links it to of fate these are things that humans can t control release when filming concluded in june 2001

depression era setting as well as performances of hanks and newman gillespie expressed wish that film lasted a little longer to explore its emotional core further eric harrison of houston chronicle considered road to perdition most brilliant work in this gangster genre since uncut once upon a time in america 1984 harrison considered self s script so finely honed that story can change directions in a heartbeat kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter praised hanks newman and craig but called law s performance almost cartoonish peter travers of rolling stone also complimented hanks and newman they act together with confidence of titans their talents in service of character never star ego travers cited hall s breathtaking cinematography and composer thomas newman s evocative score paul clinton of cnn said while these deeply human issues are touched upon they re never fully explored and that undermines sense of greatness to which this movie obviously aspires clinton considered craig s character one dimensional to extreme he found cinematography too overpowering for film s storyline which he considered weak j hoberman of village voice described film as grim yet soppy he added action is stilted and tabloid energy embalmed stephen hunter of washington post thought that script lost its path when sullivan and his son fled their old life accolades award category recipient result
