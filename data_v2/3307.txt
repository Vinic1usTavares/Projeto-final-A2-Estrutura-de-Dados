legal case against marvel helped establish a precedent to end monopoly of work for hire system wherein comics creators even freelancers had owned no rights to characters they created george p 73 in 1983 richard kyle commissioned kirby to create a 10 page autobiographical strip street code which became one of last works published in kirby s lifetime it was published in 1990 in second issue of kyle s revival of argosy kirby continued to do periodic work for dc comics during 1980s including a brief revival of his fourth world saga in 1984 and 1985 super powers matthew k 1980s in dolan p 208 in association with toy company kenner dc released a line of toys called super powers dc soon debuted a five issue super powers miniseries plotted by comic book legend jack king kirby scripted by joey cavalieri and with pencils by adrian gonzales and 1985 graphic novel hunger dogs dc executives jenette kahn and paul levitz had kirby re design fourth world characters for super powers toyline as a way of entitling him to royalties for several of his dc creations in 1985 kirby and gil kane helped to create concept and designs for ruby spears animated television series centurions a comic book series based on show was published by dc and a toy line produced by kenner in twilight of his life kirby spent a great deal of time sparring with marvel executives over ownership rights of his original page boards at marvel many of these pages owned by company due to outdated and legally dubious copyright claims were given away as promotional gifts to marvel clients or simply stolen from company warehouses after passage of copyright act of 1976 which greatly expanded artist copyright capabilities comics publishers began to return original art to creators but in marvel s case only if they signed a release reaffirming marvel s ownership of copyright in 1985 marvel issued a release that demanded kirby affirm that his art was created for hire allowing marvel to retain copyright in perpetuity in addition to demanding that kirby forego all future royalties marvel offered him 88 pages of his art less than 1 of his total output if he signed agreement but reserved right to reclaim art if kirby violated deal after kirby publicly slammed marvel calling company thugs and claiming they were arbitrarily holding his creations marvel finally returned after two years of deliberations approximately 1 900 or 2 100 pages of estimated 10 000 to 13 000 kirby drew for company for producer charles band jack kirby made concept art for films doctor and which would later be released as doctor 1992 and 1993 respectively initially doctor would be an adaptation of a marvel comics character dr strange for topps comics founded in 1993 kirby retained ownership of characters used in multiple series of what company dubbed evanier p 207 these titles were derived mainly from designs and concepts kirby had kept in his files some intended initially for by then defunct pacific comics and then licensed to topps for what became jack kirby s secret city saga mythos phantom force was last comic book kirby worked on before his death story was co written by kirby with michael thibodeaux and richard french based on an eight page pitch for an unused bruce lee comic in 1978 issues 1 and 2 were published by image comics with various image artists inking over kirby s pencils issue 0 and issues 3 8 were published by genesis west with kirby providing pencils for issues 0 and 4 thibodeaux provided art for remaining issues of series after kirby died personal life in early 1940s kirby and his family moved to brooklyn there kirby met rosalind roz goldstein who lived in same apartment building pair began dating soon afterward ro p 14 kirby proposed to goldstein on her 18th birthday and two became engaged ro p 16 they married on may 23 1942 evanier king of comics p 57 couple had four children together susan b december 6 1945 neal b may 1948 barbara b november 1952 and lisa b

war ii v mail letter from kirby to rosalind in george p 117 during winter of 1944 kirby suffered severe frostbite and was taken to a hospital in london for recovery doctors considered amputating kirby s legs which had turned black but he eventually recovered and was able to walk again ro p 40 41 he returned to united states in january 1945 assigned to camp butner in north carolina where he spent last six months of his service as part of motor pool kirby was honorably discharged as a private first class on july 20 1945 having received a combat infantryman badge a european african middle eastern campaign medal and a bronze star medal evanier p p 42 in 1949 kirby bought a house for his family in mineola new york on long island this would be family s home for next 20 years with kirby working out of a basement studio just wide which family referred to jocularly as dungeon he moved family to southern california in early 1969 both to live in a drier climate for sake of daughter lisa s health and to be closer to hollywood studios kirby believed might provide work evanier king of comics pp 157 160 unnumbered drove jack to distraction and from there to southern california in early 1969 kirbys moved west main reason was daughter lisa s asthma and her need to live in a drier climate than in new york state but jack had another reason kirby had hopes that being close to hollywood might bring hm entry to movie business film seemed like next logical outlet for his creativity in an interview kirby s granddaughter jillian kirby said kirby was a liberal democrat on february 6 1994 kirby died at age 76 of heart failure in his thousand oaks california home he was buried at pierce brothers valley oaks memorial park westlake village california artistic style and achievements brent staples wrote in new york times jack kirby has been referred to as superhero of style his artwork described by john carlin in masters of american comics as deliberately primitive and bombastic and elsewhere has been compared to cubist futurist primitivist and outsider art hatfield 7 saunders p 11 his contributions to comic book form including many characters he created or co created and many genres he worked on have led to him being referred to as definitive comic book artist carlin p 261 given number of places kirby s artwork can now be found toys based on his designs and success of movies based upon his work charles hatfield and ben saunders declare him one of chief architects of american imagination hatfield saunders p 9 he was regarded as a hard working artist and it has been calculated that he drew at least 20 318 pages of published art and a further 1 385 covers in his career he published 1 158 pages in 1962 alone kirby defined comics in two periods his work in early 1940s with joe simon on captain america strip and then his superhero comics of 1960s with stan lee at marvel comics and on his own at dc comics reprinted in george p 61 73 kirby has also created stories in almost every genre of comics from autobiographical street code to apocalyptic science fiction fantasy of kamandi narrative approach to comics like many of his contemporaries kirby was hugely indebted to milton caniff hal foster and alex raymond who codified many of tropes of narrative art in adventure comic strips it has also been suggested that kirby also drew from burne hogarth whose dynamic figure work may have informed way kirby drew figures his ferocious bounding and grotesquely articulated figures seem directly descended from hogarth s dynamically contorted forms hatfield 2012 p 61 his style drew on these influences all major artists at time kirby was learning his craft with caniff foster and raymond between them imparting to sequential adventure comic strip a highly illustrative approach based on realising setting to a very high degree where kirby diverged from these influences and where his style impacted on formation of comic book art was in his move away from an illustrated approach to one that was more dynamic kirby s artistic style was one that captured energy and motion within image with text and helping to serve narrative in contrast successors to illustrative approach such as gil kane found their work eventually reach an impasse art would illustrate but in lacking movement caused reader to contemplate art as much as written word later artists such as bryan hitch and alex ross combined kirby and kane approaches using highly realistic backgrounds contrasted with dynamic characters to create what became known as a widescreen approach to comics hatfield 2012 p 63 65 kirby s dynamism and energy served to push reader through story where an illustrative detailed approach would cause eye to linger hatfield 2012 p 65 67 his reduction of presentation of a given scene down to one that represents semblance of movement has led kirby to be described as cinematic in his style having worked at fleischer studios before coming to comics kirby had a grounding in animation techniques for producing motion he also realised that comic books weren t subject to same constraints as newspaper strip while other comic book artists recreated layouts that format used kirby swiftly utilised space a whole comic book page created as ron goulart describes h e broke up pages in new ways and introduced splash panels that stretched across two pages kirby himself described creation of his dynamic style as a reaction both to cinema and to urge to create and compete i found myself competing with movie camera i had to compete with camera i felt like john henry i tore my characters out of panels i made them jump all over page i tried to make that cohesive so that it would be easier to read i had to get my characters in extreme positions and in doing so i created an extreme style which was recognizable by everybody style thumb left fantastic four 51 june 1966 p 14 collage and pencilled figure by jack kirby inks by joe sinnott letters by artie simek dialogue by stan lee illustrating kirby s use of collage in early 1940s kirby would at times disregard panel borders a character would be drawn in one panel but their shoulder and arm would extend outside border into gutter and sometimes on top of a nearby panel a character may be punched out of one panel feet being in original panel and body in next panels themselves would overlap and kirby would find new ways to arrange panels on a comic book page his figures were depicted as lithe and graceful although kirby would place them thrusting from page towards reader hatfield 2012 p 24 5 69 saunders p 11 late 1940s and 1950s saw kirby move away from superhero comics and working with joe simon try his hand at a number of genres kirby and simon created romance comics genre and working in this as well as war western and crime genres saw kirby s style change he left behind diverse panel framing and layouts nature of these genres enabled him to channel energy into posing and blocking of characters forcing drama into constraints of panel when kirby and stan lee came together at marvel comics his art developed again his characters and representations became more abstract less anatomically correct he would place figures across three planes of a panels depth to suggest three dimensions hatfield 2005 p 54 55 his backgrounds would be less detailed where he did not want eye to be drawn his figures would move actively along diagonals and he utilised foreshortening to make a character appear to recede more deeply into panel so that they appeared to move towards reader off page during 1960s kirby also developed a talent for collages initially utilising them within pages of fantastic four he introduced negative zone as a place within marvel universe that would only be illustrated via collage however reproduction within published comics of collages coupled with low page rate he was being paid and time they took to develop saw their use discarded kirby would later return to use of collage in his fourth world work at dc comics here he used them most often in pages of superman s pal jimmy olsen hatfield saunders p 89 99 kirby s style in late 1960s was regarded so highly by stan lee that he instituted it as marvel s house style lee would instruct other artists to draw more like jack and would also assign them books to work on using kirby s breakdowns of story so that they could more closely hew to kirby s style hartfield 2012 p 9 over time kirby s style has become so well known that imitations homages and pastiche are referred to as originally published in comics journal 175 march 1995 kirby krackle also referred to as kirby dots is kirby s artistic convention of depicting effect of energy within drawing a field of black pseudo fractal images is used to represent negative space around unspecified kinds of energy kirby are typically used in illustrations of explosions smoke blasts from ray guns cosmic energy and outer space phenomena advanced technology kirby drew from afrofuturistic state of wakanda through mother boxes of new gods to spaceships and design of celestials is gathered together under collective term kirby tech john paul leon has described it as it s tech it s mechanical even if it s alien but it s drawn in such an organic way that you don t question it it s just an extension of his world i m not sure who else you could say did that kirby s depiction of technology is linked by charles hatfield to leo marx s idea of technological sublime specifically utilising edmund burke s definition of sublime using this definition kirby s view and depiction of technology is that of it as something to be feared hatfield 2012 p 144 71 working method thumb right jack kirby s pencils for splash page to demon 1 dc comics september 1972 detailed pencil work kirby created can be seen in this art unlike many of his contemporaries kirby did not use preliminary sketches rough work or layouts he would instead start with blank board and draw story onto page from top to bottom start to finish many artists including carmine infantino gil kane and jim steranko have remarked on unusual nature of his method kirby would rarely erase while working art and therefore story would flow from him almost fully formed hatfield p 58 kirby s pencils had a reputation for being detailed to point that they were difficult to ink will eisner remembers even in early years that kirby s pencils were tight eisner p 199 working for eisner kirby initially inked with a pen not confident enough in his ability to use japanese brushes lou fine and eisner preferred eisner p 213 by time kirby worked with joe simon kirby had taught himself to use a brush and would on occasion ink over inked work where he felt it was needed eisner p 209 due to amount of work kirby produced it was rare for him to ink his own work instead pencilled pages were sent on to an inker different inkers would therefore impact on published version of kirby s art with kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres interview nostalgia journal 30 1 november 1976 december 1976 reprinted in george p 10 for a period during 1950s when work had dried up it s been suggested by harry mendryk that kirby inked himself by late 1960s kirby preferred to pencil feeling that inking in itself is a separate kind of art stan lee recalls kirby not really being too interested in who inked him i cared much more about who inked kirby than kirby did kirby never seemed to care who inked him i think kirby felt his style was so strong that it just didn t matter who inked him chic stone an inker of kirby s during 1960s at marvel recalled t he two best inkers for jack were mike royer and steve rude both truly maintained integrity of jack s pencils morrow p 90 size of art board made a difference to kirby s style during late 1960s industry shrunk size of art board artists used prior to 1967 art boards were around 14 x 21 inches being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches after 1967 size of board shrunk to 15 x 10 hatfield saunders p 36 7 this affected way kirby drew gil kane noted that amount of space around figures became less and less figures became bigger and bigger and they couldn t be contained by a single panel or even a single page hatfield saunders p 28 professor craig fischer asserts kirby at first hated new size hatfield saunders p 37 fischer argues that it took kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at smaller size initially he retreated to a less detailed close up style as seen in fantastic four 68 in adjusting to new size kirby began utilising depth to bring pages to life increasing his use of foreshortening by time kirby had moved to dc he started to incorporate use of two page spreads into his art more these spreads helped define mood of story and came to define kirby s late era work hatfield saunders p 149 157 exhibitions and original art kirby s art has been exhibited as part of masters of american comics joint exhibition by hammer museum and museum of contemporary art from november 2005 to march 2016 in 2015 charles hatfield curated comic book apocalypse

would have been reused or due to paper shortages dc comics had a policy of destroying original art in 1950s marvel comics would also destroy art up until 1960 when it stored artwork prior to a policy which saw art returned to artist in kirby s case it s reported he was returned roughly 2100 pieces of estimated 10 000 pages drawn whereabouts of these missing pages are unknown although some do turn
