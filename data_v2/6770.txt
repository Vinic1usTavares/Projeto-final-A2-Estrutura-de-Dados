landing at scarlet beach operation diminish 22 september 1943 took place in new guinea during huon peninsula campaign of second world war involving forces from australia united states and japan allied forces landed at scarlet beach north of siki cove and south of song river to east of katika and about north of finschhafen capture of finschhafen allowed construction of air base and naval facilities to assist allied air and naval forces to conduct operations against japanese bases in new guinea and new britain after lae had fallen sooner than allies had anticipated they exploited advantage as a result of faulty intelligence which underestimated size of japanese force in area assault force chosen consisted of only brigadier victor windeyer s 20th infantry brigade landing at scarlet beach that took place on 22 september 1943 was first opposed amphibious landing that australian forces had made since landing at anzac cove in gallipoli campaign of 1915 navigational errors resulted in troops being landed on wrong beach with some of them coming ashore at siki cove and taking heavy fire from strong japanese defences in pillboxes after re organising australians pushed inland japanese put up stiff resistance on high ground at katika but were forced back by end of day australians had secured their objectives japanese launched a retaliatory air raid on ships of vii amphibious force but us fighter aircraft defended convoy and no ships were hit continued japanese air attacks on beachhead inflicted numerous casualties over course of battle next day australians commenced their advance south towards village of finschhafen about south of landing beach with 2 15th infantry battalion leading way to bumi river japanese had established strong defences along river s southern bank which australians attempted to outflank by sending a force to west climbing through steep terrain once they had located a suitable place to cross river they began wading across but were fired upon by a group of japanese naval infantry who were positioned on a high feature overlooking river despite taking casualties australians were able to establish themselves south of bumi and at that point 2 13th infantry battalion began to advance on finschhafen from west meanwhile 2 15th attacked left flank of japanese that had opposed their crossing after advancing up steep slope under fire sometimes on their hands and knees 2 15th took position at point of bayonet killing 52 japanese in close combat australian fears of a japanese counter attack grew and they requested reinforcements from general douglas macarthur request was denied as his intelligence staff believed that there were only 350 japanese in vicinity actually there were already 5 000 japanese around sattelberg and finschhafen australians received some reinforcements in shape of 2 43rd infantry battalion arrival of this unit meant that entire 20th infantry brigade could concentrate on finschhafen japanese naval troops which were holding finschhafen began to withdraw and finschhafen fell to australians on 2 october 20th infantry brigade then linked up with 22nd infantry battalion a militia infantry battalion that had

nadzab salamaua lae and markham river valley were all in allied hands by 16 september 1943 blamey then turned his attention to his next objective finschhafen japanese bombing of wewak in which 100 japanese aircraft were lost in august 1943 caused imperial general headquarters ighq in tokyo to reconsider whether eastern new guinea and solomon islands could be held concluding that it could not ighq authorised commander of japanese eighth area army to conduct a fighting withdrawal to a new defensive position in western new guinea which it hoped would be ready in 1944 lieutenant general hatazo adachi commander of japanese xviii army in new guinea recognised importance of finschhafen area and had placed major general eizo yamada commander of 1st shipping group in charge of defending it to strengthen defences there adachi ordered 80th infantry regiment and a battalion of field artillery from 20th division at madang to move to finschhafen on 7 august 1943 headquarters artillery and heavy weapons departed bogadjim on 15 august and travelled by sea but remainder marched along coast on 26 august he assigned 2nd battalion 238th infantry regiment part of 41st division which was in area en route to join rest of 238th infantry regiment at salamaua to remain in finschhafen area under yamada s command landing at lae on 4 september made an australian advance on finschhafen appear imminent and adachi ordered rest of 20th division less nakai detachment in markham valley to move to finschhafen main body under lieutenant general shigeru katagiri left bogadjim bound for finschhafen on 10 september but was not expected to arrive before october in event of an allied attack before he arrived yamada was to hold high ground around sattelberg and prepare for a counter attack geography huon peninsula is situated along north east coast of papua new guinea and stretches from lae in south on huon gulf to sio in north along vitiaz strait along coast between these two points numerous rivers and streams cut terrain of these most prominent are song bumi and mape rivers these waterways flow from mountainous interior which is formed through conglomeration of rawlinson range in south with cromwell mountains in east these meet in centre of peninsula to form saruwaged range massif which joins finisterre range further west apart from a thin flat coastal strip at time of campaign area was thickly covered with dense jungle through which very few tracks had been cut during planning allies identified three areas as key and decisive terrain in area beach north of katika which was later codenamed scarlet by allies peak called sattelberg to south west which dominated area due to its height and finschhafen possessing a small airfield and sitting on coast in a bay which offered protected harbour facilities before war town had a population of about 30 white and 60 native people there were good anchorages for vessels of up to 5 000 tons in dreger harbour langemak bay and finsch harbour flat coastal strip provided a number of potential airfield sites german names abounded in area because territory of new guinea was a german colony from 1884 until it was occupied by australia in 1914 prelude intelligence allied estimates of number of japanese troops in finschhafen area varied brigadier general charles a willoughby assistant chief of staff g 2 and therefore head of intelligence branch at macarthur s ghq considered finschhafen to be primarily a transhipment point and troops there to be mainly from line of communication units fall of lae ended its utility so he reduced his estimate of number of japanese troops in area to 350 based on this appreciation ghq believed that finschhafen would be a there was reason to believe otherwise a ten man allied intelligence bureau patrol that included three australian officers an american amphibian scout from us army s 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment a signaller from z special unit and native soldiers was landed during night of 11 12 september in rubber boats launched from two pt boats scouts were unable to obtain hydrographic information they sought due to japanese patrols in area a number of machine gun nests were identified during their reconnaissance of enemy positions before they were extracted on 14 september as had happened during kokoda track campaign and battle of buna gona estimates by australian intelligence differed greatly from those at ghq as they used different methods intelligence staff at blamey s allied land forces headquarters lhq headed by brigadier j d rogers had come up with a much higher figure of 3 000 i corps produced an estimate of 1 800 which was passed on along with ghq s estimate allies best source of intelligence ultra shone no light on matter finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted messages in previous three months most of these were in insecure japanese water transport code only after capture of japanese in battle of sio in january 1944 were allies able to systematically break into japanese army codes in fact japanese strength in area on 22 september was about 5 000 planning two contingency plans had been prepared by lieutenant general sir edmund herring s i corps one was a ship to shore operation by 6th division s 16th infantry brigade or 7th infantry brigade a militia formation at milne bay other was for a shore to shore operation by a brigade of major general george wootten s 9th division operation was codenamed diminish which was in fact that of finschhafen itself in plan produced by i corps on 24 august 1943 herring selected beaches immediately south of song river for landing indications were that it was suitable for landing craft most of japanese defenders and defences were believed to be facing south in anticipation of an australian overland advance from lae it avoided having to cross mape river which was believed to be a significant obstacle landing beach became known as scarlet beach from post landing red screens and lights used to guide landing craft left end of beach was marked with a solid red panel mounted on tent poles right with one alternating red and white at night left would have a red light and right one alternating red and white this scheme had first been used at red beach during landing at lae to avoid confusion of having two red beaches landing beach was called scarlet beach instead thumb left brigadier victor windeyer won distinguished service order at siege of tobruk and again at second battle of el alamein on 16 september day lae fell macarthur ordered that finschhafen be captured as soon as possible following day he held a conference at port moresby he and blamey selected second contingency a landing by a brigade of 9th division brigadier victor windeyer s 20th infantry brigade was chosen as it was still relatively fresh and had experience with amphibious operations from landing at lae 6th division s movement to new guinea was postponed rear admiral daniel e barbey commander of vii amphibious force had originally counted on four weeks break between fall of lae and finschhafen operation on 9 september he had told herring that it would require a minimum of ten days under pressure from macarthur barbey cut that to three days this was too soon for herring to get troops together and 21 september was selected as target date herring briefed windeyer on operation on 18 september windeyer felt that schedule was still too tight and it was postponed one more day to 22 september as at lae first wave consisting of two companies each from 2 13th and 2 7th infantry battalions would land in plywood lcp r s launched by four destroyer transports and remainder of assault would land in six lsts 15 lcis and six lcts of vii amphibious force and 10 lcms and 15 lcvps of 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment total force would number about 5 300 9th division would be limited to taking 15 days supplies one of lessons of lae operation was need for a naval beach party to take soundings mark beaches and channels and handle communications between ship and shore us navy doctrine held that these should be composed of personnel drawn from attack transports but none were involved in lae or finschhafen operations for finschhafen an eight man royal australian navy ran beach party was organised under lieutenant commander j m band a set of oblique aerial photographs of scarlet beach were taken on 19 september by usaaf s 8th photo reconnaissance squadron only unit in swpa with equipment to take them that showed a shallow sand bar along southern half of beach rendering it unsuitable for landing craft this left beaching space for only three lsts landing plan was changed so only three of six lsts would beach with initial assault other three returning to buna and arriving on beach at 23 00 that night herring considered that spreading lst arrivals might make unloading easier wootten noted that this would mean that one battery of 25 pounders one light antiaircraft battery a quarter of engineer stores and casualty clearing station would have to arrive with second group ironically soundings taken by ran beach party after landing revealed that sand bar was actually a white shingle bottom and in fact beach was ideally suited to lst operations main point of disagreement between herring and barbey concerned timing of landing barbey and commander of allied naval forces vice admiral arthur s carpender did not want a repeat of what happened at lae when two lcis were lost and two lsts were badly damaged although usaaf and raaf attacked japanese air bases in new britain this did not stop nine japanese bombers and 10 fighters attacking nadzab on 20 september moreover some 23 japanese warships were sighted in harbour at rabaul and there were reports of japanese submarines in area accordingly barbey proposed landing at 02 00 under a quarter moon which would allow his ships to unload and get away soon after dawn noting that it was rainy season and sky would therefore likely be overcast herring doubted that vii amphibious force would be able to locate beach and pressed for a dawn landing at 05 15 in end a compromise was reached on 04 45 samuel eliot morison us naval historian noted that australians proved to be right uncle dan s outfit was not prepared for a neat night landing usual snafu developed landing first wave produced 140 mimeograph copies of vii amphibious force operation order which was distributed by pt boat they then departed for g beach east of lae while they were en route during night a japanese raid on buna sank

to return to buna this left a company of 2 13th infantry battalion without its transport battalion commander lieutenant colonel g e colvin arranged for them to travel on uss lci 337 lci 338 and lci 342 around sunset six sally bombers attacked escorting destroyers they dropped their bombs but scored no hits thumb left a type 1 heavy machine gun in a japanese pillbox on coast ships arrived off scarlet beach on time and destroyers conducted a short 11 minute preliminary bombardment it was doubtful if any japanese positions were hit or any casualties inflicted low cloud trapped smoke and dust produced by bombardment to australians it was dark as inside of a cow scarlet beach and siki cove were covered by bunker type pillboxes made of logs spaced about apart and connected by shallow trenches they held about 300 japanese defenders japanese tracer fire started pouring from shore at this point one australian recalled i realised that this was not an unopposed landing it was first opposed landing by australian troops since landing at anzac cove in gallipoli campaign of 1915 almost all lcp r s in first wave veered off course to left landing between siki creek and rocks of headland between siki cove and arndt point all boats landed successfully except for one carrying 11 platoon of 2 15th infantry battalion which had broken down and was towed by lcp r carrying 10 platoon delaying both another lcp r appeared and took platoon in but only three of sixteen landed on scarlet beach in some ways this was good as it meant that plywood landing craft were not subjected to intense machine gun fire which might have caused heavy casualties but there were still serious disadvantages to landing on wrong beach on right captain t c sheldon s b company 2 17th infantry battalion accompanied by anti tank platoon and 10 platoon papuan infantry battalion landed roughly where they were supposed to and pushed on to their objective north hill rest of first wave was jumbled up major p h pike found his a company of 2 17th mixed up with captain paul deschamps b company of 2 13th since latter had further to travel and there was no japanese opposition pike agreed to hold his company back while deschamps moved on to his objective pike then moved his men inland and waited for daylight c company s task was to seize arndt point but part of it was already there facing a steep cliff only platoon to encounter serious opposition was lieutenant c huggett s platoon which had veered off to right and landed on scarlet beach near mouth of song river it came under fire from two japanese machine gun posts there with help of an american amphibian scout lieutenant herman a koeln huggett attacked posts with grenades and small arms another amphibian scout lieutenant edward k hammer encountered a party of japanese that he fired on koeln and hammer were conspicuous because they were carrying red canvas signs to mark beach lieutenant commander john m band was fatally wounded making his way to scarlet beach he was posthumously awarded us navy cross follow up second wave came in lcis these were craft that had no ramps infantry disembarked from down gangways that they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked but they were all that was available first wave s mission had been to capture scarlet beach and foreshore since that had not been done they came under fire from japanese bunkers despite explicit orders not to they replied with their oerlikon 20 mm cannon some helped to suppress japanese machine guns while others fired wildly and caused casualties among australian troops ashore like first wave they veered off to left adding to chaos at least three of lcis grounded on a sand bar but were able to retract and make better landings although still on wrong beach thumb right uss lst 168 unloads at scarlet beach military landing officer major j r broadbent landed with first wave in same lcp r as pike with him was an amphibian scout carrying red signal light that was to mark centre of beach for later waves they were unable to reach correct location in time for second wave but were able to place it and switch it on in time for third so it was first to land on scarlet beach although first wave had landed seven minutes late second was fifteen and third was half an hour behind schedule in confusion two lcis collided killing two soldiers and injuring eight some of lci captains were reluctant to drive their ships in hard enough and many troops disembarked into water that was over their heads sergeant of royal papuan constabulary landing with 9 platoon of papuan infantry battalion was awarded george medal for attempting to save captain a b who was hit in deep water third wave found japanese bunkers still manned and assaulted them most of japanese defenders withdrew rather than fight to finish four lcms of lieutenant colonel e d brockett s boat battalion of 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment carrying bofors 40 mm guns were supposed to arrive with second wave but due to some navigational difficulties they were an hour late they came in with six lcms and four lcvps of fourth wave which was itself 40 minutes late arriving at 06 10 11 lcvps of fifth wave reached scarlet beach ten minutes later by 06 30 beach and foreshore were clear of japanese and destroyer transports and lcis were on their way back to buna amphibian engineers set up a portable surgical hospital to treat wounded windeyer and his brigade major major b v wilson arrived in a landing craft from destroyer and he established brigade headquarters in a kunai patch from beach a japanese soldier threw a hand grenade at them that killed one man and wounded brigade intelligence officer captain barton maughan japanese soldier was killed with an owen gun thumb left american and australian troops with a japanese prisoner captured in landing at scarlet beach sixth and final wave consisted of and they had instructions to wait until smaller craft had cleared beach and beached at 06 50 each carried an unloading party of 100 men drawn from 2 23rd and 2 48th infantry battalions and 2 2nd machine gun battalion who would return with lsts unloading proceeded at a rapid pace all cargo was unloaded from two of three when they retracted at 09 30 and headed off escorted by ten destroyers and fleet tug 2 3rd field company 2 1st mechanical equipment company 2 3rd pioneer battalion and shore battalion of 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment prepared four beach exits stores were quickly moved off beach to inland dumps some 5 300 troops 180 vehicles 32 25 pounders and bofors 40 mm guns and of bulk stores had been unloaded fifth air force fighters provided air cover from 06 45 a japanese reconnaissance aircraft flew over beachhead at 09 10 and was shot down a lone bomber showed up ten minutes later and attacked lsts on beach but missed two dive bombers attacked at 09 30 and were driven off but not before inflicting casualties bofors guns of 10th light anti aircraft battery were attacked and five men were wounded one fatally over next two weeks there was at least one air raid on beachhead every day air raids proved an effective way of clearing beach a large attack by 39 aircraft of 4th air army ran into bad weather and had to return to wewak but a naval air forces attack with 38 zeke fighters and eight betty bombers found lsts and destroyers near tami islands on their way back to buna at 12 40 fighter cover was being changed over so fifth air force fighter controller on board destroyer could deploy five squadrons instead of just three they claimed to have shot down 29 fighters and 10 bombers antiaircraft gunners from destroyers lsts and sonoma also engaged bombers while torpedo wakes were seen no hits were suffered three lockheed p 38 lightning fighters were shot down but at least one pilot was rescued japanese pilots claimed to have sunk two cruisers two destroyers and two transports consolidation a shortage of 9 mm ammunition for owen guns was discovered apparently because ammunition was in lst that had not been completely unloaded an emergency airdrop was requested at 10 30 in port moresby 1st air maintenance company prepared 30 parachutes each attached to two boxes containing 2 560 rounds of 9 mm ammunition a total of 153 600 rounds this was loaded onto three usaaf b 24 liberator bombers at wards airfield that took off at 16 55 they arrived over finschhafen area after dark at 19 15 where a drop zone in a kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches of 115 000 rounds that were dropped about 112 000 were recovered thumb bofors 40 mm gun of 12th battery 2 4th australian light anti aircraft regiment around daybreak pike s a company 2 17th infantry battalion reached village of katika which turned out to be a clearing with some dilapidated huts his company came under fire from katika spur high ground to west which was strongly held by 9th company 80th infantry regiment and a company of 238th infantry regiment japanese attempted to outflank a company on its left but ran into capitan l snell s d company 2 15th infantry battalion japanese positions were well sited on spur for an attack from east along track from katika to sattelberg but at this point captain b g cribb commander of d company 2 13th infantry battalion came on radio and announced that he was in contact with japanese to west and was going to attack from that direction a furious fight ensured japanese held their fire until australians were almost on top of them realising that position was stronger than he had thought cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded windeyer ordered 2 17th to bypass position and proceed to its objective high ground south of song river 2 15th was ordered to attack katika spur attack was delivered at 15 15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars but japanese defenders had withdrawn leaving behind eight dead by nightfall most of brigade was on their objectives seventh wave made up of uss lst 67 lst 452 and lst 454 arrived at scarlet beach at midnight as with previous wave each carried an australian labour force which unloaded lsts under direction of shore battalion lsts retracted at 03 00 in order to be well clear before dawn during first day australian casualties were 20 killed 65 wounded and nine missing all of whom were eventually found to be either dead or wounded vii amphibious force reported that three men had been wounded reinforcement blamey relinquished command of new guinea force on 22 september handing over to lieutenant general sir iven mackay as one of his final actions before returning to lhq in brisbane blamey instructed herring to arrange for reinforcement of finschhafen with an extra brigade and 9th division headquarters that day though macarthur who also returned to brisbane on 24 september had issued an instruction that operations at finschhafen were to be so conducted as to avoid commitment of amphibious means beyond those allotted barbey therefore declined to arrange for reinforcement of finschhafen mackay took up matter with carpender who likewise demurred macarthur feared that committing additional resources would tie them up and perhaps result in losses that would delay upcoming operations relinquishing initiative to japanese ironically delay in reinforcing finschhafen would cause just that thumb left rough terrain in area necessitated these human supply chains to get ammunition and food to forward troops windeyer sent a signal on 27 september asking for another infantry battalion and a squadron of tanks and carpender agreed to ship additional battalion following day herring flew to milne bay to confer with barbey about this on takeoff from dobodura b 25 mitchell he was travelling in crashed a flying fragment killed his chief of staff brigadier r b sutherland instantly everyone else on board escaped shaken but unscathed meeting was cancelled willoughby still clung to his original estimate of 350 japanese in finschhafen area but macarthur authorised extra battalion it was arranged that first lst departing lae on night of 28 29 september would stop at g beach and collect 2 43rd infantry battalion and a platoon of 2 13th field company a total of 838 men they were taken to buna where they transferred to destroyer transports uss brooks gilmer and humphreys next night they made a run to scarlet beach troops were landed and 134 wounded were taken back but surf conditions prevented most seriously wounded from being evacuated while 20th infantry brigade was engaged at finschhafen 22nd infantry battalion a militia infantry battalion from victoria advanced along coast from hopoi mission station towards finschhafen this advance constituting a minor epic in new guinea operations traversed increasing difficult terrain supply using vehicles was impossible 22nd infantry battalion was supplied by boats of 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment stores were dropped off at advanced beaches and then carried from there by native porters 22nd infantry battalion fought a number of skirmishes against japanese 2nd battalion 80th infantry regiment which was under orders to withdraw 22nd infantry battalion therefore discovered a series of well prepared and strong positions which were either unmanned or soon abandoned along way two type 41 75 mm mountain guns that had been disabled were found along with bodies of six natives who had hauled guns who had been bound and shot battalion reached dreger harbour on 1 october where it made contact with 20th infantry brigade advance on finschhafen thumb right map of 20th infantry brigade s advance on finschhafen september 1943 on 23 september windeyer ordered an advance on finschhafen lieutenant colonel colin grace s 2 15th infantry battalion reached bumi river at 12 40 it was wide and appeared fordable but banks contained barbed wire and strongly fortified japanese positions while yamada was withdrawing towards sattelberg japanese marines of 85th garrison unit remained in place yamada had no authority over marines and its commander captain tsuzuki saw no reason to conform to yamada s actions he intended to hold finschhafen for as long as possible grace ordered major ron suthers to outflank japanese position by moving through foothills of range as previously instructed by windeyer while not high these were very steep and covered in thick vegetation suthers halted on ridge for night but resumed his advance in morning reaching bumi at 10 00 they again found north bank defended but south occupied so attempted to find a crossing upstream a japanese sniper with a light machine gun killed b company s commander captain e christie and lieutenant n suthers then ordered snell to make an assault crossing with d company this was done at 13 30 with company crossing in waist deep water only one man was killed in crossing during afternoon 2 13th infantry battalion crossed river to bridgehead secured by b and d companies a large japanese air raid at 12 30 by 20 fighters and 12 bombers struck australian positions around launch jetty and finschhafen airstrip about 60 bombs were dropped there were heavy casualties 2 3rd field company lost 14 killed and 19 wounded 2 12th field regiment lost two killed and 16 wounded and air liaison party s headquarters was hit knocking out its radio set and killing captain ferrel its commander another eight men were killed and 40 wounded in air raids on 25 september during night of 25 26 september japanese barges and a submarine were spotted offshore windeyer had to bring a company of 2 17th infantry battalion back to protect brigade area meanwhile d company of 2 17th infantry battalion had moved along track to sattelberg with intent of capturing that position d company reported that sattelberg was unoccupied but in fact had captured jivevenang not sattelberg when mistake was realised and it attempted to take sattelberg it was found to be strongly defended d company therefore withdrew to jivevenang unfortunately news of capture of sattelberg was passed all way up line to ghq in brisbane thumb left a 25 pounder of 2 12th australian field regiment shells kakakog area from airstrip advance on finschhafen continued on 26 september since salankaua plantation was still reported to be heavily defended windeyer attempted to force defenders to withdraw he started with attacks on two hills to south west of plantation b and d companies of 2 15th infantry battalion attacked what came to be called snell s hill it was captured in hand to hand combat using bayonets australians captured three 13 mm heavy machine guns and seven light machine guns and buried bodies of 52 dead japanese defenders other feature which came to be called starvation hill was taken by c company however their capture did not prompt japanese to leave salankaua plantation windeyer realised that he needed to capture kakakog ridge torrential rain was falling making it difficult to resupply forward positions particularly starvation hill on 1 october eight douglas a 20 havoc bombers of us 89th bombardment squadron attacked japanese positions in salankaua plantation and kakakog ridge area at 10 35 followed by ten vultee vengeance dive bombers of no 24 squadron raaf this was followed by twenty 25 pounders of 2 12th field regiment firing 30 rounds per gun attack was delivered but assault companies were soon pinned down when a situation seemed desperate historian david dexter noted australian army appeared to have knack of producing a leader of necessary character sergeant g r crawford led 11 and 12 platoons of 2 13th infantry battalion in a bayonet charge on japanese positions covering creek private a j firing a bren gun from hip silenced one of japanese posts causing most trouble he went on to silence another but was wounded trying to take out a third crawford s furious assault swept all before it one post remained on crawford s left which was attacked with 2 inch mortars and attacked by 8 platoon japanese abandoned post and withdrew into salankaua plantation rolfe and crawford were awarded distinguished conduct medal 2 13th infantry battalion lost 10 killed and 70 between 80 and 100 japanese marines died arrival of 2 43rd infantry battalion meant that 2 17th infantry battalion could be reassembled for advance on finschhafen thus enabling entire 20th infantry brigade to concentrate on that objective on 2 october 2 17th infantry battalion crossed bumi without opposition and found salankaua plantation unoccupied in mopping up area it captured two japanese stragglers and killed three by evening finschhafen was in australian hands between 22 september and 2 october 20th infantry brigade had taken its objectives it had lost 73 dead 276 wounded and nine missing all of whom were later accounted for as dead or wounded 532nd engineer boat and shore regiment had eight dead and 42 wounded two americans were also killed in air liaison party aftermath macarthur s decision to move swiftly against finschhafen coupled with blamey s to envelop japanese defences by landing at scarlet beach and yamada s to avoid a decisive engagement that might result in loss of all or part of his force gave windeyer time and space he needed to take finschhafen blamey s objective was therefore in allied hands but it was of limited use without sattelberg allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that japanese reinforced their position faster and thus were able to seize initiative japanese launched a counter attack on allied lodgement around scarlet beach a three pronged action counter attack saw a diversionary attack to north while sugino craft raiding unit attacked from sea and two infantry regiments assaulted centre aiming towards beach and heldsbach plantation it had been intended that once beachhead was overwhelmed that 79th and 80th infantry regiments would link up and then clear finschhafen and bay areas but assault was poorly co ordinated and failed to achieve sufficient weight to overcome australians while also suffering from a lack of artillery seaborne assault was interdicted by us navy pt boats which inflicted heavy casualties and was destroyed by allied machine gunners on beach in centre though japanese were able to break through to siki cove and in process isolated several australian units including those fighting on western flank around jivevenang forcing australians to resort to air drops to keep their forces supplied while japanese briefly managed to force australians to contract their forces around beachhead and japanese aircraft were able to attack allied ground troops around area over three successive nights between 19 and 21 october attack eventually ran out of momentum on 24 october at which point japanese commander yamada ordered his forces to concentrate around high ground at sattelberg where they planned to make further attacks meanwhile australians prepared for an assault against japanese strong hold that had been established around abandoned lutheran mission atop sattelberg heights before advancing towards wareo plateau to cut off key japanese lines of communication notes references category 1943 in papua new guinea category battles of world war ii involving
