thumb upright 1 4 view of route 1920 ridge route officially castaic tejon route was a two lane highway between los angeles county and kern county california opened in 1915 and paved with concrete between 1917 and 1921 road was first paved highway directly linking los angeles basin with san joaquin valley over tejon pass and rugged sierra pelona mountains ridge south of gorman much of old road runs through angeles national forest and passes by many historical landmarks including national forest inn reservoir summit kelly s half way inn tumble inn and sandberg s summit hotel north of forest ridge route passed through deadman s curve before ending at grapevine most of road was bypassed in 1933 34 by three lane ridge route alternate then u s route 99 us 99 to handle increased traffic and remove many curves four lane us 99 was completed in 1953 and replaced by a freeway interstate 5 i 5 around 1968 portion of road within angeles national forest was added to national register of historic places in 1997 following efforts of harrison scott much of road has been closed by u s forest service other remnants of road are used by local traffic route description ridge route was officially castaic tejon route official limits of ridge route as built in 1910s were sr 126 at castaic junction and bottom of grade at grapevine until 1930 31 road from san fernando to castaic junction ran through newhall tunnel at san fernando pass and along san fernando road magic mountain parkway both part of sr 126 until early 2000s and road to a former bridge over santa clara river a 1930 bypass of tunnel and newhall through weldon canyon is now part of old road from castaic junction north to castaic ridge route has been largely buried by ridge route alternate and interstate 5 at castaic ridge route alternate turned northwest from old road at now intersection of castaic road and neely street first piece of ridge route road out of castaic has been realigned as recently as late 1990s when north lake housing development was built road begins to climb after passing north lake a portion was straightened in 1924 and now is next to southbound lanes of i 5 in this area known as five mile grade four lane ridge route alternate became northbound lanes of i 5 while added four lane alignment built to east next to old ridge route had lower grades and became southbound downhill lanes to cut down on runaway trucks two bridges were built to allow traffic to cross to left side near north end of this area ridge route curves away from newer bypass road enters angeles national forest about south of templin highway with forest service road designation establishments in forest included national forest inn kelly s half way inn tumble inn and sandberg s summit hotel thumb left remains of steps to national forest inn national forest inn was on west side of road a popular place along route composed of white clapboard buildings it was described in a 1932 highway beautification pamphlet as sort of filling station that gets into a national forest and is no addition thereto on october 14 1932 a fire began in garage and took over a day to put out when ridge route alternate bypassed site to west inn was not rebuilt and all that remains are concrete steps about north of national forest inn is serpentine drive where road curves around sides of hills as it climbs out of a low point in route about above sea level north of curves road passes through swede s cut also called big cut culebra excavation or castaic cut cut was largest on route with a depth of reservoir summit also called reservoir hill is above sea level reservoir summit cafe was a popular high class restaurant on east side of road closed in late 1920s foundation remains summit was named after a now dry reservoir one of three probably built for concrete used in paving road kelly s half way inn was roughly halfway between los angeles and bakersfield located on a small knoll with a single tree on east side of road all that remains is remnants of foundation tumble inn later mountain view lodge was on west side of road and closed when ridge route alternate opened in 1933 steps including top step with tumble inn in concrete and a retaining wall remain thumb historical marker sandberg s summit hotel later sandberg s lodge was located just north of liebre summit highest point on road at above sea level hotel was built in 1914 and thus served travelers from opening of road in 1915 built of logs it was a high class hotel place which had become a ceramics factory burned down on april 29 1961 from a fire started by new owner who was converting it into a camp type operation for underprivileged children burning trash in fireplace lease from u s forest service was canceled in 1963 and only portions of foundation and a rock wall remain name sandberg is still used by national weather service for an automated weather station a short distance to north at pine canyon road pine canyon road cr n2 marks end of forest and beginning of county maintenance and cr n2 uses old ridge route alignment to reach sr 138 near quail lake thumb left looking north through swede s cut ridge route crosses west branch california aqueduct with sr 138 splitting to northwest on gorman post road it rejoins path of i 5 at gorman and from gorman to end at grapevine most of old road has been covered over by ridge route alternate or i 5 path of ridge route is now named peace valley road and lebec road passing over tejon pass and past lebec and fort tejon past fort tejon route descends through grapevine canyon to grapevine named for grapevines in area best known curve on road deadman s curve or death curve is visible from road on west side of i 5 next part of old road that still exists is near bottom of grade where a number of curves brought road down to grapevine original plan was to build road nearer to center of canyon but a march 1914 flood destroyed work and grading was redone higher up deadman s curve and grapevine loops were both bypassed by ridge route alternate which was built directly over most of old road in this area at grapevine land suddenly flattens out and road north of grapevine was longest straight section of road in state in 1926 most of this road lies under i 5 and sr 99 but southernmost piece in grapevine was bypassed by alternate and is now in median of i 5 history before ridge route before ridge route passage between los angeles and san joaquin valley was more indirect for example el camino real spanish king s road first major road in california connected los angeles and various missions and settlements with san francisco and sonoma san joaquin valley route split from el camino real at present day universal city western leg running along pacific coast and coastal valleys and eastern el camino viejo spanish old road laid out via san joaquin valley to san antonio now east oakland an alternate route between los angeles and bakersfield followed southern approach to ridge route to saugus but took a longer route between saugus and gorman heading northeast through san francisquito canyon to antelope valley and west to gorman rest of route from gorman toward bakersfield via tejon pass followed same path as ridge route butterfield overland stage first overland mail service to california went from tipton missouri and memphis to san francisco via los angeles from october 1858 when first stage passed through tejon pass until april 1861 route was identical to el camino viejo running via san francisquito canyon in order to keep stages from running directly northwest from san bernardino and bypassing los angeles los angeles county board of supervisors spent 8000 in 1858 about in to deepen cut later beale s cut at san fernando pass south of saugus and newhall east of sierra highway west of antelope valley freeway or state route 14 path followed by stages was changed to pass along pacific coast from los angeles in april 1861 similarly residents of city of los angeles approved expenditure of a good deal of money towards building of southern pacific railroad which had originally planned to bypass city line to san francisco including san fernando tunnel through san fernando pass was completed on september 5 1876 railroad s route between saugus and bakersfield was even longer than that of el camino viejo and butterfield overland stage heading east through soledad canyon before turning north via palmdale to mojave and northwest over tehachapi pass in 1910s several power companies built lines through area general pipe line company completed an oil pipeline connecting san joaquin valley s midway sunset oil field with port at san pedro in 1913 its alignment followed ridge route north of gorman and south of reservoir summit a longer distance than any of earlier transportation routes but from gorman south to present location of pyramid lake where it turned east to reservoir summit it roughly followed later ridge route alternate that same year midway gas company opened a natural gas line and pacific light and power company opened a power line both staying fairly close to entire ridge route two general routes followed by butterfield overland stage and southern pacific railroad known respectively as tejon pass route and tehachapi or midway route were main automobile routes between los angeles and san joaquin valley around start of 20th century state bureau of highways recommended in 1895 that a more direct route be built to shorten this distance a bond issue was approved in 1909 and 1910 to build a state highway system including ridge route new california highway commission was unable to raise funds in east but los angeles again contributed funds to ensure that construction would go forward these routes all shared roadway south of saugus which was generally flat but included crossing of san fernando pass as discussed earlier this was deepened at county s expense in 1858 california state legislature authorized a turnpike in 1861 and it was completed in 1863 then owned by edward fitzgerald beale cut which came to be known as beale s cut was deepened by beale and lowered once more by county in 1904 to improve crossing county bypassed cut with narrow newhall tunnel for railroad traffic only which opened in october 1910 construction california highway commission considered several easterly routes between saugus and gorman soledad canyon used by southern pacific had frequent washouts mint canyon used by midway route was too long and cost too much bouquet canyon used by both automobile routes had bad drainage and san francisquito canyon used by tejon pass route was steep and narrow another possible route through piru canyon to west was rejected because of a proposal for a dam this route was later chosen for ridge route alternate but had to be abandoned in 1970s due to construction of pyramid lake thumb left leveling concrete pavement on original ridge route 1915 thumb left reinforcing concrete 1919 thus route chosen was a direct line between saugus and gorman over top of ridge for many miles due to cost and drainage concerns and a desire to reduce altering terrain road was built with 697 curves high in mountains construction on ridge route officially considered to run from castaic junction west of saugus on road to ventura to bottom of grade at grapevine began in 1914 highway was one of earliest projects completed by california highway commission to construct road horse drawn scrapers were used new road designed with an ideal grade of 6 percent but with several 7 percent grades including at grapevine cut distance by over tejon pass route or over midway route a speed limit of was enforced between castaic and quail lake making trip from los angeles to bakersfield take about 12 hours on ridge route between castaic junction and grapevine curves added up to a total of about 109 5 complete circles with a minimum radius of unpaved road which had cost 450 000 about in opened in october 1915 in addition to being part of state highway system as a portion of unsigned sacramento los angeles legislative route 4 road was also part of national park to park highway a privately designated auto trail and became part of us 99 in 1926 continuation south via saugus and newhall tunnel towards los angeles also part of route 4 was added to state highway system in 1917 according to san francisco chronicle new route was one of most remarkable engineering feats accomplished by state highway commission it is southern california s magnus opus sic in mountain highway construction it was also credited with stopping efforts to split california into two states by linking its two halves over rugged terrain separating them work on paving ridge route with wide and thick reinforced concrete began in 1917 but was delayed until 1919 by u s entry into world war i during work on road traffic was detoured via mint and bouquet canyons road was reopened on november 15 1919 completely paved except north of lebec including grade at grapevine which was only oiled after a bond issue was passed in july 1919 this portion was paved from september 1919 to may 1921 dangerous detour included a 20 percent grade this paving added about 1 million to cost for a total price of about 1 5 million about in which was not paid off until 1965 asphalt was added on top of concrete for south from swede s cut in 1922 and in 1924 a number of dangerous blind curves were widened and straightened bypasses and fate of bypassed road thumb left ridge route bypass in 1943 looking north towards grapevine in 1929 state decided to build a new bypass of central portion through piru canyon and to upgrade northern portion over tejon pass and down hill at grapevine this ridge route alternate or ridge alternate highway shortened route by and increased minimum curve radius from this was done over concerns regarding safety of road which had a high number of traffic accidents as well as highway s increased use old highway was to be relinquished to los angeles county and incorporated into county road system construction began in 1930 and road south of tejon pass was officially opened on october 29 1933 replacement of grapevine grade was completed by 1936 road which included a center suicide passing lane cost 3 5 million about in paid for by state gas tax it was estimated that it would pay itself off in 2 5 years with savings in time and gas a new bypass of newhall tunnel through weldon canyon had been opened on may 28 1930 thus giving drivers a better route all way from los angeles to bakersfield roadway was widened to an expressway by 1952 at a cost of 13 5 million about in providing two lanes in each direction and a center median but retaining at grade intersections even this four lane ridge route alternate was not adequate for volume of traffic using road and construction of eight lane freeway i 5 with a minimum curve radius of began in june 1963 large parts of ridge route alternate were incorporated into new roadway but area through present pyramid lake was completely bypassed i 5 over mountains between castaic junction and grapevine was completed on august 24 1970 at a cost of 103 million about in thumb right a section of 1915 ridge route in lebec abandoned when us 99 later upgraded to i 5 was constructed over tejon pass in order to make travel straighter and safer meanwhile portions of old road continued to exist as a county road longest preserved segment was part completely bypassed by ridge route alternate between castaic and sr 138 near sandberg including portion through angeles national forest road for about south from sr 138 is part of cr n2 harrison scott a retired engineer was traveling north on i 5 with his son in 1991 when his son speculated about difficulty of driving over first road through rugged terrain having some extra time and recalling a drive on old road in 1955 they left freeway and traveled along most of abandoned section near sr 138 scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing road if it was still maintained by county and crew replied that they didn t know who maintained it through desert it turned out that county officially owned it but did not maintain it scott has since convinced county and forest to exchange ownership with santa anita canyon road then a county road thumb right stretch of original pavement and curb in 2007 for next six years scott worked on getting road added to national register of historic places and finally succeeded when on september 25 1997 national park service added within forest to national register he subsequently wrote a book ridge route road that united california from research he had done for national register application that was published in 2002 route was repaired in 2005 following heavy rainfall but road was not reopened due to objections from angeles national forest officials major intersections see also 1857 fort tejon
