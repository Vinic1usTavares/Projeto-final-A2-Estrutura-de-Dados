began in wake of his failed attempt to seize power in beer hall putsch of 8 9 november 1923 trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave hitler a platform for propaganda hitler was sentenced to five years prison but was released on 20 december 1924 after serving just over a year goebbels was drawn to nsdap mostly because of hitler s charisma and commitment to his beliefs he joined nsdap around this time becoming member number 8762 in late 1924 goebbels offered his services to karl kaufmann who was gauleiter nsdap district leader for rhine ruhr district kaufmann put him in touch with

speaker and representative for rhineland westphalia members of strasser s northern branch of nsdap including goebbels had a more socialist outlook than rival hitler group in munich strasser disagreed with hitler on many parts of party platform and in november 1926 began working on a revision hitler viewed strasser s actions as a threat to his authority and summoned 60 gauleiters and party leaders including goebbels to a special conference in bamberg in streicher s gau of franconia where he gave a two hour speech repudiating strasser s new political programme hitler was opposed to socialist leanings of northern wing stating it would mean political of germany further there would be no princes only germans and a legal system with no jewish system of exploitation for plundering of our people future would be secured by acquiring land not through expropriation of estates of former nobility but through colonising territories to east goebbels was horrified by hitler s characterisation of socialism as a jewish creation and his assertion that a nazi government would not expropriate private property he wrote in his diary i no longer fully believe in hitler that s terrible thing my inner support has been taken away after reading hitler s book mein kampf goebbels found himself agreeing with hitler s assertion of a jewish doctrine of marxism in february 1926 goebbels gave a speech titled lenin or hitler in which he asserted that communism or marxism could not save german people but he believed it would cause a socialist nationalist state to arise in russia in 1926 goebbels published a pamphlet titled nazi which attempted to explain how national socialism differed from marxism in hopes of winning over opposition hitler arranged meetings in munich with three greater ruhr gau leaders including goebbels goebbels was impressed when hitler sent his own car to meet them at railway station that evening hitler and goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally following day hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to three men encouraging them to put their differences behind them goebbels capitulated completely offering hitler his total loyalty he wrote in his diary i love him he has thought through everything such a sparkling mind can be my leader i bow to greater one political genius he later wrote adolf hitler i love you because you are both great and simple at same time what one calls a genius as a result of bamberg and munich meetings strasser s new draft of party programme was discarded original national socialist program of 1920 was retained unchanged and hitler s position as party leader was greatly strengthened propagandist in berlin at hitler s invitation goebbels spoke at party meetings in munich and at annual party congress held in weimar in 1926 for following year s event goebbels was involved in planning for first time he and hitler arranged for rally to be filmed receiving praise for doing well at these events led goebbels to shape his political ideas to match hitler s and to admire and him even more gauleiter goebbels was first offered position of party gauleiter for berlin section in august 1926 he travelled to berlin in mid september and by middle of october accepted position thus hitler s plan to divide and dissolve northwestern gauleiters group that goebbels had served in under strasser was successful hitler gave goebbels great authority over area allowing him to determine course for organisation and leadership for gau goebbels was given control over local sturmabteilung sa and schutzstaffel ss and answered

began charging admission to party meetings aware of value of publicity both positive and negative he deliberately provoked beer hall battles and street brawls including violent attacks on communist party of germany goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to political sphere including use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues his new ideas for poster design included using large type red ink and cryptic headers that encouraged reader to examine fine print to determine meaning like hitler goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing and venues were decorated with party banners his entrance almost always late was timed for maximum emotional impact goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time using pre planned and choreographed inflection and gestures but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience he used loudspeakers decorative flames uniforms and marches to attract attention to speeches goebbels tactic of using provocation to bring attention to nsdap along with violence at public party meetings and demonstrations led berlin police to ban nsdap from city on 5 may 1927 violent incidents continued including young nazis randomly attacking jews in streets goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until end of october during this period he founded newspaper der angriff attack as a propaganda vehicle for berlin area where few supported party it was a modern style newspaper with an aggressive tone 126 libel suits were pending against goebbels at one point to his disappointment circulation was initially only 2 000 material in paper was highly anti communist and antisemitic among paper s favourite targets was jewish deputy chief of berlin police bernhard weiss goebbels gave him derogatory nickname isidore and subjected him to a relentless campaign of jew baiting in hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit goebbels continued to try to break into literary world with a revised version of his book michael finally being published and unsuccessful production of two of his plays der wanderer and die saat seed latter was his final attempt at playwriting during this period in berlin he had relationships with many women including his old flame anka stalherm who was now married and had a small child he was quick to fall in love but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new he worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career 1928 election ban on nsdap was lifted before reichstag elections on 20 may 1928 nsdap lost nearly 100 000 voters and earned only 2 6 per cent of vote nationwide results in berlin were even worse where they attained only 1 4 per cent of vote goebbels was one of 12 nsdap members to gain election to reichstag this gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges including a three week jail sentence he received in april for insulting deputy police chief weiss reichstag changed immunity regulations in february 1931 and goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in der angriff over course of previous year in his newspaper berliner berlin workers newspaper gregor strasser was highly critical of goebbels failure to attract urban vote however party as a whole did much better in rural areas attracting as much as 18 per cent of vote in some regions this was partly because hitler had publicly stated just prior to election that point 17 of party programme which mandated expropriation of land without compensation would apply only to jewish speculators and not private landholders after election party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in agricultural sector in may shortly after election hitler considered appointing goebbels as party propaganda chief but he hesitated as he worried that removal of gregor strasser from post would lead to a split in party goebbels considered himself well suited to position and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and media thumb upright goebbels used death of horst wessel pictured in 1930 as a propaganda tool against communist subhumans by 1930 berlin was party s second strongest base of support after munich that year violence between nazis and communists led to local sa troop leader horst wessel being shot by two members of communist party of germany he later died in hospital exploiting wessel s death goebbels turned him into a martyr for nazi movement he officially declared wessel s march die fahne hoch raise flag renamed as horst wessel lied to be nsdap anthem great depression great depression greatly impacted germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment during this time strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in berlin nationaler sozialist like their other publications it conveyed brothers own brand of nazism including nationalism anti capitalism social reform and anti goebbels complained vehemently about rival strasser newspapers to hitler and admitted that their success was causing his own berlin newspapers to be pushed to wall in late april 1930 hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to gregor strasser and appointed goebbels to replace him as reich leader of nsdap propaganda one of goebbels first acts was to ban evening edition of nationaler sozialist goebbels was also given control of other nazi papers across country including party s national newspaper volkischer beobachter people s observer he still had to wait until 3 july for otto strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving nsdap upon receiving news goebbels was relieved crisis with was finally over and glad that otto strasser had lost all power rapid deterioration of economy led to resignation on 27 march 1930 of coalition government that had been elected in 1928 a new cabinet was formed and paul von hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees he appointed heinrich bruning as chancellor goebbels took charge of nsdap s national campaign for reichstag elections called for 14 september 1930 campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over country hitler s speeches focused on blaming country s economic woes on weimar republic particularly its adherence to terms of treaty of versailles which required war reparations that had proven devastating to german economy he proposed a new german society based on race and national unity resulting success took even hitler and goebbels by surprise party received 6 5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in reichstag making it second largest party in country thumb upright left goebbels and his daughter helga with adolf hitler in late 1930 goebbels met magda quandt a divorcee who had joined party a few months earlier she worked as a volunteer in party offices in berlin helping goebbels organise his private papers her flat on soon became a favourite meeting place for hitler and other nsdap officials goebbels and quandt married on 19 december 1931 for two further elections held in 1932 goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies parades speeches and hitler travelling around country by aeroplane with slogan fuhrer over germany goebbels wrote in his diary that nazis must gain power and exterminate marxism he undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets goebbels was also involved in production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium many of goebbels campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as international high finance his propaganda characterised opposition as november criminals jewish wire pullers or a communist threat support for party continued to grow but neither of these elections led to a majority government in an effort to stabilise country and improve economic conditions hindenburg appointed hitler as reich chancellor on 30 january 1933 propaganda minister to celebrate hitler s appointment as chancellor goebbels organised a torchlight parade in berlin on night of 30 january of an estimated 60 000 men many in uniforms of sa and ss spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast with commentary by longtime party member and future minister of aviation hermann goring goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in hitler s new cabinet bernhard rust was appointed as minister of culture post that goebbels was expecting to receive like other nsdap officials goebbels had to deal with hitler s leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped in this way hitler fostered distrust competition and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power nsdap took advantage of reichstag fire of 27 february 1933 with hindenburg passing reichstag fire decree following day at hitler s urging this was first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship headed by hitler in its place on 5 march yet another reichstag election took place last to be held before defeat of nazis at end of second world war while nsdap increased their number of seats and percentage of vote it was not landslide expected by party leadership goebbels finally received

ministry which set up its offices in 18th century across from reich chancellery was to centralise nazi control of all aspects of german cultural and intellectual life goebbels hoped to increase popular support of party from 37 per cent achieved at last free election held in germany on 25 march 1933 to 100 per cent support an unstated goal was to present to other nations impression that nsdap had full and enthusiastic backing of entire population one of goebbels first productions was staging day of potsdam a ceremonial passing of power from hindenburg to hitler held in potsdam on 21 march he composed text of hitler s decree authorising nazi boycott of jewish businesses held on 1 april later that month goebbels travelled back to rheydt where he was given a triumphal reception townsfolk

restoration of professional civil service passed on 7 april 1933 forced all non aryans to retire from legal profession and civil service similar legislation soon deprived jewish members of other professions of their right to practise first nazi concentration camps initially created to house political dissenters were founded shortly after hitler seized power in a process termed co ordination nsdap proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of party all civilian organisations including agricultural groups volunteer organisations and sports clubs had their leadership replaced with nazi sympathisers or party members by june 1933 virtually only organisations not in control of nsdap were army and churches in a move to manipulate germany s middle class and shape

and chancellor workings of ministry propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments administration and legal mass rallies public health youth and race radio national and foreign press films and film censorship art music and theatre and protection against counter propaganda both foreign and domestic goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable he would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public goebbels was successful at his job however life wrote in 1938 that p he likes nobody is liked by nobody and runs most efficient nazi department john gunther wrote in 1940 that goebbels is cleverest of all nazis but could not succeed hitler because everybody hates him reich film chamber which all members of film industry were required to join was created in june 1933 goebbels promoted development of films with a nazi slant and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages under auspices of reich chamber of culture created in september goebbels added additional sub chambers for fields of broadcasting fine arts literature music press and theatre as in film industry anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of corresponding chamber in this way anyone whose views were contrary to regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced in addition journalists now considered employees of state were required to prove aryan descent back to year 1800 and if married same requirement applied to spouse members of any chamber were not allowed to leave country for their work without prior permission of their chamber a committee was established to censor books and works could not be re published unless they were on list of approved works similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment even cabaret performances were censored many german artists and intellectuals left germany in pre war years rather than work under these restrictions thumb free radios were distributed in berlin on goebbels birthday in 1938 thumb upright 0 9 hitler was focal point at 1934 nuremberg rally leni riefenstahl and her crew are visible in front of podium goebbels was particularly interested in controlling radio which was then still a fairly new mass medium sometimes under protest from individual states particularly prussia headed by goring goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide and placed them under reichs rundfunk gesellschaft german national broadcasting corporation in july 1934 manufacturers were urged by goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers called people s receiver and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold loudspeakers were placed in public areas factories and schools so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all germans on 2 september 1939 day after start of war goebbels and council of ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in death penalty albert speer hitler s architect and later minister for armaments and war production later said regime made complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country through technical devices like radio and loudspeaker 80 million people were deprived of independent thought a major focus of nazi propaganda was hitler himself who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became focus of a cult of personality much of this was spontaneous but some was stage managed as part of goebbels propaganda work adulation of hitler was focus of 1934 nuremberg rally where his moves were carefully choreographed rally was subject of film triumph of will one of several nazi propaganda films directed by leni riefenstahl it won gold medal at 1935 venice film festival at 1935 nazi party congress rally at nuremberg goebbels declared that bolshevism is declaration of war by jewish led international subhumans against culture itself goebbels was involved in planning staging of 1936 summer olympics held in berlin it was around this time that he met and started having an affair with actress lida baarova whom he continued to see until 1938 a major project in 1937 was degenerate art exhibition organised by goebbels which ran in munich from july to november exhibition proved wildly popular attracting over two million visitors a degenerate music exhibition took place following year meanwhile goebbels was disappointed by lack of quality in national socialist artwork films and literature church struggle in 1933 hitler signed reichskonkordat reich concordat a treaty with vatican that required regime to honour independence of catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics however regime continued to target christian churches and to try to weaken their influence throughout 1935 and 1936 hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences goebbels widely publicised trials in his propaganda campaigns showing cases in worst possible light restrictions were placed on public meetings and catholic publications faced censorship catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings hitler often vacillated on whether or not kirchenkampf church struggle should be a priority but his frequent inflammatory comments on issue were enough to convince goebbels to intensify his work on issue in february 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate protestant church in response to persecution pope pius xi had mit sorge with burning concern encyclical smuggled into germany for passion sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit it denounced systematic hostility of regime toward church in response goebbels renewed regime s crackdown and propaganda against catholics his speech of 28 may in berlin in front of 20 000 party members which was also broadcast on radio attacked catholic church as morally corrupt as a result of propaganda campaign enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities harassment and threats of imprisonment led clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of regime partly out of foreign policy concerns hitler ordered a scaling back of church struggle by end of july 1937 world war ii as early as february 1933 hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken albeit clandestinely at first as to do so was in violation of versailles treaty a year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was target date for going to war in east goebbels was one of most enthusiastic supporters of hitler aggressively pursuing germany s expansionist policies sooner rather than later at time of reoccupation of rhineland in 1936 goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary n ow is time for action fortune favors brave he who dares nothing wins nothing in lead up to sudetenland crisis in 1938 goebbels took initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for sudeten germans while campaigning against czech government still goebbels was well aware there was a growing war panic in germany and so by july had press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity after western powers acceded to hitler s demands concerning czechoslovakia in 1938 goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against poland from may onwards he orchestrated a campaign against poland fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic germans in danzig and other cities even so he was unable to persuade majority of germans to welcome prospect of war he privately held doubts about wisdom of risking a protracted war against britain and france by attacking poland after invasion of poland in 1939 goebbels used his propaganda ministry and reich chambers to control access to information domestically to his chagrin his rival joachim von ribbentrop minister for foreign affairs continually challenged goebbels jurisdiction over dissemination of international propaganda hitler declined to make a firm ruling on subject so two men remained rivals for remainder of nazi era goebbels did not participate in military decision making process nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after fact thumb left upright production of a newsreel at front lines january 1941 propaganda ministry took over broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender and began broadcasting prepared material using existing announcers as a way to gain trust of citizens most aspects of media both domestically and in conquered countries were controlled by goebbels and his department german home service armed forces programme and german european service were all rigorously controlled in everything from information they were permitted to disseminate to music they were allowed to play party rallies speeches and demonstrations continued speeches were broadcast on radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1 500 mobile film vans hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as war progressed so goebbels increasingly became voice of nazi regime for german people from may 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in das reich which were later read aloud over radio he found films to be his most effective propaganda medium after radio at his insistence initially half films made in wartime germany were propaganda films particularly on antisemitism and war propaganda films recounting both historical wars and current exploits of wehrmacht goebbels became preoccupied with morale and efforts of people on home front he believed that more people at home were involved in war effort better their morale would be for example he initiated a programme for collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on eastern front at same time goebbels implemented changes to have more entertaining material in radio and film produced for public decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment as gauleiter of berlin goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing as well as need to ration beer and tobacco which were important for morale hitler suggested watering beer and degrading quality of cigarettes so that more could be produced but goebbels refused saying cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse through his propaganda campaigns he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among public about military situation neither too optimistic nor too grim series of military setbacks germans suffered in this period thousand bomber raid on cologne may 1942 allied victory at second battle of el alamein november 1942 and especially catastrophic defeat at battle of stalingrad february 1943 were difficult matters to present to german public who were increasingly weary of war and sceptical that it could be won on 15 january 1943 hitler appointed goebbels as head of newly created air raid damage committee which meant goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as assessment and repair of damaged buildings in actuality defence of areas other than berlin remained in hands of local gauleiters and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale by early 1943 war produced a labour crisis for regime hitler created a three man committee with representatives of state army and party in an attempt to centralise control of war economy committee members were hans lammers head of reich chancellery field marshal wilhelm keitel chief of oberkommando der wehrmacht armed forces high command okw and martin bormann who controlled party committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of wishes of various ministries with hitler reserving most final decisions to himself committee soon known as dreierausschuss committee of three met eleven times between january and august 1943 however they ran up against resistance from hitler s cabinet ministers who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from committee seeing it as a threat to their power goebbels goring and speer worked together to bring it down result was that nothing changed and committee of three declined into irrelevance by september 1943 thumb upright 1 4 sportpalast speech 18 february 1943 banner says krieg krieg total war shortest war partly in response to being excluded from committee of three goebbels pressured hitler to introduce measures that would produce total war including closing businesses not essential to war effort conscripting women into labour force and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into wehrmacht some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 january but to goebbels dismay goring demanded that his favourite restaurants in berlin should remain open and lammers successfully lobbied hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription even if they had child care available after receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 january 1943 on topic goebbels believed he had support of german people in his call for total war his next speech sportpalast speech of 18 february 1943 was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war which he presented as only way to stop bolshevik onslaught and save german people from destruction speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at extermination of jewish people that was already underway speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well during live version of speech goebbels accidentally begins to mention extermination of jews this is omitted in published text of speech goebbels efforts had little impact for time being as while hitler was in principle in favour of total war he was not prepared to implement changes over objections of his

right 9 march 1945 goebbels awards 16 year old hitler youth willi hubner iron cross for defence of lauban after allied invasion of sicily july 1943 and strategic soviet victory in battle of kursk july august 1943 goebbels began to recognise that war could no longer be won following allied invasion of italy and fall of mussolini in september he raised with hitler possibility of a separate peace either with soviets or with britain hitler rejected both of these proposals as germany s military and economic situation grew steadily worse on 25 august 1943 reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler took over post of interior minister replacing wilhelm frick intensive air raids on berlin and other cities took lives of thousands of people goring s luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on london in early 1944 but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact while goebbels propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in offing v 1 flying bombs launched on british targets beginning in mid june 1944 had little effect with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets to boost morale goebbels continued to publish propaganda to effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on outcome of war meanwhile in normandy landings of 6 june 1944 allies successfully gained a foothold in france throughout july 1944 goebbels and speer continued to press hitler to bring economy to a total war footing 20 july plot where hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in east prussia played into hands of those who had been pushing for change bormann goebbels himmler and speer over objections of goring goebbels was appointed on 23 july as reich plenipotentiary for total war charged with maximising manpower for wehrmacht and armaments industry at expense of sectors of economy not critical to war effort through these efforts he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service however as many of these new recruits came from armaments industry move put him in conflict with armaments minister speer untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into armaments industry and likewise new wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained at hitler s behest volkssturm people s storm a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service was formed on 18 october 1944 goebbels recorded in his diary that 100 000 recruits were sworn in from his gau alone however men mostly age 45 to 60 received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed goebbels notion that these men could effectively serve on front lines against soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best programme was deeply unpopular defeat and death in last months of war goebbels speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone by beginning of 1945 with soviets on oder river and western allies preparing to cross rhine river he could no longer disguise fact that defeat was inevitable berlin had little in way of fortifications or artillery and even volkssturm units were in short supply as almost everything and everyone had been sent to front goebbels noted in his diary on 21 january that millions of germans were fleeing westward he tentatively discussed with hitler issue of making peace overtures to western allies but hitler again refused privately goebbels was conflicted at pushing case with hitler since he did not want to lose confidence of his fuhrer when other nazi leaders urged hitler to leave berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in national redoubt in bavaria goebbels opposed this arguing for a heroic last stand in berlin his family except for magda s son harald who had served in luftwaffe and been captured by allies moved into their house in berlin to await end he and magda may have discussed suicide and fate of their young children in a long meeting on night of 27 january he knew how outside world would view criminal acts committed by regime and had no desire to subject himself to debacle of a trial he burned his private papers on night of 18 april goebbels knew how to play on hitler s fantasies encouraging him to see hand of providence in death of united states president franklin d roosevelt on 12 april whether hitler really saw this event as a turning point as goebbels proclaimed is not known by this time goebbels had gained position he had wanted so long at side of hitler goring was utterly discredited although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 april himmler whose appointment as commander of army group vistula had led to disaster on oder was also in disgrace with hitler most of hitler s inner circle including goring himmler ribbentrop and speer prepared to leave berlin immediately after hitler s birthday celebration on 20 april even bormann was not anxious to meet his end at hitler s side on 22 april hitler announced that he would stay in berlin until end and then shoot himself goebbels moved with his family into vorbunker connected to lower fuhrerbunker under reich chancellery garden in central berlin that same day he told vice admiral hans erich voss that he would not entertain idea of either surrender or escape on 23 april goebbels made following proclamation to people of berlin after midnight on 29 april with soviets advancing ever closer to bunker complex hitler married eva braun in a small civil ceremony within fuhrerbunker afterwards hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife hitler then took secretary traudl junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament goebbels and bormann were two of witnesses in his last will and testament hitler named no successor as fuhrer or leader of nazi party instead he appointed goebbels as reich chancellor grand admiral karl donitz who was at flensburg near danish border as reich president and bormann as party minister goebbels wrote a postscript to will stating that he would categorically refuse to obey hitler s order to leave berlin as he put it first time in my life that he had not complied with hitler s orders he felt compelled to remain with hitler for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty further his wife and children would be staying as well they would end their lives side by side with fuhrer in mid afternoon of 30 april hitler shot himself goebbels was depressed and stated that he would walk around chancellery garden until he was killed by russian shelling voss later recounted goebbels as saying it is a great pity that such a man hitler is not with us any longer but there is nothing to be done for us everything is lost now and only way out left for us is one which hitler chose i shall follow his example on 1 may goebbels completed his sole official act as chancellor he dictated a letter to general vasily chuikov and ordered german general hans krebs to deliver it under a white flag chuikov as commander of soviet 8th guards army commanded soviet forces in central berlin goebbels letter informed chuikov of hitler s death and requested a ceasefire after this was rejected goebbels decided that further efforts were futile thumb goebbels family in this vintage manipulated image goebbels stepson harald quandt who was absent due to military duty was added to group portrait later on 1 may vice admiral voss saw goebbels for last time while saying goodbye i asked goebbels to join us but he replied captain must not leave his sinking ship i have thought about it all and decided to stay here i have nowhere to go because with little children i will not be able to make it especially with a leg like mine on evening of 1 may goebbels arranged for an ss dentist helmut kunz to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths according to kunz s later testimony he gave children morphine injections but it was magda goebbels and ss obersturmbannfuhrer ludwig stumpfegger hitler s personal doctor who administered cyanide at around 20 30 goebbels and magda left bunker and walked up to garden of chancellery where they committed suicide there are several different accounts of this event one account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where hitler had been buried and were given a coup de grace immediately afterwards goebbels ss adjutant gunther schwagermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up stairs and out into chancellery garden he waited in stairwell and heard shots sound schwagermann then walked up remaining stairs and once outside saw their lifeless bodies following goebbels prior order schwagermann had an ss soldier fire several shots into goebbels body which did not move bodies were then doused with petrol but they were only partially burned and not buried a few days later voss was brought back to bunker by soviets to identify partly burned bodies of joseph and magda goebbels and their children remains of goebbels family hitler braun general krebs and hitler s dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed last burial was at smersh facility in magdeburg on 21 february 1946 in 1970 kgb director yuri andropov authorised an operation to destroy remains on 4 april 1970 a soviet kgb team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at magdeburg smersh facility those were burned crushed and scattered into biederitz river a tributary of nearby elbe antisemitism and holocaust thumb a ruined synagogue in munich after kristallnacht goebbels was antisemitic from a young age after joining nsdap and meeting hitler his antisemitism grew and became more radical he began to see jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on german society after nazis seized power he repeatedly urged hitler to take action against jews despite his extreme antisemitism goebbels spoke of rubbish of race materialism and of of biological racism for nazi ideology he also described himmler s ideology as in many regards mad and thought alfred rosenberg s theories were ridiculous nazi party s goal was to remove jews from german cultural and economic life and eventually to remove them from country altogether in addition to his propaganda efforts goebbels actively promoted persecution of jews through pogroms legislation and other actions discriminatory measures he instituted in berlin in early years of regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that jewish shops be marked as such in november 1938 german diplomat ernst vom rath was killed in paris by a young jewish man in response goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by press and result was start of a pogrom jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over germany situation was further inflamed by a speech goebbels gave at a party meeting on night of 8 november where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by german people at least a hundred jews were killed several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed and thousands of jewish shops were vandalised in an event called kristallnacht night of broken glass around 30 000 jewish men were sent to concentration camps destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 november where goring pointed out that destruction of jewish property was in effect destruction of german property since intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated goebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in hitler s 30 january 1939 reichstag speech which goebbels helped to write thumb upright goebbels ordered all german jews to wear an identifying yellow badge while goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of berlin jews since 1935 there were still 62 000 living in city in 1940 part of delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in armaments industry deportations of german jews began in october 1941 with first transport from berlin leaving on 18 october some jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as riga and kaunas in preparation for deportations goebbels ordered that all german jews were required by law to wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 september 1941 on 6 march 1942 goebbels received a copy of minutes of wannsee conference document made nazi policy clear jewish population of europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of poland and killed his diary entries of period show that he was well aware of fate of jews in general it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated while only 40 per cent can be put to work a judgment is being carried out on jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved he wrote on 27 march 1942 goebbels had frequent discussions with hitler about fate of jews a subject they discussed almost every time they met he was aware throughout that jews were being exterminated and completely supported this decision he was one of few top nazi officials to do so publicly family life thumb upright post reconciliation photo commissioned by hitler 1938 hitler was very fond of magda goebbels and children he enjoyed staying at goebbels berlin apartment where he could relax magda had a close relationship with hitler and became a member of his small coterie of female friends she also became an unofficial representative of regime receiving letters from all over germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues in 1936 goebbels met czech actress lida baarova and by winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her magda had a long conversation with hitler about it on 15 august 1938 unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers hitler demanded that goebbels break off relationship thereafter joseph and magda seemed to reach a truce until end of september couple had another falling out at that point and once again hitler became involved insisting couple stay together hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with reconciled couple in october magda too had affairs including a relationship with kurt in 1933 and karl hanke in 1938 goebbels family included harald quandt magda s son from her first marriage born 1921 plus helga 1932 hilde 1934 helmuth 1935 holde 1937 hedda 1938 and heide 1940 harald was only member of family to survive war see also glossary of nazi germany
