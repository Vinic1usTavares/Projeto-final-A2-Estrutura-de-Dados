goo is sixth studio album by american alternative rock band sonic youth released on june 26 1990 by dgc records for this album band sought to expand upon its trademark alternating guitar arrangements and layered sound of their previous album daydream nation 1988 band s songwriting on goo is more topical than past works exploring themes of female empowerment and pop culture coming off success of daydream nation nick sansano returned to engineer goo but veteran producer ron saint germain was chosen by sonic youth to finish mixing album following sansano s dismissal goo was a critical and commercial success upon its release peaking at number 96 on us billboard 200 their highest chart position to date although it lacked significant radio airplay its lead single kool thing a collaborative effort with public enemy s chuck d reached number seven on billboard modern rock tracks chart since then goo has been viewed as one of alternative rock s most important albums and is considered musically and artistically significant background in 1989 nearly a year after release of band s breakthrough album daydream nation sonic youth announced that it had signed a recording contract with geffen records group s first major label deal sonic youth decided to sever relations with its former label enigma records as a result of band s displeasure with enigma s indecisive marketing and distribution of daydream nation as well as teen age riot album s accompanying single another factor that contributed to group s departure from label was enigma s handling of whitey album an experimental album of sound manipulation and hip hop influences released under name ciccone youth not only did enigma reject band s proposal to simultaneously release album with daydream nation label s publicity branch also attempted to withdraw its cover art an enlarged photo of madonna s face even though madonna reportedly gave sonic youth her permission to use it by mid 1989 sonic youth s relationship with its british and american label head paul smith who band s legal counsel richard termed a trusted advisor but never a manager was growing increasingly strained tensions between smith and group had begun in 1986 when smith arranged release of live recordings by band on album walls have ears without their input mindful about their work and image sonic youth was irritated by decision especially when album was distributed before evol situation was compounded further when smith took a bold negotiating stance with major record labels during daydream nation tour and took long intervals to communicate information to band his stance which had potential to scare away record executives represented final straw for band on june 2 1989 sonic youth went to smith s apartment ostensibly to discuss another music video for daydream nation to announce an end to their partnership having entertained offers from a m records atlantic records and mute records sonic youth signed a five album deal worth 300 000 with a clause which secured band s complete control of its creative output group however was somewhat dissatisfied that album would not be released by geffen but rather a new and subsidiary label dgc records recording in november 1989 sonic youth accompanied by producers don fleming and j mascis recorded demos of eight songs at waterworks a studio run by jim waters in meat packing district of new york city lee ranaldo recalled kim gordon and thurston moore were keen on inviting fleming and mascis both as extended family and as people to have an opinion both ranaldo and steve shelley were uncomfortable about their presence because we d never made records before where there were other people involved original working title for album was blowjob mostly to test humor of their new label but ultimately band was convinced to drop name in favor of goo a title inspired by one of album s tracks my friend goo because results of these sessions were later heavily bootlegged moore officially released them on album goo demos in 1991 at engineer nick sansano s recommendation with a sizable budget finally at their disposal sonic youth booked themselves into sorcerer sound in early 1990 sansano knew well from his work on daydream nation that band particular ranaldo enjoyed overdubbing sound and guitar effects at sorcerer sound studio was equipped with two 24 track consoles allowing group as many instrumentals as they desired sonic youth used studio time to experiment with abstract techniques such as hanging microphones from sorcerer sound s catwalk and isolating shelley in a drum booth early on however band was bogged down by issues it took us forever to get final takes said ranaldo something would inevitably go wrong for somebody and we d have to start again i remember getting fairly frustrated with it after basic tracks were completed sonic youth moved to greene st recording sansano s home base to finalize songs and begin process of mixing goo additional layers of guitar lines were included vocals were manipulated with different distortion devices particularly on mary christ also in studio again were mascis and fleming to serve as consultants mascis for album s vocal parts and fleming for percussion sounds fleming felt gordon s vocals with her unconventional timbre were a particular pleasure to record noting her eagerness to attempt different approaches with her delivery during sessions sansano however was unsure of album s direction each member of sonic youth brought their own philosophy to arranging music that conflicted with label owner s expectations for a radio friendly album although gary gersh one of geffen s managers denies that geffen placed any pressures on sonic youth to produce a commercial album upon listening to first mixes from sessions both gersh and band were concerned about sansano s abilities to finish goo and insisted on hiring a veteran producer group chose jazz musician turned producer ron saint germain to arrange final mixes sansano voluntarily left project but was so dejected by group s lack of faith that he refused to speak to them years afterwards with germain band gave him relatively free rein to sort through countless overdubs that sonic youth had worked on before his entry into project he already had an extensive resume including his work in jazz community and bad brains highly influential album i against i by time goo was complete its costs rose to 150 000 us five times as much as daydream nation figure was staggering for a cost conscious band according to shelley sonic youth would have been better served releasing original goo demos to reduce final costs music goo expanded upon alt rock stylings of daydream nation with far more deliberate pop culture references another development within band at time was gordon s importance as both a lead vocalist and songwriter gordon contributed two songs tunic song for karen and kool thing that challenged expectations of a woman s role in american society tunic song for karen an exploration into self esteem and body image traces karen carpenter s struggle with anorexia nervosa to her mother s comment that she appeared overweight onstage and music industry s rejection of her proposed 1980 solo album band biographer stevie chick described gordon s lyrics as coloured by a suffocating almost gothic sadness and melancholy perhaps similar to that which underscores carpenters own music a second gordon composition kool thing was inspired by her 1989 interview with ll cool j although gordon was a long time fan of hip hop artist and credited his album radio with drawing her to rap ll cool j s inattention to punk music and misogynistic viewpoints towards women disenchanted gordon in her anthology book here she comes now women in music who have changed our lives elissa wrote that gordon transformed experience into a sharp and witty social critique of gender race and power that you could dance to gordon s tongue in cheek response to meeting kool thing poked fun at her own left wing political beliefs as well as her fascination with black panther party although ll cool j himself is not mentioned in song his works i can t live without my radio going back to cali and walking with a panther were referenced chuck d of public enemy who was at greene street to record fear of a black planet contributed to call and response middle section production s musique concrete influenced approach reflected sonic youth s inclination to record sound collages that feature varying rhythms and overdubbing mildred pierce and scooter jinx were worked out from methods that involved band members reconfiguring and different types of sound in studio deriving from eight minute demo blowjob angst driven mildred pierce was inspired by 1945 noir film of same name alec foerge observed song as band s reaction against what had become a frustratingly overwrought process featuring nothing more than a three chord vamp and moore repeatedly shouting mildred pierce still as foerge described it is an example of sonic youth s progression from primitive nature of confusion is sex and kill yr idols at one point in recording sessions moore s amplifier overheated and exploded emitting a high screeching sound band nonetheless fascinated by results reappropriated sound for all of scooter jinx release and reception goo was released by dgc records on june 26 1990 album s front cover design was created by raymond pettibon who was responsible for early covers for black flag instead of his original joan crawford sketch sonic youth chose another pettibon design an illustration of two sunglasses wearing british mods based on a photograph of two witnesses in moors murders trial although geffen pushed for a mainstream market label also was concerned about alienating sonic youth s original fan base this prompted geffen executive mark kates to attempt grassroots promotional tactics in promoting goo kates arranged for band to visit college radio stations and music journalists weeks leading up to album s release controversy surrounding album s content and exposure from single kool thing helped goo exceed expectations of group s label by december 1990 goo had sold over 200 000 copies and ultimately peaked at no 96 on billboard 200 band s highest charting album to date although it was difficult for geffen to transition sonic youth over to pop radio kool thing made it onto buzz bin s regular rotation schedule and became their most popular song on alternative radio reaching no 7 on billboard modern rock tracks album contributed to alternative music s commercial breakthrough at beginning of 1990s despite its limited radio airplay goo received rave reviews from contemporary critics in an august 1990 article rolling stones david fricke viewed record as sonic youth s most accessible work to date he believed goo was a brilliant extended essay in refined primitivism that deftly reconciles rock s structural conventions with band s twin passions for violent tonal elasticity and garage punk holocaust jonathan gold of los angeles times hailed sonic youth as rolling stones of noise music and found band s distorted guitars danceable rhythms and catchy choruses fit for radio airplay select writer russell brown felt that album bursts with a sense of unexpected and praised it as bitchin good art since goo was first released it has been viewed as one of greatest and most important alternative rock records of all time as well as a culturally significant work alec foerge cited it as radical even defiant by 1990 major label standards while david browne said album s success was an indication that an audience for this music was coalescing albeit slowly daisy jones of dazed found album powerfully relevant to american youth it sprung out of 1990 year in which grunge had spread like an itch amongst a generation increasingly disillusioned with mock metal and stadium theatrics of artists like guns n roses and alice cooper writing for tidal jakob matzen said that because goo was sonic youth s most approachable album it is a crucial piece of puzzle to understand how and why other alternative artists like nirvana were able to bring underground to mainstream and challenge dominant music industry hegemony track listing personnel note source for this section is as
