when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d is a long poem in form of an elegy written by american poet walt whitman 1819 1892 in 1865 poem written in free verse in 206 lines uses many of literary techniques associated with pastoral elegy it was written in summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning in aftermath of assassination of president abraham lincoln on april 14 1865 despite poem being an elegy to fallen president whitman neither mentions lincoln by name nor discusses circumstances of his death instead whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including symbols of lilacs a drooping star in western sky venus and hermit thrush and employs traditional progression of pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death poem also addresses pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing american civil war 1861 1865 which ended only days before assassination when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d was written ten years after publishing first edition of leaves of grass 1855 and it reflects a maturing of whitman s poetic vision from a drama of identity and romantic exuberance that has been tempered by his emotional experience of american civil war whitman included poem as part of a quickly written sequel to a collection of poems addressing war that was being printed at time of lincoln s death these poems collected under title drum taps and sequel to drum taps range in emotional context from excitement to woe from distant observation to engagement from belief to resignation and more concerned with history than self more aware of precariousness of america s present and future than of its expansive promise first published in autumn 1865 when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d along with 42 other poems from drum taps and sequel to drum taps was absorbed into leaves of grass beginning with fourth edition published in 1867 although whitman did not consider poem to be among his best works it is compared in both effect and quality to several acclaimed works of english literature including elegies such as john 1637 and percy bysshe shelleys adonais 1821 writing history and background thumb right common lilac vulgaris in late 1850s and early 1860s whitman established his reputation as a poet with release of leaves of grass whitman intended to write a distinctly american epic and developed a free verse style inspired by cadences of king james bible small volume first released in 1855 was considered controversial by some with critics attacking whitman s verse as obscene however it attracted praise from american transcendentalist essayist lecturer and poet ralph waldo emerson which contributed to fostering significant interest in whitman s work at start of american civil war whitman moved from new york to washington d c where he obtained work in a series of government offices first with army paymaster s office and later with bureau of indian affairs he volunteered in army hospitals as a hospital missionary his wartime experiences informed his poetry which matured into reflections on death and youth brutality of war patriotism and offered stark images and vignettes of war whitman s brother george washington whitman had been taken prisoner in virginia on september 30 1864 and was held for five months in libby prison a confederate prisoner of war camp near richmond virginia on february 24 1865 george was granted a furlough to return home because of his poor health and whitman had travelled to his mother s home in new york to visit his brother while visiting brooklyn whitman contracted to have his collection of civil war poems drum taps published civil war had ended and a few days later on april 14 1865 president abraham lincoln was shot by john wilkes booth while attending performance of a play at ford s theatre lincoln died following morning whitman was at his mother s home when he heard news of president s death in his grief he stepped outside door to yard where lilacs were blooming many years later whitman recalled weather and conditions on day that lincoln died in specimen days where he wrote lincoln was first american president to be assassinated and his death had a long lasting emotional impact upon united states over three weeks after his death millions of americans participated in a nationwide public pageant of grief including a state funeral and 1 700 mile 2 700 km westward journey of funeral train from washington through new york to springfield illinois lincoln s public funeral in washington was held on april 19 1865 some biographies indicate that whitman journeyed to washington to attend funeral and possibly observed lincoln s body during viewing held in east room of white house whitman biographer jerome loving believes that whitman did not attend public ceremonies for lincoln in washington as he did not leave brooklyn for nation s capital until april 21 likewise whitman could not have attended ceremonies held in new york after arrival of funeral train as they were observed on april 24 loving thus suggests that whitman s descriptions of funeral procession public events and long train journey may have been based on second hand information he does accede that whitman in his journey from new york to washington may have passed lincoln funeral train on its way to new york possibly in harrisburg pennsylvania whitman

whitman revised his collection leaves of grass throughout his life and each additional edition included newer works his previously published poems often with revisions or minor emendations and reordering of sequence of poems first edition 1855 was a small pamphlet of twelve poems at his death four decades later collection included over 400 poems for fourth edition 1867 in which when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d had first been included leaves of grass had been expanded to a collection of 236 poems however university of nebraska literature professor kenneth price and university of iowa english professor ed folsom describe 1867 edition as most carelessly printed and most chaotic of all editions citing errata and conflicts with price and folsom note that book had five different formats some including drum taps poems some without when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d and his other three lincoln poems o captain my captain hush d be camps to day this dust was once man 1871 were included in subsequent editions of leaves of grass although in whitman s 1871 and 1881 editions it was separated from drum taps in 1871 edition whitman s four lincoln poems were listed as a cluster titled president lincoln s burial hymn in 1881 edition this cluster was renamed memories of president lincoln whitman considered 1881 edition to be final although subsequent deathbed edition compiled

dooryard bloom d is a first person monologue written in free verse it is a long poem 206 lines in length 207 according to some sources that is cited as a prominent example of elegy form and of narrative poetry in its final form published in 1881 and republished to present poem is divided into sixteen sections referred to as cantos or strophes that range in length from 5 or 6 lines to as many as 53 lines poem does not possess a consistent metrical pattern and length of each line varies from seven syllables to as many as twenty syllables literary scholar kathy rugoff says that poem has a broad scope and incorporates a strongly characterized speaker a complex narrative action and an array of highly lyrical images first version of when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d that appeared in 1865 was arranged into 21 strophes it was included with this structure in fourth edition of leaves of grass that was published in 1867 by 1871 whitman had combined strophes numbered 19 and 20 into one and poem had 20 in total however for seventh edition 1881 of leaves of grass poem s final seven strophes of his original text were combined into final three strophes of 16 strophe poem that is familiar to readers today for 1881 edition original strophes numbered 14 15 and 16 were combined into revised 14th strophe strophes numbered 17 and 18 were combined into revised 15th strophe material from former strophes numbered 19 20 and 21 in 1865 were combined for revised 16th and final strophe in 1881 according to literary critic and harvard university professor helen vendler poem builds up to its longest and most lyrical moment in canto 14 achieves its moral climax in canto 15 and ends with a coda of out of night in canto 16 narrative while whitman s when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d is an elegy to fallen president it does not mention him by name or circumstances surrounding his death this is not atypical whitman biographer jerome loving states that traditionally elegies do not mention name of deceased in order to allow lament to have universal application according to rugoff poem s narrative is given by an unnamed speaker adding according to vendler speaker s first act is to break off a sprig from lilac bush line 17 that he subsequently lays on lincoln s coffin during funeral procession here coffin that slowly passes i give you my sprig of lilac line 44 45 style and techniques thumb right lincoln s funeral procession on pennsylvania avenue on april 19 1865 whitman s biographers explain that whitman s verse is influenced by aesthetics musicality and cadences of phrasing and passages in king james bible whitman employs several techniques of parallelism a device common to biblical poetry while whitman does not use end rhyme he employs internal rhyme in passages throughout poem although whitman s free verse does not use a consistent pattern of meter or rhyme disciplined use of other poetic techniques and patterns create a sense of structure his poetry achieves a sense of cohesive structure and beauty through internal patterns of sound diction specific word choice and effect of association poem uses many of literary techniques associated with pastoral elegy a meditative lyric genre derived from poetic tradition of greek and roman antiquity literary scholar harold bloom writes that elegies often have been used for political purposes as a means of healing nation a pastoral elegy uses rural imagery to address poet s grief a poetic response to death that seeks to fact of death into an imaginatively acceptable form to reaffirm what death has called into question integrity of pastoral image of contentment an elegy seeks also to attempt to preserve meaning of an individual s life as something of positive value when that life itself has ceased a typical pastoral elegy contains several features including a procession of mourners decoration of a hearse or grave a list of flowers changing of seasons and association of dead person with a star or other permanent natural object this includes a discussion of death expressions of mourning grief anger and consolation and poet s simultaneous acceptance of death s inevitability and hope for immortality according to literary scholar james perrin warren whitman s long musical lines rely on three important techniques syntactic parallelism repetition and cataloguing repetition is a device used by an orator or poet to lend persuasive emphasis to sentiment and create a driving rhythm by recurrence of same sound it can also intensify emotion of poem it is described as a form of parallelism that resembles a litany to achieve these techniques whitman employs many literary and rhetorical devices common to classical poetry and to pastoral elegy to frame his emotional response according to warren whitman uses anaphora repetition of a word or phrase at beginning of lines epistrophe repetition of same words or phrase at end of lines and combined use of anaphora and epistrophe repetition of both initial and terminal words according to raja sharma whitman s use of anaphora forces reader to inhale several bits of text without pausing for breath and this breathlessness contributes to incantatory quality this sense of incantation in poem and for framework for expansive lyricism that scholars have called cataloguing whitman s poetry features many examples of cataloguing where he both employs parallelism and repetition to build rhythm scholar betty erkkila calls whitman s cataloguing overarching figure of leaves of grass and wrote according to daniel hoffman whitman is a poet whose hallmark is anaphora hoffman describes use of verse as a poetry of beginnings and that whitman s use of its repetition and similarity at inception of each line is so necessary as norm against which all variations and departures are measured what follows is varied parallels and ensuing words phrases and clauses lending verse its delicacy its charm its power further device allows whitman to vary tempo or feeling to build up climaxes or drop off in innuendoes scholar stanley coffman analyzed whitman s catalogue technique through application of ralph waldo emersons comment that such lists are suggestive of metamorphosis of an imaginative and excited mind according to coffman emerson adds that because universe is externalization of soul and its objects symbols manifestations of one reality behind them words which name objects also carry with them whole sense of nature and are themselves to be understood as symbols thus a list of words objects will be effective in giving to mind under certain conditions a heightened sense not only of reality but of variety and abundance of its manifestations themes and symbolism a trinity of symbols lilac and star and bird twined whitman s poem features three prominent motifs or images lilacs a western star venus and hermit thrush referred to as a trinity biographer david s reynolds describes these three symbols as autobiographical loving describes trinity of symbols lilacs poet s perennial love for lincoln fallen star lincoln and hermit thrush death or its chant as brilliant lilac blooming perennial thumb right lilac flowers and heart shaped leaves according to price and folsom whitman s encounter with lilacs in bloom in his mother s yard caused flowers to become viscerally bound to memory of lincoln s death according to gregory great star early droop d in western sky thumb right venus whitman s western falling star reflected in pacific ocean in weeks before lincoln s assassination whitman observed planet venus shining brightly in evening sky he later wrote of observation nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of beauty than some of nights lately here western star venus in earlier hours of evening has never been so large so clear it seems as if it told something as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity with us americans in poem whitman describes disappearance of star literary scholar patricia lee identifies lincoln as falling star further she contrasts dialectic of powerful western falling star with a nascent spring and describes it as a metaphor for lincoln s death meant to evoke powerful conflicting emotions in poet which transport him back to that first and continuously remembered rebellion signaling death of his own innocence biographer betsy erkkila writes that whitman s star is fallen star of america itself and characterizes whitman s association as myth to counter booth s cry on night of assassination sic semper and increasingly popular image of lincoln as a dictatorial leader bent on abrogating rather than preserving basic american liberties star seemingly immortal is associated with lincoln s vision for america a vision of reconciliation and a national unity or identity that could only survive president s death if americans resolved to continue pursuing it however vendler says that poem dismisses idea of a personal immortality through symbol of star saying star sinks and it is gone forever a shy and hidden bird thumb right hermit thrush guttatus is considered whitman s alter ego in poem in summer of 1865 whitman s friend john burroughs 1837 1921 an aspiring nature writer had returned to washington to his position at treasury department after a long vacation in woods burroughs recalled that whitman had been deeply interested in what i tell him of hermit thrush and he says he largely used information i have given him in one of his principal poems burroughs described song as finest sound in nature perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn a voice of that calm sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments whitman took copious notes of his conversations with burroughs on subject writing of hermit thrush that it sings oftener after sundown is very secluded likes shaded dark places his song is a hymn in swamps is very shy never sings near farm houses never in settlement is bird of solemn primal woods of nature pure holy whitman notebooks 2 766 burroughs published an essay in may 1865 in which he described hermit thrush as quite a rare bird of very shy and secluded habits found only in deepest and most remote forests usually in damp and swampy localities loving notes that hermit thrush was a common bird on whitman s native long island biographer justin kaplan draws a connection between whitman s notes and lines in poem according to reynolds whitman s first person narrator describes himself as me powerless o helpless soul of me and identifies with hermit thrush a shy and hidden bird singing of death with a bleeding throat hermit thrush is seen as an intentional alter ego for whitman and its song as source of poet s insight miller writes that hermit thrush is an american bird and whitman made it his own in his lincoln elegy we might even take dry grass singing as an oblique allusion to leaves of grass scholar james edwin miller states that whitman s hermit thrush becomes source of his reconciliation to lincoln s death to all death as strong killingsworth writes that poet retreats to swamp to mourn death of beloved president to strains of solitary hermit thrush singing in dark pines sacred places resonate with mood of poet they offer renewal and revived inspiration they return him to rhythms of earth with tides and replaces sense of time killingsworth m jimmie in kummings 311 325 322 legacy influence on eliot s waste land thumb right t s eliot in 1920 in a photo taken by lady ottoline morrell alt portrait of t s eliot in a parlour scholars believe that t s eliot 1888 1965 drew from whitman s elegy in fashioning his poem waste land 1922 in poem eliot prominently mentions lilacs and april in its opening lines and later passages about dry grass singing and where hermit thrush sings in pine trees eliot told author ford madox ford that whitman and his own lines adorned by lilacs and hermit thrush were poems only good lines cleo kearns writes that whitman s poem gives us not only motifs and images of waste land but its very tone and pace steady andante which makes of both poems a walking meditation while eliot acknowledged that passage in waste land beginning who is third who walks always beside you was a reference to an early antarctic expedition of explorer ernest shackleton scholars have seen connections to appearance of jesus to two of his disciples walking on road to emmaus luke 24 13 35 however alan indicates a possible link to whitman and a passage in fourteenth strophe with knowledge of death as walking one side of me and thought of death close walking other side of me and i in middle with companions lines 121 123 beginning in 1950s scholars and critics starting with john peter began to question whether eliot s poem were an elegy to a male friend english poet and eliot biographer stephen spender who eliot published for faber faber in 1920s speculated it was an elegy perhaps to jean jules verdenal 1890 1915 a french medical student with literary inclinations who died in 1915 during gallipoli campaign according to miller eliot spent considerable amounts of time with verdenal in exploring paris and surrounding area in 1910 and 1911 and two corresponded for several years after their parting according to miller eliot remembered verdenal as coming across luxembourg garden in late afternoon waving a branch of lilacs during a journey in april 1911 two took to a garden on outskirts of paris both eliot and verdenal repeated journey alone later in their lives during periods of melancholy verdenal in april 1912 eliot in december 1920 miller observes that if we follow out all implications of eliot s evocation of whitman s lilacs at this critical moment in waste land we might assume it has its origins too in a death in a death deeply felt death of a beloved friend but unlike whitman poem eliot s waste land has no retreat on shores of water no hermit thrush to sing its joyful carol of death he further adds that it seems unlikely that eliot s long poem in form in which it was first conceived and written would have been possible without precedence of whitman s own experiments in similar forms musical settings whitman s poetry has been set by a variety of composers in europe and united states although critics have ranged from calling his writings unmusical to noting that his expansive lyrical style and repetition mimics process of musical composition jack sullivan writes that whitman had an early intuitive appreciation of vocal music one that as he himself acknowledged helped shape leaves of grass sullivan claims that one of first compositions setting whitman s poem charles villiers stanfords ode op 21 1884 a four movement work scored for baritone and soprano soloists chorus and orchestra likely had reached a wider audience during whitman s lifetime than his poems after world war i gustav holst turned to last section of whitman s elegy to mourn friends killed in war in composing his ode to death 1919 for chorus and orchestra holst saw whitman as a new world prophet of tolerance and internationalism as well as a new breed of mystic whose transcendentalism offered an antidote to encrusted victorianism according to sullivan holst invests whitman s vision of lovely and soothing death with luminous open chords that suggest a sense of infinite space holst is interested here in indeterminacy a feeling of infinite not in predictability and closure in 1936 german composer karl amadeus hartmann 1905 1963 began setting a german translation of an excerpt from whitman s poem for an intended cantata scored for an alto soloist and orchestra that was given various titles including lamento kantate trans cantata fragment trans symphonic fragment and unser leben trans our life cantata contained passages from whitman s elegy and from three other poems hartmann stated in correspondence that he freely adapted poem which he thought embraced his generally difficult hopeless life although no idea will be choked with death hartmann later incorporated his setting of poem as second movement titled fruhling trans spring of a work that he designated as his first symphony versuch eines requiem trans attempt at a requiem hartmann withdrew his compositions from musical performance in germany during nazi era and work was not performed until may 1948 when it was premiered in frankfurt am main his first symphony is seen as a protest of nazi regime hartmann s setting is compared to intentions of igor stravinskys ballet rite of spring where it was not a representation of natural phenomenon of season but an expression of ritualistic violence cast in sharp relief against fleeting tenderness and beauty of season american conductor robert shaw and his choral ensemble robert shaw chorale commissioned german composer paul hindemith to set whitman s text to music to mourn death of president franklin delano roosevelt on april 12 1945 hindemith had lived in united states during world war ii work was titled when lilacs last in dooryard bloom d a requiem for those we love hindemith set poem in 11 sections scored for mezzo soprano and baritone soloists mixed choir satb and full orchestra it premiered on april 20 1946 conducted by shaw composition is regarded by musicologist david as hindemith s only profoundly american work and paul hume described it as a work of genius and presence of genius presiding over its performance brought us splendor and profound and moving glory it is noted that hindemith incorporated a jewish melody gaza in his composition whitman s poem appears in broadway musical street scene 1946 which was collaboration of composer kurt weill poet and lyricist langston hughes and playwright elmer rice rice adapted his 1929 pulitzer prize winning play of same name for musical in play which premiered in new york city in january 1947 poem s third stanza is recited followed by duet don t forget lilac bush inspired by whitman s verse weill received first tony award for best original score for this work african american composer george t walker jr born 1922 set whitman s poem in his composition lilacs for voice and orchestra which was awarded 1996 pulitzer prize for music work described as passionate and very american with a beautiful and evocative lyrical quality using whitman s words was premiered by boston symphony orchestra on february 1 1996 composer george crumb born 1929 set death carol in his 1979 work apparition 1979 an eight part song cycle for soprano and amplified piano university of california at berkeley commissioned american neoclassical composer roger sessions 1896 1985 to set poem as a cantata to commemorate their centennial anniversary in 1964 sessions did not finish composing work until 1970s dedicating it to memories of civil rights leader martin luther king jr and political figure robert f kennedy both assassinated in 1968 sessions first became acquainted with leaves of grass in 1921 and began setting poem as a reaction to death of his friend george bartlett although none of sketches from that early attempt survive he returned to text almost fifty years later composing a work scored for soprano contralto and baritone soloists mixed chorus and orchestra music is described as responding wonderfully both to biblical majesty and musical fluidity of whitman s poetry and here to in evocation of gray brown bird singing from swamp and of over mastering scent of lilacs he gives us one of century s great love letters to nature in 2004 working on a commission from brooklyn
