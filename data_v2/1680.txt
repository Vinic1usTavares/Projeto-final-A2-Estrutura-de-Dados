aucanquilcha pronounced ow kahn keel is a massive stratovolcano located in antofagasta region of northern chile just west of border with bolivia and within alto loa national reserve part of central volcanic zone of andes stratovolcano has form of a ridge with a maximum height of volcano is embedded in a larger cluster of volcanoes known as aucanquilcha cluster this cluster of volcanoes was formed in stages over eleven million years of activity with varying magma output including lava domes and lava flows aucanquilcha volcano proper is formed from four units that erupted between 1 04 0 23 million years ago during ice ages both principal aucanquilcha complex and other volcanoes of cluster were subject to glaciation resulting in formation of moraines and cirques cluster has generated lava ranging in composition from andesite to dacite with main volcano being exclusively of dacitic composition systematic variations in temperature crystal and biotite content have been recorded during evolution of cluster at aucanquilcha volcano there is some fumarolic activity and sulfur deposits are found at summit several sulfur mines lie in complex one mine at an altitude of was opened in 1913 and remained in use from 1950 to 1992 it was world s highest mine during that period originally sulfur obtained at mine was transported down with llamas subsequently an aerial cableway was employed to transport sulfur to town of amincha to bring sulfur down a road network to summit was constructed in 1972 although it is now impassable in 1986 four men were reported to be living at an altitude of making them highest permanent residents on earth geography and geology regional setting aucanquilcha is part of central volcanic zone cvz of andes a highly silicic volcanic zone in south america cvz generates magmas at a rate of one tenth of global average of arc magma production and lies about above wadati benioff zone arc has migrated eastward towards high andes from pacific ocean coast since jurassic arc contains andesitic volcanoes ignimbrites and compound volcanoes and has generated over of eruption products over 28 million years aucanquilcha complex lies northwest of altiplano puna volcanic complex apvc a local large igneous province apvc is underpinned below at a depth of by a slow seismic velocity zone that has been linked to presence of 15 25 of partial melts in zone aucanquilcha complex is much smaller volumetrically than apvc ignimbrites but duration of activity and location indicate that aucanquilcha is a of apvc complex long term magma output of aucanquilcha is comparable to magma output of other long term active volcanoes in central andes such as ollague and llullaillaco in all such cases an early peak in magma output is followed by later lower volume activity followed by unzen in japan and mount duff and lassen peak in california have similar eruption histories such decreases may occur because of load imposed by edifices on magma chambers and increased travel distance of magma through edifice local setting thumbnail in this topographic map of region white surface in upper left is aucanquilcha alt topographic map of chile bolivia frontier aucanquilcha is part of a cluster of volcanoes located between rio loa and chile bolivia border aucanquilcha sits on top of a 2 7 3 3 mya andesite platform and rises more than over it main volcano is composed of an east west long chain of stratovolcanoes and has an estimated volume of maximum slope of summit area is 25deg during cumbre negra stage a pyroclastic flow occurred on northwestern side of volcano it covered on a run of and now has a volume of it was at first identified as a debris avalanche but lack of hummocky topography and presence of large juvenile blocks identify it as a pyroclastic flow one block in flow and lava dome from which flow originated have been dated at 0 6 mya lava flows mostly from summit areas are dark to grey in colour and extend as far as from their vents it is likely that two small lava domes cerro cumbre negra and summit on northwest flank occupy flank vents to north lies 3 3 mya old andesite cerro tres monos ridge to west lies east west cerro polan and la luna ridge volcanic cluster of which aucanquilcha is a part contains about 19 20 volcanoes and has generated about of andesite and dacite over eleven million years covering a surface area of cluster is surrounded on its northern western and eastern sides by salt flats and alluvial deposits on its southern side lies cerro volcano cluster lies on a thick crust and arid conditions since miocene have preserved its structures its volcanoes are arranged in north south and northwestern alignments which may indicate a rupture of crust above shallow magma reservoirs aucanquilcha underwent a northwestward flank collapse generating a debris avalanche deposit debris avalanche descended and ran for with an azimuth of eventually covering an area of flow was channeled between mino volcano and cerro cumbre negra an eroded lava massif towards dry rio loa valley favouring preservation of slide deposit proximal parts of slide are covered by younger eruptive products and also by moraines indicating that slide was followed by at least one glacial episode slide lacks hummocky topography usually found on debris avalanches but has radial ridges and grooves another landslide occurred during redondo stage on eastern side of main volcano into salar de carcote it has classic hummocky topography of landslides and covers a length of and a surface area of roughly half of surface area of mount st helens avalanche of 1980 and one third of surface area of ollague avalanche a volume of is assumed based on a probable thickness of composition of cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with sio2 ranging from 62 8 to 65 7 andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes rocks from main aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition potassium content ranges from 1 5 to 4 plagioclase is dominant component of magma clinopyroxene orthopyroxene amphibole hornblende and or amphibole biotite minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components apatite ilmenite magnetite and zircon can also be found there is evidence of magma mixing and mingling rocks have a porphyritic texture basaltic andesites typically contain less than 10 crystals while dacites generally have more than 20 crystals alconcha group lavas of first one million years are crystal poor and lack biotite later lavas contain biotite and more crystals based on data highest temperatures occurred during phases of high activity and lower temperatures are associated with low output periods it is likely that crustal feedback and increased deep crustal influx of mantle derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux during time of polan eruption on west flank magma output was spatially segregated with peripheral mino volcano generating andesite lavas and more central volcanos generating dacites various parts of main volcano have been subjected to hydrothermal alteration azufrera stage edifice was subject to most alteration especially in summit area and between angulo and azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits central part of complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity hydrothermal alteration may be driven by formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks eruptive history eruption rates increased 6 million years ago coinciding with magmas becoming more uniform in composition and onset of strong hydrothermal alteration it is possible that solidification of magmas below volcano insulated feeding channels from heat loss and caused temperatures in system to increase activity waned again 2 million years ago with magma and included crystals being drawn from depths of and forming aucanquilcha volcano proper 10 million year duration of activity of altiplano puna volcanic complex systems is comparable to duration of aucanquilcha activity age of lava flows ranges from heavily glaciated andesite flows overlying less eroded ones to possibly postglacial lava flows that may be tens of thousands of years old aucanquilcha cluster thumb aucanquilcha cluster formed in four stages each corresponding to a group alconcha group with seven volcanoes is constructed from pyroxene andesite and dacite and formed 11 8 mya it is constructed from two northern composite cones alconcha and volcan tuco also known as cerro garage dated 10 96 10 51 mya and five lava domes on northeastern side of cluster alconcha has a large breach on southern side of its crater that is likely product of a flank collapse but avalanche deposit may be buried beneath younger material lavas within breach are dated 10 78 10 43 mya centres of volcan tuco and alconcha are heavily eroded and alconcha s lavas and scoria lie on top of tuco ujina ignimbrite was erupted 9 4 mya from an unknown vent and has a volume of of dacite while vent location is unknown composition of ignimbrite and its dating and distribution indicate an association with this group domes are poorly researched with dome dated 8 9 8 7 mya and cerro amincha 8 01 total volume of this group is indicating a flux rate of gordo group which erupted 6 4 mya following a probable 2 million year hiatus is located in southern and western parts of cluster cerro gordo itself 5 49 mya has a crater that is breached westwards exposing about twelve radial dykes but with no trace of a debris avalanche one of larger centres of cluster gordo is associated with a lava field on its western side that is dated 4 9 mya cerro puquios and cerro negro 5 81 5 28 mya lie on southern side of cluster and glacial cirques cutting their northeastern flanks reveal layers of scoria and lavas puquios has an amphitheatre structure on its western side paco paco 4 41 4 27 mya is located north of most gordo group volcanoes it forms a wide stratocone with a lava filled crater and layers of scoria and agglutinated lavas dip from it volcan 4 14 4 12 mya sits southwest of puquios negro ridge las lava field 5 23 5 13 mya is associated with gordo group but vent locations are unknown total volume of this group is indicating a flux rate of 3 6 2 3 mya polan group with ten dispersed volcanoes including mino volcano is largest group in cluster and includes tres monos la luna cerro polan chaihuiri mino volcano and lavas of aucanquilcha platform cerro polan s 3 5 3 mya eastern side is deeply dissected and exposed materials are heavily altered in deeper sections lava fields to polan s west and southwest 2 6 mya on one western field are associated with it la luna 2 97 2 57 lies just east of polan these two volcanoes were probably one volcano in past la luna has a lava dome surrounded by a glaciated but unaltered lava table cerro tres monos 3 4 2 78 mya forms a northbound long ridge with at least six vents hydrothermal alteration has affected some lavas and pyroclastics from tres monos and western side has lateral and terminal moraines aucanquilcha platform 3 6 2 7 mya sits underneath main aucanquilcha volcano and its lava mostly flowed north its southern side is a table with one hill cerro campana dated to 3 3 mya platform presumably forms one third of total volume of aucanquilcha cluster and may have originated from a part of ridge of la luna polan trend now buried beneath aucanquilcha chaihuiri 2 39 mya is a lava dome with moraines and two short lava flows it is youngest polan group volcano total volume of this group is indicating a flux rate of after four main phases some scoria cones of basaltic composition including and luna de tierra formed between aucanquilcha and ollague aucanquilcha proper thumb landscape view main aucanquilcha volcano formed in four stages between 1 04 0 92 mya bulk of volcano formed in azufrera stage one lava flow toward southwest is unusually long at a vent at altitude fed most of this edifice a second vent on northern flank at summit generated three lava flows two shorter ones and a long one to northwest azufrera stage lavas are blocky dacites with large clasts and flow fronts up to high these flows are moderately altered and have oxidation rinds there is little evidence of explosive activity but it may have been obscured by glacial erosion total volume is indicating a flux rate of this volcano was probably an isolated cone but existence of a previous stage cannot be excluded second stage named rodado lasted from 0 95 to 0 85 mya it formed on eastern slopes of azufrera volcano with one vent at summit rodado stage lavas are blocky and and usually thicker than azufrera stage lavas some of summit vent lavas are among most vesicular of this stage they are also less weathered oxidation rinds are c thick and less subject to solfataric alteration cerro lavas are oldest of this stage erupted from an unknown vent they lack total volume is indicating a flux rate of a flank collapse possibly triggered by a large earthquake occurred during this stage third stage is cumbre negra stage named after westernmost summit and principal vent of this stage cerro cumbre negra time course of its activity is less defined than previous two stages it may have occurred between 1 0 47 mya but most likely 0 6 0 5 mya based on potassium argon dating four lava flows derived from main vent all less than one kilometre long and thicker than previous stages they all have hydration rinds but no native sulfur deposits this stage generated aucanquilcha s only pyroclastic flow during a lava dome collapse as occurred on merapi in indonesia total volume of this stage is indicating a flux rate of youngest stage known as angulo lasted from 0 66 to 0 24 mya it was centered between azufrera and rodado stage edifices 0 35 0 23 mya most lava flows from this stage originate on a long ridge that includes aucanquilcha s highest summit one crater on northeast side of ridge fed lavas to north other than that most flows extend southwards from vent and with exception of a due south flow thick they are thin with thicknesses of one of oldest flows has been compared in length to 50 longer chao dacite flow but is much thinner flows from this stage are weakly weathered and partially overlie glacial deposits total volume is indicating a flux rate of volcano has active fumaroles though low temperature fumaroles are not visible through short wavelength infrared data from satellites fumarole activity was observed in 1962 glaciation and hydrology volcano is currently not glaciated despite its height due to aridity of climate quebrada de valley originates at foot of aucanquilcha rio loa river drains western and northwestern sides of volcano eastern side drains into salar de ollague salt pan northeastern into salar de laguani and southeastern into salar de carcote most valleys only intermittently transport water if at all but it forms headwaters of rio loa volcanic cluster was modestly glaciated during quaternary as evidenced by glacial striations and moraines at elevations above and shows evidence of glaciers both on main volcano and its subsidiaries at least two distinct glacier stages took place western azufrera edifice was heavily glaciated in past at least three moraine stages have been mapped on that edifice and on its southern side is found a modest cirque with glacially polished lavas on floor rodado stage edifice has several moraine stages on its southern slopes another small cirque with a moraine has been found in northeastern side of cerro cumbre negra summit next to an azufrera stage lava flow a small moraine lies on south side of angulo edifice some lavas from that edifice overlie glacial deposits human activity and mining thumbnail a sulfur mine on aucanquilcha alt tracks in a sulfur mine on aucanquilcha thumb aucanquilcha camp a mine at altitude that yielded ore with 30 sulfur was opened by julian b carrasco in 1913 who subsequently established compania minera y azufrera carrasco s a in 1933 sulfur was transported down first with llamas later through an aerial cableway system and finally by trucks sulfur was then transported to chuquicamata to be converted into sulfuric acid mine was active from 1950 to 1992 last reported mining activity on mountain was in 1994 in 1977 other sulfur mines were present to west between cerro polan and cerro gordo and south of main aucanquilcha massif cableway runs from mine to a mining camp and from there to amincha road leading up to mine is dated 1972 and is now impassable because of rock falls there is still a relic network of roads leading up to covellite and other copper sulfides found in area appear to have formed through epithermal mineralization above deep porphyry copper mineralization sulfur itself formed at temperatures of in a now extinct fumarole altitude and habitation sulfur mine is notable for being highest mine in world at and highest permanently inhabited area an expedition in 1935 part of international high altitude expedition found that miners lived at an altitude of in town of and reached higher mine on foot expedition found that an even higher abandoned village at existed but miners refused to live there conclusion taken from expedition was that was highest habitable altitude west in 1986 reported that a few miners permanently lived in mine area a small group of men caretakers of mine has lived at an altitude of in a galvanized iron hut one of them reportedly had spent two years there these are considered to be highest human inhabitants on earth research performed on aymara miners of aucanquilcha mine indicates that they are fully acclimatized to altitude with less hyperventilation and higher hemoglobin than acclimatized people from lower areas their families are born and raised at lower altitudes however see also list of
