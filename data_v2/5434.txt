data images pdi and overseen by tim johnson animators at pdi worked closely with normal animators on simpsons and worked hard not to reinvent character s animators storyboarded segments and showed pdi animators how they would have handled scenes while designing 3d model of bart animators did not know how they would show bart s hair however they realized that there were vinyl bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model one of most difficult parts for pdi animators was to make homer and bart move properly without making them look robotic one of key shots in segment was where homer steps into 3d world and his design transitions into 3d executive producer bill oakley considers shot to be money shot and had a difficult time communicating his idea to animators oakley

equations that appears is 178212 184112 192212 although a false statement it appears to be true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision if it were true it would disprove fermat s last theorem which had just been proven when this episode first aired cohen generated this fermat near miss with a computer program other equations that appear are euler s identity and p np which is a reference to famous p vs np problem and similarly contradicts general belief that in fact p np code 46 72 69 6e 6b 20 72 75 6c 65 73 21 is a string of hexadecimal numbers that when

three segments it doesn t blast off screen but it seems imaginative and fun nightmare on elm street parody has its moments and comes across as generally entertaining however it lacks bite best pieces
