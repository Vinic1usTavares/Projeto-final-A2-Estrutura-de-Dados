hurricane flossie was a powerful pacific tropical cyclone that brought squally weather and light damage to hawaii in august 2007 sixth named storm second hurricane first and only major hurricane of inactive 2007 pacific hurricane season flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on july 21 after traversing tropical atlantic wave crossed central america and entered eastern pacific on august 1 there a favorable environment allowed it to become a tropical depression and a tropical storm shortly thereafter on august 8 tracking generally west southwestward storm entered a stage of rapid deepening on august 10 despite forecasts of an only marginally favorable environment on august 11 flossie became a major hurricane reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140 mph 220 km h with cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear in its path hurricane weakened steadily deteriorating to a tropical depression by august 16 storm s center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day indicating flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone as a strong storm flossie prompted hurricane and tropical storm warnings for big island of hawaii residents were warned by emergency officials to prepare for over a foot of rainfall and wind gusts well within tropical storm force however impact was negligible peak wind gust on big island of hawaii reached and rainfall totals remained below meteorological history formation of hurricane flossie is attributed to a poorly defined tropical wave that emerged off western coast of africa and into eastern atlantic ocean on july 21 tracking westward disturbance remained disorganized and lacked a significant amount of convection shower and thunderstorm activity near its center wave crossed central america and entered eastern pacific on august 1 where it was met with a much more favorable atmospheric environment for organization and intensification a consolidated area of shower and thunderstorms developed near center while system was situated just south of gulf of tehuantepec on august 2 though no further development occurred thereafter two days later an increase in deep convection was observed on conventional satellite imagery but like first no further organization occurred on august 6 yet another burst of convection developed near low level center and national hurricane center nhc contemplated classifying disturbance at that time but yet another wane in shower and thunderstorm activity deferred this disturbance tracked westward through august 8 and following another deep burst of convection that persisted itself for an appreciable amount of time had finally gathered enough organization to be classified as a tropical depression at 1800 utc on august 8 at this time depression was situated roughly east southeast of big island of hawaii within an environment characterized by low vertical wind shear as a result of an anticyclone aloft and warm sea surface temperatures tropical depression six e continued its organizational trend and was declared a tropical storm earning name flossie six hours after formation thumb right hurricane flossie approaching hawaii on august 13 located on southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge situated over southwestern mexico flossie tracked generally west southwestward after formation while intensifying upper level outflow began to expand in all quadrants of cyclone and spiral bands became prominent around center on august 9 an eyewall and associated mid level eye feature was observed on microwave imagery but was obscured on conventional satellite imagery that evening following a series of satellite intensity estimates and presence of an eye on visible and infrared satellite imagery flossie was upgraded to a category 1 on saffir simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200 utc on august 10 despite forecasts of an increasingly unfavorable environment as cyclone moved towards hawaiian islands flossie continued to intensify hurricane unexpectedly began a period of rapid deepening during overnight hours of august 10 and by 0600 utc on august 11 flossie attained major hurricane intensity a category 3 hurricane with a quickly falling barometric pressure early morning satellite images revealed a eye with cloud tops cooler than surrounding feature further intensification ensued as storm entered central pacific hurricane center cphc s area of responsibility that morning and flossie was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane by 1200 utc two hours later cyclone attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph 220 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of 949 mb hpa 28 02 inhg strongest tropical cyclone of 2007 pacific hurricane season after peak intensity flossie was forecast to gradually weaken as wind shear increased however despite prediction of such flossie did not weaken at all and in fact remained a category 4 hurricane for 36 continuous hours in its discussion during morning hours of august 13 central pacific hurricane center stated that flossie was not willing to give up by pre dawn hours of august 14 however cyclone began to feel impacts of increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and higher southerly wind shear while outflow in northern semicircle of flossie remained exceptional outflow in southern half of circulation began to dissipate additionally southern flank of eyewall began to fall apart an aircraft reconnaissance flight into system revealed surface winds of and warming cloud tops and flossie was downgraded to a category 3 hurricane further passes through eyewall of storm depicted ever decreasing surface winds and organization with flossie and storm was downgraded once again to a category 2 hurricane by 1200 utc as it passed south of hawaiian islands over of vertical wind shear eroded remainder of storm s eyewall on august 15 as such central pacific hurricane center downgraded cyclone to a tropical storm further weakening to tropical depression status occurred by 0600 utc on august 16 as shower and thunderstorm activity over center faded away by 1200 utc a lone low level swirl remained on satellite imagery and storm dissipated thereafter while located southwest of hawaiian islands preparations and impact thumb left overcast skies from flossie along kona coast shortly after entering central pacific hurricane center s area of responsibility organization issued a hurricane watch for big island of hawaii within a few days as hurricane tracked slightly further to north and its wind radii expanded a tropical storm warning was overlaid on hurricane watch heavy rainfall and flooding were expected to be primary concern as such flash flood watches were issued and officials warned residents of potential for of rainfall governor linda lingle declared a state of emergency for island of hawaii in advance of storm where residents were advised to stock up on necessary supplies federal emergency management agency fema dispatched 20 transportation public works and health experts to region emergency shelters were opened though were used little threat of storm led to closure of schools including university of hawaii at hilo and hawaii community college forcing an estimated 26 000 college students to remain home some libraries parks private schools banks and other businesses were also closed non essential state employees were advised to remain at home and emergency workers were mobilized to quickly assist in aftermath of storm in advance of storm many tourists canceled reservations forecast heavy rains over southeast facing slopes of big island failed to occur as flossie turned westward before low level southeasterly winds had a chance to produce mountain enhanced rainfall however north and northeast facing slopes received minimal rainfall of rain was reported in south hilo and puna districts elsewhere of precipitation fell at maui and fell at koolau range on oahu although no significant winds or flooding was reported wave action affected southeast facing shores also with little impact most significant waves were estimated at in height while sustained winds of at least were reported at south point a large lava bench collapsed into ocean on august 13 which may have been related to hurricane s passage or alternatively a recent 5 4 magnitude earthquake see also list of hawaii hurricanes hurricane jimena
