thumb female northern territory thumb male northern territory red tailed black cockatoo calyptorhynchus banksii also known as banksian or banks black cockatoo is a large black cockatoo native to australia adult males have a characteristic pair of bright red panels on tail that gives species its name it is more common in drier parts of continent five subspecies are recognised differing chiefly in beak size although more northerly subspecies are widespread two southern subspecies forest red tailed black cockatoo and south eastern red tailed black cockatoo are under threat species is usually found in eucalyptus woodlands or along water courses in more northerly parts of country these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks they are seed eaters and cavity nesters and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters generally eucalyptus populations in southeastern australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations of black cockatoos red tailed is most adaptable to aviculture although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside australia taxonomy and naming species complex was first described by ornithologist john latham in 1790 as psittacus banksii commemorating english botanist sir joseph banks red tailed black cockatoo also has distinction of being first bird from eastern australia illustrated by a european as a female presumably collected at endeavour river in north queensland was sketched by banks draughtsman sydney parkinson in 1770 forshaw p 94 narrowly predating latham english naturalist george shaw described psittacus magnificus from a specimen collected somewhere in port jackson now sydney region for many years species was referred to as calyptorhynchus magnificus lendon p 64 proposed by gregory mathews in 1927 as shaw s name had predated latham s 1790 description for several decades mathews proposal was accepted by many authorities although it was unclear whether original port jackson reference had actually referred to red tailed black or more likely glossy black cockatoo in 1994 an application to conserve calyptorhynchus banksii as scientific name was accepted by iczn red tailed black cockatoo is type species of genus calyptorhynchus forshaw p 55 name of which is derived from greek hidden and rugkhos beak change was first made by anselme gaetan desmarest in 1826 in 1827 jennings proposed name psittacus niger for bird binomial combination had already been used by carl linnaeus for lesser vasa parrot in 1758 and by johann friedrich gmelin for palm cockatoo in 1788 it was thus invalid even though both other species were already known by different names at time alternate common names include banks black cockatoo banksian black cockatoo or simply black cockatoo

cockatoo two species form subgenus calyptorhynchus within genus of same name forshaw p 89 they are distinguished from other black cockatoos of subgenus zanda by their significant sexual dimorphism and calls of juveniles one a squeaking begging call other a vocalization when swallowing food a 1999 mtdna phylogenetic study of cockatoos utilizing among others red tailed black cockatoo supported hypotheses that cockatoos originated in australia before paleogene and neogene periods 66 mya marking end of mesozoic to 2 6 mya and that genus diversified in two separate radiations to islands of indonesia new guinea and south pacific it concluded that first extant cockatoo to diverge from ancestral cockatoos was palm cockatoo followed by a subclade containing black cockatoos a 2008 mitochondrial and nuclear dna phylogenetic study of parrots cockatoos and related taxa by utilizing among others yellow tailed black cockatoo provides confirmatory evidence for a gondwanaland origin of ancestral parrots in cretaceous period and an australasia divergence of ancestral cockatoos from parrots in either late cretaceous 66 mya or paleogene 45 mya periods depending on baseline assumptions five subspecies are recognised they differ mainly in size and shape of beak overall bird size and female colouration c b banksii is found in queensland and rarely in far northern new south wales it is largest subspecies by overall body size and has a moderate sized bill it merges with subspecies macrorhynchus around gulf of carpentaria it has disappeared from much of its former range in northern new south wales and southeast queensland c b graptogyne endangered garnett p 99 known as south eastern red tailed black cockatoo is found in southwestern victoria and southeastern south

habitat c b macrorhynchus given name great billed cockatoo by mathews is found across northern australia although thought to be widespread and abundant this subspecies has been little studied it is also large and has a large beak as its subspecific name implies females lack red colouration in their tails c b naso near threatened garnett p 100 is known as forest red tailed black cockatoo and is found in southwest corner of western australia between perth and albany this form has a larger bill and favours marri corymbia formerly eucalyptus calophylla jarrah e marginata and karri e

tailed black cockatoos have zygodactyl feet two toes facing forward and two backward that allow them to grasp objects with one foot while standing on other for feeding and manipulation black cockatoos are almost exclusively left footed along with nearly all other cockatoos and most parrots juvenile red tailed black cockatoos resemble females until puberty which occurs around four years of age but have paler yellow barred underparts as birds reach maturity males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones complete process takes around four years lendon p 66 as with other cockatoos red tailed black cockatoo can be very long lived in captivity in 1938 ornithologist neville cayley reported one over fifty years old at taronga zoo lendon p 68 another bird residing at london and rotterdam zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979 several calls of red tailed black cockatoos have been recorded bird s contact call is a rolling metallic krur rr or kree

and habitat left thumb red tailed black cockatoo juvenile male darling scarp south west western australia red tailed black cockatoo principally occurs across drier parts of australia it is widespread and abundant in a broad band across northern half of country where it has been considered an agricultural pest with more isolated distribution in south it is found in a wide variety of habitats from shrublands and grasslands through eucalypt sheoak and acacia woodlands to dense tropical rainforests bird is dependent on large old eucalypts for nesting hollows although specific gums used vary in different parts of country cockatoos are not wholly migratory but they do exhibit regular seasonal movements in different parts of australia in northern parts of northern territory they largely leave areas of high humidity in summer wet season in other parts of country cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources a pattern recorded in northern queensland and new south wales in southwest western australia both extant subspecies appear to have a north south pattern northwards after breeding in case of subspecies naso while movements by subspecies samueli in wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to seasons behaviour thumb right in flight thumb right red tailed black cockatoo in flight sanctuary red tailed black cockatoos are diurnal raucous and noisy and are often seen flying high overhead in small flocks sometimes mixed with other cockatoos flocks of up to 500 birds are generally only seen in north or when birds are concentrated at some food source otherwise they are generally rather shy of humans in northern and central australia birds may feed on ground while two southern subspecies graptogyne and naso are almost exclusively arboreal forshaw p 97 8 they tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats markedly different from shallow wingbeats of similar glossy black cockatoo they also often fly at considerable height breeding male red tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers and hiding beak it then sings and struts ending in a jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward female who will most often reply by defensively biting him forshaw p 100 breeding generally takes place from may to september except in case of south eastern subspecies which nests during summer december to february pairs of subspecies samueli in wheatbelt region of western australia may produce two broods while those of south eastern subspecies only produce one nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees isolated trees are generally chosen so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered same tree may be used for many years hollows can be 1 to 2 metres 3 7 ft deep and 0 25 0 5 metres 10 20 in wide with a base of woodchips a clutch consists of 1 to 2 white lustreless eggs although second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy feeding although red tailed black cockatoos feed on a wide variety of native and introduced grains mainstay of their diet is eucalyptus seeds there is a specific relationship between species and larger fruited species of gums these vary across australia but include marri in southwest western australia darwin e miniata across north of country e baxteri in victoria and bloodwood species corymbia polycarpa and c intermedia in queensland cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering ground with debris among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of acacia allocasuarina banksia grevillea and hakea as well as berries fruits and various insects forshaw p 99 100 cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as australis there is some evidence of consumption of wild radish raphanus wild turnip brassica and melon or cucumis red tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests of peanut and other crops at lakeland downs in far north queensland here cockatoos in flocks of up to several hundred birds have learned to sever peanut plants above ground level before pulling peanuts out of ground by their stems and shelling them they also damage electrical cables on pivot irrigators ahmet mike 1998 damage caused by red tailed black cockatoos calyptorhynchus banksii on peanut and other

hand reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate although males may become imprinted and unlikely to breed red tailed black cockatoo is most commonly seen of black cockatoos in captivity forshaw p 103 and can be hardy and long lived if given plenty of space until now most birds in captivity have been of subspecies c b banksii and c b samueli birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin however with an increase in interest in conservation more are concerned about maintaining integrity of separate subspecies in cultivation and so avoid crossbreeding birds breed easily in p 104 and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between february and november once female has one egg in her nest she will not lay another an egg takes about 30 days to hatch forshaw p 102 eyes of young open around 3 weeks and yellow down will show black pin feathers at about 6 weeks best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but tail feathers are still short young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have colouring of their mother mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty 4 years they must be separated if caged large and powerful bills of these birds can quickly and easily open a brazil nut normally requiring crushing in a vise or pounding with a hammer shearing it as neatly as a laser they can also demolish a whole coconut with husk in 3 days captive breeding guidelines may be found in husbandry guidelines for red tailed black cockatoo bennett 2008
