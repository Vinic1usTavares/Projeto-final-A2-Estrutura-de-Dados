drosera commonly known as sundews is one of largest genera of carnivorous plants with at least 194 species mcpherson s r 2010 carnivorous plants and their habitats 2 volumes redfern natural history productions ltd poole these members of family droseraceae lure capture and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces insects are used to supplement poor mineral nutrition of soil in which plants grow various species which vary greatly in size and form are native to every continent except antarctica mcpherson s r 2008 glistening carnivores redfern productions ltd poole charles darwin performed much of early research into drosera engaging in a long series of experiments with drosera rotundifolia which were first to confirm carnivory in plants in an 1860 letter darwin wrote at present moment i care more about drosera than origin of all species in world both botanical name from greek drosos drosos dew dewdrops and english common name sundew derived from latin ros solis meaning dew of sun refer to glistening drops of mucilage at tip of glandular trichomes that resemble drops of morning dew principia botanica published in 1787 states sun dew drosera derives its name from small drops of a liquor like dew hanging on its fringed leaves and continuing in hottest part of day exposed to sun characteristics thumb a tuber of d a tuberous sundew beginning its winter growth sundews are perennial or rarely annual herbaceous plants forming prostrate or upright rosettes between in height depending on species climbing species form scrambling stems which can reach much longer lengths up to in case of d mann phill 2001 world s largest drosera carnivorous plant newsletter vol 30 3 pg 79 sundews have been shown to be able to achieve a lifespan of 50 years barthlott et al karnivoren p 102 genus is specialized for nutrient uptake through its carnivorous behavior for example pygmy sundew is missing enzymes nitrate reductase in particular that plants normally use for uptake of earth bound nitrates habit genus can be divided into several habits or growth forms temperate sundews these species form a tight cluster of unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter dormancy period all of north american and european species belong to this group drosera from australia including tasmania and new zealand is another temperate species that dies back to a horn shaped hibernaculum subtropical sundews these species maintain vegetative growth year round under uniform or nearly uniform climatic conditions pygmy sundews a group of roughly 40 australian species they are distinguished by miniature growth formation of gemmae for asexual reproduction and dense formation of hairs in crown center these hairs serve to protect plants from australia s intense summer sun pygmy sundews form subgenus bryastrum tuberous sundews these nearly 50 australian species form an underground tuber to survive extremely dry summers of their habitat re emerging in autumn these so called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems tuberous sundews comprise subgenus thumb d from petiolaris complex petiolaris complex a group of tropical australian species they live in constantly warm but sometimes wet conditions several of 14 species that comprise this group have developed special strategies to cope with alternately drier conditions many species for example have petioles densely covered in trichomes which maintain a sufficiently humid environment and serve as an increased condensation surface for morning dew petiolaris complex comprises subgenus although they do not form a single strictly defined growth form a number of species are often put together in a further group queensland sundews a small group of three species d adelae d and d prolifera all are native to highly humid habitats in dim of australian rainforest leaves and carnivory thumb leaf and tentacle movement on d capensis sundews are characterised by glandular tentacles topped with sticky secretions that cover their laminae trapping and digestion mechanism usually employs two types of glands stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them and sessile glands that absorb resulting nutrient soup latter glands are missing in some species such as d erythrorhiza small prey mainly consisting of insects are attracted by sweet secretions of glands upon touching these prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape eventually prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles death usually occurs within 15 minutes plant meanwhile secretes esterase peroxidase phosphatase and protease enzymes barthlott et al karnivoren p 41 these enzymes dissolve insect and free nutrients contained within it this nutrient mixture is then absorbed through leaf surfaces to be used by rest of plant thumb drosera glandular hair all species of sundew are able to move their tentacles in response to contact with edible prey tentacles are extremely sensitive and will bend toward center of leaf to bring insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible according to charles darwin contact of legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to induce this response this response to touch is known as and is quite rapid in some species outer tentacles recently coined as snap tentacles of d burmannii and d can bend inwards toward prey in a matter of seconds after contact while d glanduligera is known to bend these tentacles in toward prey in tenths of a second hartmeyer i hartmeyer s 2005 drosera glanduligera der sonnentau mit schnapp das gfp 2005 2 34 38 in addition to tentacle movement some species are able to bend their laminae to various degrees to maximize contact with prey of these d capensis exhibits what is probably most dramatic movement curling its leaf completely around prey in 30 minutes some species such as d filiformis are unable to bend their leaves in response to prey thumb emergences of an australian d indica a further type of mostly strong red and yellow emergence has recently been discovered in a few australian species d d indica their function is not known yet although they may help in attracting prey leaf morphology of species within genus is extremely varied ranging from sessile ovate leaves of d erythrorhiza to divided leaves of d binata while exact physiological mechanism of sundew s carnivorous response is not yet known some studies have begun to shed light on how plant is able to move in response to mechanical and chemical stimulation to envelop and digest prey individual tentacles when mechanically stimulated fire action potentials that terminate near base of tentacle resulting in rapid movement of tentacle towards center of leaf this response is more prominent when marginal tentacles further away from leaf center are stimulated tentacle movement response is achieved through auxin mediated acid growth when action potentials reach their target cells plant hormone auxin causes protons h ions to be pumped out of plasma membrane into cell wall thereby reducing ph and making cell wall more acidic resulting reduction in ph causes relaxation of cell wall protein and allows for an increase in cell volume via osmosis and turgor as a result of differential cell growth rates sundew tentacles are able to achieve movement towards prey and leaf center through bending caused by expanding cells among some drosera species a second bending response occurs in which non local distant tentacles bend towards prey as well as bending of entire leaf blade to maximize contact with prey while mechanical stimulation is sufficient to achieve a localized tentacle bend response both mechanical and chemical stimuli are required for secondary bending response to occur flowers and fruit thumb flower of d flowers of sundews as with nearly all carnivorous plants are held far above leaves by a long stem this physical isolation of flower from traps is commonly thought to be an adaptation meant to avoid trapping potential pollinators mostly inflorescences are spikes whose flowers open one at a time and usually only remain open for a short period flowers open in response to light intensity often opening only in direct sunlight and entire inflorescence is also moving in response to sun s position in sky radially symmetrical actinomorphic flowers are always perfect and have five parts exceptions to this rule are four petaled d pygmaea and eight to 12 petaled d heterophylla most of species have small flowers 1 5 cm or 0 6 in a few species however such as d regia and d have flowers or more in diameter in general flowers are white or pink australian species display a wider range of colors including orange d red d adelae yellow d or metallic violet d microphylla ovary is superior and develops into a dehiscent seed capsule bearing numerous tiny seeds pollen grain type is compound which means four microspores pollen grains are stuck together with a protein called callose roots thumb drosera anglica with prey root systems of most drosera are often only weakly developed serving mainly to absorb water and to anchor plant to ground roots are relatively useless for nutrient uptake a few south african species use their roots for water and food storage some species have wiry root systems that remain during frosts if stem dies some species such as d adelae and d use their roots for asexual propagation by sprouting plantlets along their length some australian species form underground corms for this purpose which also serve to allow plants to survive dry summers roots of pygmy sundews are often extremely long in proportion to their size with a 1 cm 0 4 in plant extending roots over beneath soil surface some pygmy sundews such as d and d scorpioides also form adventitious roots as supports d intermedia and d rotundifolia have been reported to form arbuscular mycorrhizae which penetrate plant s tissues taxonomy and phylogenetics unrooted cladogram to right shows relationship between various subgenera and classes as defined by analysis of rivadavia et al in 2002 monotypic section was not included in study so its place in this system is unclear more recent studies have placed this group near section bryastrum so it is placed there below also of note placement of section in relation to and is uncertain since section drosera is polyphyletic it shows up multiple times in cladogram this phylogenetic study has made need for a revision of genus even clearer reproduction many species of sundews are self fertile their flowers will often self pollinate upon closing often numerous seeds are produced tiny black seeds germinate in response to moisture and light while seeds of temperate species also require cold damp stratification to germinate seeds of tuberous species require a hot dry summer period followed by a cool moist winter to germinate vegetative reproduction occurs naturally in some species that produce stolons or when roots come close to surface of soil older leaves that touch ground may sprout plantlets pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale like leaves called gemmae tuberous sundews can produce offsets from their corms in culture sundews can often be propagated through leaf crown or root cuttings as well as through seeds distribution thumb distribution of genus drosera shown in green thumb drosera filiformis var filiformis in a peat bog in new jersey range of sundew genus stretches from alaska in north to new zealand in south centers of diversity are australia with roughly 50 of all known species and south america and southern africa each with more than 20 species a few species are also found in large parts of eurasia and north america these areas however can be considered to form outskirts of generic range as ranges of sundews do not typically approach temperate or arctic areas contrary to previous supposition evolutionary speciation of this genus is no longer thought to have occurred with breakup of gondwana through continental drift rather speciation is now thought to have occurred as a result of a subsequent wide dispersal of its range origins of genus are thought to have been in africa or australia europe is home to only three species d intermedia d anglica and d rotundifolia where ranges of two latter species overlap they sometimes hybridize to form sterile d x obovata in addition to three species and hybrid native to europe north america is also home to four additional species d is a small annual native to coastal states from texas to virginia while d capillaris a slightly larger plant with a similar range is also found in areas of caribbean third species d linearis is native to northern united states and southern canada d filiformis has two subspecies native to east coast of north america gulf coast and florida panhandle this genus is often described as cosmopolitan meaning it has worldwide distribution botanist ludwig diels author of only monograph of family to date called this description an arrant misjudgment of this genus highly unusual distributional circumstances ihrer hochst while admitting sundew species do occupy a significant part of earth s surface einen teil der diels ludwig droseraceae in engler a hrsg 4 112 109 1906 he particularly pointed to absence of drosera species from almost all arid climate zones countless rainforests american pacific coast polynesia mediterranean region and north africa as well as scarcity of species diversity in temperate zones such as europe and north america habitat thumb round leaf sundew d rotundifolia growing in sphagnum moss along with sedges and in mt hood national forest oregon sundews generally grow in seasonally moist or more rarely constantly wet habitats with acidic soils and high levels of sunlight common habitats include bogs fens swamps marshes of venezuela of coastal australia fynbos of south africa and moist many species grow in association with sphagnum moss which absorbs much of soil s nutrient supply and also soil making nutrients less available to plant life this allows sundews which do not rely on soil bound nutrients to flourish where more dominating vegetation would usually outcompete them genus though is very variable in terms of habitat individual sundew species have adapted to a wide variety of environments including atypical habitats such as rainforests deserts d burmannii and d indica and even highly shaded environments queensland sundews temperate species which form hibernacula in winter are examples of such adaptation to habitats in general sundews tend to inhabit warm climates and are only moderately frost resistant conservation status thumb leaf of common sundew drosera rotundifolia although none of drosera species in united states are federally protected all are listed as threatened or endangered in some states usda threatened and endangered results for genus drosera results compiled from multiple publications retrieved 04 30 may 16 2006 additionally many of remaining native populations lie on protected land such as national parks or wildlife preserves drosera species are protected by law in many european countries such as germany world wildlife fund germany traffic germany eds drosera spp sonnentau 2001 p 5 pdf online austria switzerland czech republic finland hungary france and bulgaria currently largest threat in europe and north america is habitat destruction for development projects as well as draining of bogs for agricultural uses and peat harvesting in many regions this has led to extirpation of some species from parts of their former range reintroduction of plants into such habitats is usually difficult or impossible as ecological needs of certain populations is closely tied to their geographical location through increased legal protection of bogs and moors as well as a concentrated effort to such habitats threat to these plants survival might be curbed although most species would remain endangered relatively unimpressive image of these plants as well as their small low growth makes them difficult to protect as part of landscape sundews are often overlooked or not recognized at all in south africa and australia two of three centers of species diversity natural habitats of these plants are undergoing a high degree of pressure from human activities expanding population centers such as queensland perth and cape town threaten many such habitats as does draining of moist areas for agriculture and forestry in rural areas droughts that have been sweeping australia over last 10 years also pose a threat to many species by drying up previously moist areas those species endemic to a very limited area are often most threatened by collection of plants from wild d madagascariensis is considered endangered in madagascar because of large scale removal of plants from wild for exportation 10 200 million plants are harvested for commercial medicinal use annually uses thumb this page of 15th century voynich manuscript might possibly show one of oldest illustrations of a drosera species as a medicinal plant sundews were used as medicinal herbs as early as 12th century when an italian doctor from school of salerno described plant as an herbal remedy for coughs under name herba sole it has been used

protected in many parts of europe and north america extracts are usually prepared using cultivated fast growing sundews specifically d rotundifolia d intermedia d anglica d and d madagascariensis or from plants collected and imported from madagascar spain france finland and baltics as ornamental plants because of their carnivorous nature and beauty of their glistening traps sundews have become favorite ornamental plants however environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation as a result most species are unavailable commercially a few of hardiest varieties however have made their way into mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to venus these most often include d capensis d and d spatulata rice barry 2006 growing carnivorous plants timber press portland oregon cultivation requirements vary greatly by species in general though sundews require high environmental moisture content usually in form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate most species also require this water to be pure as nutrients salts or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them commonly plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss sphagnum peat moss sand and or and are watered with distilled reverse osmosis or rain water mucilage produced by drosera has remarkable elastic properties and has made this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research in one recent study adhesive of three species d binata d capensis and d spatulata were analyzed for and nanoparticle content using atomic force microscopy transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within mucilage residues in addition calcium magnesium and chlorine key components of biological salts were identified these nanoparticles are theorized to increase viscosity and stickiness of mucilage in turn increasing effectiveness of trap more importantly for biomaterials research however is fact that when dried mucin provides a suitable substrate for attachment of living cells this has important implications for tissue engineering especially because of elastic qualities of adhesive essentially a coating of drosera mucilage on a surgical implant such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant could drastically improve rate of recovery and decrease potential for rejection because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for drosera mucin including wound treatment regenerative medicine or enhancing synthetic adhesives also of note because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use it can be an extremely cost efficient source of other uses corms of tuberous sundews native to australia are considered a delicacy by
