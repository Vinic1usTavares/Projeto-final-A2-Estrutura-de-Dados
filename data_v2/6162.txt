siward barn was an 11th century english thegn and landowner warrior he appears in extant sources in period following norman conquest of england joining northern resistance to william conqueror by end of 1060s siward s resistance continued until his capture on isle of ely alongside aethelwine bishop of durham earl morcar and hereward wake as cited in anglo saxon chronicle siward and his confiscated properties in central and northern england were mentioned in domesday book and from this it is clear that he was one of main of henry de ferrers father of robert de ferrers first earl of derby following his capture in 1071 he was imprisoned this incarceration lasted until 1087 when a guilt ridden king william in expectation of his own death ordered siward s release firm evidence of siward s later life is non existent but some historians have argued that he took up a career in varangian guard at constantinople in service of emperor alexios i komnenos sources upon which this theory is based also allege that siward led a party of english colonists to black sea who renamed their conquered territory new england origins identifying siward s origin is difficult for historians because of large number of siwards in england in mid 11th century other notable siwards include siward of maldon and siward grossus both men of substance with landholdings larger or comparable to siward barn s clarke english nobility pp 32 3 anglo norman writer orderic vitalis when describing william conqueror s stay at barking says that morcar formerly earl of northumbria and earl of mercia came and submitted to king william followed by earl of northumbria along with of eadric wild and ealdred and siward sons of aethelgar grandsons or grand nephews of king edward chibnall ed ecclesiastical history vol ii p 195 edward augustus freeman and other historians have thought that this siward was siward barn arguing that siward must have been a descendant of uhtred bold earl of northumbria and aelfgifu daughter of king aethelred unready king edward s father for some citations see chibnall ed ecclesiastical history vol ii p 194 n 4 historian and translator of orderic marjorie chibnall pointed out that this siward is mentioned later in his ecclesiastical history as a shropshire landowner in connection with foundation of shrewsbury abbey chibnall ed ecclesiastical history vol ii p 194 5 n 4 ann williams likewise rejected this identification identifying this siward firmly with shropshire thegn siward grossus williams english pp 8 89 6 175 6 she does not call him grossus but this is nickname used by clarke english nobility pp 339 40 et passim according to williams reconstruction siward grossus and his brother ealdred were sons of aethelgar by a daughter of eadric streona

historian forrest scott guessed that siward was a member of family of northumbrian earls presumably connected in some way to siward earl of northumbria scott earl waltheof p 172 margaret faull and

book yorkshire part ii s v page number not marked but in appendix section 4 biographies of tenants english another historian geoffrey barrow pointed out that faull and stinson gave no evidence for
