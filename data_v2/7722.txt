afrasia djijidae is a fossil primate that lived in myanmar approximately 37 million years ago during late middle eocene only species in genus afrasia it was a small primate estimated to weigh around despite significant geographic distance between them afrasia is thought to be closely related to afrotarsius an enigmatic fossil found in libya and egypt that dates to 38 39 million years ago if this relationship is correct it suggests that early simians a related group or clade consisting of monkeys apes and humans dispersed from asia to africa during middle eocene and would add further support to hypothesis that first simians evolved in asia not africa neither afrasia nor afrotarsius which together form family afrotarsiidae is considered ancestral to living simians but they are part of a side branch or stem group known as eosimiiforms because they did not give rise to stem simians that are known from same deposits in africa early asian simians are thought to have dispersed from asia to africa more than once prior to late middle eocene such dispersals from asia to africa also were seen around same time in other mammalian groups including hystricognathous rodents and anthracotheres afrasia is known from four isolated molar teeth found in pondaung formation of myanmar these teeth are similar to those of afrotarsius and eosimiidae and differ only in details of chewing surface for example back part of third lower molar is relatively well developed in pondaung formation afrasia was part of a diverse primate community that also includes eosimiid bahinia and members of families amphipithecidae and sivaladapidae etymology name afrasia derives from continental names africa and asia and refers to occurrence of primates on both continents species a djijidae was named in memory of a young girl from village in central myanmar evolutionary history afrasia djijidae was first described in 2012 on basis of isolated teeth from 37 million year old pondaung formation which is close to village of in myanmar prior to discovery of a djijidae early asian simians were typically classified in two families eosimiidae and amphipithecidae while eosimiids are generally considered most basal simian clade a stem group of simians phylogenetic placement of amphipithecids is more disputed amphipithecids are usually considered to share affinities with either eosimiids or crown simians those simians that are part of smallest clade that contains living simians latter view is favored eosimiids were first described from findings in china in 1994 and are still best known there two genera are now known eosimias and phenacopithecus but have also been recorded in pakistan phileosimias and myanmar bahinia all species had a small body size and a mix of primitive ancestral and derived traits largest eosimiid bahinia is from pondaung formation same stratum as afrasia and morphology of its molars bridges gap between more primitive molars of eosimias and more derived molars of later eocene african simians afrasia on other hand is more comparable in size to eosimiids from china upper molars of afrasia are nearly identical in morphology and size to those of afrotarsius an animal known from 38 to 39 million year old deposits in libya species afrotarsius libycus and about 30 million year old deposits in egypt a afrotarsius was originally described as a tarsier but later suggested to be related to primitive simians because of their close similarities afrasia and afrotarsius are together placed in family afrotarsiidae a phylogenetic analysis placed afrasia as a sister group to afrotarsius forming family afrotarsiidae afrotarsiidae was found to be most closely related to eosimiidae and unrelated to tarsiers clade formed by afrotarsiidae and eosimiidae was designated as infraorder eosimiiformes by et al in 2012 eosimiiformes are sister group of crown simians however classification of afrotarsius as a stem simian is not accepted by all researchers and phylogenetic claims and their implications rest on only four molars of afrasia initially discovered biogeography left thumb afrasia from asia and afrotarsius from africa exhibit similar morphology of their teeth and lived in late middle eocene suggesting stem simians dispersed from asia to africa around that time alt two molars one of afrotarsius left and one of afrasia right are compared with an eocene map of globe showing where each came from in lower left a life reconstruction of afrotarsius is shown several hypotheses compete to explain geographic origins of simians of two most popular views one hypothesis states that simians originated in asia while other favors africa as their place of origin both their ancient origins and sparse fossil record in africa and asia complicate debate convergent evolution also makes it difficult for researchers to determine relationships between fossils also earliest fossils which do not match up with molecular clock estimates for simian origins have been found in both afro arabia and asia at time both land masses would have been separated by tethys sea oldest undisputed simians from africa also date to late middle eocene afrotarsius was found in dur at escarpment in libya which dates to 38 39 million years ago and also contains and although diverse these primates were all very small in size much like eosimiids simian classification for older fossils from africa are more contested altiatlasius oldest suspected fossil primate known from late paleocene of morocco is too fragmentary to ascertain its true affinities was popularly considered an early middle eocene simian however less fragmentary remains uncovered between 2003 and 2009 suggest it was a type of a group of strepsirrhine primates likely related to lemuriform primates lemurs and lorisoids according to team who discovered afrasia headed by jean jacques jaeger similarities in tooth morphology body size and age suggest a phylogenetic relationship with afrotarsius despite geographic separation they suggested that simians from asia dispersed across tethys sea to africa around middle eocene giving rise to afrotarsius a reverse migration as suggested by african origins hypothesis for simians is not favored due to close phylogenetic relationship between older asian eosimiids and afrasia however to explain origins of and crown simians from african fossil record a higher simian clade also needed to disperse from asia to africa before late middle eocene since neither afrasia nor afrotarsius could have given rise to this group such dispersals from asia to africa were not uncommon since hystricognathous rodents anthracotheres and possibly other mammalian fauna from asia arrived around same time anatomy afrasia is known from four isolated teeth a first upper molar m1 with a length of 2 13 mm and width of 3 06 mm a second upper molar m2 holotype of 2 27 mm by 3 35 mm a second lower molar m2 of 2 09 mm by 1 41 mm and a third lower molar m3 of 2 05 mm by 1 27 mm like other eosimiiforms it was a small primate that weighed around which is estimated based on measurements of its m2 and m1 respectively it is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and afrotarsius in particular some distinguishing features are well developed small cusps conules on upper molars variable development of lingual cingulum a shelf on inner or lingual side of tooth of upper molars and unreduced talonid posterior portion on m3 its teeth are smaller than those of eosimiids phenacopithecus bahinia and phileosimias m2 is similar to that of eosimiids and almost identical to that of afrotarsius libycus it shows well developed small accessory cusps and metaconule that are connected to equally well developed crests conules are stronger than in eosimias and bahinia but weaker than in phileosimias stylar shelf outer area of tooth is broad particularly at metacone cusp however shelf is better developed near paracone cusp in afrasia than in afrotarsius which makes ectoflexus an invagination in outer wall of tooth more symmetrical in former parastyle a small cusp in outer front corner of tooth is located more buccally towards outer side of tooth than in afrotarsius and is larger stylar shelf is larger than that of bahinia and phileosimias but smaller than that of eosimias parastyle is also less developed than in eosimias but protocone main cusp on lingual side of tooth is more expansive lingual cingulum is incomplete it is stronger in phenacopithecus m1 is similar to m2 but somewhat smaller ectoflexus is less apparent stylar shelf is narrower there is no crest behind metaconule and lingual cingulum is continuous condition of parastyle more closely resembles that in afrotarsius in m2 trigonid front portion of tooth consists of three very distinct cusps paraconid at front and behind it paired protoconid on buccal side and metaconid on lingual side these three cusps are less discrete in afrotarsius paraconid is distinct from crest that connects it to protoconid and is located more lingually than in afrotarsius between this cusp and metaconid behind it central basin of trigonid is open towards lingual margin of tooth protoconid has a v shape with one arm reaching towards metaconid and other towards paraconid back portion of tooth talonid is broader eosimias has a narrower talonid main cusps buccal hypoconid and lingual entoconid are opposite each other on margins of tooth entoconid is further to front in phenacopithecus a crest cristid obliqua connects front side of hypoconid to protoconid it is nearly in line with main axis of tooth contrasting with its more diagonal position in eosimias and phenacopithecus a crest descends from hypoconid along back margin of tooth and almost reaches entoconid which is separated by a notch it incorporates third talonid cusp hypoconulid which is indistinct in afrasia in afrotarsius and eosimiids except pakistani phileosimias this crest reaches entoconid there is a cingulum or shelf on buccal side of m2 last lower molar m3 is smaller and has a longer talonid with a well developed hypoconulid lobe at back and generally resembles that of phenacopithecus but trigonid is smaller paraconid is distinct hypoconulid lobe is longer than in afrotarsius and entoconid is located further to front unlike on m2 there is no notch between hypoconulid and entoconid though a shallow valley is present range and ecology afrasia has only been found in eocene pondaung formation of central myanmar a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating this places it at end of bartonian stage near middle late eocene boundary although many tons of sediments in area have been screened for fossils afrasia is still known only from four teeth suggesting that it was a rare species since fossils were first discovered there in 1916 a rich fossil fauna has been recovered in pondaung formation in addition to afrasia primates found there include eosimiid bahinia amphipithecids and and sivaladapids and references literature cited external links press release discovery of a new middle eocene primate from myanmar and initial
