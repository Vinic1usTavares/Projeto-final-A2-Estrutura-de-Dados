development and writing early development of script began while kurt wimmer was doing interviews promoting equilibrium in a november 2002 interview he discussed what scripts he was working on he stated that i have several scripts foremost of which is one called far reaching philosophy of edwin a salt kind of a high action spy thriller in another interview wimmer described project as very much about me and my wife plot incorporated many elements from equilibrium with an oppressive and paranoid political system of brainwashing that gets overthrown by one of its high ranking members who rebels due to an emotional transformation with shortened title edwin a salt script was sold to columbia pictures in january 2007 by july 2007 script had attracted attention of tom cruise terry george was first director to join project and he also did some revisions to script but he soon left project peter berg was next director to consider but he too eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons a year later it was confirmed that phillip noyce would direct noyce was attracted to salt for its espionage themes which are present in most of his filmography as well as tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence yet also does what he was previously accused of casting file liev schreiber 2012 jpg thumb left schreiber was chosen for his hidden emotionality and his performance in defiance alt liev schreiber initial discussions took place in 2008 between tom cruise and noyce about cruise playing edwin a salt these discussions were ongoing for more than a year between pair and their representatives it was finally decided that cruise was unable to commit to script because he feared that character was too close to his mission impossible character ethan hunt cruise decided to work on knight and day instead filmmakers tried to differentiate character from hunt but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change characteristics of salt noyce said but you know he had a valid point it was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he d already played it s like playing brother or cousin of somebody that you played in another movie columbia pictures executive amy pascal suggested angelina jolie to noyce who had often spoken to jolie in past about a desire to create a female spy franchise pascal even invited jolie for a bond girl role but actress playfully replied that she was more interested in playing james bond himself instead jolie was sent salts script in september 2008 and liked it wimmer noyce and producer lorenzo di bonaventura went to visit jolie at her home in france to discuss a possible script and character change writer brian helgeland helped with character development and dialogue of script based on notes that came out of those discussions with jolie and to accompany gender change title character s name was changed to evelyn salt one of jolie s requests was to rework third act which originally had salt rescue his wife and son from a coalition of villains because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation wimmer decided to then make salt more crucial to villain s schemes and add a sequence where salt breaks into a place harder than fort knox after considering camp david wimmer settled on white house when asked if script written for cruise was same for jolie he said i think that it s just been a continual process obviously accelerating by changing central character but ideas locomotive of ideas that drive film are same an undercover cia operative is accused of being a russian mole and has to go on run to defend himself that s been same since day one tone of film has changed in this evolution in same way i guess as you know action thrillers have changed along lines of bond films and bourne films on february 19 2009 it was reported that liev schreiber would play role of ted winter evelyn salt s friend and colleague in cia three days later chiwetel ejiofor named as cia officer peabody who is in pursuit of salt noyce said ejiofor whom he first saw in dirty pretty things seemed to have intelligence and disarming sort of obsessiveness that a counter intelligence officer would need august diehl who played salt s husband mike krause came after a recommendation from jolie s partner brad pitt who had worked with diehl in inglourious basterds and daniel olbrychski was chosen for orlov because andrei konchalovsky told noyce that such an evil russian character could only be played by a polish actor filming on a budget of 110 million principal photography took place mostly on location in new york city and washington d c from march to june 2009 noyce decided to avoid typical post card views of washington dc to reflect more day to day environment of massive federal buildings inhabited by typical bureaucrat opening sequence in north korea was shot at floyd bennett field with an extra who had experience with prisoner exchange acting as a consultant salt s rendezvous with orlov was shot on frying pan a former lighthouse ship now moored in hudson river at 26th street in new york outside of ka training facility was monastery in russia while interior was russian orthodox cathedral of holy virgin protection in new york s east village filming for a chase sequence took place in albany on water street near interstate 787 ramp between april and may studio production took place at grumman studios in bethpage long island new york while film was in post production di bonaventura became dissatisfied with some scenes steven zaillian was brought for uncredited rewrites and reshoots mostly of action scenes were held in new york during january 2010 filming also took place in upper manhattan s neighborhood washington heights on 157th st and riverside dr some scenes were also filmed outside of manhattan including bronx queens staten island and in westchester county after jolie had just given birth to twins she spent time training before filming to get fit in order to perform almost all of stunts herself bonaventura said she is so prepared and so ready and gung ho she ll do any stunt we had her jumping out of helicopters shooting jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate salt s fighting style was described as a mixture of muay thai shaolin kung fu and jeet kune do which was considered by stunt team most suitable for jolie s physique and krav maga for its rawness and aggressiveness noyce wanted to film scene where salt hangs from edge of building in a studio with chroma key but jolie insisted on doing it herself in actual location on may 29 2009 filming was temporarily halted after jolie suffered a minor head injury during filming an action scene she was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on same day with no serious injuries allowing filming to resume salt s escape after being captured in st bartholomew s originally involved her jumping off a building into a window cleaning machine but budgetary constraints caused scene to be changed into a car chase computer generated imagery cgi was used extensively throughout film to create environments and elements such as bullet holes and flames more dangerous objects such as a taser or handcuffs used to strangle winter were also made from cgi five companies were responsible for visual effects two most involved were cis vancouver and framestore cis vancouver recreated white house since crew did not have permission to shoot in building and made a digital elevator shaft for scene where salt goes down into white house bunker framestore was responsible for assassination attempt on russian president which combined actual shots of st bartholomew s church a digital recreation of church s interior and scenes with actor olek krupa falling down a collapsing floor female cia officers were consulted about creation of disguises leading to scene where salt undergoes subtle changes to disguise herself as a czech sweet and caring blonde salt dyeing her hair black would represent shift to menacing russian agent for scene where salt disguises herself as a major pictures of angelina jolie were treated on adobe photoshop to create a believable male version with resulting image being used by make up team as an inspiration for prosthetics versions director phillip noyce has said that due to extensive usage of flashbacks there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into theatrical version film ended up having two extra versions director s cut and extended cut which noyce refers to in his audio commentary as film s original cut both included on dvd and blu ray disc deluxe editions director s cut was described by noyce as my own personal take on material free from politics and restrictions of producers studio or censorship ratings four minutes of film are added leading to a running time of 104 minutes more flashbacks are added and violence is amped up for example mike being drowned rather than shot to death ending is also different in bunker scene winter shoots president instead of only knocking him unconscious and a media report during final scene reports that new us president had been orphaned on a family visit to russia implying he is also a sleeper agent noyce has described this ending as an ending yet just a beginning and it s an ending that turns whole story on its head extended cut increases running time by only one minute but rewrites plot by removing rearranging and adding scenes ending has salt escaping from cia custody and going to russia where she kills orlov his death scene at barge doesn t appear in this cut along with facility where new child spies are being trained being blown up at end of cut original motion picture soundtrack was released on july 20 2010 on itunes and on august 11 2010 as on demand cd r from amazon com music was composed by james newton howard and released by madison gate records song orlov s story includes a russian lullaby which music editor joe e rand found at amoeba music and which served as inspiration for choir heard in other tracks but chants in rest of score are only random syllables as rand and howard thought actual russian words would be a spoil about salt s allegiance track listing release thumb right jolie at moscow

coincidence of salt getting released shortly after reveal of real russian sleeper agents in illegals program with a few comparing salt to one of agents anna chapman thumb left jolie at san diego comic con in 2010 on salt panel actress performance was considered one of film s strong points alt a woman in front of a microphone kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter said that while preposterous at every turn salt is a better bond movie than most recent bond movies as its makers keep stunts real and severely limit cgi gimmickry chicago sun times critic roger ebert gave film four stars his maximum saying salt is a damn fine thriller it s gloriously absurd this movie has holes in it big enough to drive whole movie through laws of physics seem to be suspended here same way as in a road runner cartoon time magazine reviewer richard corliss praised action scenes and noyce s persistence in keeping a serious tone he ignores story s preposterous elements and lets audience decide whether to laugh shudder or both empire s william thomas praised jolie s performance remarking that when it comes to selling incredible crazy death defying antics jolie has few peers in action business and village voices karina longworth considered that original star tom cruise would never express protagonist s ambiguity as well as jolie among negative responses new yorkers david denby said salt is as impersonal an action thriller as we ve seen in years finding supporting cast tricky plot locks them into purely functional responses claudia puig of usa today considered film a by book thriller with jolie s performance as only distinguished feature lawrence of charlotte observer was mostly critical of writing describing film as absurd overplotted and incoherent and saying villainous schemes would have been called off 20 years ago at latest when soviet union dissolved steven rea of philadelphia inquirer described salt as commendably swift and progressively inane saying script was a sloppy concoction of story elements from 70s espionage classics that ended up not working right with its nonsensical setups and wildly illogical twists james berardinelli of reelviews considered that while film was fast paced and action scenes competently shot plot was predictable and spy aspects which are by far most intriguing elements of movie are shunted aside in favor of spectacular stunts and long chases received one academy award nomination for best sound mixing jeffrey j haboush greg p russell scott millan and william which it lost to inception film won best action adventure film at saturn

loved that character and would love to explore character some more first and foremost noyce later said he had other projects and would not participate those 3 blu ray disc cuts represent just about
