simeon hymn is sung to a melody by wolfgang dachstein written before 1530 friedrich spitta revised lyrics in 1898 and added a third stanza his revision transformed englisch s prayer of an individual

catholic hymnal as gl 216 it appears in several other hymnals history development of hymn spans four stages within history of christianity its initial inspiration draws from account of jesus being presented at temple 40 days after his birth in a ritual of purification depicted in gospel of luke on that occasion simeon praised light that appeared by baby centuries later simeon s canticle became a regular part of liturgy of hours as nunc dimittis especially connected to feast of purification thirdly during reformation was used as a prayer of thanks after communion as documented in a nordlingen liturgy of 1522 and a strasbourg liturgy of 1524 latter specifically calling for its use after meal or communion rhyming paraphrase created by johann englisch or first appearing in 1527 on a now lost leaflet became a regular part of strasbourg hymnals from 1530 on his version retains theme of with its ideas of rest in peace after having seen light of a saviour who came for all people and especially israel hymn is sung to a melody attributed to wolfgang dachstein written before 1530 it is one of three hymns described as simeon s song of praise appearing in an 1848 collection of treasure of protestant church singing in first century of reformation first two are biblical canticle in martin luther s translation and luther s paraphrase followed by a footnote marks three songs as also suitable for funerals thumb upright friedrich spitta finally in 1898 friedrich spitta a protestant theologian revised song and added a third stanza which is now usually placed between older stanzas he shifted meaning from an individual prayer for a good death to a communal prayer for a meaningful life focus is on communion as a way for believers to see light of christ and thereby live in peace and unity with additional minor changes this version of hymn is part of german protestant hymnal as eg 222 an ecumenical song it is also part of current catholic hymnal as gl 216 in section songs week communion thanks after communion it appears in several other hymnals text text of hymn is as follows on left as in s 1848 publication which shows englisch s two stanzas on right text from current german hymnals englisch s lyrics are a close paraphrase of about being able to go in peace after having seen light of saviour simeon said so after actually seeing baby jesus 40 days after his birth and for him departing in peace could mean readiness to die englisch begins in first person addressing god as his lord who prays to be allowed to rest in god s peace spitta transfers thought to a more general meaning of travelling one s roads after having seen light adding that his mercy is unmeasurable second stanza in englisch s version is a paraphrase of second part of simeon s canticle mentioning dear guest alluding to jesus for all people including heathen and for greatness of israel spitta changes focus identifying singer with guest instead of referring to jesus invited to a rich meal of mercy meal offers bread of life which joins invited believers to god and among each other a reason to praise filled with sense and courage heathen and israel are not mentioned in his version final stanza is a prayer for love and faithfulness in god connecting us all so that hand and mouth will show friendliness of lord until after this time all may find a seat at his table lyrics follow a pattern of two rhyming short lines followed by a longer line repeated three times in a stanza with three longer lines all rhyming melodies from 1530 hymn was associated with a melody attributed to wolfgang dachstein tune has an element often found in strasbourg melodies a rhythm of long short short long here used for short lines first two long lines begin with a long note followed by a sequence of equally short notes ending on two long notes first line begins with lowest note and rises a fourth step by step other short lines have similar patterns such as equal lines which begin second and third section moving a fourth downward last section begins an octave higher than second ends a feature often found in contemporary strasbourg melodies especially by matthaus sometimes accentuating a bar form s last line beginning like first line is only one which has a melisma in dachstein s composition it stresses last word by dotted notes rising to an octave above first note stressed word in first stanza is seen and in second people meaning israel shortly before end of melisma a ligature typical for german melodies of 16th century moves around second to last note then released to key note while it is usually difficult to find a relation between words and music in strophic texts it can be assumed that peace is expressed by calm movement up and down in symmetry last rising line might even be experienced as an expression of a vision of god although it seems unlikely that composer had that in mind long and complex last line is difficult for congregational singing and later versions therefore often abbreviate melisma in various ways an 1899 hymnal for alsace lorraine has a version with only ligature before end version in today s hymnals however first publication of spitta s text came with dachstein s melody musical settings samuel composed a four part choral setting in 1606 published by carus verlag herbert composed a setting for three parts in 1953 in 1980 aldo clementi
