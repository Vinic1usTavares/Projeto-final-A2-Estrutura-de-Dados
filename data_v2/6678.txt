beck s bolero is a rock instrumental recorded by english guitarist jeff beck in 1966 it is beck s first solo recording and has been described as one of great rock instrumentals epic in scope harmonically and rhythmically ambitious yet infused with primal energy beck s bolero features a prominent melody with multiple guitar parts propelled by a rhythm inspired by ravel s bolero recording session brought together a group of musicians including jimmy page keith moon john paul jones and nicky hopkins who later agreed that line up was a first attempt at what became led zeppelin however there is an ongoing disagreement over composer as well as producer credits despite being credited solely to page beck claims that he made significant contributions to composition likewise page and simon napier bell each claim to have produced it while mickie most received credit beck s bolero was not released until ten months after recording and then only as b side to beck s first single when it finally received greater exposure on beck s debut album truth in latter part of 1968 it was still considered quite advanced even though it was over two years old beck continues to perform it and several renditions have been recorded by other musicians background recording session for beck s bolero was conceived of as a side project for jeff beck while he was a member of yardbirds it was decided that it would be a good idea for me to record some of my own stuff partly to stop me moaning about yardbirds beck recalled also yardbirds management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to band through success in solo projects studio time was booked for may 1966 at ibc studios in london to prepare for session beck called on long time friend and studio guitarist jimmy page who had recommended beck as eric clapton s replacement in yardbirds to work up some ideas for songs to record although there is a disagreement over credits for composition both beck and page agree that page began by playing some chords on a twelve string guitar using a rhythm based on bolero bolero is a one movement orchestral piece composed by maurice ravel in 1928 and is built on a persistent repeating motif supported by a snare drum re creating spanish bolero dance pattern for full orchestra according to beck biographer martin power a melody line for guitar was developed along with a middle section to break up rhythm reminiscent of yardbirds arrangements for for your love and shapes of things with at least outline of one song and page on board to play guitar beck approached keith moon of who whom he considered one of his favourite drummers moon was unhappy with who at time and readily agreed to participate to avoid a confrontation with pete townshend and kit lambert who s manager moon wished to do so incognito he recommended bandmate john entwistle who was similarly discontented with who to provide bass recording 200px left thumb jeff beck at fillmore east 1968 recording session took place at ibc studios on 16 and 17 may 1966 although a date after beck left yardbirds in november 1966 has also been suggested moon arrived at studio disguised in sunglasses and a russian cossack hat when entwistle did not show studio musicians john paul jones and nicky hopkins were brought in at last minute to provide bass and piano there is an unsubstantiated account that ritchie blackmore may have been involved at studio but his participation has not been acknowledged by beck page or others at session napier bell yardbirds producer who had originally promoted idea was present for recording for guitar parts beck used a gibson les paul played through a vox ac30 amplifier and page played a fender electric xii twelve string electric guitar halfway through song moon smashed drum microphone with his stick you can actually hear him screaming as he does it beck remembered so all you can hear from then on is cymbals after moon and napier bell left beck and page added overdubs and sound treatments to complete track according to beck two or three songs were recorded at session but beck s bolero was only track released composition beck s bolero is roughly divided into three parts first begins with a reworking of ravel s two chord progression transposed to key of a power points out that by using a 12 string guitar page is able to take advantage of instrument s rich chiming quality to emulate distinct orchestral bolero sound beck then introduces melody line on electric guitar with a fuzz tone effect producing indefinite sustain alternating between major and minor modes it is described as haunting by power and as a distinctive piercing sinister tone by critic richie unterberger in second section piano bass and drums come in and tension builds unterberger describes third section as suddenly set ting off from main motif into a beautiful serene section highlighting slide glissando guitars with beck s echo laden slide sounding similar to a steel guitar fourth section returns to main melody with overlaid drawn out descending slide according to beck phasing was jimmy s idea i played a load of waffle and he reversed it tension mounts as moon adds drum flourishes climaxing with a break second part begins with moon s simultaneous drum break and scream and launches in different hard rock direction it was my idea to cut off in middle yardbirds style beck commented keith upped tempo and gave it an extra kick it s like a bit of who a bit of yardbirds and a bit of me amply distorted guitar provides a thick toned descending riff according to power he also describes break inspired by yardbirds rave up technique as eerily ing coming era of hard rock and heavy metal third part returns to main motif with added guitar fills melody line is abandoned in second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects including phasing echo and controlled feedback it concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock style lead guitar and an abrupt ending releases right 280px thumb later columbia single pressing with j page composer credit record release of beck s bolero was delayed for ten months when jeff beck began his solo career

and it is his name that appears on credits for all but initial release nonetheless beck has claimed credit for his contributions to composition both beck and page agree that page came up with bolero influenced chords and rhythm however beck specifically claims that key features of instrumental haunting melody line and second part hard rock break are his beck adds that break contains first heavy metal riff ever written and i wrote it while not addressing specifics page asserts i wrote it played on it produced it and i don t give a damn what jeff says that s truth but adds slide bits are his
