thumb right a ceremony worshipping sarcophagus of osiris depicted in a fresco in temple of isis at pompeii from 1st century ce death of osiris was a prominent motif in cult of isis sarcophagus s appearance here may refer to emphasis on osiris and afterlife found in mysteries dedicated to isis mysteries of isis were religious initiation rites performed in cult of goddess isis in greco roman world they were modeled on other mystery rites particularly eleusinian mysteries in honor of greek goddess demeter and originated sometime between third century bce and second century ce despite their mainly hellenistic origins mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient egyptian religion in which worship of isis arose by undergoing mystery rites initiates signaled their dedication to isis although they were not required to worship her exclusively rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth and they may have been thought to guarantee that initiate s soul with goddess s help would continue after death in a blissful afterlife many texts from roman empire refer to mysteries of isis but only source to describe them is a work of fiction novel golden ass written in second century ce by apuleius in it initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into innermost part of isis s temple where he has an intense religious experience seeing gods in person some aspects of mysteries of isis and of other mystery cults particularly their connection with afterlife resemble important elements of christianity question of whether mysteries influenced christianity is controversial and evidence is unclear some scholars today attribute similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence in contrast apuleius s account has had direct effects in modern times through his description mysteries of isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations as well as a widespread though false belief that ancient egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations origins thumb upright roman statue of isis 2nd century ce greco roman mysteries were secret initiation rituals into which people entered voluntarily they were dedicated to a particular deity or group of deities and they used a variety of intense experiences such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise that induced a state of disorientation and an intense religious experience some of them involved cryptic symbolism initiates were not supposed to discuss some of details of what they experienced in mysteries and modern understanding of these rites is limited by this secrecy most prestigious mysteries in greek world were eleusinian mysteries dedicated to goddess demeter which were performed at eleusis near athens from at least sixth century bce to end of fourth century ce they centered on demeter s search for her daughter persephone in greek mythology eleusinian initiates passed into a dark hall and were subjected to terrifying sights followed by a fiery light and a shout from hierophant who presided over ceremony by this light initiates saw objects that represented demeter s power over fertility such as a sheaf of wheat and perhaps other images that referred to myth of persephone in mysteries of god dionysus which were performed in many places across greek world participants celebrated in a frenzy at night in open air dionysian celebrations were connected in some way with a group of mystical beliefs about nature of afterlife isis was originally a goddess in ancient egyptian religion which did not include greek style mysteries some egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests out of public view but ordinary egyptians were never permitted to join in ancient egyptian funerary texts contained knowledge about duat or underworld that was characterized as secret and was meant to help deceased souls reach a pleasant afterlife some egyptologists such as jan assmann have suggested some of these texts may also have been used in rituals that consecrated priests but other egyptologists contest idea that funerary texts were ever used in rituals by living other rituals may have reenacted events from egyptian mythology such as ceremonies in honor of osiris god of afterlife and mythological husband of isis that were performed at abydos greeks interpreted these myth based rituals as mysteries herodotus a greek historian writing in fifth century bce was first to do so he referred to egyptian rites reenacting myth of murder of osiris as mysteries likening them to mysteries of dionysus that he was familiar with he further said that greek worship of dionysus was influenced by worship of osiris in egypt various greek writers who came after herodotus viewed egypt and its priests as source of all mystical wisdom they claimed that many elements of greek philosophy and culture came from egypt including mystery cults classicist walter burkert and egyptologist francesco both say there is a grain of truth in these claims as oldest greek mystery cults developed in seventh and sixth centuries bce at same time that greece was developing closer contacts with egyptian culture imagery of afterlife found in mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in egyptian afterlife beliefs isis was one of many non greek deities whose cults became part of greek and roman religion during hellenistic period 323 30 bce when greek people and culture spread to lands across mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by roman republic under influence of greco roman tradition some of these cults including that of isis developed their own mystery rites mysteries of isis could have emerged as far back as early third century bce after greek ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of egypt ptolemies promoted cult of god serapis who incorporated traits of osiris and of greek deities like dionysus and underworld god pluto isis s cult was conjoined with that of serapis she too was reinterpreted to resemble greek goddesses particularly demeter while retaining many of her egyptian characteristics mysteries of isis modeled on those in demeter s honor at eleusis could have been developed at same time as part of this mingling of greek and egyptian religion another possibility is that mysteries developed after isis s hellenized cult reached greece itself later in third century bce much of early evidence of isis worship in greece comes from aretalogies poems in praise of goddess wording of aretalogies from maroneia and andros both from first century bce closely links isis with mystery rites petra says that these aretalogies prove mysteries of isis existed by that time but jan bremmer argues that they only connect isis with eleusinian mysteries not with distinctive rites of her own stronger evidence for mysteries of isis is found in first century ce and they certainly existed in second temples to isis in greece may have developed their mysteries in response to widespread belief that greek mystery cults had originated with isis and osiris in egypt they could have adapted elements of eleusinian rites and perhaps dionysian mysteries as well to reflect egyptian mythology end product would have seemed to greeks like an authentic egyptian precursor to greek mysteries many greco roman sources claim that isis herself devised these rites even once mysteries were established they were not performed everywhere isis s cult was present only known sites for her mystery cult were in italy greece and anatolia although she was worshipped in nearly every province of roman empire in egypt itself only a few texts and images from roman period refer to mysteries of isis and it is not certain that they were ever performed there apuleius s description of mysteries thumb priestess of isis holding a a bronze jug 2nd century ce context and reliability several texts from roman times refer to people who were initiated in isis cult however only direct description of mysteries of isis comes from golden ass also known as metamorphoses a comic novel from late second century ce by roman author apuleius novel s protagonist is lucius a man who has been magically transformed into a donkey in eleventh and last book of novel lucius after falling asleep on beach at cenchreae in greece wakes to see full moon he prays to moon using names of several moon goddesses known in greco roman world asking her to restore him to human form isis appears in a vision before lucius and declares herself greatest of all goddesses she tells him that a festival in her honor isidis is taking place nearby and that festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them after lucius becomes human again high priest at festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by goddess and that he will now be free of inquisitiveness and self indulgence that drew him into many of misadventures he has experienced lucius joins local temple of isis becomes her devoted follower and eventually undergoes initiation lucius s apparently solemn devotion to isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with comic misadventures that make up rest of novel scholars debate whether account is intended to seriously represent lucius s devotion to goddess or whether it is ironic perhaps a satire of isis cult those who believe it is satirical point to way lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations each requiring a fee despite having little money although many of scholars who have tried to analyze mysteries based on book have assumed it is serious book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical apuleius s description of isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of outside evidence about them s j harrison says it shows detailed knowledge of egyptian cult whether or not apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of isiac religion in another of his works apologia apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations though he does not mention mysteries of isis specifically in writing golden ass he may have drawn on personal experience of isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent even so detailed description given in golden ass may be idealized rather than strictly accurate and isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities although only first is described in any detail rites according to golden ass initiation was performed in manner of voluntary death and salvation obtained by favor only isis herself could determine who should be initiated and when thus lucius only begins preparing for mysteries after isis appears to him in a dream implication that isis was thought to command her followers directly is supported by pausanias a greek writer in same era as apuleius who said no one was allowed to participate in isis s festivals in her shrine at without her inviting them in a dream and by inscriptions in which priests of isis write that she called them to become her servants in apuleius s description goddess also determines how much initiate must pay to temple in order to undergo rites priests in lucius s initiation read procedure for rite from a ritual book kept in temple that is covered in unknown characters some of which are shapes of all sorts of animals while others are ornate and abstract use of a book for ritual purposes was much more common in egyptian religion than in greek or roman tradition and characters in this book are often thought to be hieroglyphs or hieratic which in eyes of greek and roman worshippers would emphasize egyptian background of rite and add to its solemnity however david frankfurter suggests that they are akin to deliberately unintelligible magical symbols that were commonly used in greco roman magic before initiation proper lucius must undergo a series of ritual purifications priest bathes him asks gods for forgiveness on his behalf and sprinkles him with water this confession of and repentance for past sins fits with an emphasis on chastity and other forms of self denial found in many other sources about isis cult lucius next has to wait ten days while abstaining from meat and wine before initiation begins purifying baths were common in many rituals across greco roman world plea for forgiveness however may derive from oaths that egyptian priests were required to take in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing sprinkling with water and refraining from certain foods probably come from purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple on evening of final day lucius receives a variety of unspecified gifts from fellow devotees of isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering deepest part of temple description of what happens next is deliberately cryptic lucius reminds reader that uninitiated are not allowed to know details of mystery rites before describing his experience in vague terms i came to boundary of death and having trodden on threshold of proserpina i travelled through all elements and returned in middle of night i saw sun flashing with bright light i came face to face with gods below and gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand in a series of paradoxes then lucius travels to underworld and to heavens sees sun amid darkness and approaches gods many people have speculated about how ritual simulated these impossible experiences first sentence indicates that initiate is supposed to be passing through greek underworld but surviving remains of roman temples to isis have no subterranean corridors that might have simulated underworld bright sun lucius mentions may have been a fire in darkness similar to one at climax of eleusinian mysteries gods he saw face to face may have been statues or frescoes of deities some scholars believe that initiation also entailed some kind of reenactment of or reference to death of osiris but if it did apuleius s text does not mention it lucius emerges from this experience in morning and priests dress him in an elaborately embroidered cloak he then stands on a dais carrying a torch and wearing a crown of palm leaves adorned like sun and set up in manner of a divine statue as apuleius describes it priests draw back curtains to reveal lucius to a crowd of his fellow devotees during next three days lucius enjoys a series of banquets and sacred meals with his fellow worshippers completing initiation process after this initiation lucius moves to rome and joins its main temple to goddess urged by more visions sent by gods he undergoes two more initiations incurring more expenses such as having to buy a replacement for cloak he left behind at cenchreae each time these initiations are not described in as much detail as first second is dedicated to osiris and is said to be different from one dedicated to isis apuleius calls it nocturnal mysteries of foremost god but gives no other details third initiation may be dedicated to both isis and osiris before this initiation lucius has a vision where osiris himself speaks to him suggesting that he is dominant figure in rite at novel s end lucius has been admitted to a high position in cult by osiris himself and he is confident that god will ensure his future success in his work as a lawyer significance religious symbolism and contact with gods most mystery rites were connected with myths about deities they focused on osiris myth in case of isis and they claimed to convey to initiates details about myths that were not generally known in addition various greco roman writers produced theological and philosophical interpretations of mysteries spurred by fragmentary evidence modern scholars have often tried to discern what mysteries may have meant to their initiates but hugh bowden argues that there may have been no single authoritative interpretation of mystery rites and that desire to identify a lost secret something that once it is correctly identified will explain what a mystery cult was all about is bound to fail he regards effort to meet gods directly exemplified by climax of lucius s initiation in golden ass as most important feature of rites notion of meeting gods face to face contrasted with classical greek and roman beliefs in which seeing gods though it might be an awe inspiring experience could be dangerous and even deadly in greek mythology for example sight of zeus s true form incinerated mortal woman semele yet lucius s meeting with gods fits with a trend found in various religious groups in roman times toward a closer connection between worshipper and gods ancient egyptian beliefs are one possible source for understanding symbolism in mysteries of isis j gwyn griffiths an egyptologist and classical scholar extensively studied book 11 of golden ass and its possible egyptian background he pointed out similarities between first initiation in golden ass and egyptian afterlife beliefs saying that initiate took on role of osiris by undergoing symbolic death in his view imagery of initiation refers to egyptian underworld duat griffiths argued that sun in middle of night in lucius s account of initiation might have been influenced by contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites but it derived mainly from depictions of underworld in ancient egyptian funerary texts according to these texts sun god ra passes through underworld each night and unites with osiris to emerge renewed just as deceased souls do however authors of a more recent commentary on book 11 caution that solar and underworld imagery could be based solely on greek and roman precedents and they doubt griffiths s assertion that lucius undergoes a mystical union with osiris elements that lucius passes through in first initiation may refer to classical elements of earth air water and fire that were believed to make up world or to regions of cosmos in either case it indicates that lucius s vision transports him beyond human world suggests word refers specifically to planets in hellenistic astrology astrological themes appeared in many other cults in roman empire including another mystery cult dedicated to mithras in isis cult astrological symbolism may have alluded to belief that isis governed movements of stars and thus passage of time and order of cosmos beliefs that lucius refers to when praying to goddess however in course of book as valentino gasparini puts it osiris explicitly snatches out of isis s hands role of supreme being and replaces her as focus of lucius s devotion osiris s prominence in golden ass is in keeping with other evidence about isis cult in rome which suggests that it adopted more themes and imagery from egyptian funerary religion and gave increasing prominence to osiris in late 1st and early 2nd centuries ce gasparini argues that shift in focus in book reflects a belief that osiris was supreme being and isis was an intermediary between him and humanity this interpretation is found in essay on isis and osiris by first century ce greek author plutarch which analyzes osiris myth based on plutarch s own middle platonist philosophy and gasparini suggests that apuleius shared it however s j harrison suggests that sudden switch of focus from isis to osiris is simply a satire of grandiose claims of religious devotion commitment to cult because not all local cults of isis held mystery rites not all her devotees would have undergone initiation nevertheless both apuleius s story and plutarch s on isis and osiris suggest that initiation was considered part of larger process of joining cult and dedicating oneself to goddess isis cult like most in greco roman world was not exclusive worshippers of isis could continue to revere other gods as well devotees of isis were among very few religious groups in greco roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves loosely equivalent to jew or christian that might indicate they defined themselves by their exclusive devotion to goddess however word or isiac was rarely used many priests of isis officiated in other cults as well several people in late roman times like joined multiple priesthoods and underwent several initiations dedicated to different gods mystery initiations thus did not require devotees to abandon whatever religious identity they originally had and they would not qualify as religious conversions under a narrow definition of term however some of these initiations did involve smaller changes in religious identity such as joining a new community of worshippers or strengthening devotees commitment to a cult they were already part of that would qualify as conversions in a broader sense many ancient sources both written by isiacs and by outside observers suggest that many of isis s devotees considered her focus of their lives and that cult emphasized moral purity self denial and public declarations of devotion to goddess joining isis s cult was therefore a sharper change in identity than in many other mystery cults isiac initiation by giving devotee a dramatic mystical experience of goddess added emotional intensity to process book does not say how initiation may have affected a devotee s rank within cult after going through his third initiation lucius becomes a pastophoros a member of a particular class of priests if third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros it is possible that members moved up in cult hierarchy by going through series of initiations nevertheless apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within cult initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one connection with afterlife many pieces of evidence suggest that mysteries of isis were connected in some way to salvation and guarantee of an afterlife greek conception of afterlife included paradisiacal elysian fields and philosophers developed various ideas about immortality of soul but greeks and romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death in both greek and roman traditional religion no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions but evidence about those cults afterlife beliefs is vague apuleius s account if it is accurate provides stronger evidence for isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for other cults book says isis s power over fate which her greek and roman devotees frequently mentioned gives her control over life and death according to priest who initiates lucius devotees of isis who had finished their life s span and were already standing on threshold of light s end if only they could safely be trusted with great unspoken mysteries of cult were frequently drawn forth by goddess power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on course of renewed life in another passage isis herself says that when lucius dies he will be able to see her shining in darkness of underworld and worship her there some scholars are skeptical afterlife was a major focus of cult ramsay macmullen says that when characters in golden ass call lucius reborn they refer to his new life as a devotee and never call him in aeternam or eternally reborn which would refer to afterlife mary beard john north and simon price say golden ass shows that cult of isis had implications for life and death but even so more emphasis is placed on extending span of life than on after life which is pictured in fairly undifferentiated terms some inscriptions provide evidence of isiac afterlife beliefs outside apuleius s work they show that some of isis s followers thought she would guide them to a better afterlife but they also suggest isis cult had no firm picture of afterlife and that isiacs drew upon both greek and egyptian precedents to envision it some inscriptions say that devotees would benefit from osiris s enlivening water while others refer to fortunate isles of greek tradition none of them make specific reference to mystery rites and mysteries may not have been considered necessary for receiving isis s blessing ancient egyptians believed that osiris lived on in duat after death thanks in part to isis s help and that after their deaths they could be revived like him with assistance of other deities including isis these beliefs may well have carried over into greco roman isis cult symbolism found in lucius s first initiation with its references to death and to sun in egyptian underworld suggests that it involved afterlife beliefs even though osiris is not mentioned in description of rite as robert turcan puts it when lucius is revealed to crowd after his initiation he is honoured almost like a new osiris saved and regenerated through ineffable powers of isis palms radiating from his head were signs of sun triumphing over death influence on other traditions possible influence on christianity mysteries of isis like those of other gods continued to be performed into late fourth century ce toward end of century however christian emperors increasingly restricted practice of non christian religions which they condemned as pagan mystery cults thus died out near start of fifth century they existed alongside christianity for centuries before their extinction and some elements of their initiations resembled christian beliefs and practices as a result possibility has often been raised that christianity was directly influenced by mystery cults evidence about interactions between christianity and mystery cults is poor making question difficult to resolve most religious traditions in greco roman world centered on a particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion only public ritual in contrast cult of isis like christianity and some other mystery cults was made up of people who joined voluntarily out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others christianity has its own initiation ritual baptism and beginning in fourth century christians began to refer to their sacraments like baptism with word greek term that was also used for a mystery rite in this case word meant that christians did not discuss their most important rites with non christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them their rites thus acquired some of aura of secrecy that surrounded mystery cults furthermore if isiac initiates were thought to benefit in afterlife from osiris s death and resurrection this belief would parallel christian belief that death and resurrection of jesus make salvation available to those who become christians even in ancient times these similarities were controversial non christians in roman empire in early centuries ce thought christianity and mystery cults resembled each other reacting to these claims by outsiders early christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion 17th century protestant scholar isaac casaubon brought up issue again by accusing catholic church of deriving its sacraments from rituals of mystery cults charles francois dupuis in late 18th century went further by claiming that all christianity originated in mystery cults intensified by religious disputes between protestants catholics and non christians controversy has continued to present day some scholars have specifically compared baptism with isiac initiation described by apuleius before early fourth century ce baptism was culmination of a long process in which convert to christianity fasted for forty days of lent before being immersed at easter in a cistern or natural body of water thus like mysteries of isis early christian baptism involved a days long fast and a washing ritual both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in religions of mediterranean and christian baptism was specifically derived from baptism of jesus and jewish immersion rituals therefore according to hugh bowden these similarities come from shared religious background of christianity and isis cult not from influence of one tradition upon other similarly sacred meals shared by initiates of many mystery cults have been compared with christian rite of communion for instance classicist r e witt called banquet that concluded isiac initiation pagan eucharist of isis and sarapis however feasts in which worshippers ate food that had been sacrificed to a deity were a nearly universal practice in mediterranean religions and do not prove a direct link between christianity and mystery cults most distinctive trait of christian communion belief that god himself was victim of sacrifice was not present in mystery cults bowden doubts that afterlife beliefs were a very important aspect of mystery cults and therefore thinks their resemblance to christianity was small jaime alvar in contrast argues that mysteries of isis along with those of mithras and cybele did involve beliefs about salvation and afterlife that resembled those in christianity but he says they did not become similar by borrowing directly from each other only by adapting in similar ways to greco roman religious environment he says each cult found materials it required in common trough of current ideas each took what it needed and adapted these elements according to its overall drift and design influence in modern times thumb right unveiling of a statue of isis as a personification of nature depicted as climactic moment of an isiac initiation in an 1803 engraving by henry fuseli motifs from apuleius s description of isiac initiation have been repeated and reworked in fiction and in esoteric belief systems in modern times and they thus form an important part of western perception of ancient egyptian religion people reusing these motifs often assume that mystery rites were practiced in egypt long before hellenistic times an influential example is 1731 novel life of sethos by jean terrasson terrasson claimed he had translated this book from an ancient greek work of fiction that was based on real events book was actually his own invention inspired by ancient greek sources that assumed greek philosophers had derived their wisdom from egypt in novel egypt s priests run an elaborate education system like a european university to join their ranks protagonist sethos undergoes an initiation presided over by isis taking place in hidden chambers beneath great pyramid of giza based on lucius s statement in golden ass that he was borne through all elements during his initiation terrasson describes initiation as an elaborate series of ordeals each based on one of classical elements running over hot metal bars for fire swimming a canal for water and swinging through air over a pit divine legation of moses a treatise by anglican theologian william warburton published from 1738 to 1741 included an analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon sethos for much of its evidence assuming that all mystery rites derived from egypt warburton argued that public face of egyptian religion was polytheistic but egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper monotheistic truth to elite initiates one of them moses learned this truth during his egyptian upbringing and developed judaism to reveal it to entire israelite nation freemasons members of a european fraternal organization that attained its modern form in early eighteenth century developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced freemasonry back to ancient times egypt was among civilizations that masons claimed had influenced their traditions after sethos was published several masonic lodges developed rites based on those in novel late in century masonic writers still assuming that sethos was an ancient story used obvious resemblance between their rites and initiation of sethos as evidence of freemasonry s supposedly ancient origin many works of fiction from 1790s to 1820s reused and modified signature traits of terrasson s egyptian initiation trials by three or four elements often taking place under pyramids best known of these works is 1791 opera magic flute by wolfgang amadeus mozart and emmanuel in which main character undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke isis and osiris karl leonhard reinhold a philosopher and freemason writing in 1780s drew upon and modified warburton s claims in an effort to reconcile freemasonry s traditional origin story which traces freemasonry back to ancient israel with its enthusiasm for egyptian imagery he claimed that sentence i am that i am spoken by jewish god in book of exodus had a pantheistic meaning he compared it with an egyptian inscription on a veiled statue of isis recorded by roman era authors plutarch and proclus which said i am all that is was and shall be and argued that isis was a pantheistic personification of nature according to reinhold it was this pantheistic belief system that moses imparted to israelites so that isis and jewish and christian conception of god shared a common origin in contrast some people in wake of of france during french revolution used imagery of a pantheistic isis to represent their opposition to clergy and to christianity in general for instance an esoteric fraternal organization in napoleonic france order regarded isis as their tutelary deity to them she symbolized both modern scientific knowledge which hoped to uncover nature s secrets and mystical wisdom of ancient mystery rites vague set of esoteric beliefs that surrounded goddess offered an alternative to traditional christianity it was during this anticlerical era that dupuis claimed that christianity was a distorted offshoot of ancient mystery cults various esoteric organizations that emerged in late 19th and early 20th centuries such as theosophical society and ancient and mystical order crucis repeated beliefs that had originated with sethos that egyptians underwent initiation within pyramids and that greek philosophers were initiates who learned egypt s secret wisdom esoteric writers influenced by theosophy such as reuben swinburne clymer in his book mystery of osiris 1909 and manly palmer hall in freemasonry of ancient egyptians 1937 also wrote of an age old egyptian mystery tradition an elaborate example of these beliefs is 1954 book stolen legacy by george g m james which claims that greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from egyptian school of initiates james imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents so that purported system of egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over world notes and citations notes citations works
