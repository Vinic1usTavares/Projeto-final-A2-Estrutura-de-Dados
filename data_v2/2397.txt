i want to tell you is a song by english rock group beatles from their 1966 album revolver it was written and sung by george harrison band s lead guitarist after taxman and love you to it was third harrison composition recorded for revolver its inclusion on lp marked first time that he was allocated more than two songs on a beatles album a reflection of his continued growth as a songwriter beside john lennon and paul mccartney when writing i want to tell you harrison drew inspiration from his experimentation with hallucinogenic drug lsd lyrics address what he later termed avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit in combination with song s philosophical message harrison s stuttering guitar riff and dissonance he employs in melody reflect difficulties of achieving meaningful communication recording marked first time that mccartney played his bass guitar part after band had completed rhythm track for a song a technique that became commonplace on beatles subsequent recordings among music critics and beatles biographers many writers have admired group s performance on track particularly mccartney s use of indian style vocal melisma harrison performed i want to tell you as opening song throughout his 1991 japanese tour with eric clapton a version recorded during that tour appears on his live in japan album at concert for george tribute in november 2002 a year after harrison s death song was used to open western portion of event when it was performed by jeff lynne ted nugent smithereens thea gilmore and melvins are among other artists who have covered track background and inspiration george harrison wrote i want to tell you in early part of 1966 year in which his songwriting matured in terms of subject matter and productivity as a secondary composer to john lennon and paul mccartney in beatles harrison began to establish his own musical identity through his absorption in indian culture as well as perspective he gained through his experiences with hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide lsd according to author gary tillery song resulted from a creative surge that harrison experienced at start of 1966 during same period beatles had been afforded an unusually long time free of professional commitments due to their decision to turn down a talent for loving as their third film for united artists harrison used this time to study indian sitar and like lennon to explore philosophical issues in his songwriting while preparing to record band s next album revolver in his autobiography i me mine harrison says that i want to tell you addresses avalanche of thoughts that are so hard to write down or say or transmit authors russell reising and jim leblanc cite song along with rain and within you without you as an early example of beatles abandoning coy statements in their lyrics and instead adopt ing an urgent tone intent on channeling some essential knowledge psychological and or philosophical of lsd experience to their listeners writing in beatles anthology harrison likened outlook inspired by his taking drug to that of an astronaut on moon or in his spaceship looking back at earth i was looking back to earth from my awareness author robert rodriguez views song as reflecting effects of harrison s search for increased awareness in that faster and more wide reaching his thoughts came greater struggle to find words to express them as reproduced in i me mine harrison s original lyrics were more direct and personal compared with philosophical focus of completed song latter has nevertheless invited interpretation as a standard love song in which singer is cautiously entering into a romance another interpretation is that theme of miscommunication was a statement on beatles divergence from their audience during a time when group had tired of performing concerts before screaming fans composition music thumb left 250px musical notation for song s guitar riff author simon leng considers that unusual stuttering aspect in this recurring passage mirrors search for adequate words expressed in harrison s lyrics i want to tell you is in key of a major and in a standard time signature of 4 4 it contains a low register descending guitar riff that music journalist richie unterberger describes as circular full and typical of 1966 british mod rock riff opens and closes song and recurs between verses particularly over introduction rests between riff s syncopated notes create a stammering effect metric anomalies suggested by this effect are borne out further in uneven eleven bar length of verse main portion of song consists of two verses a bridge or middle eight followed by a verse a second bridge and final verse according to rodriguez i want to tell you is an early example of harrison matching music to message as aspects of song s rhythm harmony and structure combine to convey difficulties in achieving meaningful communication as in his 1965 composition think for yourself harrison s choice of chords reflects his interest in harmonic expressivity verse opens with a harmonious e a b c e melody note progression over an a major chord after which melody begins a harsh ascent with a move to b7 chord further to off kilter quality of opening riff musicologist alan pollack identifies this chord change as part of disorientating characteristics of verses due to change occurring midway through fourth bar rather than at start of measure musical and emotional dissonance is then heightened by use of e79 a chord that harrison said he happened upon while striving for a sound that adequately conveyed a sense of frustration with return to i chord for guitar riff harmonic progression through verse suggests what author ian macdonald terms an oriental variant of a major scale that is more arabic than indian middle eight sections present a softer harmonic content relative to strident progression over verses melody encompasses b minor diminished and major 7 chords together with a major inner voicings within this chord pattern produce a chromatic descent of notes through each semitone from f to c musicologist walter everett comments on aptness of conciliatory lyric maybe you d understand which closes second of these sections as melody concludes on a perfect authentic cadence representing in musical terms a natural emblem for any coming together pollack views song s outro as partly a reprise of introduction and partly a departure in form of a one two three go style of fade out ending on beatles recording group vocals over this section include indian style performed by mccartney on word time creating a melisma effect that is also present on harrison s revolver track love you to and on lennon s rain further to harrison s drawn out phrasing over first line of verses this detail demonstrates composition s subtle indian influence lyrics lyrics to i want to tell you address problems in communication and inadequacy of words in conveying genuine emotion writing in 1969 author dave laing identified serene desperation in song s attempt at real total contact in any interpersonal context author ian inglis notes that lines such as my head is filled with things to say and games begin to drag me down present in modern day terms same concepts regarding interpersonal barriers with which philosophers have struggled since pre socratic period macdonald cites lyrics to first bridge but if i seem to act unkind it s only me it s not my mind that is confusing things as an example of harrison applying an eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication by presenting them as contradictions between different levels of being in laing s interpretation entities me and my mind represent respectively individualistic selfish ego and buddhist not self freed from anxieties of historical time in i me mine however harrison states that with hindsight order of me and my mind should be reversed since mind is thing that hops about telling us to do this and do that when what we need is to lose forget mind further to laing s reading of song s message author and critic tim riley deems barriers in communication to be boundaries imposed by anxious western concept of time as harrison instead seeks healthy exchange and enlightened possibilities offered outside such limitations according to riley transcendental key is therefore song s concluding lines i don t mind i could wait forever i ve got time signifying singer s release from vexation and temporal restrictions recording untitled at time i want to tell you was third harrison composition that beatles recorded for revolver although his initial submission for a third contribution was isn t it a pity it was first time he had been permitted more than two songs on one of group s albums opportunity came about due to lennon s inability to write any new material over previous weeks exasperated by harrison s habit of not titling his compositions lennon jokingly named it granny smith part friggin two referring to working title derived from granny smith apple for love you to following lennon s remark geoff emerick beatles recording engineer named new song s superb after another variety of apple thumb right beatles used emi s steinway piano 1905 mrs mills model on track beatles taped main track consisting of guitars piano and drums at emi studios now abbey road studios in london session took place on 2 june 1966 day after harrison met indian classical musician ravi shankar for first time and secured shankar s agreement to help him master sitar band recorded five takes of song before harrison selected third of these for further work after reduction to a single track on four track master tape their performance consisted of harrison on lead guitar treated with a leslie effect mccartney on piano and ringo starr on drums with lennon adding tambourine group then overdubbed vocals with mccartney and lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside harrison s lead vocal further overdubs included maracas sound of which pollack likens to a rattlesnake additional piano at end of bridge sections and over e79 chord in verses and handclaps created during a period when beatles had fully embraced recording studio as a means of artistic expression recording added further to message behind song like eight days a week completed track begins with a fade in a device that in combination with fadeout according to rodriguez provided a circular effect perfectly matching song s lack of resolution everett similarly recognises mccartney s clumsy finger tapping impatience on piano over e79 chord as an apt expression of struggle to articulate final overdub was mccartney s bass guitar part which he added on 3 june process of recording bass separately from a rhythm track provided greater flexibility when mixing a song and allowed mccartney to control harmonic structure of music by defining chords as confirmed by band s recording historian mark lewisohn i want to tell you was first beatles song to have bass superimposed onto a dedicated track on recording this technique became commonplace in beatles subsequent work during 3 june session song was temporarily renamed i don t know which had been harrison s reply to a question from producer george martin as to what he wanted to call track eventual title was decided on by 6 june during a remixing and tape copying session for album release and reception emi s parlophone label released revolver on 5 august 1966 one week before beatles began their final north american tour i want to tell you was sequenced on side two of lp between lennon s song about a new york doctor who administered amphetamine doses to his wealthy patients doctor robert and got to get you into my life which mccartney said he wrote as an ode to pot for north american version of revolver however capitol records omitted doctor robert together with two other lennon written tracks as a result eleven song us release reinforced level of contribution from mccartney and from harrison according to beatles biographer nicholas schaffner harrison s revolver compositions taxman which opened album indian music styled love you to and i want to tell you established him as a songwriter within band recalling release in 2004 edition of rolling stone album guide rob sheffield said that revolver displayed a diversity of emotions and styles ranging from beatles prettiest music to their scariest among which i want to tell you represented band at their friendliest commenting on unprecedented inclusion of three of his songs on a beatles album harrison told melody maker in 1966 that he felt disadvantaged in not having a collaborator as lennon and mccartney were to one another he added when you re competing against john and paul you have to be very good to even get in same league in a contemporary review for nme allen evans wrote that beatles individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear and he admired song s combination of guitar and piano motifs and vocal harmonies in their combined album review in record mirror richard green found track well written produced and sung and praised harmony singing while peter jones commented on effectiveness of introduction and concluded deliberately off key sounds in backing are again very distinctive adds something to a romantic number available at rock s backpages subscription required in america due to controversy there surrounding lennon s remark that beatles had become more popular than christianity initial reviews of revolver were relatively lukewarm while commenting on this phenomenon in september 1966 krla beats reviewer described i want to tell you as unusual newly melodic and interesting and lamented that as with songs such as she said she said and yellow submarine it was being denied recognition it deserved available at rock s backpages subscription required retrospective assessment and legacy writing in rolling stones harrison commemorative issue in january 2002 mikal gilmore recognised his incorporation of dissonance on i want to tell you as having been revolutionary in popular music in 1966 gilmore considered this innovation to be perhaps more originally creative than avant garde styling that lennon and mccartney took from karlheinz stockhausen luciano berio edgar varese and igor stravinsky and incorporated into beatles work over same period according to musicologist dominic pedler e79 chord that harrison introduced in song became one of most legendary in entire beatles catalogue speaking in 2001 harrison said i m really proud of that as i literally invented that chord john later borrowed it on i want you she s so heavy over line it s driving me mad in his overview of i want to tell you alan pollack highlights harrison s descending guitar riff as one of those all time great ostinato patterns that sets tone of whole song right from start producer and musician chip douglas has stated that he based guitar riff for monkees 1967 hit pleasant valley sunday on that of beatles song neil innes of bonzo dog doo dah band and later rutles recalls being at abbey road studios while beatles were recording i want to tell you and his band were working on a 1920s vaudeville song titled my brother makes noises for talkies innes said he heard beatles playing back i want to tell you at full volume and appreciated then in words of music journalist robert fontenot just how far out of their league he was creatively innes has since included his recollection of this episode in his stage show among beatles biographers ian macdonald cites song as an example of harrison s standing as if not most talented then certainly most thoughtful of songwriting beatles he comments that in keeping with lyrics subtle hindu aligned perspective harrison s embrace of indian philosophy was dominating social life of group a year after its release jonathan gould considers that track would have been a highlight of any beatles album before revolver but such was standard of songwriting on their 1966 album it gets lost in shuffle of lennon and mccartney tunes on side two simon leng writes that aided by fertile harmonic imagination evident in i want to tell you revolver changed george harrison s musical identity for good presenting him in a multitude of roles a guitarist a singer a world music innovator and a songwriter in his review of song for allmusic richie unterberger admires its interesting idiosyncratic qualities and group vocals on recording adding that mccartney s singing merits him recognition as one of great upper register male harmony singers in rock similarly impressed with mccartney s contribution joe bosso of musicradar describes incorporation of vocal melisma as an affectionate nod to harrison s indian influences and includes track among his choice of harrison s ten best songs from beatles era in a 2009 review of revolver chris coplan of consequence of sound said that harrison s presence as a third vocalist fits perfectly in contrast with some of bigger aspects of album s psychedelic sounds and added in a song like i want to tell you sinister piano and steady near tribal drum line combine effortlessly with his voice to make for a song that is as beautiful as it is emotionally impacting and disturbing other versions ted nugent covered i want to tell you on his 1979 album state of shock a version that billboards reviewer said was probably enough to sell album nugent s recording was also released as a single that year and later appeared on his 1998 compilation super hits and mike melvoin are among other artists who have recorded song grateful dead included i want to tell you in their live performances in 1994 metzger
