behave differently one night a waiting game about people waiting for a train and udder chaos about cows who escape and then return to their field macaulay had idea of creating a book about journeys in 1980s and combined several previously unrelated sketches in order to form four stories in book owing to its metafictional structure book is considered a main example of a postmodern picture book book

book both complement each other and provide a sense of tension as they are sometimes in opposition to each other black and white is credited with helping to advance form of a picture book and is seen as a direct or indirect inspiration for several other picture books background and publication david macaulay started drawing sketches which would become black and white in 1980s idea of journeys

over it is a book of and about connections between pictures and between words and pictures each of four stories is presented with a unique design and illustration style seeing things was illustrated with watercolor problem parents was illustrated in pen and ink and had dialogue through captions a waiting game had colored ink and udder chaos had colored ink with lines removed printing technology enabling this kind of book with its multiple illustration styles and was relatively new at time of black and white s publication various ways stories overlap are never fully explained and are instead left for reader to discern reader is primed to interact with writing and illustrations by unattributed warning on title page to carefully inspect different stories even writing style utilizing passive voice encourages reader to take agency over story number of stories and their intersections are determined primarily through analysis by reader of illustrations further stories can be read in any particular order or combination and indeed sometimes can only be understood by reading book in a non linear manner in words of macaulay it isn t necessary to think in straight lines to make sense text is written to be subtly funny through its use of irony illustrations also add core elements to story while there is an illustration of a mask on nearly every page word does not appear in text e t

that is children under age of five but also older children and teens macaulay plays with this interaction between text and pictures at times they can be complementary as in start of problem parents but at other times can be discordant as in seeing things when text suggests it s an old woman on train while illustrations suggest it s robber at times text can be misleading as in udder chaos where text is about holsteins while illustrations focus on a robber and with some believing that robber is merely a figment of imagination of boy from seeing things illustrations also intersect with one another and can even become part of text as when drawing of a cow s udder becomes u in title for udder chaos there are also visual similarities between stories and characters boy of seeing things and robber present in that story and udder chaos both wear striped shirts while mask of robber and dog s face are quite similar dog whose name tag shows chris has been interpreted by some as an homage to chris van whose books have a reoccurring motif of a terrier themes in story include parent child relationship and of life trains are a motif through all four of stories burns m m 1990 black and white horn book magazine 66 5 593 594 retrieved from ebscohost there can be thematic coherence found in two stories on stories on left page where two sets of children are attempting to make sense of unusual events and also wishing to be reunited with their parents book also promotes idea that nothing is as simple as it seems such as with words black and white appearing in blue white and green font on cover and in red font on title page this red font has been interpreted as a reference to joke what is black and white and read all over newspapers given newspapers importance to story black and white has both order and chaos expressed through story illustrations and design of book chaos of story increases reaching its climax when only colors used are black on white on a page before order is restored at end of stories and at end of book however final page featuring a hand picking up train station from a waiting game and nose of dog from problem parents can have multiple interpretations

when examining book for use teachers can feel that complexity of book is too much for children while children who enjoy book do so because of its complexity teachers who do choose to use book can do
