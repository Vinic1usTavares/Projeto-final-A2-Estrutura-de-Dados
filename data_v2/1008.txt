years and they did not know whether he would return for first two episodes an eight to nine member team came up with new character of adam carter they wanted adam to have a different dynamic than tom producers set up a girlfriend boyfriend storyline in first series with adam they wanted him to have a wife fiona carter who works in security service since married couples working in that environment are common they wanted adam to be more animated and energetic than tom writer howard brenton wanted him to have an mi6 background and have something awful happen to him in past brenton invented backstory of syria early on into third series which he wanted to revisit in fourth series early on in development process producers wanted to cast a brilliant actor with a strong screen presence they discussed casting rupert penry jones for role of adam carter early in process though it took months to finally decide to cast him though penry jones was aware of spooks and its success he had never seen any episodes to be interested in role he spent a weekend catching up on entire first and second series he did not take long to decide since his last leading role was four years previously in 2000 in channel 4 drama north square adam was originally meant to be older and more street when he found acting street was too difficult penry jones acted more like himself he had to audition three times before producers included him four months before filming commenced on his first day for filming series three penry jones participated in a fight scene in middle of first episode he felt a little wary replacing matthew macfadyen after two months of filming penry jones began to feel more at ease with role he felt especially so after he started working for fourth series he returned to fourth series because he thought his character took off by end of last series and wanted to see which direction he would go to next crew wanted adam to go from a happy go lucky figure to wanting him to deal with things that would make it hard for adam to be jokey towards end of fourth series this involved fiona s death before sixth series finale aired in december 2007 it was announced that rupert penry jones would leave series sometime in series seven penry jones wanted to leave series as he felt character had run its course as well as wanting to explore other venues he also stated that working in spooks was great but felt he was getting to point where i needed to move on before seventh series aired penry jones revealed his character would leave in what he believed was one of best spooks exits he found that his last days on spooks was generally upsetting and welled up on his final day penry jones did not envisage lasting as long as he did because he believed series would not last as long as it has reception rupert penry jones noted that initial fan reaction towards adam carter was negative because matthew macfadyen was so successful and loved it took a while for fans to accept him penry

matthew macfadyen who was fifth david oyelowo who was seventh and peter firth who was tenth he was later voted fifth in 2005 and ninth in 2006 in a dvd review of third series of spooks michael mackenzie of home cinema had mixed views of adam s introduction stating despite ardent protests from both cast and crew tom and adam are almost exactly same character in fifth series mackenzie felt more open towards adam stating adam carter isn t exactly james bond he doesn t jet around world bedding multiple women and engaging in fisticuffs atop precarious construction rigs but he does rush around london with a gun in his hand and occasionally ends up on receiving end of odd beating david blackwell of media was receptive of adam in fourth series as he felt adam became more fleshed out and interesting however blackwell was critical of adam s role in following fifth series stating it is too much about him fans and critics alike displayed shock towards character s death in first episode of seventh series fans voted adam s death as fourth most shocking death scene in series radio times stated shock factor of his death was spectacular and said that driving a primed car bomb to a safe place is so run of mill for spooks they wouldn t normally break a sweat this time however it went off me me me tv has said that adam s death was bound to happen and stated just when we ve formed a deep meaningful and totally healthy relationship with lead gentleman they go and blow him up adding it s just not fair times s hilary rose noted that fans will remember adam s dramatic exit
