construction during late 1944 and early 1945 australian army suffered from a shortage of shipping leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from australia to operational areas in south west pacific while several british and united states vessels were eventually made available in mid 1945 australian army s chief engineer major general clive steele chose to design and build a heavy lift ship for army mallett 2007 pp 319 320 steele personally designed ship which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies he deliberately underestimated project s cost in order to gain approval for ship s design and construction james 2007 p 65 ship s design incorporated a number of unusual features crusader had a shallow draft to allow her to operate close to shore as well as four rudders and six engines driving six propellers to give her a high degree of manoeuvrability while ship required engines capable of generating a total of largest engines which were available in australia at time each generated only horsepower only six of these engines could be fitted into ship and she was considered under powered during her army service her hold could carry of stores and an additional 40 vehicles could be embarked on her deck ship also had six cranes to move heavy equipment as well as six bridge like structures which were used to embark and disembark vehicles this equipment allowed her to discharge cargo at rate of at any one time gillett 1983 p 258 crusader had a box like appearance and her design did not impress naval engineers mellor 1958 p was

several further trips between tasmania and mainland but in april 1947 it was reported that ship was to be scrapped on grounds that she was considered unseaworthy gil duthie federal member for wilmot sought to have crusader retained in service until shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from tasmania was rectified shipping control board rejected s representations on grounds that crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade and it would take at least a year to complete necessary works however board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from tasmania crusader was subsequently offered for sale and was purchased by queensland cement and lime company qcl she arrived at brisbane on 28 september 1947 and was subsequently renamed cementco queensland cement and lime company qcl used cementco as a self propelled coral barge ship was converted to this role in brisbane by
