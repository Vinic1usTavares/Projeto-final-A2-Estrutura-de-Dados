awarded episode five stars praising matt smith s mercurial doctor sophie okonedo s acting and concept of episode however he worried that moffat may not be as interested in time lord as rest of his fans referring to a scene in which doctor dismisses death of his people as a bad day keith watson in metro praised developing relationship between doctor and amy sam wollaston in guardian noted parallels between future uk and modern britain and also confessed to being in love with amy pond sfx magazine russell lewin gave beast below four out of five stars calling it immensely satisfying he particularly praised two lead performances and amy s characterisation as companion as well as writing and dialogue dan martin also of guardian praised story for testing characters relationships rather than being just a visit to starship uk to make it better though he commented that anti vivisection message seemed to be lost along way he praised way doctor was portrayed in terms of his more inhumane instincts in contrast to tenth doctor and rated episode as four out of five radio times reviewer patrick mulkern said that episode neither moved him to wave a save banner nor reach for nearest harpoon and made him feel out of loop as it seemed more directed at children than adults however he praised acting of smith gillan and sophie okonedo as well as creation of robotic smilers ign s matt wales had a more mixed opinion about episode rating it a good 7 out of 10 he considered it imaginative with more brilliant ideas than most other shows can muster in an entire season but he thought episode never quite brought its cacophony of ideas together to form a satisfying whole and conclusion failed to resonate effectively against hodgepodge of insane ideas and action because of large number of ideas wales also pointed out that characterisation was scant especially on liz 10 and smilers however he praised smith s and gillan s chemistry and moffat s crackling dialogue in february 2013 moffat cited beast below as his least favourite among episodes he wrote describing it as a bit of a mess references external links category 2010 british television episodes category fiction set in 4th
