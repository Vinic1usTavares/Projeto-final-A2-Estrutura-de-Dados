studio effects accompanied by bass drums and glockenspiel lyrically it is one of several of his songs that reference an idealized feminine or guardian angel like figure at about two and a half minutes in length it is one of his most concise and melodically focused pieces origins of little wing have been traced back to 1966 recording of my girl she s a fox an r b song which features hendrix playing curtis mayfield influenced guitar accompaniment he developed song while performing in new york city s greenwich village prior to his involvement with producer chas chandler after being inspired by events at 1967 monterey pop festival hendrix completed song in october 1967 when it was recorded by experience during sessions for their second album axis bold as love little wing was released with axis album in december 1967 in uk and following month in us as one of only two songs from album to become part of experience s concert repertoire experience often performed it live and recordings were issued on early hendrix posthumous albums hendrix in west in 1972 and jimi hendrix concerts in 1982 more recently demo versions have been released as well as additional live renditions little wing is one of hendrix s most popular songs and has become a standard with interpretations recorded by musicians in a variety of styles it is ranked number 366 on rolling stone magazine s list of 500 greatest songs of all time background jimi hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular r b artists including isley brothers don covay and little richard he learned from other r b guitarists including curtis mayfield who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording hendrix toured as a support act with mayfield in 1963 he described experience best gig was with curtis mayfield and impressions curtis was a really good guitarist i learned a lot in that short time he probably influenced me more than anyone i d ever played with up to that time that sweet sound of his you know in 1966 hendrix recorded a song titled my girl she s a fox with an r b duo hendrix biographer harry shapiro has described it as paced and phrased in style of curtis mayfield that is virtually a blueprint for little wing later hendrix producer john mcdermott called his contribution to she s a fox included on 2010 west coast seattle boy jimi hendrix anthology perhaps strongest of his pre experience career hendrix s curtis mayfield influenced guitar styling is song s strongest attribute according to hendrix little wing came from an idea he had originally developed while playing in greenwich village when he was fronting his band jimmy james and blue flames in summer of 1966 he later explained that he was further inspired during experience s performance at 1967 monterey pop festival recording and composition thumb left 200px jimi hendrix experience promotional photo circa 1968 in october 1967 recording sessions for second experience album axis bold as love began at olympic studios in london on october 25 after recording strongly r b oriented wait until tomorrow experience recorded an instrumental version of little wing it followed same chord progression as later master recording but had a more forceful rock feel after another take in same vein chandler called for a different approach recording engineer eddie kramer explained chas knew right away what was needed he had jimi slow tempo down and try it again after basic track was completed hendrix and kramer recorded overdubs on october 28 1967 for his recordings hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve optimal tone for his guitar tracks for his rhythm guitar he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between neck and middle settings to achieve a hollow tone sometimes mistakenly referred to as out of phase however for lead kramer later fed guitar signal through a makeshift leslie speaker which was normally used for electric organs by rotating sound leslie speakers produce vibrato and tremolo like effects i e a pulsing or quivering addition to sound hendrix later popularized use of phase shifter effects pedal which can be set to get a roughly similar effect next hendrix added a straight dry without any effects glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar according to kramer jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about studio and found glockenspiel in studio a last to be recorded was his vocal which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound these have been variously described as artificial double tracking adt phasing pultec filter equalization and processing with a leslie speaker regarding song s arrangement shapiro commented musically little wing is structured to lay a touch across whole song from arresting opening statement and haunting glockenspiel to use of a leslie speaker cabinet for guitar according to allmusic s matthew greenwald it is based on a gentle soulful chord progression which guides melody and is an accurate mirror of title and lyrics song has been notated in 4 4 time with one bar in 2 4 at a slow rock 70 72 beats per minute tempo and is built on a chord progression without a bridge section bam cg c drest after an instrumental introduction there are two verses followed by a guitar solo which has been described as richly melodic by biographer keith shadwick shapiro noted song s brevity song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty five seconds even live little wing was hardly any longer he said what he wanted to say and stopped hendrix s use of guitar chords for song involves unconventional finger positions and approach to fretboard guitarist frank marino explained a reference work by hal leonard compares it to a pianist s approach with hendrix s thumb fret ting bass notes functioning in almost same manner as a keyboardist s left hand and fingers of his fretting hand can be likened to a pianist s right hand leonard also adds that guitarist adrian belew describes technique as a lost art lyrics and interpretation in discussing his lyrics jimi hendrix was characteristically enigmatic in a 1967 interview he explained most ballads come across in different ways sometimes you see things in different ways than other people see it so then you write it in a song it could represent anything in different interviews he acknowledged an american indian influence on his songs i don t live today may this be love and little wing he described little wing as being based on a very very simple indian style perhaps referring to some native american mythologies in which spirits inhabit nature and animals including birds in one interview he saw it as self explanatory that s exactly what it s about like she s walking through clouds music journalist charles shaar murray likens figure to a feminine ideal sometimes she is a spirit sometimes a fantasy sometimes a woman as solidly palpably physical as he is figure first appears as waterfall in may this be love where she offers solace and hope and as a soulful loving sprite in little wing however other writers have suggested that figure is similar to guardian angel associated with christianity which is clearly what she represents in hendrix s later song angel hendrix s brother leon interpreted little wing and angel as a general tribute he wrote it for his girlfriends our and especially for our mama who looked over us from high above in afterlife hendrix s hand written lyrics for angel with note finished january 14 1968 use title my angel return of little wing which suggests that he saw a connection between two songs at time hendrix had just finished a short tour of scandinavia where he had performed little wing in concert for first time at some point he responded to a question love i know a girl katerina in sweden in a later 1969 interview hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour so like little wing is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes she was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if i wanted it and me with my crazy ass couldn t get it together so i m off here and there and off over there releases thumb right 240px axis bold as love album cover front little wing along with rest of tracks for axis bold as love was mixed october 31 1967

song s ending their live performances generally follow studio arrangement since axis recording ends on a fade hendrix needed to devise a different live ending early recordings show a progression to an open chord while later ones have more elaborate single string guitar improvisation with effects such as wah wah before a chiming final chord for one 1968 performance in san francisco hendrix s guitar signal was routed through a leslie speaker writer dave rubin commented real leslie played outdoors out of studio like this really gives a very delicate gentle swirl to chords and helps chordal
