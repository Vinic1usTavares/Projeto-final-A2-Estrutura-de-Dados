primer is a 2004 american science fiction film about accidental discovery of time travel film was written directed produced edited and scored by shane carruth who also stars with david sullivan primer is of note for its extremely low budget experimental plot structure philosophical implications and complex technical dialogue which carruth a college graduate with a degree in mathematics and a former engineer chose not to simplify for sake of audience film collected grand jury prize at 2004 sundance film festival before securing a limited release in united states and has since gained a cult following plot thumb 500px operation of time travel in primer two and their day jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects working out of aaron s garage during one such research effort involving electromagnetic reduction of objects weight two men accidentally discover an a to b time loop side effect objects left in weight reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies proceeding normally from time a when field was activated to time b when field is powered off then backwards from b back to a in a continuously repeating sequence such that objects can leave field in present or at some previous point abe refines this proof of concept and builds a stable time apparatus box sized to accommodate a human subject abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past as part of this process original abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room so as not to interact or interfere with outside world after which original abe enters box waits inside box for six hours thus going back in time six hours and becomes future abe who travels across town explains proceedings to aaron and brings aaron back to self storage facility housing box at end of overlap timespan original abe enters box and ceases to exist abe and aaron repeat abe s six hour experiment multiple times over multiple days making profitable same day stock trades armed with foreknowledge of market s performance duo s divergent cautious and controlling aaron impulsive and subtle strain on their collaboration and friendship these tensions come to a head after a late night encounter with thomas granger father to abe s girlfriend rachel who appears inexplicably unshaven and exists in overlap with his original suburban self granger falls into a comatose state after being pursued by aaron aaron theorizes that at some unknown point in future granger entered box with timeline altering consequences abe concludes that time travel is simply too dangerous and enters a secret second box failsafe box built before experiment began and kept continuously running traveling back four days to prevent experiment s launch cumulative competing interference wreaks havoc upon timeline future abe sedates original abe so he will never conduct initial time travel experiment and meets original aaron at a park bench so as to dissuade him but finds that future aaron has gotten there first armed with pre recordings of past conversations and an unobtrusive earpiece having brought a disassembled third failsafe box four days back with his own body future abe faints at this revelation overcome by shock and fatigue two men briefly and tentatively reconcile they jointly travel back in time experiencing and reshaping an event where abe s girlfriend rachel was nearly killed by a gun wielding party crasher after many repetitions aaron with knowledge of party s events stops gunman becoming a local hero abe and aaron ultimately part ways aaron considers a new life in foreign countries where he can tamper more broadly for personal gain while abe states his intent to remain in town and dissuade sabotage original box experiment abe warns aaron to leave and never return multiple box aware versions of aaron least one future aaron has shared his knowledge with original aaron via discussions voice recordings and an unsuccessful physical altercation future abe watches over original abe going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware of future an aaron directs french speaking workers in construction of a warehouse sized box cast shane carruth as aaron david sullivan as abe casey gooden as robert anand upadhyaya as phillip carrie crawford as kara samantha thomson as rachel granger brandon blagg as will carruth cast himself as aaron after having trouble finding actors who could break habit of filling each line with so much drama most of other actors are either friends or family members themes although one of more fantastic elements of science fiction is central to film carruth s goal was to portray scientific discovery in a down to earth and realistic manner he notes that many of greatest breakthrough scientific discoveries in history have occurred by accident in locations no more glamorous than aaron s garage whether it involved history of number zero or invention of transistor two things stood out to me first is that discovery that turns out to be most valuable is usually dismissed as a side effect second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome i wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with way real innovation takes place than i had seen on film before carruth has said he intended central theme of film to be breakdown of abe and aaron s relationship as a result of their inability to cope with power afforded them by this technological advancement first thing i saw these guys as scientifically accomplished but ethically morons they never had any reasons before to have ethical questions so when they re hit with this device they re blindsided by it first thing they do is make money with it they re not talking about ethics of altering your former self physics and science thumb right in this feynman diagram an electron and positron annihilate producing a virtual photon that becomes a quark pair then one radiates a gluon aaron and abe start film by attempting to create a device to somehow counter effects of gravity they have plans for such a device from another development team but wish to improve on viability of design their main approach to achieve this is to discard coolant bath for required superconductors they instead increase transition temperature of superconductor to something more usable a room temperature superconductor time machine makes use of property of superconductors called meissner effect which knock s out interior magnetic field aaron and abe require palladium to build their machine this is reason they take catalytic converter containing a small amount of palladium from a car principles of time travel in film are inspired by feynman diagrams carruth explained richard feynman has some interesting ideas about time when you look at feynman diagrams which map interaction of elementary particles there s really no difference between watching an interaction happen forward and backward in time production while writing script carruth studied physics to help him make abe and aaron s technical dialogue sound authentic he took unusual step of eschewing contrived exposition and tried instead to portray shorthand phrases and jargon used by working scientists this philosophy carried over into production design time machine itself is a plain gray box with a distinctive electronic hum created by overlaying sounds of a mechanical grinder and a car engine rather than by using a processed digital effect carruth also set story in unglamorous industrial parks and suburban tract homes carruth chose to deliberately obfuscate film s plot to mirror complexity and confusion created by time travel as he said in a 2004 interview this machine and abe and aaron s experience are inherently complicated so it needed to be that way in order for audience to be where abe and aaron are which was always my hope filming principal photography took place over five weeks on outskirts of dallas texas film was produced on a budget of only usd 7 000 and a skeleton crew of five carruth acted as writer director producer cinematographer editor and music composer he also stars in film as aaron and many of other characters are played by his friends and family small budget required conservative use of super 16mm carefully limited number of takes resulted in an extremely low shooting ratio of 2 1 every shot in film was meticulously storyboarded on 35mm stills carruth created a distinctive flat overexposed look for film by using fluorescent lighting non neutral color temperatures high speed film stock and filters after shooting carruth took two years to fully post produce primer he has since said that this experience was so arduous that he almost abandoned film on several occasions music entire film score was created by carruth on october 8 2004 primer score was released on amazon and itunes release distribution carruth secured a north american distribution deal with thinkfilm after company s head of theatrical distribution mark urman saw film at 2004 sundance film festival although he and carruth made a handshake agreement during festival urman reported that actual negotiation of deal was longest he had ever been involved with in part due to carruth s specific demands over how much control over film he would retain film went on to take 424 760 at box office box office mojo primer domestic total gross retrieved 2012 2 11 critical reception primer received positive reception from critics review aggregator metacritic rated it a 68 while rotten tomatoes rated it a fresh 73 stating dense obtuse but stimulating primer is a film ready for viewers ready for a cerebral challenge and site listed it as one of best science fiction films for thinking man or woman many reviewers were impressed by film s originality dennis lim of village voice said that it was freshest thing genre has seen since 2001 while in new york times a o scott wrote that carruth had skill guile and seriousness to turn a creaky philosophical gimmick into a dense and troubling moral puzzle scott also enjoyed film s realistic depiction of scientists at work saying that carruth had an impressive feel for odd quiet rhythms of small scale research and development there was also praise for carruth s ability to maintain high production values on a minuscule budget with roger ebert declaring movie never looks cheap because every shot looks as it must look ty burr of boston globe commented that aspects of primer are so low rent as to evoke guffaws but added that homemade feel is part of point film s experimental plot and dense dialogue were controversially received esquire s mike d angelo claimed that anybody who claims he fully understands what s going on in primer after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar scott tobias writes for a v club banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition were it not for presence of voiceover narration film would be close to incomprehensible for los angeles times carina chocano writes sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly then just sort of fall off spool some reviewers were entirely put off by film s obfuscated narrative kirk honeycutt of hollywood reporter complained that primer nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture primer is hopelessly confusing and grows more and more byzantine as it unravels chuck klosterman writes in an essay on time travel films five years later i ve watched it seven or eight times and i still don t know what happened he nonetheless says it is finest movie about time travel i ve ever seen because of its realism ultimately klosterman says lesson of primer regarding time travel is that it s too important to use only for money but too dangerous to use for anything else film has been selected to be part of a v club new cult canon donald clarke film critic with irish times included primer at no 20 on his list of top twenty films of decade 2000 2010 science fiction author greg egan described it as an ingenious tautly constructed time travel story awards grand jury prize sundance film festival in 2004 alfred p
