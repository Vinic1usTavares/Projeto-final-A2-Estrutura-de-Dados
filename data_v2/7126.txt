clips or screenshots from gameplay or live stream directly to streaming services such as mixer and twitch games can also be played off console via a local area network on supported windows 10 devices console can play blu ray disc and overlay live television programming from an existing set top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide console optionally included a redesigned kinect sensor marketed as kinect 2 0 providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition xbox one received mostly positive reviews for its refined controller design multimedia features and voice navigation its quieter and cooler design was praised for making console more reliable than its predecessor on launch but console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than playstation 4 its original user interface was panned for being although changes made to it and other aspects of console s software post launch received a positive reception its kinect received praise for its improved motion tracking accuracy its face recognition and its voice commands original xbox one model was succeeded by xbox one s in 2016 which has a smaller form factor and support for hdr10 high dynamic range video as well as support for 4k video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4k it was praised for its smaller size its on screen visual improvements and its lack of an external power supply but its regressions such as lack of a native kinect port were noted a high end model named xbox one x was unveiled in june 2017 and released in november it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4k resolution it will be succeeded by upcoming xbox series x consoles in holiday 2020 history thumb left xbox one at e3 2013 alongside xbox 360 e model alt xbox one on display at e3 2013 xbox one is successor to xbox 360 microsoft s previous video game console which was introduced in 2005 as part of seventh generation of video game consoles over years 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce unit s size and improve its reliability in 2010 microsoft s chris lewis stated that 360 was about halfway through its lifecycle this was aided by introduction of kinect motion sensor that year which lewis stated would extend lifecycle by five years initial hardware for 360 s successor commonly referred to by industry as xbox 720 was reportedly under development as early as may 2011 official developer kit was codenamed durango and appeared to be available to developers by mid 2012 leaked documents suggested that new console would include an improved kinect sensor cloud access to games and media integration with phone and tablet devices and technology to provide players heads up displays on glasses worn by player codenamed fortaleza microsoft did not comment on these reported features leaked design documents also suggested that microsoft was seeking to eliminate ability to play used games though microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing design and were thinking about what is next and how we can push boundaries of technology like we did with kinect but did not comment on validity of information initial unveiling and launch prior to official unveiling rumors had circulated that next xbox console would be an always on system requiring a persistent internet connection though microsoft had not confirmed this this had drawn some concerns from consumers which were heightened when microsoft studios adam orth stated in a twitter message in april 2013 that said sorry i don t get drama around having an always on console every device now is always on that s world we live in orth s message drew further ire towards microsoft with concerns about digital rights management and practices against sale of used games with an always on unit orth opted to leave microsoft a few days later due to backlash and subsequently went to work for studio three one zero for their first game adrift despite microsoft s statements following this situation denying rumors mood it created lingered over next several months new console was publicly unveiled under name xbox one on may 21 2013 in a press conference designed to cover unit s broad multimedia and social capabilities however this event focused heavily on multimedia capabilities demonstrating integration with television over first 30 minutes before video game capabilities were brought up not only had this approach confused consumers about intent of xbox one but also microsoft employees who had been working on console phil spencer stated that several employees complained to him that they felt this presentation had blow n up all good work that they ve done by talking about product in a way that s not really matching what soul of an xbox console is about and what their customers are looking for from microsoft because of negative feedback from may presentation press event for e3 2013 was made to showcase video game functionality of xbox one first and foremost don mattrick described event as all about games at that time microsoft announced that console would be released in 21 different markets on november 22 2013 but this was later amended down to 13 change which pushed release date for other eight markets to 2014 was attributed to unforeseen complexity in localizing device s voice recognition capabilities later in september 2014 xbox one was released in 26 markets including remaining markets in europe japanese market and middle eastern markets microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for xbox one than what was used upon its release all games including those purchased at retail would be bound to user s xbox live account users could access their purchased games from any other xbox one console play games without their disc once installed and allow users to share their games with up to ten designated family members users would trade games at participating retailers and could also transfer a game directly to any xbox live friend on their list for at least 30 days but only once to synchronize licenses console would be required to connect to internet once every 24 hours if console could not connect all games would be disabled until console was connected again reaction to this digital rights management scheme was extremely negative in light of previous concerns about always on console from earlier in year critics felt that changes would infringe on consumers first sale rights for games purchased on physical media as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold and disc itself would only be used to install game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on second hand copies of games gamespot editor tom mcshea went on to say that microsoft had become anti consumerist trying to punish their loyal customers with strict restrictions and that by saying no to used game restrictions and always online that microsoft is so happily implementing on xbox one sony has elevated playstation 4 as console to grab this holiday season xbox chief marketing and strategy officer yusuf mehdi explained that system was built with digital distribution in mind but that microsoft wanted to maintain availability of games on physical media he also noted that microsoft was not giving in to publishers objections to used games but rather trying to balance needs of consumers and industry and that trading and sharing abilities of platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at time on june 19 2013 shortly after e3 2013 microsoft announced in response to negative reaction that it would change its policy xbox one s drm and game licensing model and reverse course as with xbox 360 users would be able to share and resell physical games without restrictions and beyond a mandatory software update upon console s initial setup process to enable playback of blu ray and dvd video console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate these changes required family sharing features along with ability to play games without their disc after installation to be dropped xbox one chief product officer marc whitten stated that family sharing feature may return in future but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints don mattrick then president of microsoft s interactive entertainment business stated that licensing changes were in response to negative public reaction other analysts believed that change was in direct response of sony s aggressive position during its e3 press conference mattrick who had been a leader in xbox one development announced his departure from microsoft on july 1 2013 to become ceo of analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on poor response and subsequent reversal of plans for xbox one microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for kinect sensor to be plugged into xbox one at all times for it to function privacy advocates argued that kinect sensor data could be used for targeted advertising and to perform unauthorized surveillance on users in response to these claims microsoft reiterated that kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users that kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy and that console would not redistribute user generated content without permission in response to these pre launch changes and a belief that microsoft s decisions for systems were in poor judgement journalists and consumers jokingly gave xbox one nicknames such as xbox 180 in reference to xbox 360 and microsoft s decision to reverse its controversial decisions and suggesting that company was throwing a bone to consumers by making these changes subsequent updates in 2015 four members of an international hacking group pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to microsoft s computer network and obtaining sensitive information relating to xbox one and xbox live u s department of justice fourth member of hacking ring pleads guilty to hacking and intellectual property theft fbi gov april 1 2015 at time of security breach microsoft was in development stage for its next generation gaming system between 2011 and 2013 hackers spent hundreds of hours searching through microsoft s network copying log in credentials source code technical specifications and other data group members say they were driven by an immense curiosity about microsoft s then unreleased xbox one console and associated software using stolen access credentials two of hackers also committed a physical theft by entering a secure building on microsoft s redmond washington campus and carrying away three durango development kits fbi arrests trio for microsoft xbox hacking smoking gun april 10 2014 on june 13 2016 during its e3 2016 press conference microsoft unveiled xbox one s a revision of original xbox one hardware with a streamlined form factor microsoft also teased a high end version of xbox one with upgraded hardware

previous iterations of console among other changes led rings used by xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white xbox logo used to communicate system s status to user due to overall ventilation design of console original xbox one is designed to only sit horizontally xbox one s utilizes a refreshed version of this design with a case that is 40 smaller in size and supports vertical orientation with a stand main xbox one s sku is colored in an entirely matte robot white finish with half of console adorned with machined holes and a visible circular vent on top of console s right half it utilizes push button controls rather than capacitive keys side usb port and controller sync button were moved to front of console and its power supply is integrated into console s casing rather than sitting externally plugging directly into wall internals xbox one is powered by an amd jaguar accelerated processing unit apu with two quad core modules totaling eight x86 64 cores clocked at 1 75 ghz and 8 gb of ddr3 ram with a memory bandwidth of 68 3 gb s memory subsystem also features an additional 32 mb of embedded static ram or esram with a memory bandwidth of 109 gb s for simultaneous read and write operations esram is capable of a theoretical memory bandwidth of 192 gb s and a memory bandwidth of 133 gb s has been achieved with operations that involved alpha transparency blending system includes a non replaceable hard drive and a blu ray disc optical drive 138 gb of hard drive space is used by operating system with remainder available for storage of games since june 2014 software update up to two usb drives can be connected to xbox one to expand its capacity external drives must support usb 3 0 and have a capacity of at least 256 gb it was reported that 3 gb of ram would be reserved for operating system and utility software leaving 5 gb for games with directx 11 2 as console s api graphics processing unit gpu is based on an amd gcn architecture with 12 compute units

not rendered at 4k gpu on xbox one s has a higher clock speed and esram bandwidth than original model which can provide some performance improvements on games with dynamic resolution scaling or uncapped frame rates console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating alongside increasing fan speed additional measures can be taken including forcing hardware to run in a lower power state a feature that was not present on xbox 360 restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance but setting would be intended as a last resort to prevent permanent hardware damage controller thumb 213px xbox one elite controller featuring two unique pairs of analog sticks a new d pad and two differently sized pairs of paddles xbox one s controller

initially shipped with kinect sensor included on june 9 2014 cheaper xbox one bundles were introduced which did not include kinect sensor microsoft stated decision to offer xbox one bundles without kinect was to offer a choice to people that would allow people to buy an xbox one and then ramp up to kinect when they can afford to while also allowing games to use processing power that was previously reserved for kinect an updated xbox development kit issued in june 2014 allows developers to explicitly disable motion tracking functionality in games allowing access to additional system resources that represent about 10 of gpu processing power these resources were previously reserved for kinect skeletal tracking regardless of whether kinect sensor was attached or in use a windows

voice control via kinect set top box and television are controlled by oneguide using an ir blaster xbox one does not provide full dvr functionality for recording television programs executive yusuf mehdi indicated that console would work in tandem with existing television services but that microsoft would need to work with them directly to provide extended functionality such as dvr integration digital tv tuner accessory allows limited dvr functionality for pausing and rewinding live tv for up to 30 minutes in june 2016 microsoft announced that their plans for full dvr functionality for xbox one were on hold xbox live xbox live service has been scaled up to use 300 000 servers for xbox one users cloud storage is available to save music films games and saved content and developers are able

one can begin to play portions of a game such as opening levels once installation or download reaches a specific point while remainder of game is downloaded or installed in background however for older titles such as xbox 360 games see xbox 360 compatibility below one must wait until installation is completed to play updates to games and system software are also downloaded in background and while in standby if game is installed from physical media disc is still required for validation purposes if game is installed on another console and that console owner no longer has access to disc owner has option of unlocking install on their hard drive by purchasing it through xbox live installed game then acts as a game installed on hard drive an active internet connection may be required for some games particularly those that rely on server side processing microsoft introduced an early access program known as in 2015 which allows developers to launch unfinished games for consumers to purchase and beta test before its official launch since june 2017 games may be promoted with additional icons that denote compatibility with hardware enhancements found in newer xbox one models including support for high dynamic range hdr colors on xbox one s and xbox one x native rendering at 4k resolution xbox one x and specific optimizations for xbox one x in february 2017 microsoft introduced a subscription on demand service known as xbox game pass separate from xbox live gold which allows users to download and play games from its library at no additional charge for life of subscription in april 2019 microsoft also introduced xbox game pass ultimate which bundles game pass with an xbox live gold subscription backward compatibility thumb xbox one achieves backward compatibility with select xbox 360 games through software emulation alt original xbox 360 model with an xbox 360 controller xbox 360 compatibility at its launch xbox one did not have native backward compatibility with original xbox or xbox 360 games it had been a desired launch feature by microsoft and had been actively under development as early as 2007 under trioxide program as to get xbox 360 code to run on 64 bit hardware rather than going route of initial playstation 3 which included a core playstation 2 system on a chip processor xbox one hardware was designed to include support for xbox 360 and texture processing on hardware knowing this would be difficult to replicate in software following criticism of its plan for an always on console from may 2013 announcement microsoft had to put significant effort to prepare xbox one software for a revised approach and backwards compatibility development work were put on hold interim solutions were suggested senior project management and planning director albert penello explained that microsoft was initially considering a cloud gaming platform to enable backward compatibility but he felt it would be problematic due to varying internet connection qualities xbox live director of programming larry major nelson did state that users could theoretically use hdmi in port on console to pass an xbox 360 or alternatively any other device that supports hdmi output including competing consoles through xbox one this process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable display lag following release of xbox one and transition of phil spencer to head of xbox division in 2014 he and software engineering vice president kareem choudhry restarted backwards compatibility program in relative secret within company choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on trioxide including kevin la chapelle jonathan morrison and barry bond to restart program team chose to start with castle crashers which included xbox networking features to test backwards compatibility castle crashers frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes which la chapelle was able to obtain from game s developers behemoth which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix compatibility issues solving most of major problems through castle crashers background compatibility team decided to let program be announced at e3 2015 with plans to have one hundred titles available by end of 2015 however by e3 they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates during event morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between xbox 360 and xbox one was its scheduling rate and when they returned morrison s idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by end of that year individual games still brought some difficulty specifically halo reach but this prompted team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run as is on xbox one and how to work around those this further set up potential to improve xbox 360 games on future iterations of xbox one such as xbox one x to improve graphics support xbox 360 backward compatibility uses fission a software emulator within system software 104 xbox 360 titles were supported at feature s public launch with more added in following months xbox 360 games contained within rare replay are packaged as standalone applications using xbox 360 emulation microsoft stated that publishers would only need to provide permission to company to allow repackaging and it expected number of supported games to increase significantly over time microsoft along with fourteen other third party publishers will offer supported games and all games with gold titles on xbox 360 since november 2015 are made compatible on june 10 2019 microsoft stated that it had wound down addition of new titles to backwards compatibility program in order to focus on xbox one s successor original xbox compatibility thumb first xbox videogame revealed to be compatible with xbox one was crimson skies high road to revenge alt xbox console with a controller s xbox division head phil spencer had also hinted possibility of adding support for games from original xbox for backwards compatibility team after they completed framework for xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over they turned to question of compatibility with original xbox console program was started in november 2016 under code name fusion and was led by software engineer spencer perreault perreault initially tried same approaches as team had done with fission but due to differences in memory management sizes and chipset bit rates these initial tests failed instead perreault worked to bring dolphin a developer tool for original xbox working to get its emulation correct la chapelle brought in a number of personal xbox titles to test in perreault s emulation getting about a 10 hit rate on successes though variety of failures helped perreault to identify common problems and within a month had improved successful hit rate to about 90 as with xbox 360 backwards compatibility fusion emulation enables xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions work with xbox one networking features and can allow mixed console system link connection between all three generations of xbox with perreault s success microsoft announced xbox backwards compatibility on xbox one in june 2017 thirteen titles were initially released on october 24 2017 microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to xbox one service during april 2018 microsoft does not anticipate that there will be as many xbox titles brought to program as with xbox 360 primarily due to legal issues related to intellectual property contracts and companies that have since gone defunct reception pre release while initial unveiling of xbox one in may 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in digital rights management scheme it would use other features of console were highlighted by journalists editorial staff of game informer offered both praise and criticism for console matt helgeson described console as microsoft s intent to control living room he called xbox one s instant switching features impressive and that console was a step in right direction with regards to tv entertainment especially prospect of avoiding usage of non intuitive user interfaces often found on cable set top boxes jeff cork said that microsoft had some great ideas for console but that it failed to properly communicate them microsoft s e3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that beyond increased graphical capabilities provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous generation games giving little incentive for buying new console rafi mohammed author of art of pricing felt that microsoft priced xbox one too high and that 100 premium over its competitor could derail system during 2013 holiday season critical reception upon its release xbox one received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers in its launch review polygon gave xbox one an 8 10 its design was described as inoffensive but its larger size noted while console s quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than xbox 360 was on launch controller was praised for its battery life and premium design but some members of site s staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs design of xbox one s interface received mixed reviews noting that it carried over windows 8 s design language interface was disfavored for hiding functions under controller s menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead while praised for having more robust voice navigation than xbox 360 they felt that voice navigation still had a learning curve in understanding what works and what doesn t although its user following smart match and improved voice chat features were noted xbox live was panned for not offering option on launch to add a real name to user profiles despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to xbox 360 and how oneguide interacted with outside set top boxes drawing comparisons to operations of tivo dvrs polygon felt xbox one s overall multimedia experience feels like a major step forward in set top boxes and makes xbox one obvious center of any living room that has one ben gilbert of engadget was similarly modest upon its launch assigning console a score of 81 100 and describing xbox one s design as a 1993 artist s rendering of 2013 s technology acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of ous xbox 360 design he praised controller for its improved d pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking but that whilst magical every false positive or unrecognized voice command had us reaching for controller overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of playstation 4 but its game library view was described as being a jumbled sadly rows of every owned piece of software that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not console was also panned for missing certain promised features on launch such as upload studio game streaming and certain apps services later on critics felt that xbox one s functionality had matured over year following its launch jeff bakalar of cnet assigning it a score of 8 10 acknowledged improvements to xbox one s software since its original release but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to xbox 360 and playstation 4 explaining that navigating interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be and there s simply not enough transparency in logic within it there are oddities peppered throughout which is root for countless headaches and frustrations xbox one s in game performance was mixed with some titles showing slower performance over ps4 but some multi platform games performing better on xbox one than ps4 cnet praised wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on xbox one over ps4 not requiring xbox live gold for online save data storage support for high speed usb 3 0 as secondary storage and having a slightly better lineup of upcoming exclusives concluding that while ps4 had a clear advantage at launch that edge is slowly evaporating as microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of xbox one s original missteps nick pino of techradar giving it four stars out of five similarly felt that xbox one felt more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago citing oneguide upload studio and microsoft s decision to drop xbox live gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps and that there s still a lot of potential locked away inside hardware of system that developers are just beginning to figure out so while playstation might have upper hand for now when it comes to certain third party titles it may not always remain that way just how microsoft will get it to that point though is still a mystery however he disfavored console s dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality kinect s voice recognition and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution but are upscaled in an august 2016 review of xbox one s model techradar further commended microsoft s recent improvements to xbox one citing a strong lineup of first party titles in 2015 and further improvements to console s interface alaina yee of ign also praised how xbox one had evolved since its launch assigning it with kinect a score of 8 1 10 and acknowledging that microsoft had made good on its promise of listening to consumers rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third xbox console offers regarding console s slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to playstation 4 it was noted that while might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately most people generally won t notice a difference between xbox one and playstation 4 versions of a game when there is one unless they see both running side by side and examples of gorgeous xbox one games were noted such as sunset overdrive and forza motorsport 5 number of hidden options in xbox one s user interface was equated to hunting for treasure in a messy room as such kinect voice commands in combination with access to common functions within xbox smartglass app were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience xbox one s revision was critically praised for its improvements over original model including its streamlined design addition of hdr and 4k video support and visual improvements on some games such as fallout 4 and rise of tomb raider when upscaled to 4k however techradar noted regressions such as lack of a kinect port considered one last kick in pants for all gamers forced into buying more expensive console bundle two short years ago and concerns that revised hardware and hdr support would lead to fragmentation of xbox one s ecosystem as not all users will necessarily experience a game same way dieter bohn of verge similarly felt that although it was one of cheapest 4k blu ray players on market consumers were more interested in streaming 4k content which could be accomplished with cheaper digital media players than 4k blu ray discs and noted small number of hdr enabled games on launch bohn concluded that xbox one s would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its hdr and 4k support but recommended that existing owners consider xbox one x instead lack of exclusive titles xbox one platform has faced criticism for lacking in exclusive releases over competitors such as playstation 4 and nintendo switch although there have been releases in flagship microsoft franchises such as forza and halo they have underperformed in comparison to other entries while several major xbox one exclusives have faced notable delays such as crackdown 3 or outright cancellations including fable legends and by contrast ps4 and switch have seen a large number of critically successful first and third party exclusives and activision would sign with sony interactive entertainment for timed exclusivity on certain add on content in call of duty and destiny franchises former having replaced a previous deal with microsoft an analyst also noted that microsoft s first party studios were not as strong as those of sony explaining that sony has always been about first party and microsoft wanted to emulate that but they allowed studios like rare and lionhead to fade away in 2018 microsoft acquired a large number of third party studios including compulsion games entertainment ninja theory obsidian entertainment playground games and undead labs and hired former crystal dynamics head darrell gallagher to lead a new microsoft studio known as initiative in 2016 microsoft began to make future xbox one exclusive first party releases simultaneously available on windows 10 pcs with digital cross buy support via microsoft store under branding xbox play anywhere this thus makes games microsoft platform exclusives rather than xbox one exclusives microsoft has used branding console launch exclusive to refer to titles such as s battlegrounds that are timed or permanent exclusives to xbox console hardware but were already available on or are planned to be available on pc microsoft initially imposed policies referred to as parity clause on indie games which required that xbox one version of a game be released at same time as versions on other platforms phil spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that xbox one was a first class platform by discouraging staggered releases however these policies resulted in some studios such as vlambeer developer of nuclear throne choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with sony instead who proved to be more receptive to indie development by july 2015 microsoft had changed its policies in response to criticism with spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios spencer also stated that microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make xbox launches of former timed exclusives special in some way so that customers are not simply purchasing last year s game sales microsoft only publicized its sales figures during first year after release last official figure was
