film historian film news anandan stated that kalidas was produced in a hurry and was technically flawed while kalidas primary language was tamil film s actors spoke a variety of languages including tamil rajalakshmi telugu venkatesan and hindi prasad because venkatesan s first language was telugu and he could not correctly pronounce tamil words his dialogue was in telugu according to guy irani was initially unsure if german sound recording equipment would record tamil language to assuage his doubts he had some actors speak and sing in tamil with venkatesan in telugu because equipment had already been used to record hindi he had other actors speak that language equipment recorded each language clearly owing to use of multiple languages sources including film news anandan birgit meyer and guy have refused to call kalidas first tamil sound film guy instead called it india s first multilingual film in 2010 book cinemas of south india culture resistance ideology sowmya dechamma states that telugu dialogues were included in film apparently to increase its market potential in two important language markets of southern india music kalidas featured fifty songs composed and written by bhaskara das film historian s theodore baskaran mentions in his 1996 book eye of serpent an introduction to tamil cinema that all of songs were in tamil birgit meyer contradicted baskaran in her 2009 book aesthetic formations stating that film had telugu songs a view that was supported by sowmya dechamma in cinemas of south india culture resistance ideology although film was based on mythology it featured compositions from much later time periods such as those by carnatic musician tyagaraja and indian national congress publicity songs film news anandan stated reddy was probably pleased to add on anything artistic that came his way relevance was hardly an issue 2008 book tamil cinema cultural politics of india s other film industry by selvaraj velayutham and aesthetic formations by birgit meyer stipulate that nationalistic songs featured in film had nothing to do with main plot while randor guy states during that period historical accuracy wasn t as important as music it wasn t uncommon for deities to sing modern poems or nationalist songs baskaran noted that this marked beginning of cinema being used as an instrument of political propaganda patriotic song kai charkha that mahatma gandhi handles also known as gandhi kai was sung by t p rajalakshmi and was unrelated to story of kalidas song extolled charkha spinning wheel a gandhian symbol of nationalism rajalakshmi also performed two of tyagaraja s compositions enta and latter of which was based on raga for film another song which rajalakshmi performed manmada baanamadaa became immensely popular and was described by
