in alta especially as airport would be located so close to town center potentially causing noise pollution an alternative at was considered but this was discarded because surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions decision to build alta airport was made in 1961 followed by additional expropriation of land construction was carried out simultaneously with that of banak and kirkenes airport hoybuktmoen which combined would give finnmark three primary airports construction started in february 1962 and cost nok 3 2 million runway was completed by fall of that year but other parts of construction were delayed by late april 1963 airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training however issues were resolved allowing

was established in 1988 and started operations in northern norway in may 1990 making alta its central hub for finnmark this involved a change to operations so that all dc 9 services from alta to oslo were flown non stop conversely all services to airports in northern norway were flown using smaller fokker 50 thus sas was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with dc 9 md 80 and
