estrange performed solo for first time in melbourne and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless performer tightrope walking had grown in popularity in australia through 1860s following reports reaching australian colonies of exploits of great french walker charles blondin who crossed niagara falls in 1859 by mid 1860s australian wire walkers were modelling themselves on blondin copying his techniques with several even calling themselves australian blondin popularity of name surged after original blondin visited australia in 1874 performing his highwire act in brisbane sydney and melbourne by mid 1880s there were at least five performing regularly in sydney and elsewhere l estrange began using moniker australian blondin from early 1876 arriving in sydney from melbourne l estrange erected a large canvas enclosure in domain and began a regular series of performances on tightrope copying location and stunts of real blondin who had performed there in august 1874 his opening night on 26 january 1877 attracted a reported crowd of between two and three thousand people newspaper reports commented that his performance was so like that of original blondin that people could be forgiven for thinking they had seen world renowned rope walker with his rope suspended 40 feet 12 metres above ground l estrange walked backwards and forwards walked in armour walked covered in a sack used and sat on a chair cooked and rode a bicycle all on rope his show also included a fireworks display for public s entertainment l estrange performed in domain from january through to

australian blondin crossing middle harbour in illustrated sydney news 28 april 1877 in late march 1877 advertisements began to appear in sydney newspapers for l estrange s proposed harbour crossing first public performance was set for saturday 31 march with l estrange having organised 21 steamers to convey spectators from circular quay to a special landing stage close to his performance area l estrange advised those wishing to see his performance to travel on his steamers as they were only ones with permission to land passengers this of course this did not stop other entrepreneurs and captains from carrying spectators of their own whilst event was profitable l estrange considered that majority of viewers were non paying dead heads prior to public performance l estrange undertook crossing for a select audience including members of press that crossing was a success and was well reviewed in papers no doubt adding to crowd s anticipation for saturday show sadly bad weather postponed performance which did not go ahead until 14 april at 1 o clock on saturday 14 april steamers began leaving circular quay conveying 8 000 of an estimated 10 000 strong crowd to middle harbour a large crowd considering alternative attractions that day of sydney royal easter show known then simply as exhibition and horse racing remainder were reported to be walking from st leonards with a toll being collected along way spectators clambered up sides of bay for vantage points while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats yachts and in row boats below rope was strung across entrance to willoughby bay from folly point to head of bay a reported length of above waters below distance meant that two ropes were required spliced together in centre to reach other side with 16 stays fixed to shore and into harbour to steady structure successful crossing was greeted with enthusiastic cheers tunes of young australian band albion brass band and cooper and bailey s international show band who had all come to entertain crowds and of steamers whistles l estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet crowds although many had already rushed steamers to leave resulting in a few being jostled into harbour while illustrated sydney news proclaimed it a truly wonderful feat performed with greatest coolness and consummate ability not all of sydney s press were so enthusiastic sydney mail questioned worth of such a performance beyond profits made commenting that it was a mystery to many minds why such large concourses of people should gather together to witness a spectacle which has so little intrinsic merit there is nothing about it to charm taste or delight fancy despite criticism l estrange performed at least once more at middle harbour although crowds were down to a few hundred requiring only four steamers to transport them same night he was guest of honour at a testimonial dinner held at victoria theatre where young australian band played blondin march a piece composed specially by their conductor mr j devlin he was presented with a large gold star engraved with a scene of his latest triumph date of his public performance measuring across it was centred with a 1 1 2 carat diamond and suspended by a blue ribbon to a clasp featuring australian coat of arms in silver an illuminated address and a bag of sovereigns collected from his admirers were also given l estrange thereafter took his show on road going first to brisbane in may 1877 and reportedly afterwards to singapore england and america ballooning in april 1878 l estrange reappeared on australian scene with a new performance gas ballooning first balloon ascent in australia had been made in melbourne in 1853 with sydney following five years later in december 1858 idea that people could be lifted from ground to fly and return safely fired imagination of public and novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through 1860s and 1870s no doubt very real chance of disaster and injury added to crowd s keen interest as mishaps were not uncommon l estrange came to sydney with his balloon in november 1878 accompanied by reports of successful flights already made in india and sydney morning herald offered a confident appraisal of l estrange s new venture in a letter to sydney city council l estrange sought permission for use of exhibition grounds in prince alfred park behind central railway station for his first attempt city of sydney archives 2 november 1878 letters received 26 154 0981 cited in dictionary of sydney l estrange struggled to fill balloon through afternoon of 17 november 1878 with gas supplied by australian gas light company by 5pm crowd was getting restless and l estrange decided to attempt liftoff despite balloon not being fully inflated to lighten load he removed car in which he was to sit and instead sat in a loop of rope balloon managed only to drag him across park before clearing and landing on a railway truck in yards of central railway station next to park l estrange blamed failure on having been supplied with dense gas and a filling pipe that was too narrow and leaky l estrange wrote to council again this time asking for permission to use belmore park for a second attempt city of sydney archives 21 november 1878 letters received 26 154 1044 cited in dictionary of sydney much like his first attempt second ended in failure once again balloon took much of day to fill with lift going ahead at 5 pm on afternoon of 7 december 1878 first attempt dragged him approximately through crowd returning to start point l estrange tried again shooting up into air approximately and sailing away towards south before descending again and being dragged across park crowd feared balloon would crash but once more it lifted up and over roof of carters barracks l estrange realising that balloon was not going to lift higher threw out anchor which caught in spouting of a building and threw balloon into drying yard of benevolent asylum where it caught in washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed still l estrange s place in sydney hearts had been established and a well attended benefit was held at theatre royal on 19 december 1878 l estrange survived an even more disastrous attempt in melbourne less than six months later at grounds of agricultural society in a balloon named aurora having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from metropolitan gas company he miscalculated speed at which balloon would ascend having floated much higher than originally anticipated balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in calico fabric suddenly burst l estrange had presence of mind to deploy silk parachute which slowed rate of descent his landing was softened by a tree and although severely shaken l estrange was uninjured whole journey took nine minutes catastrophe was widely reported with story appearing in local newspapers in adelaide canberra sydney and brisbane within week this was first emergency descent by parachute in australia predating caterpillar club by over 50 years despite these setbacks l estrange persisted returning to sydney in august 1880 to prepare for another attempt success finally came with a flight on 25 september 1880 from cook park northwards over garden palace and sydney harbour to manly final balloon flight buoyed by his achievement l estrange set himself a second flight day in march 1881 with his reputation already well known in sydney and a successful flight on record a crowd of over 10 000 turned up in outer domain as a result of high atmospheric pressure and heavy dew weighing down balloon inflation took longer than anticipated and crowd grew restless officer representing company supplying gas also refused to provide a new supply l estrange was presented with what was described as a hobson s choice either to abandon attempt and risking being seriously maltreated by mob or proceed without car accepting attendant risks of such an aerial voyage he chose latter and lift commenced at 9 30 pm with l estrange sitting in a loop of rope much like his attempt three years previously at first all seemed well as balloon lifted above heads of crowd hovering for a moment before first heading over hyde park he described rest of his voyage in a letter to a friend managing to right himself he became faint from escaping gas and lashed himself to ropes to prevent a fall realising attempt was now a danger to himself and balloon l estrange set out grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring balloon down however ropes had become tangled and hooks were too short l estrange s balloon descended rapidly over rooftops of woolloomooloo slamming into a house near corner of palmer street and robinson lane l estrange managed to disentangle himself and fell first onto a chimney then a shed below he scrambled down from rooftops to a waiting mob who whisked him away to robinson s hotel on william street corner and would not let him leave at crash site during an attempt to free balloon escaping gas was ignited when resident of house opened a window to see what commotion was and gas came into contact with open flame of room s chandelier resulting fireball destroyed balloon burnt a number of bystanders and was bright enough to cast a brief but vivid illumination over entire suburb a panicked crush developed as groups tried to both flee from and rush towards brief but extremely bright conflagration while those further away at launch site assumed l estrange had been killed several people were injured in crush or burned by fire with one lady reportedly being blinded although a masonic benefit was held in his honour to try to recoup some of his financial losses fiasco spelt end of l estrange s aeronautical career return to tightrope walking in a change of direction in march 1882 l estrange applied to sydney city council to establish a juvenile pleasure gardens at paddington reservoir fun park was to have a variety of rides a maze merry go round and a donkey racecourse l estrange proposed park to be free entry with all monies being made via sale of refreshments on site while he was given permission park does not appear ever to have opened city of sydney archives 22 march 1882 letters received 26 183 475 cited in dictionary of sydney thumb right studio portrait of l estrange demonstrating riding a bicycle on a tightrope following disastrous balloon attempt and failed pleasure grounds l estrange decided to return to what he knew best tightrope walking in april 1881 l estrange given top billing as hero of middle harbour performed at garden palace on high rope as part of juvenile fete with other acrobats contortionists and actors with proof of continuing popularity of rope act he decided to return to his greatest triumph spectacular crossing of harbour in 1877 which had still not been repeated on 23 december 1882 l estrange advised public that he would cross harbour once more this time riding a bicycle across banbury bay close to site of his original success as with his previous crossings steamers took crowds from circular quay although this time only four were needed while another 600 700 people made their own way to site ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 december but delays meant l estrange did not appear until 6 pm although length of rope was over 182 metres it was only just over nine metres above water stay wires were held in boats on either side with crews rowing against each other to keep it steady l estrange rode his bicycle towards centre where with rope swinging to and fro he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead realising he was losing his balance he was forced to leap from rope and fell into water below although he was unhurt it was another knock to his reputation a repeat attempt was announced for following weekend again steamers took a dwindling crowd to banbury bay where they found l estrange s rope had been mysteriously cut and he cancelled performance daily telegraph reported that many in crowd who had paid for tickets on steamers felt they had been scammed late career with his reputation in tatters after balloon crash and attempted second harbour crossing l estrange slowly slipped out of public eye in december 1883 he was reported as performing again on highwire at parramatta industrial juvenile exhibition while his act attracted favourable publicity his efforts were not received with amount of enthusiasm they certainly deserved in april 1885 a benefit was held for l estrange again at masonic lodge like one held after his balloon misadventure it was advertised that benefit under patronage of mayor and aldermen of sydney and with bill beach world champion in attendance was prompted because l estrange had lately met with a severe accident nature of accident is unknown but it is speculated to have been a fall from his tightrope explaining end of his performances his apparent decline in popularity may have been as much a reflection of public s changing taste for entertainment as it was a comment on his act by time l estrange returned to sydney to attempt his second harbour crossing in 1882 city was awash with blondin imitators performing increasingly dangerous and probably illegal feats at least five were performing in sydney from 1880 under variations of title from young blondin alfred row to
