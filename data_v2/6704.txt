two versions of song were recorded with second performance being used for final single although it was rumoured that future led zeppelin guitarist jimmy page had performed song s guitar solo myth has since been proven false you really got me was built around power chords perfect fifths and octaves and heavily influenced later rock musicians particularly in genres of heavy metal and punk rock built around a guitar riff played by dave davies song s lyrics were described by dave as a love song for street kids you really got me was released on 4 august 1964 as group s third single and reached number one on uk singles chart next month remaining for two weeks song became group s breakthrough hit it established them as one of top british invasion acts in united states reaching number seven there later in year you really got me was later included on kinks debut album kinks american rock band van halen adapted song for their 1978 self titled debut album it was released as their first single and peaked at 36 on billboard hot 100 background you really got me was written by ray davies kinks vocalist and main songwriter sometime between 9 and 12 march 1964 created on piano in front room of davies home song was stylistically very different from finished product being much lighter and somewhat jazz oriented ray said of song s writing when i came up with you really got me i hadn t been writing songs very long at all it was one of first five i ever came up with during spring of 1964 ray davies played an early version of you really got me on piano to rock photographer allan ballard during a photo shoot ballard later remembered it was quite a small pokey victorian terrace a bit scruffy and in hallway they had an upright piano ray sat down and plonked out der der der der der he said what do you reckon to this it meant nothing to me at time but it ended up as you really got me ray initially planning for song to be a more laid back number later played chords of song to brother dave davies kinks lead guitarist however upon hearing track dave decided that riff would be much more powerful on a guitar ray said of track s change to a guitar centred track i wanted it to be a jazz type tune because that s what i liked at time it s written originally around a sax line dave ended up playing sax line in fuzz guitar and it took song a step further band then began to perform new track in some of their live shows where it was well received in 1998 ray said i d written you really got me as tribute to all those great blues people i love lead belly and big bill broonzy dave cited gerry mulligan as an inspiration saying ray was a great fan of gerry mulligan who was in jazz on a summer s day movie and as he sat at piano at home he sort of messed around in a vein similar to mulligan and came up with this figure based on a 12 bar blues dave has also said that song had been inspired by jimmy giuffre s song train and river according to band s manager larry page song s characteristic riff came about while working out chords of kingsmen s louie louie lyrically song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of band s first serious female fans recording song was recorded by kinks at least twice in summer of 1964 band s demo was in a bluesy style while a full studio version recorded in june was slower and less emphatic than final single shel talmy had according to davies covered track in reverb all but burying lead guitar band wanted to rerecord song but their record company pye refused to fund another session on grounds that band s first two singles had failed to chart ray davies however threatened that he would refuse to perform or promote single unless it was rerecorded manager larry page also refused to publish original recording when pye stood its ground band s own management broke stalemate by funding session themselves ray davies adamant attitude on behalf of career making song effectively established him as leader and chief songwriter of kinks davies later said i was floundering around trying to find an identity it was in 1964 that i managed to do that to be able to justify myself and say i exist i m here i was literally born when that song hit influential distortion sound of guitar track was created after guitarist dave davies sliced speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin amplifier was affectionately called little green after name of amplifier made by elpico company and purchased in davies neighbourhood music shop linked to a vox ac 30 in 2014 dave davies accused brother ray of lying about participating in dave s guitar distortion sound dave wrote on his facebook page my brother is lying i don t know why he does this but it was my elpico amp that i bought and out of frustration i cut speaker cone up with a razor blade and i was so shocked and surprised and excited that it worked that i demonstrated sound to ray and kinks bassist pete quaife ray liked sound and he had written a riff on piano which formed basis of song you really got me and i played riff on my guitar with my new sound i alone created this sound according to recent kinks releases that give full official performance credits of track group members ray davies vocals and rhythm guitar dave davies lead guitar pete quaife bass are joined by session men bobby graham drums and arthur greenslade piano regular kinks drummer mick avory plays tambourine guitar solo guitar solo on recording has been subject of persistent myth that it was not played by kinks lead guitarist dave davies but by then session player jimmy page who later joined yardbirds and led zeppelin among those claiming page played lead guitar was jon lord of deep purple who also claimed to play piano on track page has always denied playing song s guitar solo going so far as to state in a 1970s interview cited in sound on sound magazine that i didn t play on you really got me and that s what him ray davies off rock historian and author doug hinman makes a case that rumour was begun and fostered by established british rhythm and blues community many of whose members were resentful that an upstart band of teenagers such as kinks could produce such a powerful and influential blues based recording seemingly out of nowhere shel talmy producer on track has gone on record and put controversy to rest in an interview with guardian saying contrary to myth jimmy didn t play on you really got me in a 7 november 2014 interview with siriusxm s town hall series page confirmed again that he did not play on song saying oh crikey i wasn t on you really got me but i did play on kinks records that s all i m going to say about it but every time i do an interview people ask me about you really got me so maybe somebody can correct wikipedia so people won t keep asking me in his 1998 autobiographical release storyteller ray davies storyteller allmusic ray davies discusses guitar solo he confirms that his brother dave played solo and it was preceded by some bantering between two music and lyrics while ray davies had been instructed at time to write beatle type material for commercial reasons you really got me was written as a more r b based composition song is centred on a guitar riff by dave davies which has since been referred to as instantly identifiable american musicologist robert walser described you really got me as first hit song built around power chords song has since been labeled as an early influence of heavy metal genre with critic denise sullivan of allmusic writing you really got me remains a blueprint song in hard rock and heavy metal arsenal sullivan denise review of you really got me allmusic however dave davies has since rejected idea that song is heavy metal saying i ve never really like that term heavy metal i think in all humility it was first heavy guitar riff rock record just because of sound if you played it on a ukulele it might not have been so powerful lyrics of song are about lust and sex dave davies said of song s lyrics you really got me is such a pure record really it s a love song for street kids they re not going to wine and dine you even if they knew how to chat you up they say i want you come here release and reception you really got me was released as band s third single on 4 august 1964 backed with it s alright within three days of single s release you really got me began to appear on local charts eventually song climbed to top of british charts band s first single to do so ray davies later claimed that due to single s

their respective markets were proposed by shel talmy but they never materialized upon release single received a positive review from record mirror which said highly promising group with strong guitar sound and a compact sort of vocal performance mid tempo but bustling song should sell well in melody maker singer dave berry was featured in a blindfold test of song with berry at first guessing song was by kingsmen he said it s fabulous this one i like these records that sound as if they ve gone into a recording studio and done what they wanted to on spot it s a good chance of being a big hit melody maker review had a lasting impact on ray davies who said that berry had a few hits so he mattered and that berry s belief that band had done what they wanted had said it all for him kinks use of distorted guitar riffs continued with songs like all day and all of night tired of waiting for you and set me free among others pete townshend of who a band also produced by talmy at that time has
