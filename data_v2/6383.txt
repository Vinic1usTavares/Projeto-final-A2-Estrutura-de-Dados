chest managed to leave restaurant while gabriel remained hidden in restaurant s bathroom eight other people escaped building through back door another customer jiri who took cover under a table used a moment in which was reloading and threw a chair at him hitting him on neck this gave him an opportunity to run out through front door with two other people authorities received first distress call from a person who escaped from restaurant at 12 38 pm and first police car reached building at 12 47 pm policemen were armed with standard equipment for czech police officers holstered pistols mostly with variants of that was also used by kovar body armor and a select fire rifle stored in car first two officers to arrive immediately entered building with body armor on and guns drawn kovar taking cover behind a bar opposite to door opened fire on officers as soon as they entered police noted people lying on ground and sitting on chairs between them and shooter not knowing status of civilians police decided not to return fire covered exits and waited for arrival of a tactical unit by this time other police units as well as first ambulance car had arrived taking away wounded female victim who had escaped at 12 56 pm kovar called a prima tv station crime news reporter claiming that he was being harassed by multiple people and that he had hostages whom he threatened to kill journalist who spoke to gunman called police who were already sending all available units to location a police negotiator contacted kovar by phone at 13 07 during negotiations kovar claimed to have hostages although all of people remaining inside were most likely already dead apart from gabriel who was hiding at bathroom unbeknownst to kovar hostage claim delayed police entry into building kovar stopped communicating at about 14 00 p m after attempts to contact him failed tactical team breached building at 14 23 p m upon team s entry kovar immediately shot himself dead apart from stun grenades policemen did not fire a single shot after securing restaurant police let in a large number of medical personnel only person alive who remained inside building was gabriel who had been hiding in bathroom for entire duration of incident perpetrator and victims perpetrator zdenek kovar 24 february 2015 was 63 years old at time of his death and lived with his wife in a house not far from scene of murders neighbours described couple as deranged both possibly mentally ill and known for loudness and verbal abuse of their neighbours kovar was son of a worker in local firearms factory largest small arms manufacturer in country formerly an electrician he had been unemployed for at least ten years kovar had held a gun license since 2000 and legally owned both of guns he used victims a total of eight people excluding gunman died in rampage this included seven men aged 27 to 66 and one woman aged 47 another woman aged 37 survived despite being shot twice in chest aftermath thumb 350px number of legally owned firearms in czech republic in thousands and total number of victims of intentional homicide by any object as more information about kovar s notoriety among neighbors surfaced focus of investigation shifted towards circumstances under which he gained and retained gun license and firearms in order to be granted a gun license in czech republic a person must pass a qualification exam receive a health clearance by a general practitioner who may require a further examination by a specialist such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and must pass a background check according to section 23 of czech firearms act an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in previous three years similarly law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses annex 1 license must be renewed every five years every ten years for licenses issued after 1 july 2014 renewal requires presentation of a new health clearance while police conduct a new background check kovar s license was renewed in january 2015 misdemeanors registry kovar applied for a gun license renewal in accordance with law according to kovar s brother in law neighbors and a local policeman who had repeated contacts with him kovar and his wife had committed misdemeanors against public order municipality of uhersky brod which deals with such misdemeanors did not register them and thus kovar had an apparently clean history in turn this satisfied requirements and he had his license renewed renewal of his license was due to fact that while there is a central registry of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in czech republic in case where a non traffic misdemeanor is solved on spot e g fining by a policeman no record of it is made only when investigated person or police refuse to deal with misdemeanor on spot is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted then a record of it is made by municipality czech government had made a decision to introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in october 2014 planning to have system working within two years as police are obliged to revoke a gun license when licensee has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in a period of three years central registry of misdemeanors might have allowed police to effectively revoke license long before murders health clearance at any time police may order a new health clearance inspection if they have a reasonable concern that person is not healthy enough to continue holding their license according to uhersky brod mayor patrik kuncar kovar s family members tried to prevent kovar from having license renewed by pleading with his general practitioner not to grant him necessary health clearance since they felt threatened and considered him mentally unstable nevertheless kovar received clearance from his general practitioner and presented it as a part of his license renewal application on 19 january 2015 after renewing license in january police were contacted by an unspecified person who reported to them on kovar s mental state police subsequently contacted kovar s general practitioner and psychiatrist and on 17 february 2015 ordered a health reevaluation he received letter on 19 february 2015 four days before murders under law kovar was obliged to present a new health clearance within a month or lose license czech media has speculated that apparent attempt of authorities to review kovar s mental state may have triggered rampage a few days after murders ministry of interior announced its deliberation about making gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms this was however rejected by psychiatric associations they argued that psychiatrists main goal is to cure patients and that potential patients may be more likely to avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license police response one of main topics of debate after kovar s rampage became way police dealt with him especially whether first two responding officers were under circumstances supposed to immediately engage and neutralize perpetrator and whether decision to wait for arrival of tactical unit was sound debate became more vocal after a cook who managed to escape rampage claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from restaurant after police had retreated another witness who escaped unharmed refuted this version of events saying that shots were fired only during initial ten minutes leading up to point of police entry with no shots heard thereafter police said first responders decided not to engage because they saw civilians lying and sitting in line of fire between them and perpetrator they didn t know their status and perpetrator had taken cover behind a bar with only his head and hand holding pistol visible according to chief of zlin regional police department jaromir tkadlecek uhersky brod district units present had enough manpower and equipment including select fire rifles to engage kovar however they decided to withdraw due to perpetrator s claim of having hostages and stated intent to negotiate their release apart from local units a special ordnance unit was called in from its regional headquarters in zlin it arrived about 30 minutes later because there are eight tactical teams covering fourteen czech regions and none in zlin a tactical team from brno was called in team s fifteen members reached restaurant by cars in 66 minutes opting not to use their helicopter that has a capacity of six furthermore a paramilitary anti terrorist police urna unit was called from prague however its helicopters arrived after end of standoff according to tkadlecek even if urna had its headquarters directly in uhersky brod it would not have changed anything about timing nor manner in which police engaged kovar zlin region politicians announced they would call for establishment of a local tactical team meanwhile minister of interior commented that police were already in process of hiring 4 000 new officers about 10 of its total manpower thus reversing cuts enacted by previous governments experts further pointed out necessity to provide more training to policemen in small municipalities and at rural areas this type of training had until that point been largely aimed and directed at police officers in large towns on 10 march 2015 weekly newspaper published more details of police engagement by chance an emergency motorized police unit which usually serve as immediate reinforcement to police officers in field was conducting exercises not far from uhersky brod unit arrived within twenty minutes of first emergency call heavily armed and well trained their officer in charge gave order to immediately engage perpetrator within a minute local police station chief arrived and ordered them to stand down began securing perimeter gathering information and preparing an engagement plan meanwhile kovar called emergency line 158 and mentioned he had five unharmed hostages and was demanding presence of tv prima officer in charge ordered policemen to stand down just as they were about to enter building in order to start negotiating at that time he could not have been aware of status of victims inside fifteen minutes later zlin region police chief arrived in total command over operation was passed between five people within initial 40 minutes fact that police rules allow passing of command during engagement had been condemned a week earlier by member of parliament stanislav who pointed out to czech firemen s rules according to which first person in charge at place of engagement remains in charge even if a general happens to come to join an operation afterwards he noted that passing of command requires briefing which not only leads to loss of time but often also to subsequent mistakes as of may 2015 only direct outcome of inquiry into police response to shooting was lowering of wage of a dispatch officer who advised policemen on spot over radio not to engage so that nothing worse happens in june 2015 two members of security committee of czech parliament visited uhersky brod and talked to multiple witnesses mps issued a report condemning handling of situation by police among other issues mps criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within shooting range of attacker initially failed to get information from witnesses and only later during intervention attempted to contact them didn t cover back exit and thus potentially allowed perpetrator to escape from building and jeopardize other people police even let a helicopter land within shooting range of attacker according to mps police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly they wrongly decided to believe perpetrator s claim of having hostage even though witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead policemen didn t seal vicinity of attack until 1 pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters minister of interior chovanec commented that mps failed to interview policemen and thus didn t get all relevant information gun politics in one of first reactions on day of murders before knowing whether kovar possessed guns he used legally minister of interior milan chovanec stated that it was up to debate whether society wants to have so many gun license holders support for chovanec s comments was largely among members of parliament elected for communist party others accused chovanec of abusing tragedy for his own political benefit some members of parliament such as miroslav chairman of senate constitutional committee commented that licensing process is thorough enough and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons especially in recent time also due to rising threat of islamist terrorist attacks roman vana chairman of parliamentary security committee and member of chovanec s own social democratic party refused chovanec s argument while some other members of parliament went in opposite direction claiming that there are too few armed people among czech population since a single armed civilian might have stopped kovar s assault sentiment was shared also by for example martin koller a former ambassador to and iraq who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force and who pointed out to a past well known czech case of a machete attack and to charlie hebdo shooting stating that both might have ended quite differently had victims been armed mf dnes pointed out that despite steady rise of firearm ownership in country since abolition of restrictive communist legislation after velvet revolution number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994 during a press conference on 26 february 2015 chovanec introduced five areas that were to be scrutinized in connection with uhersky brod attack communication of national police with municipal authorities possible changes in crisis plans operational range of tactical teams and enhanced training of policemen chovanec didn t repeat his sentiment regarding number of gun license holders and instead specified that one of issues to be analyzed will be issuing and revocation of licenses under existing legislation reactions czech minister of interior milan chovanec said on twitter that shooting was not a terrorist incident but actions of a crazed individual czech prime minister sobotka who was on a trip to south korea at time said in a statement i am shocked by tragic attack that happened today in i would like to express my deepest sorrow and condolences to families and relatives of victims uhersky brod mayor patrik kuncar also said i m shaken to core by this incident i could not have dreamed something like this could happen here in a restaurant that i m so familiar with day after murders hundreds of people gathered in
