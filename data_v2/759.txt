painted turtle chrysemys picta is most widespread native turtle of north america it lives in slow moving fresh waters from southern canada to northern mexico and from atlantic to pacific turtle is only species of genus chrysemys which is part of pond turtle family emydidae fossils show that painted turtle existed 15 million years ago four regionally based subspecies eastern midland southern and western evolved during last ice age adult painted turtle female is long male is smaller turtle s top shell is dark and smooth without a ridge its skin is olive to black with red orange or yellow stripes on its extremities subspecies can be distinguished by their shells eastern has straight aligned top shell segments midland has a large gray mark on bottom shell southern has a red line on top shell western has a red pattern on bottom shell turtle eats aquatic vegetation algae and small water creatures including insects crustaceans and fish although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents canines and snakes adult turtles hard shells protect them from most predators reliant on warmth from its surroundings painted turtle is active only during day when it basks for hours on logs or rocks during winter turtle hibernates usually in mud at bottom of water bodies turtles mate in spring and autumn females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid summer hatched turtles grow until sexual maturity 2 9 years for males 6 16 for females in traditional tales of algonquian tribes colorful turtle played part of a trickster in modern times four u s states have named painted turtle their official reptile while habitat loss and road killings have reduced turtle s population its ability to live in human disturbed settings has helped it remain most

juts its head into and out of vegetation to stir potential victims out into open water where they are pursued turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears prey apart with its forefeet it also consumes plants and skims surface of water with its mouth open to catch small particles of food although all subspecies of painted turtle eat both plants and animals their specific diets vary eastern painted turtle s diet is least studied it prefers to eat in water but has been observed eating on land fish it consumes are typically dead or injured midland painted turtle eats mostly aquatic insects and both vascular and non vascular plants southern painted turtle s diet changes with age juveniles diet consists of 13 vegetation while adults eat 88 vegetation this perhaps shows that turtle prefers small larvae and other prey but can only obtain significant amounts while young reversal of feeding habits with age has also been seen in false map turtle which inhabits some of same range most common plants eaten by adult southern painted turtles are duckweed and algae and most common prey items are dragonfly larvae and crayfish western painted turtle s consumption of plants and animals changes seasonally in early summer 60 of its diet comprises insects in late summer 55 includes plants of note western painted turtle aids in dispersal of white water lily seeds turtle consumes hard coated seeds which remain viable after passing through turtle and disperses them through its feces common foods of painted turtle larva water lily water surface predators painted turtles are most vulnerable to predators when young nests are frequently ransacked and eggs eaten by garter snakes crows chipmunks thirteen lined ground and gray squirrels skunks groundhogs raccoons badgers gray and red fox and humans small and sometimes bite size numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs bass catfish bullfrogs snapping turtles three types of snakes copperheads racers and water snakes herons rice rats weasels muskrats minks and raccoons as adults turtles armored shells protect them from many potential predators but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators ospreys crows red shouldered hawks bald eagles and especially raccoons painted turtles defend themselves by kicking scratching biting or urinating in contrast to land tortoises painted turtles can right themselves if they are flipped

claws thumb female painted turtle painted turtles mate in spring and fall in waters of males start producing sperm in early spring when they can bask to an internal temperature of females begin their reproductive cycles in mid summer and ovulate following spring courtship begins when a male follows a female until he meets her face to face he then strokes her face and neck with his elongated front claws a gesture returned by a receptive female pair repeat process several times with male retreating from and then returning to female until she swims to bottom where they copulate as male is smaller than female he is not dominant female stores sperm to be used for up to three clutches in her oviducts sperm may remain viable for up to three years a single clutch may have multiple fathers egg laying nesting is done by females only between late may and mid july nests are vase shaped and are usually dug in sandy soil often at sites with southern exposures nests are often within of water but may be as far away as with older females tending to nest further inland nest sizes vary depending on female sizes and locations but are about deep females may return to same sites several consecutive years but if several females make their nests close together eggs become more vulnerable to predators thumb upright alt a female digging a nest with her hind legs female digging a nest female s optimal body temperature while digging her nest is if weather is unsuitable for instance a too hot night in southeast she delays process until later at night painted turtles in virginia have been observed waiting three weeks to nest because of a hot drought while preparing to dig her nest female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior she presses her throat against ground of different potential sites perhaps sensing moisture warmth texture or smell although her exact motivation is unknown she may further by excavating several false nests as wood turtles also do female relies on her hind feet for digging she may accumulate so much sand and mud on her feet that her mobility is reduced making her vulnerable to predators to lighten her labors she lubricates area with her bladder water once nest is complete female deposits into hole freshly laid eggs are white elliptical porous and flexible from start to finish female s work may take four hours sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards before returning to her home water females can lay five clutches per year but two is a normal average after including 30 50 of a population s females that do not produce any clutches in a given year in some northern populations no females lay more than one clutch per year bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch clutch sizes of subspecies vary although differences may reflect different environments rather than different genetics two more northerly subspecies western and midland are larger and have more eggs per clutch 11 9 and 7 6 respectively than two more southerly subspecies southern 4 2 and eastern 4 9 within subspecies also more northerly females lay larger clutches growth incubation lasts 72 80 days in wild and for a similar period in artificial conditions in august and september young turtle breaks out from its egg using a special projection of its jaw called egg tooth not all offspring leave nest immediately though hatchlings north of a line from nebraska to northern illinois to new jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in nest and overwinter to emerge following spring thumb alt several baby painted turtles on moss on a light table hatchlings hatchling s ability to survive winter in nest has allowed painted turtle to extend its range farther north than any other american turtle painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in surrounding ground hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings immediately after hatching turtles are dependent on egg yolk material for sustenance about a week to a week and a half after emerging from their eggs or following spring if emergence is delayed hatchlings begin feeding to support growth young turtles grow rapidly at first sometimes doubling their size in first year growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body growth rates often differ from population to population in same area among subspecies western painted turtles are quickest growers females grow faster than males overall and must be larger to mature sexually in most populations males reach sexual maturity at 2 4 years old and females at 6 10 size and age at maturity increase with latitude at northern edge of their range males reach sexual maturity at 7 9 years of age and females at 11 16 behavior daily routine and basking thumb right alt a painted turtle standing on a floating log basking for warmth a cold blooded reptile painted turtle regulates its temperature through its environment notably by basking all ages bask for warmth often alongside other species of turtle sometimes more than 50 individuals are seen on one log together turtles bask on a variety of objects often logs but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs turtle starts its day at sunrise emerging from water to bask for several hours warmed for activity it returns to water to forage after becoming chilled turtle re emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding at night turtle drops to bottom of its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps to be active turtle must maintain an internal body temperature between when fighting infection it manipulates its temperature up to 5 degc 8 degf higher than normal seasonal routine and hibernation in spring when water reaches turtle begins actively foraging however if water temperature exceeds turtle will not feed in fall turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below spring set point during winter turtle hibernates in north inactive season may be as long as from october to march while southernmost populations may not hibernate at all while hibernating body temperature of painted turtle averages periods of warm weather bring turtle out of hibernation and even in north individuals have been seen basking in february painted turtle hibernates by burying itself either on bottom of a body of water near water in shore bank or burrow of a muskrat or in woods or pastures when hibernating underwater turtle prefers shallow depths no more than within mud it may dig down an additional in this state turtle does not breathe although if surroundings allow it may get some oxygen through its skin species is one of best studied vertebrates able to survive long periods without oxygen adaptations of its blood chemistry brain heart and particularly its shell allow turtle to survive extreme lactic acid buildup while oxygen deprived movement thumb right alt painted turtle with green slime on its shell on pebbles with a couple of leaves on its back sun shining moving on land searching for water food or mates painted turtles travel up to several kilometers at a time during summer in response to heat and water clogging vegetation turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters short overland migrations may involve hundreds of turtles together if heat and drought are prolonged turtles will bury themselves and in extreme cases die foraging turtles frequently cross lakes or travel linearly down creeks daily crossings of large ponds have been observed tag and release studies show that sex also drives turtle movement males travel most up to between captures females second most up to between captures and juveniles least less than between captures males move most and are most likely to change wetlands because they seek mates painted turtles through visual recognition have homing capabilities many individuals can return to their collection points after being released elsewhere trips that may require them to traverse land one experiment placed 98 turtles varying several kilometer distances from their home wetland 41 returned when living in a single large body of water painted turtles can home from up to away females may use homing to help locate suitable nesting sites distribution range most widespread north american turtle painted turtle is only turtle whose

fresh waters with soft bottoms basking sites and aquatic vegetation they find their homes in shallow waters with slow moving currents such as creeks marshes ponds and shores of lakes subspecies have evolved different habitat preferences eastern painted turtle is very aquatic leaving immediate vicinity of its water body only when forced by drought to migrate along atlantic painted turtles have appeared in brackish waters midland and southern painted turtles seek especially quiet waters usually shores and coves they favor shallows that contain dense vegetation and have an unusual toleration of pollution western painted turtle lives in streams and lakes similar to other painted turtles but also inhabits pasture ponds and roadside pools it is found as high as population features within much of its range painted turtle is most abundant turtle species population densities range from 10 to 840 turtles per hectare 2 5 acres of water surface warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations and habitat desirability also influences density rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only shore is desirable habitat central deep waters skew surface based estimates also lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space thumb 150px right alt two diagrams showing on outer segments of turtle shells there are some notches and then corresponding numbered code shell marking code adults outnumber juveniles in most populations but gauging ratios is difficult because juveniles are harder to catch with current sampling methods estimates of age distribution vary widely annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age probability of a painted turtle surviving from egg to its first birthday is only 19 for females annual survival rate rises to 45 for juveniles and 95 for adults male survival rates follow a similar pattern but are probably lower overall than females as evidenced by average male age being lower than that of female natural disasters can confound age distributions for instance a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region resulting in fewer hatchlings next year age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults to understand painted turtle adult age distributions researchers require reliable methods turtles younger than four years up to 12 years in some populations can be aged based on growth rings in their shells for older turtles some attempts have been made to determine age based on size and shape of their shells or legs using mathematical models but this method is more uncertain most reliable method to study long lived turtles is to capture them permanently mark their shells by notching with a drill release turtles and then recapture them in later years as cited in longest running study in michigan has shown that painted turtles can live more than 55 years adult sex ratios of painted turtle populations average around 1 1 many populations are slightly male heavy but some are strongly female imbalanced one population in ontario has a female to male ratio of 4 1 hatchling sex ratio varies based on egg temperature during middle third of incubation temperatures of produce males and anything above or below that females it does not appear that females choose nesting sites to influence sex of hatchlings within a population nests will vary sufficiently to give both male and female heavy broods taxonomy and evolution thumb upright alt a line drawing of schneider s portrait at a 3 4 angle he looks resolute and

was called chrysemys picta first by john edward gray in 1855 four subspecies were then recognized eastern by schneider in 1783 western by gray in 1831 and midland and southern by louis agassiz in 1857 until 1930s many of subspecies of painted turtle were labeled by biologists as full species within chrysemys but this varied by researcher painted turtles in border region between western and midland subspecies were sometimes considered a full species treleasei in 1931 bishop and schmidt defined current four in one taxonomy of species and subspecies based on comparative measurements of turtles from throughout range they subordinated species to subspecies and eliminated treleasei since at least 1958 subspecies were thought to have evolved in response to geographic isolation during last ice age 100 000 to 11 000 years ago at that time painted turtles were divided into three different populations eastern painted turtles along southeastern atlantic coast southern painted turtles around southern mississippi river and western painted turtles in southwestern united states populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long hence wholly different species never evolved when glaciers retreated about 11 000 years ago all three subspecies moved north western and southern subspecies met in missouri and hybridized to produce midland painted turtle which then moved east and north through ohio and tennessee river basins biologists have long debated genera of closely related subfamily mates chrysemys pseudemys and trachemys sliders after 1952 some combined pseudemys and chrysemys because of similar appearance in 1964 based on measurements of skull and feet samuel b mcdowell proposed all three genera be merged into one however further measurements in 1967 contradicted this taxonomic arrangement also in 1967 j alan holman a paleontologist and herpetologist pointed out that although three turtles were often found together in nature and had similar mating patterns they did not crossbreed in 1980s studies of turtles cell structures and parasites further indicated that chrysemys pseudemys and trachemys should remain in separate genera david e starkey and collaborators advanced a new view of subspecies in 2003 based on a study of mitochondrial dna they rejected glacial development theory and argued that southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species c dorsalis while other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated however this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped nevertheless in 2010 iucn recognized both c dorsalis and c p dorsalis as valid names for southern painted turtle fossils thumb right alt fossils in a

of special concern respectively much is written about different factors that threaten painted turtle but they are with only inferences of relative importance a primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms related to water habitat there is drying of wetlands clearing of aquatic logs or rocks basking sites and clearing of shoreline vegetation which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic cited in cited in related to nesting habitat urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils another significant human impact is roadkill dead turtles especially
