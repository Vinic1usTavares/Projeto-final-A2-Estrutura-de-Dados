commented i think if i had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something i might have given up too quickly on writing having no marketable job skills was a tremendous

subject of criticism from some of show s fans john ortved wrote scully s episodes excel when compared to what simpsons airs nowadays but he was man at helm when ship turned towards iceberg bbc noted common consensus is that simpsons golden era ended after season nine while an op ed in slate by chris suellentrop argued simpsons changed from a realistic show about family life into a typical cartoon during scully s years under scully s tenure simpsons became well a cartoon episodes that once would have ended with homer and marge bicycling into sunset perhaps while bart gagged in background now end with homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into marge s neck simpsons under scully has been negatively labelled as a gag heavy homer centric incarnation by jon bonne of msnbc while some fans have bemoaned transformation in homer s character during era from sweet and sincere to a boorish self aggrandizing oaf dubbing him homer despite this much of scully s work on show also received critical praise scully won five primetime emmy awards for his work on simpsons while entertainment weekly cited how i spent my strummer vacation as show s 22nd best episode robert canning of ign also gave episode a positive review something he also did for behind laughter and trilogy of error which aired during season 12 he called latter one extremely enjoyable misadventure simpsons may have peaked in 90s but that doesn t mean eight years since haven t delivered their share of quality episodes this was one of them martin said that he does not understand criticism against scully and that he thinks criticism bothered him and still bothers him but he managed to not get worked up over it ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as lowering quality of show

start to watch it together it was canceled after six episodes scully and thacker laid blame for this on show s timeslot 9 30 p m which was too late for target audience complete savages which thacker and scully wrote with simpsons sensibility of layered jokes was canceled in january 2005 due to low ratings and network anger at scully and thacker s decision to write to tv critics in what hartford
