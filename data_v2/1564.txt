thinking man s music but groove oriented music that makes you feel good in a later interview with artistdirect keenan said that he did not want lyrics to be puzzles he wanted complexity to be in music stating that s part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good in 2006 puscifer contributed song undertaker renholder mix to soundtrack of underworld evolution where renholder a moniker for danny lohner created by members of a perfect circle is reversal of re d lohner keenan financed and released first studio album v is for vagina in october 2007 created in a tour bus in several hotel rooms and in various studios around country while keenan toured with tool album is a radical departure from keenan s contributions in tool and a perfect circle tim alexander best known as drummer for

cabaret keenan who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment having fronted a similar show in los angeles before achieving fame with tool went on to add that you just can t really describe it you just have to see it then it makes sense featuring an ever changing lineup of artists including milla jovovich and primus drummer tim alexander show was originally said to have a long

heaney who described it as a fine piece of cold weather headphone music keenan followed with february 19 2013 release of donkey punch night this ep includes covers of bohemian rhapsody by queen and balls to wall by accept it received mostly mixed reviews resulting in a metacritic rating of 62 writing and performance style a primary purpose of keenan s lyrics for tool involves a desire to connect with listeners on a personal level encouraging them to look within themselves for self identity understanding and reflection tool did not include lyrics with any releases until fear inoculum as keenan believes most people don t get it and it is not a priority of band that people do however after each release keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via semi official fansite with exception of lateralus which was published on official tool website despite maynard s aversion to promoting lyrical content of tool s work to its audience lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in lyrics to lateralus wherein number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of fibonacci numbers and jambi in which metrical foot is used keenan s lyrics on aenima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality specific subjects range from evolution and jungian psychology in forty six 2 and transcendence in lateralus in live performances with tool keenan has often been situated on a platform towards rear of stage without a spotlight facing backdrop rather than audience breckinridge haggerty band s live video director says that dark spaces on stage are mostly for maynard he explains a lot of songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with glare of lights when he s trying to reproduce these emotions for audience he needs a bit of personal space and he feels more comfortable in shadows an exception which surprised even devout tool fans occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug keenan during band s performance of after dropping fan to ground with a gentle hip toss keenan continuing to sing wrapped himself around man s back into a rear naked choke he held man without actually constricting his neck allowing him to raise his fist in celebration keenan eventually turned man to his stomach and sat on his back where he stayed for an uncomfortably long period of time his appearance with tool has included mohawk hairstyle wigs kabuki masks bras tights and his entire body in blue paint this is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting a perfect circle describing keenan s contribution to tool and a perfect circle new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenan s ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust honey in his voice adding a touch of
