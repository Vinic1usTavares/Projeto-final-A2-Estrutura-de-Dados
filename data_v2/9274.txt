air rhodesia flight 825 was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra on 3 september 1978 during rhodesian bush war aircraft involved a vickers viscount named hunyani was flying last leg of air rhodesia s regular scheduled service from victoria falls to capital salisbury via resort town of kariba soon after flight 825 took off a group of zipra guerrillas scored a hit on its starboard wing with a soviet made strela 2 surface to air infrared homing missile critically damaging aircraft and forcing an emergency landing an attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of karoi was foiled by a ditch which caused plane to cartwheel and break up of 52 passengers and four crew 38 died in crash insurgents then approached wreckage rounded up 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire three passengers survived by hiding in surrounding bush while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before guerrillas arrived zipra leader joshua nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down hunyani in an interview with bbc s today programme next day saying aircraft had been used for military purposes but denied that his men had killed survivors on ground majority of rhodesians both black and white saw attack as an act of terrorism a fierce rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black rhodesians supported attacks of this kind reports viewing attack negatively appeared in international journals such as time magazine but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments much to rhodesian government s indignation talks between nkomo and prime minister ian smith which had been progressing promisingly were immediately suspended by rhodesians with smith calling nkomo a monster on 10 september smith announced extension of martial law over selected areas rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over following months attacking both zipra and its rival zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla attack on zipra in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions in february 1979 zipra shot down air rhodesia flight 827 another civilian flight in an almost identical incident background thumb rhodesia or southern rhodesia highlighted in red on a map of africa alt a map see description a dispute over terms for granting of full sovereignty to self governing colony of rhodesia or southern rhodesia led colonial government headed by prime minister ian smith to unilaterally declare independence from united kingdom on 11 november 1965 idea of no independence before majority rule had recently gained ground in britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation and rhodesia s government was dominated by country s white minority so unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally britain and united nations imposed economic sanctions on rhodesia two rival communist backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow government and introduce majority rule chinese aligned zimbabwe african national union zanu mostly comprising created zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla and adopted aspects of maoist doctrine while ndebele dominated zimbabwe african people s union zapu aligned with soviet style marxism leninism and warsaw pact mobilised zimbabwe people s revolutionary army zipra these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called second chimurenga against rhodesian government and security forces resulting conflict rhodesian bush war began in earnest in december 1972 when zanla attacked altena and whistlefield farms in north eastern rhodesia after security forces mounted a successful counter insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 developments overseas caused conflict s momentum to shift in insurgents favour leftist carnation revolution of april 1974 caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support for smith s administration and led to mozambique s independence following year as a communist state openly allied with zanu around same time rhodesia s other main backer south africa adopted a detente initiative that forced a ceasefire giving guerrillas time to regroup following abortive victoria falls conference of august 1975 smith and zapu leader joshua nkomo held unsuccessful talks between december 1975 and march 1976 zanu and zapu announced in october 1976 during run up to unsuccessful geneva conference in december that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint patriotic front in march 1978 smith and non militant nationalist groups headed by bishop abel muzorewa reverend ndabaningi sithole and chief jeremiah chirau agreed what became internal settlement this created a joint black white transitional government with country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia in 1979 pursuant to multiracial elections zanu and zapu were invited to participate but refused nkomo sardonically dubbed smith s black colleagues blacksmiths zanu proclaimed 1978 to be year of people as war continued officials from muzorewa s united african national council sent to provinces to explain internal settlement to rural blacks were killed by marxist leninist guerrillas insurgents also began to target christian missionaries climaxing in killing of nine british missionaries and four children at elim mission near mozambican border on 23 june transitional government was badly received abroad partly because internal settlement kept control of law enforcement military judiciary and civil service under white control no country recognised rhodesia s interim administration smith again worked to bring nkomo into government hoping this would lend it some credence domestically prompt diplomatic recognition overseas and help security forces defeat zanla starting on 14 august 1978 he attended secret meetings with nkomo in lusaka zambia where zapu was based doing so with assistance of mining corporation attempts were made to also involve zanu leader robert mugabe but mugabe would have no part in talks according to south african military historian jakkie cilliers negotiations between smith and nkomo progressed well and seemed on verge of success by start of september 1978 on 2 september smith and nkomo revealed publicly that secret meetings had taken place incident prior threats to rhodesian air traffic a strela 2 surface to air missile launcher and one of its missiles thumb alt a strela 2 launcher and one of its missiles rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 in latter stages of war before this time neither revolutionary force had weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target weapon that made such attacks feasible for zipra was strela 2 shoulder launched surface to air missile launcher supplied by soviet union from mid 1970s as part of warsaw pact s materiel support by september 1978 there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons none of which had been successful some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit but all had survived and landed safely no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during bush war flight thumb a vickers viscount of central african airways air rhodesia s predecessor in 1957 alt a vickers viscount aircraft on a runway photographed from port side air rhodesia was country s national airline established by government on 1 september 1967 to succeed central african airways which was dissolved at end of that year based at salisbury airport air rhodesia s flight network during late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights as well as international services to south african cities of johannesburg and durban flight 825 aircraft was a vickers viscount a british made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing it was named hunyani after river of same name which flowed between lake kariba and rhodesian capital salisbury hunyani was on second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury stopping over in resort town of kariba despite occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on kariba by zipra guerrillas on northern side of zambezi in zambia resort had endured as one of rhodesia s choice tourist destinations flight on 3 september 1978 sunday afternoon from kariba to salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers most of whom were holidaymakers from salisbury returning home after a weekend at lake flight took off from kariba airport on schedule soon after 17 00 central africa time flight 825 was piloted by 36 year old captain john hood a native of bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966 he had flown viscounts for air rhodesia since 1968 and had also served in rhodesian air force on a voluntary basis his first officer garth beaumont was 31 years old and had lived in rhodesia for most of his life having immigrated as a child from south africa two air stewardesses were dulcie 21 years old and from bulawayo and 23 year old louise pearson from salisbury shootdown a group of zipra guerrillas armed with a strela 2 launcher waited in bush beneath flight 825 s flightpath and fired on hunyani about five minutes after it took off while aircraft was still in climb phase of its flight heat seeking missile hit plane s starboard wing and exploded causing inner engine to also explode a fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured creating a fire that could not be put out second starboard engine failed almost immediately leaving hood with only his two port engines heaving wildly hunyani began to descend rapidly at 17 10 captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control informing them that he had lost two starboard engines and was going to crash we re going in he radioed telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing he aimed for an open field of cotton in hills in bush to west of karoi intending to belly land craft landing was relatively stable until hunyani hit a ditch cartwheeled and exploded remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire setting wrecked cabin ablaze massacre on ground of 56 people on board 38 including hood and beaumont died in crash eighteen survived albeit with injuries and climbed out of wreckage after briefly settling others one of passengers cecil maclaren led four others young newlyweds robert and shannon hargreaves sharon coles and her four year old daughter tracey off in direction of a nearby village in search of water other 13 remained close to wreckage meanwhile nine guerrillas made their way towards crash site and reached it at about 17 45 three of 13 survivors remaining at crash site hid on seeing figures approaching rhodesian army reservist anthony hill 39 took cover in surrounding bush while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did same this left 10 passengers in full view near wreckage including four women and two girls aged 11 and 4 guerrillas who were armed with ak 47 rifles presented themselves to 10 passengers as friendly saying they would summon help and bring water they spoke in english both to survivors and among themselves they told passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from wreckage when survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk insurgents told able bodied men to carry others passengers were assembled into an area of about standing roughly away cadres now raised their weapons you have taken our land one of them said please don t shoot us one of passengers cried just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire those that survived initial bursts were bayoneted including a mother and her 3 week old baby having collected water from nearby village maclaren and his companions were almost back at crash site when they heard shots thinking it was personal ammunition in luggage exploding in heat they continued on their way and called out to other passengers who they thought were still alive this alerted insurgents to presence of more survivors one of guerrillas told maclaren s group to come here insurgents then opened fire on their general location prompting maclaren and others to flee hill and hansens also ran they revealed their positions to fighters in their haste but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge after hill and others had hidden there for about two hours they saw attackers return to crash site at about 19 45 guerrillas looted wrecked cabin and some of suitcases strewn around site filled their arms with passengers belongings then left again survivors were found over following days by rhodesian army and police hill and hansens were taken to kariba hospital while maclaren and his group were airlifted to andrew fleming hospital in salisbury nkomo claims responsibility but denies killing survivors nkomo claimed responsibility for attack in an interview with bbc s today radio programme next day laughing as he did so to horror of most rhodesian observers both black and white this wicked massacre shocked entire nation and world black and white united in condemnation of shooting down of flight 825 and senseless loss of innocent lives reports that zapu leader joshua nkomo had laughed about incident when interviewed on television by bbc were met with utter revulsion he said that he had received intelligence that hunyani was being used for military purposes nkomo said he regretted deaths as it was not his party s policy to kill civilians and denied that his men had killed any survivors on ground by contrast he said that his men had helped them and had left them alive he also accused air rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for government an allegation that captain pat travers air rhodesia s general manager called a downright deliberate lie according to eliakim sibanda a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of zapu nkomo was implying that responsibility for massacre lay with security force pseudo guerrillas more specifically selous scouts unit which had often been accused of rural civilians with goal of shifting public opinion sibanda asserts that massacre cannot be put beyond scouts and also supports nkomo s claim that hunyani had been used militarily suggesting that zipra might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers on board rhodesian television before attacks on zanla in mozambique had shown viscounts ferrying paratroopers for job he writes and zipra intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed at victoria falls reactions racial tensions a report published in american magazine time a fortnight later described incident as a genuine horror story calculated to make most alarming of rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true white community in rhodesia heard news with fury and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism prominent indian rhodesian gulab family was particularly affected by incident having lost eight members in attack although rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge cause of crash doing so only after four days investigation truth was common knowledge in salisbury within hours smith wrote in his memoirs that degree of anger was difficult to control white south africans were similarly enraged particularly after reports appeared in south african press that killers had raped female passengers before massacring them a friends of rhodesia society in south africa offered a reward of r100 000 to anybody who would either kill nkomo or bring him to salisbury to stand trial geoffrey who was then one of few black reporters at rhodesia herald newspaper later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general believing them all to be terrorist sympathisers describing herald newsroom night of incident he relates a vile collective temper among white sub editors they cursed until their voices became hoarse threatening dire consequences for all and or i sensed that some of more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears stress in original several racially motivated incidents occurred over following days according to time article a group of whites entered an salisbury bar fingering triggers of rifles and forced blacks drinking there to leave time also reported a rumour that two white youths on learning of massacre shot first black man they saw smith says that several would be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into bush around crash site to make local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting terrorists he instructed them not to according to his memoirs telling them that many rural blacks only assisted guerrillas under extreme duress and that it would not do to attack them many rhodesians also resented apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments especially considering character of attack and its civilian target memorial service 8 september 1978 thumb anglican cathedral of st mary and all saints in salisbury was location of memorial service on 8 september 1978 alt a small stone cathedral viewed from across street at a memorial service held on 8 september 1978 for flight 825 s passengers and crew at salisbury s anglican cathedral about 2 000 people crowded inside with another 500 standing outside on steps and pavement many listening to service inside on portable radio sets prominent among those present in cathedral were uniformed air rhodesia and south african airways personnel as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units smith and several government ministers also attended including p k van der byl co minister of foreign affairs dean john de costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a deafening silence from overseas nobody who holds sacred dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at events attending viscount he said but are we with voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised we are not like men in story of good samaritan they pass by on other side of this ill fated flight from kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come for others far from our borders it is an intellectual matter not one which affects them deeply here is tragedy smith nkomo talks halted talks between smith and zapu leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by salisbury smith himself called nkomo a monster cilliers comments that ending of smith nkomo talks at this time was potentially most serious result of viscount massacre as talks had been progressing well before incident he surmises that an agreement between two at this critical stage might have helped transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition on 10 september prime minister announced to nation that certain areas of country would be placed under a variation of martial law which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed he declared rhodesia s intent to liquidate internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for any defensive strikes we might undertake against guerrilla bases in their respective territories he claimed that war had escalated because britain and united states were supporting patriotic front william irvine co minister of transport warned guerrillas that rhodesia w ould not let these innocents go rhodesian military response operation snoopy rhodesian raid into zambia because zapu and zipra were based in zambia many rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country but first external target hit by security forces following viscount shootdown was prominent cluster of zanla bases around chimoio in mozambique rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in november 1977 during operation dingo destroying much of zanla presence there but insurgents had since built a complex called new chimoio slightly to east new camps were distributed across a far larger area than originals in a combined airborne ground assault called operation snoopy rhodesian air force rhodesian light infantry and special air service wiped out much of new chimoio on 20 september 1978 mozambique sent armour to zanla s aid in form of nine soviet made t 54 tanks and four russian btr 152 armoured personnel carriers but former were routed and one of latter destroyed by rhodesian security forces according to rhodesian figures there were several hundred guerrillas killed while security forces lost only two soldiers one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike rhodesia then attacked zipra s bases in zambia in what group captain peter petter bowyer later described as payback time for flight 825 operation gatling green leader raid operation gatling was launched on 19 october 1978 it was another joint force operation between air force and army which contributed rhodesian special air service and rhodesian light infantry paratroopers gatling primary target just north east of central lusaka was formerly white owned westlands farm which had been transformed into zipra s main headquarters and training base under name freedom camp zipra presumed that rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to lusaka about 4 000 guerrillas underwent training at freedom camp with senior zipra staff also on site rhodesian operation s other targets were chikumbi north of lusaka and mkushi camp all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across zambia assaulting targets deep inside zambia was a first for rhodesian forces previously only guerrillas near border had been attacked led by squadron leader chris dixon who identified himself to lusaka airport tower as green leader a rhodesian air force group flew into zambia at very low altitudes thereby avoiding zambian radar and took control of country s airspace for about a quarter of an hour during initial assault on westlands farm informing lusaka tower that attack was against rhodesian dissidents and not against zambia and that rhodesian hawker hunters were circling zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off zambians obeyed all of green leader s instructions made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic using airstrip in eastern zambia as a forward base rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during three day operation and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 500 zipra personnel as well as some cuban instructors historians paul moorcraft and peter mclaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably number of guerrillas killed as most of nkomo s army then numbering about 10 000 fighters had not been touched on other hand unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions and hundreds of these had been killed in rhodesian raid moorcraft and mclaughlin comment that for rhodesian airmen it would have been impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young zipra recruits sibanda describes freedom camp as a refugee camp for boys and says 351 boys and girls were killed he claims that red cross and un refugee agency confirmed zapu s claim that smith s forces struck at defenseless civilian trainees aftermath rhodesian attacks on zanla and zipra bases did much to restore morale of rhodesian people following viscount incident though they had not made much impact on respective guerrilla campaigns nkomo and zambian president kenneth kaunda all same requested further military aid and better weapons from soviets and british respectively martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia s rural areas and covered three quarters of country by end of 1978 air rhodesia meanwhile began developing shielding for its viscounts before this work was completed zipra shot down a second viscount air rhodesia flight 827 on 12 february 1979 this time there were no survivors following second shootdown air rhodesia created a system whereby underside of viscounts would be coated with paint with exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded according to tests conducted by air force a viscount so treated could not be detected by strela s targeting system once it was over there were no further viscount shootdowns in rhodesia in elections held following year under internal settlement terms boycotted by zanu and zapu muzorewa won a majority and became first prime minister of reconstituted state of zimbabwe rhodesia on 1 june 1979 this new order failed to win international acceptance however and in december 1979 lancaster house agreement was agreed in london by zimbabwe rhodesia uk government and patriotic front returning country to its former colonial status uk government suspended constitution and took direct control for an interim period fresh elections were won by mugabe who took power in april 1980 concurrently with country s recognised independence as zimbabwe legacy and memorial thumb uk labour mp kate hoey who in 2013 proposed to memorialise victims of viscount attacks alt a photograph of kate hoey in modern zimbabwe it is not viscount shootdowns but rather rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in cultural memory state media in zimbabwe prominently herald newspaper often claim that rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations zipra s downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on grounds that guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board massacre of surviving flight 825 passengers at crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than zipra in his 1984 memoirs nkomo repeated his claim that zipra fighters had helped survivors and wrote simply that i truly have no idea how ten died a monument to those killed in rhodesian attack on chikumbi was built in zambia in 1998 and dedicated jointly by zambian and zimbabwean governments a memorial to victims of two rhodesian viscount incidents dubbed viscount memorial was erected on grounds of voortrekker monument in pretoria south africa in 2012 and inaugurated on 1 september that year names of dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright side by side pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft a pole beside monument flies rhodesian flag a british parliamentary motion put forward by labour mp kate hoey in february 2013 to retrospectively condemn viscount attacks and memorialise victims on anniversary of second shootdown prompted outcry in zimbabwean press with herald branding it a racist motion intended to antagonise mugabe administration and its supporters a former zipra commander described move as a provocation motivated by race that went against spirit of amnesty enacted at lancaster house christopher a diplomat and political analyst took a similar line calling hoey s proposed commemoration a provocation that means they only regard death of white people alone during struggle there is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside country zapu s official response to hoey s motion included assertion that in all conflicts civilians get caught up in cross fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors and juxtaposed
