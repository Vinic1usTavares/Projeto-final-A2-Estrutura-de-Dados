music as soca during 1975 when his hit song endless vibrations was causing major musical waves on radio stations and at parties and clubs not just throughout his native t t but also in far off metropolitan cities like new york toronto and london soca was originally spelled which stands for soul of calypso with kah part being taken from first letter in sanskrit alphabet and representing power of movement as well as east indian rhythmic influence that helped to inspire new soca beat shorty stated in a number of interviews that idea for new soca beat started with rhythmic fusion of calypso rhythms with east indian rhythms that he used in his hit indrani recorded in 1972 soca beat was solidified as popular new beat that most of t t calypso musicians would start adopting by time shorty had recorded his big crossover hit endless vibrations in 1974 shorty also recorded a mid year album in 1975 called love in caribbean that contains a number of crossover soca tracks before setting off on an album distribution and promotion tour during his 1975 love in caribbean album promotion and distribution tour shorty pass thru isle of dominica on his way back to trinidad and saw dominica s top band exile one perform at fort young hotel shorty was inspired to compose and record a soca and cadence lypso fusion track called e pete or ou petit which can be viewed as first of its kind in that particular soca style shorty sought and got help with creole lyrics he used in chorus of his e pete song by consulting with dominica s 1969 calypso king lord tokyo and two creole lyricists chris and pat aaron while he was in dominica song e pete thus contains genuine creole lyrics in chorus like ou dee moin ou petit shorty meaning you told me you are small shorty and is a
