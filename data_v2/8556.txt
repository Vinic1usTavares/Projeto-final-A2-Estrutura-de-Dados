on austria as part of third italian war of independence which was fought concurrently with austro prussian war sondhaus p 1 italian fleet commander admiral carlo pellion di persano initially adopted a cautious course of action he was unwilling to risk battle with austrian navy despite fact that austrian fleet was much weaker than his own persano claimed he was simply waiting on ironclad ram en route from britain but his inaction weakened morale in fleet with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice greene massignani pp 217 222 rear admiral wilhelm von tegetthoff brought austrian fleet to ancona on june 27 in an attempt to draw out italians at time many of italian ships were in disarray several ships did not have their entire armament and several others had problems with their engines castelfidardo was one of few ironclads fit for action so she and formed up to prepare to attack tegetthoff s ships persano held a council of war aboard principe di carignano to determine whether he should sortie to engage tegetthoff but by that time austrians had withdrawn making decision moot minister of navy agostino depretis urged persano to act and suggested island of lissa to restore italian confidence after their defeat at battle of custoza previous month on 7 july persano left ancona and conducted a sweep into adriatic but encountered no austrian ships and returned on 13th wilson pp 216 218 battle of lissa thumb upright map showing disposition of fleets on 20 july on 16 july persano took italian fleet out of ancona bound for lissa where they arrived on 18th with them they brought troop transports carrying 3 000 soldiers italian warships began bombarding austrian forts on island with intention of landing soldiers once fortresses had been silenced in response austrian navy sent fleet under tegetthoff to attack italian ships sondhaus pp 1 2 castelfidardo was at that time assigned to 1st division commanded by admiral giovanni vacca along with ironclads and principe di carignano divisional flagship wilson p 219 after arriving off lissa on 18th persano ordered 1st division to bombard austrian fortresses protecting island but vacca informed him that his ships guns could not elevate high enough to hit high fortifications persano then sent vacca s division to vis to force harbor defenses but by time they arrived night was approaching and so he cancelled attack wilson pp 221 222 next morning persano ordered ironclad to enter harbor vis and attack madonna battery supported by castelfidardo and rest of 1st division vacca found it impossible to employ his ships in confined waters and so he left formidabile to handle battery with day s attacks again having yielded no results persano decided to make another attempt on 20th vacca would take his three ships to patrol to north east of island while rest of fleet would again try to land soldiers wilson pp 221 224 before italians could begin attack dispatch boat arrived bringing news of tegetthoff s approach persano s fleet was in disarray vacca s ships were three miles to northeast from persano s main force and three other ironclads were further away to west wilson pp 223 225 persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with vacca s first in line abreast formation and then in line ahead formation castelfidardo initially reported trouble with her engines but her crew was able to repair them before battle began wilson p 232 shortly before action began persano left his flagship and transferred to turret ship affondatore though none of his subordinates on other ships were aware of change they there thus left to fight as individuals without direction more dangerously by stopping re d italia he allowed a significant gap to open up between vacca s three ships and rest of fleet wilson pp 233 tegetthoff took his fleet through gap between vacca s and persano s ships in an attempt to split italian line and initiate a melee he failed to ram any italian vessels on first pass so he turned back toward persano s ships and took re d italia san martino and palestro under heavy fire wilson pp 234 235 vacca turned principe di carignano and castelfidardo to port taking them away from austrian ships hammering persano s division he briefly attempted to engage austrian wooden ships in rear but was driven off by heavy fire from three steam frigates greene

italia had been rammed and sunk and palestro had been set on fire soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion persano broke off engagement and though his ships still outnumbered austrians persano refused to counter attack with his badly demoralized forces italian fleet began to withdraw followed by austrians as night began to fall opposing fleets disengaged completely heading for ancona and pola respectively wilson pp 238 241 250 castelfidardo had emerged from battle relatively unscathed though captain s cabin had been set on fire by an austrian shell wilson p 245 after battle vacca replaced persano he was ordered to attack main austrian naval base at pola but war ended before operation could be carried out wilson p 251 later career thumb castelfidardo in 1880s for rest of her long career castelfidardo served in a variety of roles both in main fleet and in italy s colonial empire ordovini et al pp 343 344 after end of war government lost confidence in fleet and drastically reduced naval budget cuts were so severe that fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack port of civitavecchia in september 1870 as part of wars of italian unification instead ships were laid up and sailors conscripted to man them were sent home gardiner p 336 some time after 1866 ship was rebuilt as a central battery ship with most of her guns located in a central armored casemate two other guns were placed in bow as chase guns with a third mounted as a stern chaser around 1871 her armament was also revised to two guns in bow and eight 8 in guns four on each
