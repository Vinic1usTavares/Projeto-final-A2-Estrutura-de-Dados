began developing super mario galaxy after release of donkey kong jungle beat in late 2004 when shigeru miyamoto suggested that nintendo should commission a large scale mario game concept for use of spherical platforms originated from ideas used in super mario 128 a technology demonstration shown at nintendo space world in 2000 nintendo aimed to make game appeal to players of all ages and team had more freedom in designing it compared to other super mario games because of outer space setting soundtrack was composed by mahito yokota and koji kondo using a symphony orchestra for first time in

galaxies to collect power stars earned by completing missions defeating a boss or reaching a particular area each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for player to explore each astronomical object has its own gravitational force allowing player to completely circumnavigate planetoids walking sideways or upside down player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby although main gameplay is in 3d there are several areas in game in which player s movements are restricted to a 2 dimensional plane game s main hub is comet observatory a spaceship which contains six domes that provide access to most of game s 42 available galaxies with each dome except one holding five five domes end with a boss level in which objective is to defeat

sensor is included it is a cursor that appears when wii remote pointer is pointed at screen star pointer is used to pick up special shaped objects called star bits which can then be shot to stun enemies manipulate obstacles or feed hungry lumas star shaped sentient beings pointer can also latch onto small blue objects called pull stars which can pull mario through space in certain levels that encase player in a floating bubble star pointer is used to blow wind and maneuver bubble early in game player learns a new ability known as spin technique which has appeared in varying forms throughout super mario franchise in super mario galaxy spin is primarily used for melee attacks to stun enemies and shatter objects as well as triggering special propellers called sling stars or launch stars that launch mario across large distances through space spin utility is also used for climbing vines ice skating unscrewing bolts and for activating several power ups other wii remote functions are available for smaller quests such as surfing aboard a manta ray or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through an obstacle course power ups and lives thumb right 250px from left

health meter can temporarily expand to six units through use of a life mushroom instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter by being crushed by hazards or by falling into black holes or other bottomless pits player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1 up mushrooms 50 coins without losing a life or 50 star bits multiplayer super mario galaxy has a co operative two player option called co star mode in which one player controls mario while other uses only wii remote to control a second star pointer on screen to gather star bits and shoot them at enemies second player can also make mario jump or height of mario s jump can be increased if first and second player press a button at same time second player can prevent some enemies from moving by aiming pointer star at them and holding a button plot shortly after princess peach invites mario to centennial star festival bowser invades mushroom kingdom in a fleet of airships he removes peach s castle from its foundations using a giant flying saucer and lifts it into outer space kamek one of bowser s minions launches mario who was attempting to rescue princess peach into space and onto a small planet with his magic on planet he meets enchantress rosalina and her star shaped companions lumas rosalina is a watcher of stars who uses comet observatory to travel across universe however bowser has stolen all of power stars that act as observatory s power source rendering it immobile bestowed with power to travel through space through one of lumas mario sets off on a journey across universe to reclaim power stars and restore power to rosalina s observatory along way he finds friends from mushroom kingdom such as luigi and toads upon collecting enough power stars comet observatory flies to center of

hole collapses into a singularity and universe is recreated entirely as singularity explodes in a huge supernova rosalina appears to mario revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars when universe is recreated mario awakens in restored mushroom kingdom alongside peach and bowser and he celebrates new galaxy that has emerged in skies development thumb right yoshiaki koizumi director and designer of super mario galaxy had idea to incorporate abilities shown in a technology demonstration for nintendo space world in 2000 200px alt a picture of yoshiaki koizumi game s director and designer concept for super mario galaxys gameplay originated from ideas taken from super mario 128 a technology demonstration shown at nintendo space world in 2000 to exemplify processing power of gamecube demonstration s director and future director of super mario galaxy yoshiaki koizumi desired that one of its distinguishing features spherical based platforms should be used in a future game but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons super mario creator shigeru miyamoto suggested to work on next large scale mario game after nintendo ead tokyo finished development on donkey kong jungle beat in late 2004 pushing for spherical platform concept to be realised a prototype of game s physics system took three months to build where it was decided that game s use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment with concept of gravity as a major feature during development designers would often exchange ideas with miyamoto from his office in kyoto where he would make suggestions to game design according to koizumi many ideas were conceived before development of wii console itself begun idea for mario to have a spin attack came during early stages of development when it was decided that jumping on enemies on a spherical map would be difficult for some players at one point koizumi remarked that making characters jump in a 3d environment was absurd takeo shimizu game s producer and programmer noted that most basic action in a 3d action game was to simply run and concluded that easiest way to attack was to spin not jump prior to development team shifting focus on wii and realising potential of its different controls spin attack was originally planned to be executed by swivelling analogue stick on gamecube controller spin was initially activated via rotation of nunchuk s control stick but after motion sensing was confirmed to be implemented in wii remote spin was changed to be activated through shaking latter nintendo president satoru iwata wanted to prioritise game s fun factor by giving player a sense of achievement after they have completed a difficult task iwata noted an increasing number of consumers giving up during a video game and thus wanted super mario galaxy to appeal to that audience in response development team created a co operative mode which allowed one player to control mario whilst other controlled pointer with wii remote therefore enabling lesser experienced players to enjoy themselves in game development team wanted game to be enjoyed from ages of 5 to 95 so during early stages of development they took steps to ensure that player would adjust to game without difficulty however miyamoto thought that it was too easy and lacked insensitivity asserting that a game loses its excitement when it is made unchallenging to balance out difficulty koizumi suggested that mario s health meter should have a maximum capacity of three instead of eight but at same time more 1 up mushrooms and checkpoints would be placed in game koizumi said that he wanted to alter game s intensity factor by limiting number of hits player could take to three as opposed to super mario 64 and super mario sunshine which featured eight retrospectively iwata added that decreasing health meter to three from eight is representative of things that players do not notice that actually changes gameplay dramatically with concept of gravity and spherical platforms being central elements of gameplay development team drafted several ideas on how to implement them into game koichi hayashida a co designer of game initially expressed scepticism of incorporating a spherical playing field into a jump based platform game stating that it would be a bad match shimizu also had a negative reaction to idea with his main concern being that implementation of spherical platforms would be impossible to achieve due to technical reasons and felt a sense of danger when plan was eventually approved however once shimizu started debugging game he realised that experience felt totally fresh and thought that he was playing a game like nothing that s come before it shirai game s level designer stated that unlike hayashida and shimizu he had a positive impression of new gameplay elements shirai liked idea of being able to run on different types of planetoids and came up with designs such as planets in shape of ice cream and apples because game was in outer space team could devise ideas that would have otherwise been hard to implement in other super mario games shirai said that benefit of working with a spherical shaped world was that they could design and discover new things with kenta game s artist similarly stating that player would be continuously enjoying their adventure by travelling to new planets koizumi appreciated free and open feel of developing game saying that it enabled team to make game more fun for player throughout development staff members enjoyed level of freedom game offered in particular transforming abilities of mario iwata noted that mario s bee suit was popular with women and also stated that titular character s other suits were designed to add variations to gameplay according to hayashida idea to include transformations in game came from koizumi one of female members of staff who worked on super mario galaxy wrote a note saying i want a bee mario when asked by koizumi what they wanted to transform mario into shirai stated that development team always discussed their ideas together and devised ways to incorporate an idea into game and make it more entertaining iwata concluded that having game take place in space was advantageous as it was flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of ideas after development was finished team reflected that fundamental part of a super mario game was to make player think about how fun it was to play game itself rather than simply finishing it to accomplish this koizumi made sure that there were certain areas of game which could be enjoyed by all types of people including children shimizu added that super mario galaxys ulterior motive was to have everybody gather around tv as he felt that a game starring mario was not necessarily something which could be enjoyed by playing alone game was made to support six different save files shimizu liked idea of one player looking at progress of another player and seeing how they compared against their own iwata stated that when first super mario game was released there used to be many more people gathering around television who would enjoy watching gameplay experience iwata asserted that well made video games were more enjoyable to spectate and hoped that super mario galaxys co operative mode would tempt someone who does not usually play video games to join music during development mahito yokota who was in charge of musical direction originally wanted super mario galaxy to have a latin american style of music and even had composed 28 tracks in that style latin american percussion instruments had already been featured in previous super mario instalments such as bongo drums and congas for super mario galaxys theme yokota used latin american instruments and a synthesiser to replicate sounds featured in old science fiction films composition was approved by yoshiaki koizumi game s director and designer but when yokota presented it to game s sound supervisor koji kondo he stated that it was no good when asked why his music was rejected kondo responded if somewhere in your mind you have an image that mario is cute please get rid of it incensed by rejection yokota almost resigned from his job but kondo implied that mario s character was cool and instructed him to try again according to yokota he was under impression that mario was suited for children causing him to create cute music that would appeal to targeted audience three months later yokota presented three different styles of music to miyamoto one piece had an orchestral sound other had pop music and last featured a mix of both orchestral and pop music miyamoto chose orchestral piece as it sounded most space like yokota stated that miyamoto chose piece without knowing that kondo actually wrote it in a retrospective interview satoru iwata said that miyamoto chose music that sounded space like because he was looking for a sound that would express game in contrast to tropical sounds of super mario bros yokota revealed that he initially struggled to create music that sounded like a super mario game but as time progressed he declared that songs he made for game had become natural to create a sense of variety with soundtrack yokota and kondo wrote pieces individually kondo composed four pieces for game whereas yokota composed rest kondo composed pieces that specifically requested as he thought that game s soundtrack would end up all sounding same if it were composed by one person game originally heavily utilised wii remote speaker for all sorts of sound effects but masafumi kawamura game s sound director decided they were redundant when played in tandem with those from television kawamura decided to restrict wii remote sound effects to those triggered by mario s actions such as hitting an enemy feeling that it better immersed player game s soundtrack features 28 orchestral songs performed by a 50 person symphony orchestra yokota initially had concerns whether or not orchestral music would fit in with rhythm of a mario game but thought that such music would make scale of game seem more epic kondo on other hand believed if orchestral music were used player would be obligated to play game in time to music to synchronise soundtrack to gameplay kawamura utilised similar techniques he used to synchronise sound effects in legend of zelda wind waker and donkey kong jungle beat in which game midi data with streaming data resulting in sound effects playing at same time as background music to make synchronisation possible audio team requested orchestra to perform at different tempos set with a metronome official soundtrack was released on 24 january 2008 it was initially an exclusive to club nintendo subscribers in japan although soundtrack became available to european club nintendo members in november 2008 soundtrack was released in two versions original soundtrack which only contains 28 tracks from game and platinum edition which contains another 53 tracks on a second disc for a total of 81 tracks in north america original soundtrack was included in

famitsu commented on game s tempo believing it was abnormally good and that different variations in level design and difficulty gradually builds things up a reviewer from edge praised game s use of wii remote stating control schemes were more subtle and persuasive as opposed to vigorous literalism of legend of zelda twilight princess scullion was initially sceptical about using wii remote as a pointer but admitted that within mere minutes it felt like we d been doing this since days of mario 64 scullion also thought that game s strongest aspect was incomparable gameplay parish praised fluctuating gravity that was featured in game stating that it makes even wildest challenge feel almost second nature robinson similarly commended gravity saying that different uses of game s
