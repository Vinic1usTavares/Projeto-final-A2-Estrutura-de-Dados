shafts driven by two french license built man 6 cylinder diesel engines on surface or by two electric motors when submerged curies diesel engines generated a total of and could move submarine at up to

under tow by french armored cruiser depositing her charge from pola site of austro hungarian navy s main base jules michelet departed leaving curie to proceed to austro hungarian base curie arrived next day and began reconnoitering entrance to harbor o byrne observed entrance and exit paths of austro hungarian vessels and plotted a course through deployed defensive mines on 19 december o byrne took curie in to observe anti submarine net that ran across opening in a long defensive breakwater built to keep submarines from infiltrating naval base believing that he had accounted for all of defensive measures o byrne took curie to a depth of early on 20 december and attempting an incursion into harbor heard sounds of chains and wires dragging on submarine s hull when sounds stopped after half a minute o byrne brought curie up to periscope depth to discover that he had only penetrated outer net curies forward momentum carried her into second net where she became inextricably entangled when submarine still trapped in net was forced to surface for fresh air curie came under fire from austro hungarian destroyer and torpedo boat tb 63 t which quickly sank her three of twenty six men on board were killed in attack survivors who included curies commander o byrne were all taken prisoner salvage and austro hungarian career at beginning of first world war austro hungarian navy s u boat fleet consisted of six largely experimental submarines of three classes navy had five larger more modern submarines what would have been under construction in germany at outbreak of war but when navy became convinced that delivery of u 7 boats would be impossible they were sold to germany in november 1914 amidst austro hungarian efforts to replace now unavailable u 7 boats largely intact curie resting at a depth of became focus of salvage efforts beginning on 21 december day after curies sinking salvage crews raised submarine in stages finally bringing her to surface on 2 february 1915

february u 14 survived a depth charge attack but made it back to port with all of her externally mounted torpedoes crushed and both fuel tanks leaking when she put in for repairs u 14 was extensively modernized in a refit that kept her in port from february to november submarine was given a german style conning tower that replaced french designed wet lookout platform she was equipped with more powerful diesel engines which increased her power output from u 14s fighting potential was further enhanced by installation of larger fuel tanks which nearly quadrupled her range to up from her former maximum of on 28 april 1917 u 14 was patrolling off coast of greece when she scored her first success teakwood a 5 315 ton british tanker headed from port arthur texas to port said on 3 may on patrol

because harbor at corfu was occupied by french fleet at time u 14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying submarine s former national flag french tricolor in order to pass unmolested even though u 14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other brumaire class boat one french patrol plane was successfully fooled by ruse when u 14s crew first spotted aircraft flying towards them from direction of sun there was not enough time to submerge as aircraft drew near its french markings and its cargo of bombs became apparent to crew with no other course of action possible u 14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at plane as french pilot passed overhead he returned waves apparently unaware of u boat s true nationality only success by u 14 on this cruise was sinking of a greek steamer
