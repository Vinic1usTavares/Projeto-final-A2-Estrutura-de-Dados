a 3 1 7 rating in 18 49 demographic beating simpsons allen gregory american dad in addition to significantly edging out all three shows in total viewership episode s ratings increased slightly from previous week s episode back to pilot reviews of episode were mostly mixed kevin mcfarland of a v club wrote of episode i had a hard time listening to characters spout out opinions since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like writers just wanted a place to dump their i don t want to only call out seth macfarlane because he didn t write this episode but considering little bit i know about show s writer s room it s pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing especially given his 9 11 experience he also compared a story to television series south park noting it s very clear that south park benefits from short turnaround time between production and air because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events and stay timely family guy seems to do exact opposite waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn t satirize for comedy he ended his review by commenting after last week s bright spot i knew we were headed back down for another helping of usual misery but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all out failure just expected bland mediocrity he graded episode as a c in a much more positive review r moore of ology writing it s just funny and it s got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness and it s definitely true that show isn t always in its best form but thanksgiving shows that family guy refuses to be dead yet he also praised episode for giving each character their own part in episode adding while most of story revolves around joe kevin and peter three kids and brian also get time in as well moore also stated his enjoyment of cultural references in episode stating it s all good fun and cutaways are also top notch including peter s first holiday and cowardly lion as lindsay lohan s gynecologist i nearly fell out when peter described his probably black coworker who turned out to be a white guy which i should have seen coming because it s very family guy but still managed to get a laugh out of me he gave episode a nine out of ten references external links category 2011 american television episodes category family guy season 10
