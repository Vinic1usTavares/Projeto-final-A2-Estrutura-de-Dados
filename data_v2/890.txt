complete development crawford originally created frog fractions to entertain his friends and to see their reactions when they first played it later on he felt that with indie genre taking off frog fractions was taken more seriously among gamers crawford noted that although critics often described game as a satire on old educational games he never intentionally developed frog fractions with that in mind instead crawford explained that frog fractions had an educational theme because of name s alliteration and because he considered educational games a part of his youth originally frog fractions included tutorials to teach player how to progress through game however after crawford asked his friend tim ambrogi to play test game ambrogi stated that he did not want to read any of informational that appeared throughout game because he was too busy focusing on gameplay crawford added transitions that made game feel like a dream like progression which he believed would better appeal to players for transitions in game s latter half crawford wanted transitions to entertain players more rather than attempt to make any sense of game s story pc world complimented frog fractions for using transitions to draw connections between each scene to add a feeling of consistency despite often strange transitions that take place in order to make money from frog fractions crawford first sold game s soundtrack with part of proceeds going to game s music team he later decided to sell t shirts containing jokes from game in order to benefit its art team while developing frog fractions crawford said that he came up with a lot of other video game ideas but he then realized that he could implement them immediately into frog fractions rather than start a new project due to game s unpredictable nature release crawford released frog fractions earlier than he wanted when he sent an incomplete version to 2013 independent games festival as a main competition entrant but was told that he needed to increase game s popularity before it would be accepted subsequently he let gamasutra editor and popular twitter user brandon sheffield play game who enjoyed it so much that he shared it with his more than 3 000 twitter followers within a day tens of thousands of people had played game after game s release players began requesting new features such as more updates a high definition version for tablets and smartphones and a sequel crawford was interested in developing a high definition version in which he could include some leftover ideas but admitted that he was unsure if this would ever materialize he noted that he created frog fractions to gain visibility for himself rather than to profit from it frog fractions was described as being possibly greatest game of all time by rock paper
