japanese 3do systems making it one of few games that cannot be played on systems from other regions game was ported to sega saturn with changes to graphics controls and camera and released on 31 may 1996 exclusively in japan reception lucienne s quest garnered mixed reviews critics found story not as substantial and fulfilling compared to other rpgs commenting that it resembled a series of sidequests which characters had no compelling reason to undertake game s writing and dialogue was criticized for its and juvenile humor with a next generation critic describing it as literary equivalent of having a conversation with a hyperactive 10 year old ryan lockheart writing in gamefan felt that light hearted story lent itself positively to game s charm and was overall much more receptive of lucienne s quest he blamed poor dialogue on localization effort saying that lucienne was more arrogant and mischievous in original japanese version while english version characterizes her as absent minded and stupid regarding game s simplicity critics also considered it excessively short with most saying they were able to complete it in slightly less than ten hours lockheart explained that lucienne s quest does have a considerable amount of content and short length is due to game being balanced such that player does not need to spend any time on grinding while both lockheart and next generation found full polygonal game world moderately impressive most criticized graininess of polygons though spell animations in battle were widely complimented most reviews also deemed gameplay mechanics extremely generic with next generation venturing that a more paint by numbers rpg structure is hard to imagine a gamepro critic found game weak on every front jagged graphics and carousel music along with weak story line and unimpressive enemies really grate on you you ll be more scared when you realize that you actually paid money for this game gamefan was much more receptive of music and graphics overall calling it one of best looking and sounding rpgs in more general terms most critics said that game lacked anything to set it apart from other rpgs although it has distinguishing feature of being sole japanese role playing game on 3do jeff writing in game players summarized general sentiment i can t say i hated it either it never went far enough out on a limb in any direction to give me reason to this is first placeholder rpg i think i ve ever come across practically everything about it is dead average lockheart again writing more positively said even though lucienne s quest has many elements that make it sound like a beginner s rpg there are more than enough features that could draw even most season player in and shouldn t be overlooked by anyone owning a 3do another reviewer at gamefan called it a charming well designed visually impressive and musically stunning rpg french gaming magazine deemed saturn remake a catastrophe and said that along with playstation port of space hulk vengeance of blood angels it cast doubt on whether decent conversions of 3do games were possible critics from sega saturn magazine japan echoed reception of original 3do version they called it a simple rpg lacking a gripping story and felt it may be suitable for gamers looking for an experience akin to older japanese rpgs for personal computers legacy in retrospect lucienne s quest is considered one of best 3do games listing it among their top ten 3do games retro gamer summarized it as short light hearted and blithe but enjoyable and worthy of its praise north america version had a limited release so is now considered a rare collector s item notes external links mobygames references category 1995 video games category role playing video games category 3do
