defence scouting report gary hooper scunthorpe united guardian london 3 march 2009 while at celtic hooper struck up an excellent partnership with fellow striker anthony stokes they scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be celtic s best strike partnership although on many occasions especially for big matches georgios samaras was often used alongside hooper hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with stokes in their partnership hooper usually had a more advanced role playing off shoulder of last defender or in box and making runs in behind his strength pace finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role stokes usually played a deeper role coming short to get ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing although hooper is more suited to an advanced role and stokes to a deeper one they were capable of switching and both have skills required to play in either role this made it very hard for defenders to mark them during his time as manager at rangers ally mccoist showed his players footage of a goal hooper scored against them at celtic park he makes a run from halfway line on left hand side i watched it and i showed our players it said mccoist adding that he hooper just has a desire to run and run and just get on end of a cross you can t
