server exclusively instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state some experts officials members of congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated state department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements controversy occurred against backdrop of clinton s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by house select committee on benghazi in a joint statement released on july 15 2015 inspector general of state department and inspector general of intelligence community said their review of emails found information that was classified when sent remained so at time of their inspection and never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system they also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on private server that she set up in her house government policy reiterated in nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such after allegations were raised that some of emails in question fell into so called born classified category an fbi probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on clinton server new york times

lowest level of classification separate from those about 2 000 additional e mails were up classified to make them confidential information in those had not been classified at time e mails were sent three emails out of 30 000 were found to be marked as classified although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small c in parentheses described as portion markings by comey he also said it was possible clinton was not technically sophisticated enough to understand what three classified markings meant probe found clinton used her personal email extensively while outside united states both sending and receiving work related emails in territory of sophisticated adversaries comey acknowledged that it was possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton s personal email account he added that although we did not find clear evidence that secretary clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing handling of classified information there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information nevertheless comey asserted that no reasonable prosecutor would bring criminal charges in this case despite existence of potential violations of statutes regarding handling of classified information fbi recommended that justice department decline to prosecute on july 6 2016 u s attorney general loretta lynch who had met privately with bill clinton on june 27 confirmed that probe into clinton s use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges on october 28 2016
