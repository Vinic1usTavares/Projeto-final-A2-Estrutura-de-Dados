south china sea raid designated operation gratitude was an operation conducted by united states third fleet between 10 and 20 january 1945 during pacific war of world war ii raid was undertaken to support liberation of luzon in philippines and targeted japanese warships supply convoys and aircraft in region after attacking airfields and shipping at formosa and luzon third fleet entered south china sea during night of 9 10 january aircraft flying from its aircraft carriers attacked japanese shipping off french indochina on 12 january sinking 44 vessels fleet then sailed north and attacked formosa again on 15th of month further raids were conducted against hong kong canton and hainan next day third fleet departed south china sea on 20 january and after making further attacks on formosa and ryukyu islands returned to its base on 25 january third fleet s operations in south china sea were highly successful it destroyed a large number of japanese ships and aircraft while losing relatively few of its own aircraft historians have judged destruction of cargo vessels and oil tankers to have been most important result of raid as these losses contributed to closing a supply route which was vital to japanese war effort subsequent attacks by allied aircraft and warships forced japanese to cease sending ships into south china sea after march 1945 background thumb left 300px alt

controlled by allies and remainder was controlled by japan during 1941 and first months of 1942 japan conquered or established de facto rule over almost entire south china sea region control of sea was vital to japanese economy as it was conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied malaya borneo and dutch east indies situation in french indochina was particularly complex after a short military confrontation in september 1940 colonial government which was loyal to vichy french collaborationist regime permitted japanese to use ports and airfields in northern indochina in july 1941 japanese occupied southern indochina and established airfields as well as an important naval base at cam ranh bay french authorities remained in place as a puppet government following liberation of france in 1944 colonial government sought to make contact with new free french government in paris and began preparations to stage an uprising against japanese japanese also developed plans in 1944 to forcibly disarm french forces and formally take over indochina and their intelligence services rapidly learned of french authorities intentions as war turned against japan convoys of ships passing through south china sea frequently came under attack from allied submarines and by late 1944 aircraft these attacks were guided by information gained from signals intelligence and long range air patrols supplemented by reports from coast watchers along chinese coast and other observers in asian ports united states army air forces usaaf fourteenth air force which was stationed in china regularly attacked japanese shipping in south china sea area command also made periodic attacks on japanese held ports in southern china and military installations in indochina allied clandestine services undertook few activities in indochina until northern spring of 1945 while losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy japanese government continued to order ships to make voyage through south china sea in an attempt to limit losses convoys and individual ships took routes well way from established sea lanes or sailed close to shore and operated only at night united states began liberation of philippines on 25 october 1944 with a landing at leyte island in central philippines after a base was established at leyte american forces landed at mindoro island on 13 december this operation was conducted to secure airfields which could be used to attack japanese shipping in south china sea and support largest element of liberation of philippines a landing at lingayen gulf in north western luzon that was scheduled for 9 january 1945 imperial japanese navy ijn suffered heavy losses in its attempt to attack allied fleet during battle of leyte gulf in october 1944 which when combined with losses during battle of philippine sea in june 1944 left it unable to conduct further major battles however it remained capable of raiding allied positions during late 1944 admiral william halsey jr commander of united states third fleet sought to conduct a raid into south china sea and led development of plans for such an operation on 21 november he asked admiral chester w nimitz head of united states pacific fleet for permission to begin attack but was turned down preparations in december 1944 united states navy s high command became concerned that ijn would attempt to cut supply line to planned beachhead at lingayen gulf on 26 december a japanese naval force operating from cam ranh bay shelled allied beachhead at mindoro but inflicted no damage one of japanese destroyers involved in this operation was sunk and all of remaining ships were damaged by allied air and naval attacks before returning to cam ranh bay thumb left alt black and white photograph of six aircraft carriers and other ships moored in rows several of third fleet s aircraft carriers and other warships at ulithi in early december 1944 as further japanese raids were expected senior us navy officers believed that it was necessary to destroy ijn s remaining mobile forces which were thought to be split between cam ranh bay and inland sea in japan at this time inland sea was beyond range of usaaf s heavy bombers meaning that an attack into south china sea was only viable option for striking ijn us navy s intelligence service believed that japanese force based at cam ranh bay was built around two ise class battleships halsey and nimitz discussed proposed south china sea raid during a meeting held around christmas 1944 at us navy anchorage which had been established at ulithi atoll in caroline islands on 28 december nimitz gave halsey permission to launch attack once his fleet was no longer needed to directly support lingayen gulf landings and if major japanese fleet units were sighted in area halsey issued pre prepared plans for operation to his subordinates same day its goals were to attack japanese fleet and shipping in addition americans believed that presence of a powerful force in south china sea would discourage any further ijn operations in area while fourteenth air force was directed to attack japanese shipping and airfields at hong kong in support of invasion of luzon it was not informed of plans for third fleet to enter south china sea fourteenth air force was also not briefed on fleet s operations during south china sea raid and no attempts were made to coordinate two forces activities during this period plans for raid specified that third fleet would enter south china sea via luzon strait before proceeding south west fleet s aircraft carriers would attack japanese positions on formosa and provide support for landings at lingayen gulf on 9 january three submarines from seventh fleet were to take up station in south china sea to rescue aircrew of any american aircraft which were forced to ditch this plan would require third fleet to operate near a large number of japanese airfields from which attacks could be mounted against ships allied intelligence estimated that about 300 aircraft were usually stationed at formosa around 500 were in southern china and northern indochina a further 170 in southern indochina burma and thailand and 280 in dutch east indies while most of these were imperial japanese army air force ijaaf aircraft which were less effective against warships than ijn aircraft there was a risk that kamikaze tactics would be employed in addition weather conditions were expected to be hazardous as south china sea is frequently affected by typhoons during january thumb alt black and white photo of three warships at sea ships of third fleet en route to philippines in january 1945 as of january 1945 third fleet was built around fast carrier task force which was main us navy strike force in pacific control of this force alternated at regular intervals between third and fifth fleets commanded by halsey and admiral raymond a spruance respectively with its designation also changing from task force 38 to task force 58 as task force 38 it was commanded by vice admiral john s mccain sr in january 1945 task force 38 was organized into three fast carrier task groups and a night carrier group fast carrier groups were task group 38 1 with four aircraft carriers two battleships six cruisers and 25 destroyers task group 38 2 with four carriers three battleships five cruisers and 24 destroyers and task group 38 3 which comprised four carriers three battleships five cruisers and 17 destroyers night carrier group task group 38 5 had two carriers and six destroyers and operated with task group 38 2 during day these carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total other major element of fleet was a logistics force designated task group 30 8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships several escort carriers transporting replacement aircraft for task force 38 and a large number of escorting destroyers in addition fleet was assigned an anti submarine hunter killer force designated task group 30 7 which comprised an escort carrier and three destroyer escorts and typically operated in support of task group 30 8 despite american concerns ijn was not about to attack allied supply lines and cam ranh bay was not a major fleet base as of 1 january 1945 both ise class battleships and small number of other japanese warships in region were stationed at or near singapore and only escort vessels operated from cam ranh bay while large numbers of aircraft were located in japanese held territories bordering south china sea in january 1945 relatively few trained pilots were available to operate them at this time imperial general headquarters was considering a major offensive against supply line to lingayen gulf but on 20 january 1945 it decided to concentrate japan s defensive efforts on area around home islands and only conduct delaying actions elsewhere as a result japanese forces in south china sea region at time of raid were focused on preparing to resist future allied attacks japanese believed that us forces could potentially land in indochina once liberation of philippines was complete and were also concerned about possible attacks on area by british led south east asia command in an effort to better coordinate japanese forces in south east asia region all imperial japanese army and navy units were placed under overall control of southern expeditionary army group in january 1945 this command was led by count terauchi from his headquarters in singapore despite these preparations japanese remained unable to counter powerful attacks against shipping in south china sea while navy s convoy escort forces had been expanded during 1944 they remained inadequate most common type of escort vessel kaibokan was vulnerable to air attack as a result of their slow speed and weak anti aircraft armament ijn also assigned few fighter aircraft to protect convoys in south china sea and due to interservice rivalry which badly hindered japanese war effort rejected an offer from army to provide additional fighters for this purpose just before third fleet s attacks on french indochina attack entry into south china sea thumb 300px alt map of south china sea region marked with route taken by third fleet and locations of cities and other locations mentioned in article third fleet s approximate route between 9 and 21 january 1945 third fleet sailed from ulithi on 30 december 1944 on 3 and 4 january its aircraft carriers struck japanese airfields on formosa okinawa and nearby islands in an attempt to prevent them from being used to attack allied forces at lingayen gulf in addition its strike aircraft attacked japanese shipping at formosa sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four frigates acting on a request from general douglas macarthur commander of south west pacific area fleet struck airfields on luzon on 6 and 7 january at around this time vice admiral thomas c kinkaid commander of seventh fleet which was responsible for lingayen gulf landings asked halsey to operate west of luzon to provide air cover during initial period of invasion halsey believed it would be inappropriate for his force to operate in such a passive role and instead ordered further strikes on japanese airfields in southern formosa which posed greatest threat to kinkaid s command these took place on 9 january during morning of 9 january nimitz released third fleet from directly covering lingayen gulf area and authorized it to enter south china sea once all strike aircraft had landed that afternoon halsey issued orders to execute planned attack into south china sea during fleet s operations from 3 to 9 january it destroyed more than 150 japanese aircraft but lost 86 of its own including 46 in accidents during night of 9 10 january main body of third fleet including task group 30 7 sailed through bashi channel in northern part of luzon strait task group 30 8 was reduced to six fast tankers two escort carriers and escorting warships and reached south china sea via balintang channel off northern coast of luzon neither force was detected by japanese though night fighters operating from light aircraft carrier shot down three transport aircraft that were flying to formosa from luzon fleet also received a report that a large japanese convoy of around 100 ships was sailing along southern coast of china towards formosa during night of 9 10 january but halsey decided to not attack it as doing so would disclose that his force was in south china sea and possibly prompt ijn to withdraw its battleships from area while it was planned to refuel fleet s destroyers on 10 january this was frustrated by bad weather instead destroyers were refueled during 11 january as fleet proceeded south west once destroyers were refueled third fleet was reorganized for combat two heavy cruisers and five destroyers were transferred from task group 38 1 to task group 38 2 latter task group under command of rear admiral gerald f bogan was intended to launch air attacks against cam ranh bay from its three large fleet carriers and single light carrier on morning of 12 january task group s two battleships accompanied by destroyers and cruisers would then bombard area and finish off ships which were damaged in air attacks choice of targets was informed by intelligence passed on to allies by two networks of agents in indochina third fleet remained undetected by japanese forces on 10 and 11 january strikes on southern indochina task group 38 2 began its approach to cam ranh bay at 2 pm on 11 january it was followed by task groups 38 1 and 38 3 which launched fighter aircraft to provide a combat air patrol over fleet task group 30 8 remained in central south china sea before dawn on 12 january task group 38 5 launched aircraft to search for japanese ships in cam ranh bay area crews of these aircraft radioed back location of japanese ships and conducted an intensive search for two ise class battleships and any other capital ships when none were located it was believed that warships had been hidden from view by camouflage it took several months for us navy to learn that they had not been in area by 6 am on 12 january task group 38 2 was within of cam ranh bay it and other two task groups began launching their first strikes of day at 07 31 am about half an hour before sunrise japanese had still not detected third fleet s approach and were unprepared for an attack thumb left alt black and white aerial photo of two ships near a coastline one of ships is on fire two japanese merchant vessels under attack off coast of indochina on 12 january american airmen achieved considerable success against japanese convoys two waves of aircraft from task group 38 3 attacked a convoy of 10 ships escorted by seven warships of 101st flotilla near in central indochina and sank four fully loaded oil tankers three freighters light cruiser kashii and three small escort vessels another convoy was located and struck near cape in southern indochina resulting in loss of a tanker two destroyer escorts and a patrol boat a convoy comprising seven vessels was also attacked near cape st james in southern indochina leading to two freighters three tankers three destroyer escorts and a landing craft being sunk or forced to beach american aircraft also struck japanese shipping in saigon area two freighters and a tanker were sunk at saigon and another tanker was destroyed off coast in addition disarmed french cruiser lamotte picquet was mistakenly attacked and sunk at saigon despite still flying french flag a large number of other ships were damaged in saigon area including five freighters two tankers three landing craft two to four destroyer escorts a minesweeper and a patrol boat several of these ships were beached and destroyed by a storm later in month other third fleet aircraft were used to maintain a combat air patrol over area between in central indochina and saigon and attack airfields docks and oil storage facilities railway station at nha trang and a bridge on line between saigon and bien hoa were also damaged surface strike group which had separated from task group 38 2 at 6 40 am and comprised two battleships two heavy cruisers three light cruisers and twelve destroyers did not locate any japanese ships attacks on 12 january were highly successful a total of 46 japanese ships were sunk including 33 merchant vessels with a combined tonnage of 142 285 tons twelve of these merchants were tankers 13 warships sunk were light cruiser kashii two destroyers seven coast defense vessels one patrol boat one minelayer and a military transport while few japanese aircraft were operational american airmen shot down 15 aircraft and destroyed 20 floatplanes at cam ranh bay and another 77 aircraft at various airfields third fleet lost 23 aircraft french colonial government refused to hand over downed american airmen its forces captured to japanese military and provided them with escorts to chinese border civilians also rescued american airmen and helped them to escape as a result almost all of us navy aircrew from planes shot down over indochina eventually returned to united states via china further strikes against formosa thumb alt black and white photo of a large explosion on a body of water japanese transport ship t 14 exploding after it was attacked at takao city on 15 january at 7 31 pm on 12 january third fleet reversed course and sailed north east to meet up with task group 30 8 this course was maintained next day in order to evade a typhoon and japanese search aircraft heavy seas made fuelling difficult though all of destroyers were eventually refueled on 13 january on that day fleet admiral ernest king chief of naval operations directed third fleet to remain in a strategic position to intercept enemy forces approaching lingayen gulf area from either north or south in passing this order on to halsey nimitz authorized him to attack hong kong area if more worthwhile targets could not be located on 14 january american warships continued to refuel despite bad weather all of major warships were eventually topped up to at least 60 per cent of their fuel capacity this consumed most of task group 30 8 s supplies and it later separated from fleet to rendezvous with relief tankers near mindoro after fuelling was completed third fleet sailed north to attack formosa weather conditions continued to be bad and at 3 00 am on 15 january mccain recommended to halsey that strikes be cancelled and fleet sail south even so halsey decided to continue north and execute attack in addition he ordered aircraft to be launched during 15 january to reconnoiter amoy hainan island hong kong pescadores islands and swatow in search of ise class battleships newly designated night carrier flew off search aircraft at 4 00 am that morning strikes were launched from aircraft carriers beginning at 7 30 am on 15 january at this time third fleet was about east south east of hong kong and south west of formosa ten fighter sweeps were dispatched to formosa and a further six to airfields on coast of mainland china in addition eight raids were launched against shipping in takao and regions of formosa while large numbers of ships were located these strikes were largely frustrated by bad weather and heavy anti aircraft fire destroyer and no 1 class landing ship t 14 were sunk at takao city and a tanker was damaged and forced aground several of strikes were diverted to mako in pescadores islands where weather conditions were better and these aircraft sank destroyer tsuga a weather station and radio facilities in pratas islands were also attacked by aircraft operating from enterprise american pilots claimed to have shot down 16 japanese aircraft and destroyed another 18 on ground during day 12 us navy aircraft were lost in combat and accidents at 4 44 pm carriers changed course to reach position from which hong kong and other locations in southern china were to be attacked next day attack on hong kong and southern china british colony of hong kong had been captured by japanese forces in december 1941 and became a significant naval and logistics base usaaf units based in china attacked hong kong area from october 1942 most of these raids involved a small number of aircraft and typically targeted japanese cargo ships which had been reported by chinese guerrillas by january 1945 city was being regularly raided by usaaf thumb left alt aerial photo

at hong kong under attack on 16 january third fleet s first raids for 16 january began to be launched at 7 32 am day s operations were focused on hong kong which was struck by 138 aircraft during morning and a further 158 in afternoon raiders sunk five large tankers and an ijn oiler and damaged several other ships tankers formed part of convoy hi 87 which had been diverted from its journey south in an attempt to avoid third fleet in addition kai tak airport was badly damaged and all aircraft on ground there at time were destroyed widespread damage was also inflicted on kowloon and docks several less important targets including dockyard in aberdeen and trains on kowloon canton railway were struck by pilots who had been authorized to engage targets of opportunity village of hung hom which was located near kowloon docks was heavily bombed and hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded stanley internment camp was also hit by a bomb which killed 14 of allied civilians imprisoned there fourteenth air force s 118th tactical reconnaissance squadron conducted an attack on shipping at hong kong on 16 january which was not coordinated with us navy s raids these were largest air attacks conducted on hong kong during world war ii japanese garrison at hong kong strongly resisted raid using particularly effective anti aircraft tactics which americans had not previously encountered a us navy report described gunfire aircraft faced as having been intense to unbelievable tbf avenger torpedo bombers dispatched against hong kong suffered particularly heavy losses as their low level attack runs were vulnerable to anti aircraft fire as avengers torpedoes were set to run too deep these attacks achieved little portuguese colony of macau was also struck while portugal was neutral colony s government had been forced to accept presence of japanese advisers since 1943 and had traded weapons for food supplies raid s main target was a stockpile of aviation fuel at macau naval aviation center which allies had learned from local agents was to be sold to japanese fort of dona maria ii was also attacked possibly to destroy a radio station located within or near it and some damage was inflicted on civilian areas and city s harbor two soldiers and several civilians were killed macau s garrison had no effective anti aircraft weapons and did not fire on american aircraft writing in 2016 historian geoffrey c gunn stated that it was unclear why macau was attacked given that us government s policy was to respect macau s neutrality and gains from destroying fuel stocks were more than outweighed by likely diplomatic repercussions he judged that us naval intelligence was unaware of policy towards colony other attacks were conducted against locations in southern china during 16 january strikes were made on city of canton and two raids and two fighter sweeps were conducted against locations in hainan in addition fighter aircraft attacked airfields along chinese coast between leizhou peninsula in west to swatow in east but encountered few japanese aircraft american casualties on 16 january were 22 aircraft shot down in combat and 27 lost in accidents japanese claimed to have downed 10 aircraft over hong kong alone us navy pilots reported destroying 13 japanese aircraft at least four american airmen were taken prisoner after their planes were shot down near hong kong and a further seven evaded capture and eventually reached allied held regions of china one of american prisoners was later murdered by a lethal injection at prisoner of war camp in japan exit from south china sea after completing its strikes on 16 january third fleet turned south to refuel because weather conditions were particularly bad next day fuelling was not completed weather worsened on 18 january making fuelling operations impossible during this period japanese propaganda radio broadcasts claimed that fleet had been bottled up and would be destroyed when it tried to leave south china sea as his meteorologists expected bad weather to continue into 19 january halsey decided to depart south china sea via surigao strait in central philippines rather than sail north around luzon but when nimitz learned of this he requested that third fleet use luzon strait though halsey was given discretion to make final decision on his force s route nimitz s reasoning was that if fleet sailed through central philippines its departure would be reported by japanese forces on bypassed islands possibly leading to ijn attempting a raid against allied supply lines in addition a northerly passage would leave third fleet better placed to undertake its next assignments which included attacking formosa again and reconnoitering ryukyu islands halsey chose to follow nimitz s request his fleet completed fuelling on 19 january and proceeded north towards balintang channel task group 30 8 separated from main body however and subsequently passed through surigao strait during 20 january fleet sailed east through balintang channel with a division of destroyers patrolling well ahead of carrier task groups a large number of japanese aircraft were detected by radar during this period and 15 which were evacuating ijaaf personnel from luzon were shot down no attack was made against american force third fleet exited balintang channel at 10 pm that night aftermath thumb alt black and white photo of two aircraft carriers sailing in close formation viewed from flight deck of another aircraft carrier uss hornet left and uss independence on 26 january 1945 after departing south china sea third fleet proceeded to its next assignments it attacked airfields and harbors on formosa again on 21 january with ten merchant ships being sunk at takao but a japanese aircraft struck light aircraft carrier with two small bombs and fleet carrier was badly damaged by two kamikazes destroyer was also hit by a kamikaze but suffered little damage in addition mccain s flagship suffered considerable damage when a bomb fell from a tbf avenger which had just landed and exploded on her flight deck hancock and ticonderoga were detached from fleet and proceeded to ulithi for repairs on 22 january remaining carriers struck ryukyu islands main goal of this operation was to gain photographic coverage of okinawa to help plan an invasion of island and airfields and shipping were also attacked once this task was completed fleet turned south for ulithi in evening of 22 january and arrived there on 25 january next day halsey handed command over to spruance and it became fifth fleet south china sea raid was considered a success during its operations in south china sea between 10 and 20 january third fleet sailed without suffering heavy casualties or a serious mishap nimitz later stated that sortie into south china sea was well conceived and brilliantly executed and praised planning for fleet s logistical support he regretted that japanese capital ships had not been located and attacked in 1995 historian john prados wrote that japanese convoy losses off french indochina were most significant outcome of operation gratitude similarly mark p parillo judged in 1993 that destruction of 25 oil tankers during raid spelled doom for any long term japanese resistance japanese high command believed that raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south china in response five additional infantry divisions were assigned to defense of this area three of these divisions were released for other operations in march 1945 after american invasion of iwo jima was interpreted as evidence that hong kong canton area would be bypassed rather than attacked south china sea raid also contributed to japanese takeover of indochina commander of imperial japanese army forces in indochina lieutenant general believed that raid was precursor an allied invasion of area in reality president franklin d roosevelt had decided that us would not participate in liberation of indochina and there were no plans for such an operation as part of efforts to prepare for an allied invasion and pre empt french uprising on 26 february japanese government authorized military command in indochina to execute takeover plans once preparations were complete this occurred on 9 march with japanese forces attacking and rapidly defeating most of french garrisons japanese subsequently installed emperor bao dai to rule over puppet empire of vietnam kingdom of cambodia and kingdom of laos portuguese government lodged a protest over us navy s violation of macau s neutrality shortly after raid on 16 january and us government apologized for incident on 20 january an official court of inquiry was held and in 1950 united states provided portugal with a 20 3 million compensation payment for damage caused to macau s harbor on 16 january and other accidental raids on 11 and 25 june 1945 allied air and naval attacks against japanese shipping in south china sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional usaaf units moved into bases in philippines land based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over sea from liberated areas of philippines and dutch east indies from february while allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent escape of ise class battleships when they sailed from singapore to japan during operation kita in mid february medium bombers were sinking large numbers of japanese merchant ships by end of month medium and heavy bombers also raided japanese held ports across south china sea area
