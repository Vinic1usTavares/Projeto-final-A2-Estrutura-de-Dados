musical was later released in 1991 titled a closer walk with patsy cline show was written by dean regan and has been called a musical retelling of cline s career artistry influences cline was influenced by various music artists among her earliest influences were pop singers of 1940s and 1950s these included kay starr helen morgan patti page and kate smith patti page recollected that cline s husband said to her i just wish patsy could have met you because she just adored you and listened to you all time and wanted to be like you among her primary influences was kay starr whom according to washington post cline was a fervent devotee jack hurst of chicago tribune remarked that her rich powerful voice obviously influenced by that of pop s kay starr has continued and perhaps even grown in popularity over decades cline was also attracted to country music radio programs notably grand ole opry according to mary bufwack and robert oermann cline became obsessed with program at a young age cline s mother hilda hensley commented on her daughter s admiration i know she never wanted anything so badly as to be a star on grand ole opry among performers from program she admired was patsy montana cline was also influenced by other types of performers including early rockabilly artist arthur voice and style cline possessed a contralto voice time magazine writer richard corliss called her voice bold her voice has also been praised for its display of emotion kurt wolff called it one of most emotionally expressive voices in modern country music tony gabrielle of daily press wrote that cline had a voice of tremendous emotional power cline was at times taken by her own emotion husband charlie dick recounted that cline s producer owen bradley told him to leave a recording session because she kept crying on every song cline was once quoted in describing emotion she felt saying oh lord i sing just like i hurt inside during her early career cline recorded in styles such as gospel rockabilly and honky tonk these styles she cut for four star records have been considered below quality of her later work for decca records steve leggett of allmusic commented her recordings prior to 1960 though were something else again and with exception of 1956 s walkin after midnight and perhaps one or two other songs she seemed reined in and stifled as a singer even though she was working with same producer owen bradley who was to produce her 1960s successes oh difference a song makes because in end material she recorded between 1955 and 1960 all of which is collected on these two discs was simply too weak for cline to turn into anything resembling gold even with her obvious vocal skills cline s style has been largely associated with nashville sound a sub genre of country music that linked traditional lyrics with orchestrated pop music styles this new sound helped many of her singles to crossover onto billboard hot 100 and gain a larger audience that did not always hear country music her producer owen bradley built this sound onto her decca recordings sensing a potential in her voice that went beyond traditional country music at first she resisted pop sounding style but was ultimately convinced to record in this new style stephen m of pitchfork explained that cline has been an identifiable factor with nashville sound she essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential mark deming of allmusic commented cline and bradley didn t invent countrypolitan but precious few artists managed to meld sophistication of pop and emotional honesty of country as brilliantly as this music accomplishes with seemingly effortless grace and these songs still sound fresh and brilliantly crafted decades after fact image cline s public image changed during course of her career she began her career wearing cowgirl dresses and hats designed by her mother however as her music crossed over into pop she began wearing sequined gowns and cocktail dresses while she would often wear cowgirl costumes for live performances she would also wear evening dresses for television and metropolitan performances for her 1957 performance on arthur godfrey s talent scouts show s producer insisted that cline wear an evening dress instead of fringed cowgirl attire she had intended to wear her 1962 engagement at merri mint theatre in las vegas represented this particular image shift for one of her performances cline wore a sequined cocktail dress designed by her mother cline has also been seen as a pioneer for women in country music she has been cited as an inspiration by many performers in diverse styles of music patsy cline american masters pbs org retrieved february 23 2017 kurt wolff of country music rough guide said that cline had an aggression and boisterous attitude that gained her respect of her male counterparts wolff explained she swaggered her way past stereotypes and other forces of resistance showing men in charge and public in general that women were more than capable of singing about such hard subjects as divorce and drinking as well as love and understanding sean o hagan of guardian commented that along with minnie pearl jean shepard and kitty wells cline helped prove that country music was not macho and that strong women could have a strong voice in 2013 washington post wrote she was what i call a pre feminist woman she didn t open doors she kicked them down mary bufwack and robert k oermann wrote in 2003 that cline transformed what it
