judge becker considered stroud to be modest no longer a danger to society with a genuine love for birds given his level of notoriety crimes he committed were unremarkable especially as assaults he committed had a clear cause carl considers stroud to have been a brilliant self taught expert on birds and possibly best known example of self improvement and rehabilitation in u s prison because of stroud s contributions to field of ornithology he gained a large following of thousands of bird breeders and poultry raisers who demanded his release and for many years a committee to release robert f
