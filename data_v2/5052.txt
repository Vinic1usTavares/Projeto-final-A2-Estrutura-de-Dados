zanzibar revolution thawra occurred in 1964 and led to overthrow of sultan of zanzibar and his mainly arab government by local african revolutionaries zanzibar was an ethnically diverse state consisting of a number of islands off east coast of tanganyika which had been granted independence by britain in 1963 in a series of parliamentary elections preceding independence arab minority succeeded in retaining hold on power it had inherited from zanzibar s former existence as an overseas territory of oman frustrated by under representation in parliament despite winning 54 of vote in july 1963 election mainly african afro shirazi party asp allied itself with left wing umma party and early in morning of 12 january 1964 asp member john okello mobilised around 600 800 revolutionaries on main island of unguja zanzibar island having overrun country s police force and appropriated their weaponry insurgents proceeded to zanzibar town where they overthrew sultan and his government reprisals against arab and south asian civilians on island followed resulting death toll is disputed with estimates ranging from several hundred to 20 000 moderate asp leader abeid karume became country s new president and head of state and positions of power were granted to umma party members new government s apparent communist ties concerned western governments as zanzibar lay within british sphere of influence british government drew up a number of intervention plans however feared communist government never materialised and because british and united states citizens were successfully evacuated these plans were not put into effect meanwhile communist bloc powers of east germany and soviet union along with anti soviet people s republic of china established friendly relations with new government by recognising country and sending advisors karume succeeded in negotiating a merger of zanzibar with tanganyika to form new nation of tanzania an act judged by contemporary media to be an attempt to prevent communist subversion of zanzibar revolution ended 200 years of arab dominance in zanzibar and is commemorated on island each year with anniversary celebrations and a public holiday background zanzibar archipelago now part of southeast african republic of tanzania is a group of islands lying in indian ocean off coast of tanganyika it comprises main southern island of unguja also known as zanzibar smaller northern island of pemba and numerous surrounding islets with a long history of arab rule dating back to 1698 zanzibar was an overseas territory of oman until it achieved independence in 1858 under its own sultanate in 1890 during ali ibn sa id s reign zanzibar became a british protectorate and although never formally under direct rule was considered part of british empire by 1964 country was a constitutional monarchy ruled by sultan jamshid bin abdullah zanzibar had a population of around 230 000 africans some of whom claimed persian ancestry and were known locally as and also contained significant minorities in 50 000 arabs and 20 000 south asians who were prominent in business and trade various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and distinctions between them had blurred according to one historian an important reason for general support for sultan jamshid was his family s ethnic diversity however island s arab inhabitants as major landowners were generally wealthier than africans major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines with arabs dominating zanzibar nationalist party znp and africans afro shirazi party asp znp looked towards egypt as its model which caused some tensions with british colonial officials but zanzibar had been for centuries dominated by its arab elite and colonial office could not imagine a zanzibar ruled by blacks in january 1961 as part of process of decolonisation island s british authorities drew up constituencies and held democratic elections both asp and znp won 11 of available 22 seats in zanzibar s parliament so further elections were held in june with number of seats increased to 23 znp entered into a coalition with zanzibar and pemba people s party zppp and this time took 13 seats while asp despite receiving most votes won just 10 electoral fraud was suspected by asp and civil disorder broke out resulting in 68 deaths to maintain control coalition government banned more radical opposition parties filled civil service with its own appointees and politicised police in 1963 with number of parliamentary seats increased to 31 another election saw a repeat of 1961 votes due to layout of constituencies which were gerrymandered by znp asp led by abeid amani karume won 54 percent of popular vote but only 13 seats while znp zppp won rest and set about strengthening its hold on power umma party formed that year by disaffected radical arab socialist supporters of znp was banned and all policemen of african mainland origin were dismissed this removed a large portion of only security force on island and created an angry group of paramilitary trained men with knowledge of police buildings equipment and procedures furthermore new arab dominated government made it clear that in foreign policy sultanate of zanzibar would be seeking close links with arab world especially egypt and had no interest in forging relationships with nations on african mainland as black majority wished slavery had been abolished in zanzibar in 1897 but much of arab elite who dominated island s politics made little effort to hide their racist views of black majority as their inferiors a people fit only for slavery in parliament minister of finance juma aley responded to questions from karume by insultingly saying he need not answer questions from a mere boatman aley further explained in another speech in parliament that if arabs were over represented in cabinet it was not because of racism but rather it was only because mental abilities of blacks were so abysmally low and mental abilities of arabs like himself were so high a remark that enraged black majority memories of arab slave trading in past some of older blacks had been slaves in their youth together with a distinctly patronizing view of arab elite towards black majority in present meant that much of black population of zanzibar had a ferocious hatred of arabs viewing new arab dominated government as illegitimate government did not help broaden its appeal to black majority by drastically cutting spending in schools in areas with high concentrations of blacks government s budget with its draconian spending cuts in schools in black areas was widely seen as a sign that arab dominated government was planning to lock blacks in a permanent second class status complete independence from british rule was granted on 10 december 1963 with znp zppp coalition as governing body government requested a defence agreement from united kingdom asking for a battalion of british troops to be stationed on island for internal security duties but this was rejected as it was deemed inappropriate for british troops to be involved in maintenance of law and order so soon after independence much of cabinet which was seeking closer ties with egypt ruled by radical anti western nationalist nasser did not want british troops in zanzibar anyway british intelligence reports predicted that a civil disturbance accompanied by increasing communist activity was likely in near future and that arrival of british troops might cause situation to deteriorate further however many foreign nationals remained on island including 130 britons who were direct employees of zanzibar government in 1959 a charismatic ugandan named john okello arrived in pemba working as a bricklayer and in february 1963 moved to zanzibar working as an official in zanzibar and pemba paint workers union and as an activist in asp okello had built himself a following and almost from moment that he arrived on zanzibar had been organizing a revolution that he planned to take place shortly after independence revolution around 3 00 am on 12 january 1964 600 800 poorly armed mainly african insurgents aided by some of recently dismissed ex policemen attacked unguja s police stations both of its police armouries and radio station attackers had no arms being equipped only with spears knives machetes and tire irons having only advantage of numbers and surprise arab police replacements had received almost no training and despite responding with a mobile force were soon overcome okello himself led attack on police hq which also happened to be largest armory on island several of rebels were shot down but police were overwhelmed by sheer numbers with okello impressing his men with his courage by personally attacking a police sentry and having wrestled his rifle from him used it to bayonet policeman to death arming themselves with hundreds of captured automatic rifles submachine guns and bren guns insurgents took control of strategic buildings in capital zanzibar town at about 7 00 am okello made his first radio broadcast from a local radio station his followers had captured two hours earlier calling upon africans to rise up and overthrow imperialists at time okello only referred to himself as field marshal which prompted much speculation on zanzibar about just who was this mysterious figure leading revolution who spoke his swahili with a thick acholi accent which sounded very strange on zanzibar within six hours of outbreak of hostilities town s telegraph office and main government buildings were under revolutionary control and island s only airstrip was captured at 2 18 pm in countryside fighting had erupted between manga as rural arabs were called and africans manga were armed with their hunting rifles and once arms seized from police stations reached rebels in countryside manga were doomed in stone town fiercest resistance was at malindi police station where under command of police commissioner j m sullivan a british policeman who stayed on until a local replacement could be hired all of rebel attacks were repulsed not least because insurgents tended to retreat whenever they came under fire sullivan only surrendered station late in afternoon after running out of ammunition and marched his entire force not one policeman had been killed or wounded down to wharf to board some boats that took them out to a ship salama to take them away from zanzibar throughout stone town shops and homes owned by arabs and south asians had been looted while numerous arab and south asian women were gang raped sultan together with prime minister muhammad and members of cabinet fled island on royal yacht khalifa and sultan s palace and other property were seized by revolutionary government at least 80 people were killed and 200 injured majority of whom were arabs during 12 hours of street fighting that followed sixty one american citizens including 16 men staffing a nasa satellite tracking station sought sanctuary in english club in zanzibar town and four us journalists were detained by island s new government not knowing that okello had given orders to kill no whites americans living in stone town fled to english club where point for evacuation was those travelling in car convoy to english club were shocked to see battered bodies of arab men lying out on streets of stone town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths as part of okello s carefully laid out plans all over island gangs of africans armed with knives spears and machetes went about systemically killing all arabs and south asians they could find american diplomat don petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of african men storm house of an arab behead him in public with a followed by screams from within his house as his wife and three children were raped and killed followed by same scene being repeated at next house of an arab followed by yet another and another after taking control of stone town on first day revolutionaries continued to fight manga for control of countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed according to official zanzibari history revolution was planned and headed by asp leader abeid amani karume however at time karume was on african mainland as was leader of banned umma party abdulrahman muhammad babu asp branch secretary for pemba ugandan born ex policeman john okello had sent karume to mainland to ensure his safety okello had arrived in zanzibar from kenya in 1959 claiming to have been a field marshal for kenyan rebels during mau mau uprising although he actually had no military experience he maintained that he heard a voice commanding him as a christian to free zanzibari people from muslim arabs though zanzibaris themselves were predominantly muslim and it was okello who led revolutionaries mainly unemployed members of afro shirazi youth league on 12 january one commentator has further speculated that it was probably okello with youth league who planned revolution there appears to have been three different plots to overthrow government led by karume babu and okello of which latter was most advanced and it was he who struck blow that brought down sultan s regime lofchie michael was okello s revolution a conspiracy pages 36 42 from transition no 33 oct nov 1967 page 37 okello was not widely known in zanzibar and government was more concerned with monitoring asp and umma rather a little known and barely literate house painter and minor union official lofchie michael was okello s revolution a conspiracy pages 36 42 from transition no 33 oct nov 1967 page 38 okello was a complete mystery to world at time of revolution and mi5 reported to whitehall that he was an ex policeman who fought with mau mau in kenya and had been trained in cuba in art of revolutionary violence petterson don revolution in zanzibar an american s cold war tale new york basic books 2002 pages 74 75 okello himself at a press conference several days later angrily denied having ever been to cuba or china stating that he was a christian whose motto was everything can be learned from bible during revolution there was an orgy of violence committed against south asian and arab communities with thousands of women being raped by okello s followers much looting and massacres of arabs all over island american diplomat don petterson described killings of arabs by african majority as an act of genocide petterson wrote genocide was not a term that in vogue then as it came to be later but it is fair to say that in parts of zanzibar killing of arabs was genocide pure and simple okello frequently went on radio to urge his followers in thunderous old testament language to kill as many arabs as possible with maximum of brutality as a pan african nationalist who made his followers sing god bless africa whenever he marched through streets okello appealed to black majority but at same time as a militant christian who claimed to hear voice of god in his head okello s appeal on an island whose population was 95 muslim was limited aftermath thumb right bodies of arabs killed in post revolution violence as photographed by africa addio film crew thumb paper shows photos of ex government officials defaced after revolution a revolutionary council was established by asp and umma parties to act as an interim government with karume heading council as president and babu serving as minister of external affairs country was renamed people s republic of zanzibar and pemba new government s first acts were to permanently banish sultan and to ban znp and zppp seeking to distance himself from volatile okello karume quietly sidelined him from political scene although he was allowed to retain his self bestowed title of field marshal however okello s revolutionaries soon began reprisals against arab and asian population of unguja carrying out beatings rapes murders and attacks on property he claimed in radio speeches to have killed or imprisoned tens of thousands of his enemies and stooges but actual estimates of number of deaths vary greatly from hundreds to 20 000 some western newspapers give figures of 2 000 4 000 higher numbers may be inflated by okello s own broadcasts and exaggerated reports in some western and arab news media killing of arab prisoners and their burial in mass graves was documented by an italian film crew filming from a helicopter for africa addio and this sequence of film comprises only known visual document of killings many arabs fled to safety in oman although by okello s order no europeans were harmed post revolution violence did not spread to pemba by 3 february zanzibar was finally returning to normality and karume had been widely accepted by people as their president a police presence was back on streets looted shops were re opening and unlicensed arms were being surrendered by civilian populace revolutionary government announced that its political prisoners numbering 500 would be tried by special courts okello formed freedom military force fmf a paramilitary unit made up of his own supporters which patrolled streets and looted arab property behaviour of okello s supporters his violent rhetoric ugandan accent and christian beliefs were alienating many in largely moderate zanzibari and muslim asp and by march many members of his fmf had been disarmed by karume s supporters and umma party militia on 11 march okello was officially stripped of his rank of field marshal and was denied entry when trying to return to zanzibar from a trip to mainland he was deported to tanganyika and then to kenya before returning destitute to his native uganda in april government formed people s liberation army pla and completed disarmament of okello s remaining fmf militia on 26 april karume announced that a union had been negotiated with tanganyika to form new country of tanzania merger was seen by contemporary media as a means of preventing communist subversion of zanzibar at least one historian states that it may have been an attempt by karume a moderate socialist to limit influence of radically left wing umma party babu had become close to chinese diplomats who had arranged for several shipments of arms to be sent to zanzibar to allow umma party to have a paramilitary wing both karume and president nyerere of tanganyika were concerned that zanzibar was starting to become a hot spot of cold war tensions as american and british diplomats competed for influence with soviet chinese and east german diplomats and having a union with non aligned tanganyika was considered best way of removing zanzibar from world spotlight however many of umma party s socialist policies on health education and social welfare were adopted by government foreign reaction british military forces in kenya were made aware of revolution at 4 45 am on 12 january and following a request from sultan were put on 15 minutes standby to conduct an assault on zanzibar s airfield however british high commissioner in zanzibar timothy crosthwait reported no instances of british nationals being attacked and advised against intervention as a result british troops in kenya were reduced to four hours standby later that evening crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of british citizens as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt country s economy and government within hours of revolution american ambassador had authorised withdrawal of us citizens on island and a us navy destroyer uss manley arrived on 13 january manley docked at zanzibar town harbour but us had not sought revolutionary council s permission for evacuation and ship was met by a group of armed men permission was eventually granted on 15 january but british considered this confrontation to be cause of much subsequent ill will against western powers in zanzibar western intelligence agencies believed that revolution had been organised by communists supplied with weapons by warsaw pact countries this suspicion was strengthened by appointment of babu as minister for external affairs and abdullah kassim hanga as prime minister both known leftists with possible communist ties britain believed that these two were close associates of oscar foreign affairs minister of tanganyika and that former members of tanganyika rifles had been made available to assist with revolution some members of umma party wore cuban military fatigues and beards in style of fidel castro which was taken as an indication of cuban support for revolution however this practice was started by those members who had staffed a znp branch office in cuba and it became a common means of dress amongst opposition party members in months leading up to revolution new zanzibar government s recognition of german democratic republic first african government to do so and of north korea was further evidence to western powers that zanzibar was aligning itself closely with communist bloc just six days after revolution new york times stated that zanzibar was on verge of becoming cuba of africa but on 26 january denied that there was active communist involvement zanzibar continued to receive support from communist countries and by february was known to be receiving advisers from soviet union gdr and china cuba also lent its support with che guevara stating on 15 august that zanzibar is our friend and we gave them our small bit of assistance our fraternal assistance our revolutionary assistance at moment when it was necessary but denying there were cuban troops present during revolution at same time western influence was diminishing and by july 1964 just one briton a dentist remained in employ of zanzibari government it has been alleged that israeli spymaster david kimche was a backer of revolution with kimche in zanzibar on day of revolution p 161 pateman roy residual uncertainty trying to avoid intelligence and policy mistakes in modern world 2003 university press of kentucky deposed sultan made an unsuccessful appeal to kenya and tanganyika for military assistance although tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary police officers to zanzibar to contain rioting other than tanganyika rifles formerly colonial king s african rifles police were only armed force in tanganyika and on 20 january police absence led entire rifles regiment to mutiny dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with slow progress of replacement of their british officers with africans soldiers mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both uganda and kenya however order on african mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by british army and royal marines possible emergence of an african communist state remained a source of disquiet in west in february british defence and overseas policy committee said that while british commercial interests in zanzibar were minute and revolution by itself was not important possibility of intervention must be maintained committee was concerned that zanzibar could become a centre for promotion of communism in africa much like cuba had in americas britain most of commonwealth and usa withheld recognition of new regime until 23 february by which time it had already been recognised by much of communist bloc in crosthwait s opinion this contributed to zanzibar aligning itself with soviet union crosthwait and his staff were expelled from country on 20 february and were only allowed to return once recognition had been agreed british military response thumb right rfa hebe following evacuation of its citizens on 13 january us government stated that it recognised that zanzibar lay within britain s sphere of influence and would not intervene us did however urge that britain cooperate with other southeast african countries to restore order first british military vessel on scene was survey ship hms owen which was diverted from kenyan coast and arrived on evening of 12 january owen was joined on 15 january by frigate rhyl and royal fleet auxiliary ship hebe while lightly armed owen had been able to provide revolutionaries with an unobtrusive reminder of britain s military power hebe and rhyl were different matters due to inaccurate reports that situation in zanzibar was deteriorating rhyl was carrying a company of troops of first battalion of staffordshire regiment from kenya embarkation of which was widely reported in kenyan media and would hinder british negotiations with zanzibar hebe had just finished removing stores from naval depot at mombasa and was loaded with weapons and explosives although revolutionary council was unaware of nature of hebe s cargo royal navy s refusal to allow a search of ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated that she was an amphibious assault ship thumb left hms centaur a partial evacuation of british citizens was completed by 17 january when army riots in southeast africa prompted rhyl s diversion to tanganyika so troops she was carrying could assist in quelling mutiny in replacement a company of gordon highlanders was loaded aboard owen so an intervention could still be made if necessary aircraft carriers centaur and victorious were also transferred to region as part of operation parthenon although never enacted parthenon was intended as a precaution should okello or umma party radicals attempt to seize power from more moderate asp in addition to two carriers plan involved three destroyers owen 13 helicopters 21 transport and reconnaissance aircraft second battalion of scots guards 45 commando of royal marines and one company of second battalion of parachute regiment island of unguja and its airport were to be seized by parachute and helicopter assault followed up by occupation of pemba parthenon would have been largest british airborne and amphibious operation since suez crisis following revelation that revolutionaries may have received communist bloc training operation parthenon was replaced by operation boris this called for a parachute assault on unguja from kenya but was later abandoned due to poor security in kenya and kenyan government s opposition to use of its airfields instead operation finery was drawn up which would involve a helicopter assault by royal marines from hms bulwark a commando carrier then stationed in middle east as bulwark was outside region finery s launch would require 14 days notice so in event that a more immediate response was necessary suitable forces were placed on 24 hours notice to launch a smaller scale operation to protect british citizens with merger of tanganyika and zanzibar on 23 april there were concerns that umma party would stage a coup operation shed was designed to provide for intervention should this happen shed would have required a battalion of troops with scout cars to be airlifted to island to seize airfield and protect karume s government however danger of a revolt over unification soon passed and on 29 april troops earmarked for shed were reduced to 24 hours notice operation finery was cancelled same day concern over a possible coup remained though and around 23 september shed was replaced with plan giralda involving use of british troops from aden and far east to be enacted if umma party attempted to overthrow president julius nyerere of tanzania an infantry battalion tactical headquarters unit and elements of royal marines would have been shipped to zanzibar to launch an amphibious assault supported by follow on troops from british bases in kenya or aden to maintain law and order giralda was scrapped in december ending british plans for military intervention in country legacy thumb president amani abeid karume participating in a military parade to mark 40th anniversary of revolution thumb right a kanga celebrating ten years since revolution mapinduzi with references to asp and tanu museum of house of wonders stone town one of main results of revolution in zanzibar was to break power of arab asian ruling class who had held it for around 200 years despite merger with tanganyika zanzibar retained a revolutionary council and house of representatives which was until 1992 run on a one party system and has power over domestic matters domestic government is led by president of zanzibar karume being first holder of this office this government used success of revolution to implement reforms across island many of these involved removal of power from arabs zanzibar civil service for example became an almost entirely african organisation and land was redistributed from arabs to africans revolutionary government also instituted social reforms such as free healthcare and opening up education system to african students who had occupied only 12 of secondary school places before revolution government sought help from soviet union german democratic republic gdr and people s republic of china for funding for several projects and military advice failure of several gdr led projects including new zanzibar project a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all zanzibaris led to zanzibar focusing on chinese aid post revolution zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices new tanzanian government being powerless to intervene dissatisfaction with government came to a head with assassination of karume on 7 april 1972 which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti government forces a multi party system was eventually established in 1992 but zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote rigging though 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement revolution itself remains an event of interest for zanzibaris and academics historians have analysed revolution as having a racial and a social basis with some stating that african revolutionaries represent proletariat rebelling against ruling and trading classes represented by arabs and south asians others discount this theory and present it as a racial revolution that was exacerbated by economic disparity between races within zanzibar revolution is a key cultural event marked by release of 545 prisoners on its tenth anniversary and by a military parade on its 40th zanzibar revolution
