paul palaiologos tagaris after 1394 was a byzantine greek monk and impostor a scion of tagaris family paul also claimed a somewhat dubious connection with palaiologos dynasty that ruled byzantine empire at time he fled his marriage as a teenager and became a monk but soon his fraudulent practices embroiled him in scandal fleeing constantinople he traveled widely from palestine to persia and georgia and eventually via ukraine and hungary to italy latin greece cyprus and france during his long and tumultuous career paul was appointed an orthodox bishop sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices pretended to be orthodox patriarch of jerusalem switched from greek orthodoxy to roman catholicism and back again supported both see of rome and avignon anti popes in western schism and managed to be named latin patriarch of constantinople in end his deceptions unmasked he returned to constantinople where he repented and confessed his sins before a synod in 1394 early life and family main source on paul s life is document of his confession before patriarchal synod in constantinople which is undated but included among documents of years 1394 1395 it was published in modern times by franz ritter von miklosich and joseph muller eds acta et graeca medii aevi sacra et vol ii acta patriarchatus vienna 1860 confession is complemented by an account of his visit to paris in 1390 written by a monk of abbey of saint denis and included in anonymous chronique du religieux de saint denys contenant le regne de charles vi de 1380 a 1422 paul tagaris was apparently a scion of tagaris family a lineage which first appears in early 14th century his father is unnamed but is described by paul as a valiant and famous soldier so that he is possibly identifiable either with megas stratopedarches manuel tagaris or with latter s son george tagaris paul tagaris claimed to be related to ruling imperial dynasty of palaiologoi and adopted surname for himself manuel tagaris was indeed married to theodora palaiologina daughter of ivan asen iii of bulgaria and niece of emperor andronikos ii palaiologos but even if paul was manuel s son theodora was according to byzantinist donald nicol almost certainly not mother of paul according to nicol tagaris was probably born in 1320s while other modern sources like oxford dictionary of byzantium and lexikon der put it later around year 1340 his parents arranged his marriage at age of 14 or 15 but soon he abandoned his wife and left constantinople to become a monk in palestine after a while he returned to constantinople where he quickly became embroiled in scandal he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties and made money out of gullible believers this affair scandalized his family but patriarch kallistos i declined to take action against him it was not until patriarch went on a visit to serbia in july 1363 that his locum tenens confiscated icon and forced paul to return to palestine career in east in palestine paul was able to secure his ordination as a deacon by patriarch of jerusalem lazaros who took him under his protection ca 1364 shortly after lazaros left for constantinople and his locum tenens brought charges against paul who was forced to abandon jerusalem for antioch in antioch paul once again managed to befriend an influential figure newly elected 1368 patriarch michael who not only ordained him a priest but eventually made him patriarchal exarch and administrator of patriarchate s affairs it was not long before paul began abusing his authority he sacked serving bishops and put their sees up for sale threatening to report those who complained to turkish authorities soon he claimed title of patriarch of jerusalem for himself and began to ordain bishops even in territories subject to patriarchate of constantinople in 1370 he went to iconium and then to persia and georgia where according to his own recollection he adjudicated a dispute among three rival claimants of throne finding in favour of highest bidder no such dispute is recorded in georgian sources at this time at this point again according to his own account he felt remorse and considered returning to constantinople where he would give fortune he had amassed to poor but he was forestalled by bishop of tyre and sidon metropolitan of tyre in 1351 1376 and rival patriarch of antioch in 1366 1376 who found him and delivered an offer by patriarch of antioch to name him bishop of an unidentified location suggested as being either in taurus mountains or in peninsula i e crimea paul accepted and was apparently consecrated by bishop of tyre and sidon at same time patriarch of constantinople i heard about his dealings in east and at trebizond paul was met by a messenger from patriarch who demanded his immediate return to constantinople to stand trial latin patriarch of constantinople thumb pope urban vi modern painting basilica of saint paul outside walls rome reluctant to face patriarch s wrath paul once more decided to flee and try his luck in rome as nicol points out such a move would be highly unusual for an orthodox priest but may be explained by his family s links with pro catholic circles in byzantine capital george tagaris his putative brother or father was among those who supported union of churches and had received letters of encouragement from pope innocent vi to avoid passing near constantinople paul was forced to make a broad detour he took a ship probably from trebizond to crimea where he presented local governor of golden horde with jewels from treasure he had amassed in exchange he received an escort through horde lands modern ukraine to kingdom of hungary and thence to rome there he secured an audience with pope urban vi claiming to be orthodox patriarch of jerusalem paul presented himself to pope as a penitent offered a confession and embraced catholic faith impressed by paul s humble demeanour pope named him in late 1379 or early 1380 to titular post of latin patriarch of constantinople which had been vacant since september 1378 when its incumbent giacomo da had declared his allegiance to avignon anti pope clement vii urban also named paul apostolic legate for all countries east of durazzo after his appointment as a second pope as he called it paul abandoned his simple monastic habit and adopted magnificent vestments to suit his new rank wore ostentatious jewellery and according to chronicler of saint denis went about on horseback surrounded by a magnificently outfitted entourage a likely example of paul s splendid vestments and accoutrements at this time is a richly embroidered altar cloth featuring a byzantine double headed eagle with a monogram on its breast and legend paul patriarch of constantinople and new rome in greek now in collection of metropolitan museum of art in new york city since constantinople had been recovered by byzantines in 1261 seat of latin patriarch of constantinople had been since 1314 at negroponte which still remained in latin hands soon after his investment paul stopped in ancona on his way to greece he remained in city for several weeks feted by locals and presented them with purported relics on 4 march 1380 head of james just followed on 17 april by foot of saint anne and a nail from true cross as nicol comments one may be tempted to question authenticity and still more provenance of his donation documents of grant preserved in cathedral of ancona are signed by paul and a certain alexios palaiologos despot allegedly a son of byzantine emperor but in reality according to nicol probably another figment of paul s fertile imagination from 1380 until 1384 paul remained at his see in negroponte a relative of his george tagaris probably a different person than manuel tagaris son was called in to help with administration of patriarchal domains his tenure was troubled as local orthodox clergy appealed to venetian authorities for protection against his exactions while latin archbishop of athens antonio ballester complained of patriarch s interference in his diocese furthermore his lease of some of church lands in 1383 to a venetian from crete giacomo grimani proved a source of protracted legal trouble since grimani in words of french medievalist raymond joseph loenertz revealed himself as much a scoundrel as patriarch in 1384 paul was once again denounced as an impostor to pope possibly by ballester who was named vicar general of patriarchate in same year and who had held same office during 1378 1379 vacancy paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation and resumed his wanderings in 1385 he was in cyprus where he crowned james of lusignan as king of cyprus in exchange for 30 000 gold coins and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on island as if he were still patriarch thumb left avignon anti pope clement vii modern painting by calixte in 1388 he returned to rome possibly hoping that accusations against him had been forgotten in meanwhile he was arrested tried and imprisoned but was released after urban vi s death in october 1389 and general amnesty granted by new pope boniface ix leaving rome paul went to court of amadeus vii of savoy there he presented himself as a distant relative to count a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to palaiologoi who in turn were remotely linked to house of savoy via empress anna of savoy amadeus vii s great aunt and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for avignon papacy paul s claims of kinship were dubious but amadeus was moved by plight of a fellow avignon supporter and accepted him as legitimate latin patriarch of constantinople he provided paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants and sent him on to papal court of avignon paul received a magnificent welcome at avignon where he was feted by clement vii and his cardinals clement moved by his guest s tales of suffering at hands of roman popes loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to paris there king charles vi of france likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest paul was an exotic and popular sight in french capital and was lavishly hosted and entertained he obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered according to nicol for further safety he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ on his visit to abbey of saint denis he claimed that there were several relics of abbey s patron saint commonly confused with athenian saint dionysius areopagite at time to be found back in greece and promised to help monks bring them to france his proposal was enthusiastically taken up and two monks received permission and funds from king to accompany paul back to greece when party arrived in port in italy from which they would sail for greece however paul bribed captain of ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure in same night he and his servants set sail with their entire baggage leaving two monks behind it was only in rome where monks went in search of answers for paul s behaviour that they learned true identity of their travelling companion from them chronicler of abbey later received his information return to constantinople according to nicol achievement of accomplished sinner paul was without parallel no one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides first in schism between greek and latin churches and then in schism between pope in rome and pope in avignon it is no mean feat to arrive in rome as orthodox patriarch of jerusalem and then to be received in avignon as catholic patriarch of constantinople now though having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts paul was left with no option other than to return to constantinople in 1394 he was back in byzantine capital where he appeared before patriarch antony iv before whom he confessed his sins abjured his conversion to catholicism and pleaded for mercy as nicol writes only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused for despite rumours and tales contrived against him he had never indulged in fornication miracle mongering or practice of magic patriarch passed paul s case on to full patriarchal synod before which paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice and then once more before an assembly of people records of these sessions kept by patriarchal scribe are main source on paul s life final portion of manuscript containing verdict is missing but both synod and people had recommended a pardon so it is likely that he was forgiven his subsequent life is unknown references sources category 14th century births category year
