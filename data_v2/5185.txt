t4 t4 was a seagoing torpedo boat that was operated by royal yugoslav navy between 1921 and 1932 originally built as 79 t a 250t class torpedo boat built for austro hungarian navy in 1913 1914 she was armed with two guns and four torpedo tubes and could carry 10 12 naval mines she saw active service during world war i performing convoy patrol escort and minesweeping tasks anti submarine operations and shore bombardment missions following austria hungary s defeat 79 t was allocated to navy of kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes which became royal yugoslav navy and was renamed t4 at time she and seven other 250t class boats were only modern sea going vessels of fledgling maritime force during interwar period t4 and rest of navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets in 1932 she ran aground on dalmatian coast and became a total loss background in 1910 austria hungary naval technical committee initiated design and development of a coastal torpedo boat specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours this specification was based an expectation that strait of otranto where adriatic sea meets ionian sea would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict in such circumstances there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from austro hungarian navy base at bay of kotor bocche di cattaro to strait during darkness locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning steam turbine power was selected for propulsion as diesels with necessary power were not available and austro hungarian navy did not have practical experience to run turbo electric boats stabilimento tecnico triestino stt of triest was selected for contract to build eight vessels ahead of one other tenderer t group designation signified that they were built at triest description and construction 250t class t group boats had a waterline length of a beam of and a normal draught of while their designed displacement was they displaced about fully loaded crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men boats were powered by two parsons steam turbines driving two propellers using steam generated by two yarrow water tube boilers one of which burned fuel oil and other coal turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and designed to propel boats to a top speed of they carried of coal and of fuel oil which gave them a range of at t group had one funnel rather than two funnels of later groups of class despite specifications of contract being very close to requirements for coastal torpedo boat stt boats were classified as seagoing 250t class t group were first small austro hungarian navy boats to use turbines and this contributed to ongoing problems with them boats were originally to be armed with three skoda l 30 guns and three torpedo tubes but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before first boat was completed in order to standardise armament with following f group they could also carry 10 12 naval mines sixth of its class to be completed 79 t was laid down on 1 december 1913 launched on 30 april 1914 and completed on 30 september 1914 in 1914 one machine gun was added career world war i during world war i 79 t was used for convoy patrol escort and minesweeping tasks anti submarine operations and shore bombardment missions due to inadequate funding 79 t and rest of 250t class were essentially coastal vessels despite original intention that they would be used for high seas operations on 24 may 1915 79 t and seven other 250t class boats participated in bombardment of ancona which involved shelling of various italian shore based targets with 79 t involved in shelling of porto corsini near ravenna during that action an italian shore battery returned fire hitting light cruiser and damaging one of other 250t class boats in late november 1915 austro hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at pola to cattaro in southern adriatic this force included six of eight t group torpedo boats so it is possible that one of these was 79 t this force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from italy on night of 31 may 1 june 1916 s and accompanied by 79 t and two other 250t class boats raided otranto barrage an allied naval blockade of strait of otranto orjen sank one drifter but once alarm had been raised austro hungarian force withdrew in 1917 one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an anti aircraft mount on 28 november a number of 250t class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions in first mission 79 t and two other 250t class boats supported bombardment of senigallia by three destroyers before they were joined by five more 250t class boats and another three destroyers for bombardment of porto corsini marotta and cesenatico on 10 june 1918 79 t and another five 250t class boats were part of escort force that failed to protect austro hungarian dreadnought from italian mas boats that sank her interwar period 79 t survived war intact in 1920 under terms of previous year s treaty of saint germain en laye by which rump austria officially ended world war i she was allocated to kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes kscs later yugoslavia along with three other 250t class t group boats 76 t 77 t and 78 t and four 250t class f group boats she served with royal yugoslav navy kjrm jugoslovenska ratna taken over in march 1921 in kjrm service 79 t was renamed t4 at outset she and other seven 250t class boats were only modern sea going vessels in kjrm in 1925 exercises were conducted off dalmatian coast involving majority of navy in may and june 1929 six of eight 250t class torpedo boats accompanied light cruiser dalmacija submarine tender hvar and submarines and on a cruise to malta greek island of corfu in ionian sea and bizerte in french protectorate of tunisia it is not clear if t4 was one of torpedo boats involved ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting malta in 1932 british naval attache reported that yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets in same year t4 ran aground on dalmatian coast and became a total loss see also list of ships of royal yugoslav navy notes footnotes references category torpedo boats of austro
