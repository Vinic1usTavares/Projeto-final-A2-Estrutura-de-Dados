production inspiration for nemo sprang from multiple experiences going back to director andrew stanton s childhood when he loved going to dentist to see fish tank assuming that fish were from ocean and wanted to go home finding nemo 2004 dvd commentary in 1992 shortly after his son was born he and his family took a trip to six flags discovery kingdom which was called marine world at time there after seeing shark tube and various exhibits he felt that underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation pixar story by leslie iwerks 2007 documentary later in 1997 he took his son for a walk in park but realized that he was him and lost an opportunity to have a father son experience that day in an interview with national geographic magazine stanton said that idea for characters of marlin and nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone in addition clownfish are colourful but do not tend to come out of an anemone often for a character who has to go on a dangerous journey stanton felt a clownfish was perfect type of fish for character pre production of film began in early 1997 stanton began writing screenplay during post production of a bug s life as a result finding nemo began production with a complete screenplay something that co director lee unkrich called very unusual for an animated film artists took scuba diving lessons to study coral reef stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how coral died but realized that by end of film there would be nothing to reveal deciding to show how she died at beginning of movie character of gill also was different from character seen in final film in a scene that was eventually deleted gill tells nemo that he s from a place called bad luck bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress young clownfish only for latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children s storybook that shares exactly same details thumb upright andrew stanton wrote and directed film casting of albert brooks in stanton s opinion saved film brooks liked idea of marlin being this clownfish who isn t funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes idea for initiation sequence came from a story conference between andrew stanton and bob peterson while they were driving to record actors although he originally envisioned character of dory as male stanton was inspired to cast ellen degeneres when he watched an episode of ellen in which he saw her change subject five times before finishing one sentence pelican character named gerald who in final film ends up swallowing and choking on marlin and dory was originally a friend of nigel they were going to play against each other with nigel being neat and fastidious and gerald being scruffy and sloppy filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow pace of picture so gerald s character was minimized stanton himself provided voice of crush sea turtle he originally did voice for film s story reel and assumed they would find an actor later when stanton s performance became popular in test screenings he decided to keep his performance in film he recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in unkrich s office crush s son squirt was voiced by nicholas bird young son of fellow pixar director brad bird according to stanton elder bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around pixar studios one day stanton felt voice was this generation s thumper and immediately cast nicholas megan mullally was originally going to provide a voice in film according to mullally producers were dissatisfied to learn that voice of her character karen walker on television show will grace was not her natural speaking voice producers hired her anyway and then strongly encouraged her to use her karen walker voice for role when mullally refused she was dismissed to ensure that movements of fish in film were believable animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography they visited aquariums went diving in hawaii and received in house lectures from an ichthyologist as a result pixar s animator for dory gini cruz santos
