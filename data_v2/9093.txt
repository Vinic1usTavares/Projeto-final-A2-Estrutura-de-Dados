macomb daily she spoke of covering bruna s song and altering lyrics it didn t have a chorus when we started working on it it had a shorter verse and it was a ballad so i decided if i could make klas ahlund turn it into a more uptempo and bring bpm up it could work so we started there and he kept writing song while we were recording and it came out great robyn felt that she could be seductive and
