scientific detective monthly also known as amazing detective tales and amazing detective stories was a pulp magazine that published fifteen issues beginning in january 1930 it was launched by hugo gernsback as part of his second venture into science fiction magazine publishing and was intended to focus on detective and mystery stories with a scientific element many of stories involved contemporary science without any imaginative elements for example a story in first issue turned on use of a bolometer to detect a black girl blushing but there were also one or two science fiction stories in every issue title was changed to amazing detective tales with june 1930 issue perhaps to avoid word scientific which may have given readers impression of a sort of scientific periodical in gernsback s words rather than a magazine intended to entertain at same time editor hector grey was replaced by david lasser who was already editing gernsback s other science fiction magazines title change apparently did not make magazine a success and gernsback closed it down with october issue he sold title to publisher wallace bamber who produced at least five more issues in 1931 under title amazing detective stories publication history thumb left cover of august 1930 issue under new title amazing detective tales signed by earle k bergey by end of 19th century stories that were centered on scientific inventions and set in future in tradition of jules verne were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines ashley 2000 pp 6 27 first science fiction sf magazine amazing stories was launched in 1926 by hugo gernsback at height of pulp magazine era clareson 1985 p xxiii it was successful and helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre but in february 1929 gernsback lost control of publisher when it went bankrupt ashley 2000 pp 58 59 bleiler 1998 p 548 by april he had formed a new company gernsback publications incorporated and created two subsidiaries techni craft publishing corporation and stellar publishing corporation in middle of year he launched three new magazines a non sf magazine titled radio craft and two sf pulps titled science wonder stories and air wonder stories bleiler 1998 p 579 these were followed in september 1929 by first issue of science wonder quarterly and in october gernsback sent a letter to some of writers he had already bought material from letting them know that he was seeing more demand for detective or criminal mystery stories with a good scientific background he named arthur b reeve s craig kennedy stories as an example and also mentioned s s van dine s philo vance stories which were very popular at time ashley 2004 pp 158 159 in january 1930 issue of both sf magazines gernsback advertised new magazine that he hoped to populate with these stories scientific detective monthly gernsback believed that science fiction was educational claiming for example that teachers encourage reading of this fiction because they know that it gives pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation bleiler 1998 p 542 he intended scientific detective monthly to be a detective magazine in which stories had a scientific background it would entertain but also instruct subgenre of scientific detective fiction was not new it had first become popular in u s between 1909 and 1919 and appearance of gernsback s magazine was part of a resurgence of popularity in subgenre at end of 1920s first issue was dated january 1930 meaning it would have been on newsstands in mid december 1929 gernsback was editor in chief and had final say on choice of stories but editorial work was done by his deputy hector grey in february 1930 an article by gernsback appeared in writers digest titled how to write science stories in it gernsback offered advice on how to write stories for his new magazine claiming that scientific detective stories represented future of genre and that ordinary gangster and detective story will be relegated into background in a very few years science fiction historian gary westfahl comments that article also serves as a guide to writing science fiction in general and that article is first how to article published for new genre of science fiction with june issue title was changed to amazing detective tales gernsback merged science wonder stories and air wonder stories into wonder stories at same time he was concerned that word science was putting off some potential readers who assumed that magazine was in his words a sort of scientific periodical ashley 2000 p 71 it is likely that same reasoning motivated scientific detective monthlys new title in following issue grey was replaced as editor by david lasser who was already editing gernsback s other sf titles and an attempt was made to include more stories with science fiction elements gernsback continued magazine for five issues under new title last issue was dated october 1930 decision to cease publication was apparently taken suddenly as october issue included announcement that format would change in november from large to standard pulp size and listed two stories planned for november issue ashley 2000 p 66 gernsback sold title to wallace bamber who published at least five more issues starting in february 1931 no issues are known for june or july 1931 or after august contents thumb cover of march 1931 issue now titled amazing detective stories artist is likely stories in scientific detective monthly were almost always detective stories but they were only occasionally science fiction as in many cases science appearing in stories already had practical applications in first issue for example mystery of bulawayo diamond by arthur b reeve mentions unusual science but mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on face of a black woman murderer in campus murder mystery by ralph w wilkins freezes body to conceal manner of death a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide scientific elements in two other stories in same issue only genuine science fiction story in first issue is perfect counterfeit by captain s p meek in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money van dine s philo vance novel bishop murder case began serialization in first issue which probably assisted sales since hardcover edition of novel which had appeared only a few months previously had sold well it was not science fiction however and throughout magazine s run only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction mike ashley a historian of field suggests that gernsback was more interested in stories about science of detection than in imaginary science most of scientific detective monthly s contents were gadget stories of a kind which gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time cover for first issue by showed a detective using an electronic device to measure reactions of a suspect later issues included stories by some writers who either were already well known to readers of science fiction or would soon become so including lloyd arthur eshbach david h keller ed earl repp neil r jones and edmond hamilton though even these stories were not always science fiction hamilton s invisible master for example describes a way to become invisible but at end of story science is revealed to be a hoax and story is straightforward detective fiction clark ashton smith later to be better known for his fantasy than for science fiction contributed murder in fourth dimension to october 1930 issue protagonist uses fourth dimension to dispose of his victim s corpse lowndes 2004 pp 298 311 as well as fiction there were some non fiction departments including readers letters even in first issue gernsback obtained letters by advertising magazine to readers who subscribed to his other magazines book reviews and miscellaneous crime or science related fillers first issue included a test of readers powers of observation it showed a crime scene which readers were supposed to study and then posed questions to see how much they could remember of details there was also a questionnaire about science which asked about scientific facts mentioned in stories and a science crime notes section containing news items about science and crime gernsback s editorial argued that science would eventually end crime and suggested that both police and criminals would make growing use of scientific innovations in future gernsback included on masthead names of several experts on crime such as edwin cooley a professor of criminology at fordham university he also listed members of his staff on masthead with made up titles c p mason a member of his editorial staff was listed as scientific criminologist for example following sale bamber filled magazine with ordinary detective fiction including edgar wallace s feathered serpent first few covers of magazine did not advertise names of authors whose work was inside which was probably a mistake as existing science fiction readers might have been attracted by names of writers with whom they were familiar conversely readers who might have been interested in more sedate topics covered by non fiction were probably discouraged by lurid cover artwork gernsback was unable to obtain enough fiction to make scientific detective monthly a true mixture of two genres and result was a magazine that failed to fully appeal to fans of either genre it was in a historian robert lowndes words a fascinating experiment but a failed one bibliographic details january february march april may june july august september october november 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 1931 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 3
