original single after winning eighth uk series of x factor to be instantly recognisable when it was played on radio and believed that without their own input track would misrepresent their sound after working with producers for around a month and being new to group writing band struggled to find a song they liked group member jesy nelson said we were like we want our sound to be nicki minaj mixed with missy elliott with a bit of en vogue put in a blender i think everyone got so confused we d hear some of songs and were like oh my god we re never going to get it however when production team tms played them a backing track of wings nelson recalled my hairs stood up on my arms and i was like oh my god and i looked at girls and i went that s our first single band wrote most of wings with tms and songwriter iain james in february 2012 but writing continued until they felt song was complete michelle lewis erika nuri mischke butler and heidi rojas are also credited as songwriters it was important to little mix for wings to showcase their vocals individually and have complex harmonies and melodies eschewing dance music popular at time it was composed as a retro style pop and r b song influenced by music by beyonce and michael jackson jade thirlwall from band said it was really important for us to bring something fresh and different to table lyrics were inspired by doubt and negativity little mix experienced as a girl band during x factor and being favourites for elimination during first week of live shows they were disheartened by odds overheard in show s green room and paparazzi predicting their elimination interview on british daytime television programme this morning following monday wings was also written as an uplifting message for group s fans to relate to band

and a varying kick and snare drum arrangement other instruments include guitar keyboards as well as woodwind and brass types alto baritone and tenor saxophones trombone and trumpet brief use of wobbly bass synthesizer during verses add a contrasting dubstep element wings has a complex song structure as follows introduction chorus verse pre chorus double chorus verse pre chorus double chorus breakdown double chorus outro little mix s vocal range spans from b3 to e5 journalist alfred soto writes that song never stops for a breath song opens with a brief brass introduction that ends with a b7 chord an em chord then introduces four on floor arrangement and first chanted chorus backed by sparse drums and rhythmic ad libs during verses a bass synthesizer creates an interval between each member s solo on preceding member s last line pre chorus has a chord progression of am7 bm7 d while double chorus has a sequence of em g6 dsus2 c dsus2 e g d c6 dsus2 e unusually among double choruses in pop music wings has a key change to e major halfway on harmonised lyric fly sustaining song s momentum this is built up by transition effects and a brief return to four on floor kick drum sequence group s vocals then become more sustained and use melisma as stereo widens and pitch increases second verse starts with eighth note delay taps on first lyric i m which gradually becomes louder until properly sung using an a b pitch change which increases harmonic momentum by implying a return to d chord in chorus instead of a continuation of tonic e a breakdown occurs after second double chorus where hey is chanted repeatedly at end of each line in a call and response following a third double chorus song ends with an outro in which members sing accompanied by introduction of a drum pattern reminiscent of that of a military band according to nelson lyrics have a message of not taking any crap from anyone and believing in yourself being individual and not being afraid to be who you want to be and if you have a dream you should follow it thirlwall said wings is about group ever being put down and just saying you know what we don t care we re doing our thing release little mix first
