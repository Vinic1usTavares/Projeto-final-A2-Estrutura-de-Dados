detective comedy television he considered episode mindless when compared to monk which preceded episode moriarty stated that when not comparing psych to other shows episode is still making you wonder what hell is going on in minds of show s writers and producers he questioned show s ability to last due to having to continue fake psychic concept and called detectives lassiter and o hara completely unlikeable moriarty stated that things in installment simply don t make any sense he questioned whether show would be able to last more than one season and said that we highly recommend you continue to take a pass on psych and save yourself from mindlessness of it all installment was given a rating of 6 or okay tying it for lowest rated episode of season with preceding episode spellingg bee however in his review for tv squad writer richard keller praised episode calling it a very good episode for both james roday and dule hill he stated that he really liked this week s episode and that after testing waters in first two programs both shawn and gus really did some heavy detective work this episode he also praised rotating of shawn s abilities saying that it showed that psych could be more than just a one trick pony he compared roday to ben stiller and called scene involving gus after bachelorette party best of episode keller declared that psych is finally settling into its niche and hopefully will only get stronger from here references footnotes bibliography category psych episodes category 2006 american television episodes
