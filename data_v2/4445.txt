banksia attenuata commonly known as candlestick banksia slender banksia or biara as known by noongar aboriginal people is a species of plant in family proteaceae commonly a tree it reaches high but is often a shrub in drier areas high it has long narrow serrated leaves and bright yellow inflorescences or flower spikes held above foliage which appear in spring and summer flower spikes age to grey and swell with development of woody follicles it is found across much of southwest of western australia from north of kalbarri national park down to cape leeuwin and across to fitzgerald river national park john lindley had named material collected by james drummond banksia cylindrostachya in 1840 but this proved to be same as species named banksia attenuata by robert brown 30 years earlier in 1810 and thus brown s name took precedence within genus banksia close relationships and exact position of b attenuata is unclear candlestick banksia is pollinated by and provides food for a wide array of animals in summer months several species of honeyeater visit flower spikes as does honey possum which has an important role as a pollinator it regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base known as a lignotuber or from epicormic buds within its trunk plants may have a lifespan of 300 years it has been widely used as a street tree and for amenities planting in urban western australia though its large size generally precludes use in small gardens a dwarf form is commercially available in nurseries description banksia attenuata is generally encountered as a tree up to tall in north of its range as climate becomes warmer and drier it is often a stunted multistemmed shrub tall both forms occur in vicinity of hill river but there is otherwise a marked demarcation thumb left a large tree in bold park perth trunk is characteristically wavy or bent alt a large tree with a wavy curved pale grey trunk in a dry scrubland type landscape in wheatbelt and east of stirling range it is a stunted tree tree forms have a solid trunk generally wavy or bent with thick crumbly orange grey bark which is a red brown underneath it regenerates from fire via lignotuber or epicormic buds from its fire tolerant trunk it has long narrow shiny green linear leaves long and wide leaf margins have v or u shaped serrations along their length new growth is a pale grey green and occurs mainly in late spring and summer pp 54 55 often after flowering brilliant yellow inflorescences flower spikes occur from spring into summer and are up wide and up to tall they are made up of many small individual flowers a study at mount adams north of perth revealed a count of 1933 a standard error of 88 flowers per inflorescence and another in fitzgerald river national park yielded a count of 1720 76 flowers anthesis proceeds up flower spike over about 10 to 20 days and is asynchronous that is a plant produces flower spikes over a several week period and will thus have spikes at different stages of development over flowering season often bright green in bud stage they are terminal occurring at ends of one to three year old branches and displayed prominently above foliage smell of open flowers has been likened to a peppery shiraz wine over time spikes fade to brown and then grey and individual flowers shrivel and lie against spikes this coincides with development of dark furry oval follicles which measure long high and wide however only a very small percentage 0 1 of flowers develop into follicles field study at mount adams yielded a count of 3 6 1 2 per cone follicles develop and mature over seven to eight months from february to december while seed development occurs over four months from september to december taxonomy thumb upright a flower spike in early bud stage alt a narrow cylindrical dark spike with many yellowish buds forming along its length banksia attenuata was first collected by robert brown from king george sound in december 1801 and published by him in 1810 specific epithet is latin adjective attenuatus narrowed and refers to leaves narrowing towards base species has had a fairly uneventful taxonomic history it has only two synonyms and no subspecies or varieties have been published australian botanist alex george reviewed variation in form in species and felt that tree and shrub forms differed only in size and hence were not distinct enough to represent separate taxa in 1840 john lindley published a putative new species banksia cylindrostachya in his a sketch of vegetation of swan river colony this has now be shown to be a taxonomic synonym of b attenuata in 1891 otto kuntze made a failed attempt to transfer banksia to new generic name sirmuellera in process he published name sirmuellera attenuata which is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of b attenuata common names include slender banksia candle banksia and candlestick banksia alternately spelled biara is an aboriginal name from melville region of perth relationships of banksia attenuata within genus are unclear when carl meissner published his infrageneric arrangement of banksia in 1856 he placed b attenuata in section eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head and in series salicinae a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous this series was discarded in 1870 arrangement of george bentham instead b attenuata was placed in section cyrtostylis a group of species which did not fit easily into one of other sections in 1981 george published a revised arrangement that placed b attenuata in subgenus banksia because of its flower spike section banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked and series cyrtostylis a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species he conceded its large emarginate cotyledons having a notch in their apex were quite different from other members and that it had similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member b elegans he felt b attenuata to have affinities to b lindleyana and b media thumb upright an inflorescence halfway through anthesis as flowers open upwards up spike alt a broader yellow cylindrical flower spike with a clear border halfway up it thumb upright ageing flowers remain curled against spike as furry follicles develop alt two greyish old flower spikes with oval valved seed pods george s arrangement remained current until 1996 when kevin thiele and pauline ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics they calculated b attenuata to lie at base of a large b attenuata b ashbyi clade but conceded further work was needed before its relationships could be determined and left it as incertae sedis i e its exact placement is unclear questioning emphasis on cladistics in thiele and ladiges arrangement george published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of banksia for flora of australia series of monographs to date this remains most recent comprehensive arrangement placement of b attenuata in george s 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows banksia b subg banksia b sect banksia b ser cyrtostylis b media b praemorsa b epica b b attenuata b ashbyi b b audax b lullfitzii b elderiana b laevigata b laevigata subsp laevigata b laevigata subsp b elegans b lindleyana since 1998 american botanist austin mast and co authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of dna sequence data for subtribe banksiinae which then comprised genera banksia and dryandra their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from george s taxonomic arrangement banksia attenuata resolves as a basal member of and next closest relative or sister to a clade containing b elegans and within that a monophyletic b subg isostylis an eocene fossil cone named banksia around 50 million years old resembles that of b attenuata early in 2007 mast and thiele rearranged genus banksia by merging dryandra into it and published b subg spathulatae for taxa having spoon shaped cotyledons thus b subg banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b attenuata is placed in b subg banksia distribution and habitat thumb left distribution of b across southwest of western australia alt a map of australia with red across a broad swathe of southwestern corner most widely distributed of all western banksias banksia attenuata occurs across a broad swathe of southwest of western australia from kalbarri national park and murchison river with an outlying population in national park southwards right to southwestern corner of state at augusta and cape leeuwin and then eastwards across south to western edge of fitzgerald river national park along eastern border northwards it is found at lake grace lake magenta north of jerramungup and hills it is restricted to various sandy soils including white yellow or brown sands and sand over either laterite or limestone it forms an important component of open eucalyptus woodland as a dominant or understory tree or tall shrub to north it is a shrubby component of shrubland it does not grow on heavy clay based soils and is hence only found in sandy pockets within open woodland it is found alongside b menziesii b ilicifolia b prionotes allocasuarina eucalyptus marginata or e gomphocephala annual rainfall within its distribution varies from ecology thumb upright a tree with new growth resprouting from epicormic buds after fire alt an irregularly shaped bush with many long leaves sprouting from trunk along its length like many plants in south west western australia b attenuata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent most banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire reseeders are killed by fire but fire also triggers release of their canopy seed bank thus promoting recruitment of next generation resprouters survive fire resprouting from a lignotuber or more rarely epicormic buds protected by thick bark bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber b attenuata is one of latter group with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire it is moderately serotinous storing only one tenth number of seeds in its seed bank as reseeding b hookeriana with which it coexists on sand dunes in scrub at eneabba north of perth even then many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire but instead after successive autumn rains an experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly in water after being heated in a ring bunsen flame to around for two minutes cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time around 40 released at three weeks increasing steadily to almost 90 at ten weeks compared with a series of controls which were kept dry of which fewer than 10 of seed released thus seed remains in follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in wetter winter instead of dryer summer increasing chance of survival after follicle is split seed and separator are exposed to elements wings of woody separator are hygroscopic and move together when wet and spread and curl apart when dry seed is gradually drawn out by movement with each wetting once released seed germinates at temperatures between to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival still many seedlings die off in hot and dry summer months seedling survival for species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time despite this longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants as they mature plants are less likely to perish and estimated to live for 300 years or more analyzing seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on eneabba sandplain showed that b attenuata would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20 years peaking with intervals around 10 to 12 years compared with longer intervals for reseeders b hookeriana and b prionotes placed against its rivals b attenuata would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11 years but at longer intervals is outcompeted by b hookeriana variability in timing between fires allows all three species to coexist exaggerated good and bad weather conditions favours b attenuata over reseeding species which suffer more despite having relatively heavy seed seed from banksia attenuata has a high rate of long distance dispersal a genetic study of populations in eneabba showed that over 5 of plants had originated up to away similar rates to banksia hookeriana seed of which only weighs half as much mechanism for this is unclear although byron lamont has proposed short billed black cockatoo calyptorhynchus latirostris as a vector species seeks out banksia attenuata cones after bushfire possibly because large seeds and greater chance of grubs in cone make them more nutritious flowering has been recorded one to two years after a bushfire flower spikes in late bud are used in cut flower industry primarily in western australia aboriginal people particularly and placed flower spike in a paperbark lined hole filled with water to make a sweet drink both this species and b aemula have been credited with inspiration behind may gibbs big bad banksia men this species was familiar to gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her initial inspiration although depictions resemble latter species artist marianne north produced a highly regarded painting of b attenuata during her stay in australia in 1880 1881 references external
