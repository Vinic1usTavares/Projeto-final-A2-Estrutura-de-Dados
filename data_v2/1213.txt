in 1956 a genre based on a contemporary youth subculture whose interests revolved around beach life jazz music and their progressive attitudes towards sex films met with moral public outcries and a fourth production was shut down at behest of eirin motion picture code of ethics committee however genre later experienced a resurgence which included warped ones film marked director koreyoshi kurahara s first collaboration with screenwriter nobuo yamada they reused many elements of kurahara s earlier sun tribe film time of youth 1959 including abortion a near fatality via an opened gas cock and a criminal act near water an explosion beside a stream in former and rape on beach in latter nikkatsu was promoting lead actor tamio kawachi as one of its bad boy trio along with akira kobayashi and tadao kurahara asked him to think of his character as a hungry lion roaring at sun he turned in what writer mark schilling described as his most unusual and one of his best performances of period supporting actress noriko matsumoto came to film as a relative unknown hiroyuki nagato had starred in time of youth eiji go was younger brother of future diamond line star joe film was completed on august 18 1960 style as writer mark schilling put it soundtrack drives action and composer toshiro mayuzumi s jazz score moves swiftly cinematographer yoshi mamiya and editor akira suzuki employed swish pans freeze frames and jump cuts alternating between carefully composed shots and seemingly recklessly hand held camera work titular youths of film too move violently and speak in grunts screams whistles and sound effects akira frequently greeting women with wanna get laid or s scat at they are portrayed as amoral impulsive narcissists and hedonists pickpocketing and stealing cars with equal nonchalance akira described as possessing face rubbing mannerisms of marlon brando and tortured swagger of james dean varies between sadistic and indifferent save when in a jazz induced fervor and reaches extremes largely unseen in contemporaneous cinema of west film s subject matter is sensationalistic and it contains much incident in its short run time overall style is matched to characters verve and story s frantic pace while not portraying akira sympathetically film does offer a socio political view on origins and inevitability of such criminal types in society tenements in which youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile lacking education proper role models and moral codes critic bryan hartzheim posited crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse they seem aware of injustices in their environments and rail against society at large however akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend gil chico rolands whom he views as a fellow outcast frolic in ocean reception thumb alt a woman sits on floor in her underwear with her bra undone she faces a chair in background with a dress strewn across it audubon films theatrical poster employed simple artwork and a suggestive tagline to promote film as being exploitative contrary to film s actual content warped ones was originally released in japan by nikkatsu company on september 3 1960 film was successful in japan although not so much so that tamio kawachi was ever elevated to major star status and after his bad boy period he was mainly relegated to second lead and supporting parts in july 1961 arthur davis newly formed american foreign film distribution company kanji pictures announced it had acquired ten nikkatsu films for north and south american markets and parts of europe films included warped ones shohei imamura s pigs and battleships 1961 and kon ichikawa s burmese harp 1956 and were to be distributed by kanji or sold to other distribution companies an english dubbed version of warped ones was then released in united states on december 18 1963 by radley metzger s sexploitation centric audubon films initially as weird lovemakers then warped ones became more common title it was marketed as an american film and misleadingly implied to contain sexually explicit material in order to appeal to a wider audience original film resurfaced some four decades later at 2005 udine far east film festival in no borders no limits nikkatsu action cinema retrospective mark schilling curated retrospective in order to expose international audiences to 1960s nikkatsu action films which aside from films of seijun suzuki remained predominately unseen outside japan schilling originally titled film season of heat a literal translation of japanese title but it was retitled warped ones for subsequent incarnations of retrospective which included runs in austin and new york it also appeared in a 12 film retrospective of koreyoshi kurahara s nikkatsu films at 2008 tokyo filmex international film festival in japan it was screened with english subtitles critics have most often compared film to landmark youth films breathless also 1960 released in france five months earlier directed by jean luc godard and nicholas ray s rebel without a cause 1955 although bryan hartzheim found it takes its youths more seriously and with less sympathy he stated warped ones takes a wrecking ball to what can be considered of youth film genre an exhibition of horrors of uninhibited youth taken to its carnal extremes and matched by a visual accompaniment akin to abstract and improvised style of a miles davis score tim lucas of video watchdog magazine called film an important rediscovery on many fronts one of great jazz films and possibly best illustration cinema has ever given us of jazz buff it s only film i ve ever seen that makes jazz seem scarier than darkest heavy metal that makes jazz seem dangerous for japanese cult film companion alvin lu commended score as stunning and kawachi s performance as ferocious very incarnation of kind of social chaos that could be engendered by too much exposure to jazz coke and hot dogs boston globe s wesley morris wrote koreyoshi kurahara takes movie to extremes of behavior and style merging two until form seems as violently unstable as characters he makes a wave that in europe was called french and new but with all due respect to jean luc godard this is breathless and more interesting too morris further qualified that while breathless may appeal to contemporary viewers academically warped ones retains a spontaneous documentary feel schilling discerned film among kurahara s boldest departures from studio convention reviewer peter martin confided warped ones baffled and mystified me but i liked it very much j r jones for reader s guide to arts entertainment found film actually celebrates values it s supposed to be condemning but recommended it for its and action tv guide and allmovie did not recommended it both gave it one star in their respective four and five star rating systems legacy success of film lead koreyoshi kurahara and nobuo yamada to write and direct a couple more original scripts where kurahara was primarily known for his adaptations of novels this included follow up black sun 1964 which again featured tamio kawachi who reprised his role from warped ones as did several of other actors and a lot of jazz music in it kawachi s akira shelters a black g i gil played by chico rolands who goes a w o l after killing a white man in a bar fight film explores two men s friendship and race relations it was also first reversal on rashamen themed films post war often american japanese co productions focusing on friendships or romances between a japanese and an american rashamen films were intended as to promote goodwill between two nations but were generally less well received in japan seen as unrealistic or patronizing film historian tadao sato described black sun as first film of this sort where japanese pity americans instead of reverse as akira s preconceptions of black americans are undone mark schilling characterized kawachi as bringing an explosive energy to film and roland a piping screech of fear and desperation acclaimed american jazz musician max roach contributed to score alvin lu found warped ones to be a prime example of sun tribe genre and placed it among those films whose outlook made way for japanese pink film in film tim lucas noted antecedents and a possible influence to most hellbent characters in films of acclaimed director quentin tarantino s films and specifically to stanley kubrick s iconic a clockwork orange 1971 lucas drew comparisons between warped ones main character akira and a clockwork orange s alex delarge including their respective obsessions with hard jazz and music of ludwig van beethoven former with a framed copy of ornette coleman s album shape of jazz to come next to his bed latter an engraving of beethoven also scenes of former s verbal deconstructions by a group of art students versus latter s by government akira s attacks on abstract art and delarge s on pop art lined homes finally character s regular hangouts both painted with black walls former s adorned with portraits of jazz legends latter s with advertisements for and fictional drugs delarge and his gang use to invigorate themselves before their criminal acts lucas concluded kubrick simply had to have seen it two american music groups took their name from warped ones alternate sexploitation title weird lovemakers now defunct tucson punk band weird lovemakers assumed name in 1994 and held it until their disbandment in 2000 oakland california based electropop band lovemakers planned to use same name on their inception in 2002 but dropped weird upon their discovery of former band having taken name home video in north
