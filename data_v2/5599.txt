osborne patrick mchale and series creator pendleton ward episode was directed by larry leichliter with pat mchale and sanchez serving as creative co directors and nick jennings serving as art director both ward and fellow series storyboard artist tom herpich helped moynihan and sanchez clean up their story one scene in which finn and jake hide from skeletons only to have jake s flatulence alert them to their presence was supposed to be storyboarded by ward however he was extremely tired and offered herpich 100 amount ward would have earned had he done it to storyboard scene instead episode features an extremely long pan showing much of land of dead which was designed by moynihan in episode s storyboard pan takes up 7 pages regarding this length moynihan later noted on his personal website that initially he wanted to really go over top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right moynihan s original pan was redesigned by background designer dan ghostshrimp james who also did some of other backgrounds for episode other backgrounds were done by chris tsirgiotis who according to moynihan was doing his best ghostshrimp impression tsirgiotis himself later noted that matching ghostshrimp s drawing style is pretty tricky it looks simple at first glance but it s actually very sophisticated and nuanced scene wherein peppermint butler teaches finn and jake to enter land of dead by crossing their eyes and staring at a corner was inspired by a story that moynihan s father told him when he was younger according to artist his father told him that if you concentrate really hard enough you would walk into another dimension moynihan recalled story when he was storyboarding and worked it into episode climax featuring death and finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be corny according to ward scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were easiest traps to fall into when you re writing an outline for death in bloom writing staff realized that a contest would work towards story s strengths in original drafts of episode finn and jake were guided through land of dead by a mysterious rabbit while working on episode sanchez continually felt that rabbit was misplaced in episode eventually writers and series staff began to agree with sanchez and when it came time to revise episode rabbit was cut rabbit s role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get jake to drink from river of forgetfulness according to storyboard artist rebecca sugar a rough draft for original ending featured princess bubblegum becoming a man without princess plant moynihan later noted that writers were being a little reckless when it was pitched and ward joked that he had to step in and be quality control to prevent idea from making it into final episode death was voiced by miguel ferrer ferrer would later reprise his role in fourth season episode sons of mars and several subsequent episodes after that death s look was designed by moynihan who admitted on his personal website that he was somewhat intimidated with task of redesigning such an iconic character moynihan deliberately avoided stereotypical depiction of death with a robe and a sickle instead choosing to experiment with both a japanese cosmic alien thing and a jodorowsky holy mountain inspired design latter design won out although moynihan later changed character s head into a horse skull design for character was then finalized by phil rynda who was series lead character designer at time reception death in bloom first
