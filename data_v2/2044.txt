second test of 1948 ashes series was one of five tests in a cricket series between australia and england match was played at lord s in london from 24 to 29 june with a rest day on 27 june australia won match by 409 runs to take a 2 0 lead meaning that england would need to win remaining three matches to regain ashes australian captain don bradman won toss and elected to bat tourists had won first test convincingly and decided to field same team while england made three changes mainly to adopt a more attacking bowling strategy australia started strongly led by opener arthur morris who scored 105 and took score to 166 2 mid way through first day this notation in discussing a batting side means that they have scored 166 runs while losing two wickets in doing so however later batsmen struggled after his departure and fell to 258 7 by end of first day handing home team advantage however a lower order counterattack on second morning saw australia reach 350 wicket keeper don tallon scoring 53 for england seamer alec bedser was most successful bowler taking 4 100 australian paceman ray lindwall then cut through english top order reducing them to 46 4 after a recovery an 87 run partnership between denis compton who top scored with 53 and captain norman yardley both fell within one run of each other and england looked set to be dismissed short of follow on mark when they were at 145 7 however lower order resisted stoutly and they ended at 215 early on third morning lindwall took 5 70 australia then set about extending their first innings lead and opener sid barnes led way scoring 141 he put on an opening partnership of 122 with morris 62 and added 174 with bradman 89 australia closed third day at 343 4 after a productive day of batting giving them a lead of 478 despite losing three quick wickets late in afternoon after rest day australia proceeded to reach 460 7 keith miller making 74 before bradman declared setting england a target of 596 midway through afternoon hosts reached 106 3 at stumps on fourth day but then collapsed on final morning to be all out for 186 handing australia a 409 run victory cyril washbrook and tom dollery top scored for england with 37 apiece ernie toshack had pick of figures with 5 40 while lindwall took 3 61 although toshack had better figures commentators credited lindwall with orchestrating england collapse at start of innings he bowled at leading english batsmen len hutton at great pace before dismissing him hutton had appeared very unsettled by lindwall and played meekly he was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for following match as selectors thought he was providing a poor example to junior members of team australians were very pleased with this decision which they believed to be wrong as they regarded hutton as their most formidable opponent match set a new record for highest attendance at a test in england background australia had proceeded through first two months of tour of england without defeat after winning 10 of first twelve matches before tests started eight of these by an innings other two were drawn they won first test by eight wickets between tests they defeated northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against yorkshire according to former english paceman bill bowes england had approached first test with intention of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics bowes himself believed tactics to be correct and almost successful however he suspected that walter robins one of selectors considered english strategy to be misguided and that they should attack australians this was reflected in english selections bowes pp 188 189 home team made three changes leg spinner doug wright who was forced to withdraw from first test at late notice due to lumbago had regained his fitness and replaced left arm orthodox spin of young who had taken match figures of 1 107 in first test australian wicket keeper don tallon was his only wicket fingleton p 82 however he had managed to keep batsmen quiet with his defensive leg theory bowling 60 overs for 79 runs wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler bowes p 189 jim laker who had been called into first test team due to wright s lumbago was initially third spinner in pecking order but he took 4 138 including three specialist batsmen and was retained alec coxon took match figures of 4 113 for yorkshire against australia taking four middle order wickets and scored 21 and 16 not out in middle order he came into team as an all rounder even though his performances during rest of english season had been mediocre he had a batting average of 20 25 for summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to county fixture against australia bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with robins s strategic thinking tom dollery was called into team after a run of heavy scoring for warwickshire on difficult pitches at edgbaston he had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first class matches for season batsman charlie barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in first test joe hardstaff junior was also left out he had scored a duck and 43 in first test and had a toe infection so selectors were spared predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds fingleton p 107 with wright in for young and coxon selected in place of a specialist batsman england had a more attacking bowling line up something retired australian test leg spinner bill o reilly praised he also thought selection of coxon was beneficial as his swing bowling would ease workload of batsman bill edrich who had opened bowling in previous test o reilly regarded edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought extra burden with ball was detracting from his main duty batting o reilly pp 58 59 australia retained same xi from first test at trent bridge ian johnson was retained despite taking match figures of 1 85 as was bill brown opener who was batting out of position in middle order brown had scored 25 26 and 17 in his three innings in middle order during tour o reilly criticised selection of brown who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in unfamiliar role he said that despite brown s unbeaten double century in his previous test at lord s in 1938 sam loxton and neil harvey had better claims to selection following his groin injury at trent bridge lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on first morning bradman was not convinced of lindwall s fitness but bowler s protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion australia won toss and elected to bat allowing lindwall further time to recover from his injury

of english capital first over bowled by bedser to barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden debutant coxon opened bowling with bedser and he removed barnes for a duck in his second over caught by hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery to leave australia 3 1 fingleton p 108 barnes tried to knock ball through square leg but misjudged pace of wicket and played his shot too early ball to hutton o reilly p 60 coxon bowled from very close to wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside right hander s leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner although he was not of particularly fast pace coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride making a significant impact on surface arlott p 56 bradman received a loud positive reception from crowd as he came out to bat in his final test at lord s bradman initially struggled against english bowling he faced his first ball from coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump before missing third ball from coxon and surviving a loud appeal for leg before wicket lbw bowling from other end bedser beat bradman with seam movement off pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past stumps standing up to stumps wicket keeper godfrey evans removed bails as bradman leaned forward but his foot had stayed firmly behind crease in another close call bradman inside edged a ball towards yardley at short leg but english captain was slow to react and ball landed in front of him australian captain managed only three runs in first 20 minutes and australia had scored only 14 after first 30 minutes coxon consistently moved ball into a cautious bradman and australians scored only 32 runs in first hour edrich then relieved coxon who had bowled his first seven overs in test cricket for loss of only 10 runs edrich bowled a bouncer which bradman tried to swing to leg side but leading edge instead went in air and landed behind point on 13 bradman leg glanced a bedser ball from his legs narrowly evading hutton in trap at short fine leg after one hour he was on 14 bradman had fallen twice for leg trap in previous test fingleton p 109 bedser continued to probe australian captain with inswingers trying to extract a lofted leg glance in vicinity if waiting hutton in contrast morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from back cut bedser was relieved after 70 minutes of bowling leg spin of wright was introduced and australia cut loose wright bowled a no ball that morris dispatched into leg side crowd for six before hitting another ball for four bradman and morris settled down as coxon and wright operated australian captain drove debutant coxon through covers for two fours and yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers coxon continued to significantly rough up pitch outside right handed batsman s leg stump and from other wright was able to extract substantial spin on first morning of match hitting morris in stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump o reilly p 61 at lunch australia were 82 1 with morris on 45 and bradman 35 tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries rather than take risks and as englishmen bowled accurately australians did not score quickly arlott p 57 in third over after lunch break with score at 87 bradman was caught for third consecutive time in series by hutton off bedser at short fine leg hutton had dropped bradman in same position when he was on 13 including a county match against yorkshire it was fourth time hutton had caught bradman in leg trap from a glance according to o reilly this was evidence that bradman was no longer player he was before world war ii as he had been unable to disperse close catching fielders by counter attacking before eventually being dismissed o reilly p 62 o reilly said this was first time bradman had fallen to same trap three times in succession o reilly p 64 hassett came to crease to join morris with new ball already due still using old ball bedser beat hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in but appeal for lbw was turned down however yardley opted to not take ball and hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before english captain called for a replacement ball o reilly said failure to take new ball immediately after appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise psychological pressure on hassett after a slow start morris had begun to take control he drove ball through covers and clipped it through leg side and reached his century with consecutive boundaries from coxon soon after new ball was taken arlott p 58 former australian test opener jack fingleton covering tour as a newspaper journalist called it a pretty test century in grandest of all cricket settings century ended a poor run of form for morris earlier in tour when he had been shuffling uncertainly on crease without decisively moving forward or back fingleton p 110 o reilly called it morris s best test century to date as this was strongest english attack he had faced during his career and because of loss of wickets at other end o reilly said morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity morris was out soon after for 105 runs with score at 166 3 having struck 14 fours and one six his innings which was noted for powerful well placed cover drives ended when he hit coxon to hutton in gully miller came in and bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers to him a fourth ball swung other way and miller did not offer a shot expecting ball to curve away and miss stumps instead he was hit in front of wickets and given out lbw for four perry 2005 p 240 o reilly said miller s display was more akin to that of a tail end batsman with minimal skill and blamed his poor form with bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by bradman o reilly p 65 with two quick wickets england had put match back in balance batting out of position in middle order brown came in at 173 4 and helped hassett to rebuild innings both scored slowly averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run they realised australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution reluctant even to attack long hops hassett was dropped three times before yardley who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate arlott p 59 broke through his defences with a yorker english skipper trapped brown lbw nine runs later to leave australia at 225 6 brown had hit two consecutive half volleys off his pads through leg side for four and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery however this third delivery came off pitch more quickly and beat brown for pace this left johnson and tallon as new men at crease johnson struggled to score while tallon did so freely in last hour edrich had johnson caught behind for four to leave australia at 246 7 johnson had contributed only four of 30 runs scored while he was at crease lindwall joined tallon and pair survived to close of play england were well placed when australia ended at stumps on 258 7 with tallon on 25 and lindwall on 3 tallon had dominated scoring late in day making 25 of 33 runs added bowes believed that yardley attacked very well keeping pressure on australia by rotating his bowlers effectively so his three main bowlers were always at crease o reilly praised evans s agile display in his stumping attempts as fastest and best he had seen o reilly p 66 english crowd were optimistic about england s position and some of them immediately camped outside turnstiles upon leaving ground arlott said england s bowlers had done nobly 25 june day two next day english crowd filled ground early anticipating a strong showing from home team after their promising start on first day arlott p 60 but australia s lower order batted their team into control on second morning tallon and lindwall batted confidently from start of play and latter hit two cover drives for four from bedser after new ball was taken o reilly said lindwall was playing in same manner as when he made his maiden test century in last ashes series but he then played around a straight ball from bedser and was bowled for 15 to leave score at 275 8 o reilly p 67 tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner while johnston and toshack played adventurously registering highest test scores of their careers cashman et al pp 152 153 299 300 both johnston and toshack swung hard at ball which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots australia s wicket keeper put on 45 with johnston who scored 29 before becoming bedser s second victim of morning holing out to yardley for 53 toshack came out to join johnston with score at 320 9 and last pair put on 30 more runs before latter was stumped from wright s leg spin having overbalanced while leaning onto front foot and trying to hit a ball for six o reilly p 68 australians had regained momentum adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in morning one sequence of two overs from edrich was taken for 28 runs with many balls being unintentionally over slips or covers from both johnston and toshack not known for their batting ability played without inhibitions joyfully revelling in their luck arlott p 61 yardley was later criticised for not bringing wright into attack at an earlier stage as australian tail was dealing efficiently with english pacemen bedser was most successful of bowlers ending with 4 100 from 43 overs while debutant coxon took 2 90 from 35 overs off spin of laker was used sparingly accounting for only seven overs whereas part time medium pace of edrich and yardley had combined for 23 overs washbrook and hutton then strode to crease as england faced a short burst of australian pace before lunch break lindwall took new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering first ball to hutton perry 2001 p 223 despite this lindwall persevered and his first over was a maiden arlott p 62 seeing lindwall struggle through pain barrier bradman tossed ball to miller at start off second over to see if he could lift and bowl as well however miller threw ball back to his captain indicating that his body would not be able to withstand strain this resulted in media speculation that bradman and miller had quarrelled although bradman claimed exchange had been amicable others disputed this teammate barnes later asserted that miller had retorted by suggesting bradman a very occasional slower bowler bowl himself barnes said captain was as wild as a battery stung brumby and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance growden pp 202 203 according to unpublished writings in fingleton s personal collection bradman chastised his players in dressing room at end of play saying i m 40 and i can do my full day s work in field miller reportedly snapped so would i if i had fibrositis growden p 203 bradman had been discharged from armed services during world war ii on health grounds whereas most of team had been sent into battle miller had crash landed while serving as a fighter pilot in royal australian air force in england and had suffered chronic back trouble ever since perry 2005 pp 105 120 washbrook had been criticised after first test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks early in his innings having fallen twice to attacking shots he continued to play in a similar way rather than adopting traditional opener s strategy of not playing at any ball unless it was going to hit stumps and waiting for bowlers to tire o reilly pp 68 69 lindwall had washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over playing at a ball outside off stump o reilly p 69 and ended his pre lunch spell with 1 7 from six overs while johnston accompanied him from other end neither hutton nor washbrook appeared comfortable against bowling and new batsman edrich tried to hit lindwall through off side leading to a loud appeal for caught behind which was turned down after lunch hutton did majority of scoring before playing outside a johnson off break on front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave england at 32 2 english opener had been uncertain against johnson s spin and played forward too early at a slower ball which went between a gap between his bat and pad compton came in having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in last test while trying to avoid a bouncer and lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away but new batsman was not caught off guard o reilly p 70 lindwall then clean bowled edrich who was playing across line with an outswinger for five edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs dollery came out and played first ball with his pads before being bowled for a duck from next delivery dollery s bat was still about to start its downward swing towards by time lindwall s outswinger had passed him and hit stumps o reilly said dollery s inability to deal with lindwall was typical of english cricket s lack of answers to express pace bowling this was part of a six over post lunch spell by lindwall that yielded 2 11 as batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace england were 46 4 and australia firmly in control fingleton p 111 compton was joined by his skipper yardley and after playing defensively for a period pair rebuilt innings scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes after loss of four quick wickets compton and yardley elected to not play at any balls that were not on line of stumps and lindwall and johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of second new ball australia had option of taking new ball just before tea break but bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels o reilly p 71 meanwhile johnson and toshack operated and english duo played them cautiously and comfortably at tea england had recovered to be 129 4 with compton on 51 and yardley 42 fingleton p 112 english captain had been particularly successful against johnson capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs after tea lindwall and johnston returned with new ball but former appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over compton edged johnston into slips where miller took a low catch ending his innings for 53 one run later lindwall clipped yardley s off stump with first ball of next over to leave england at 134 6 home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot evans came to crease and tried to counter attack hitting lindwall for a boundary past square leg johnston then removed evans for nine caught by a diving miller from a swing of bat wide outside off stump leaving hosts at 145 7 coxon and laker came to crease and put on a 41 run stand for eighth wicket after 85 minutes of resistance coxon hit a catch back to johnson ending his first test innings for 19 and laker was caught behind from same bowler having already been dropped twice in slips england s last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 207 9 with bedser on six and wright eight having just avoided follow on 26 june day three on third morning bedser and wright survived for 20 minutes and lindwall tried to break their resistance by aiming a few bouncers at former bedser eventually inside edged a lindwall bouncer onto his stumps ending england s innings at 215 giving australia a 135 run first innings lead lindwall ended with 5 70 while johnson took 3 72 and johnston 2 43 toshack was other bowler used sending down 18 overs for loss of 23 runs in later years bradman told lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler s pain lindwall was worried his captain had noticed injury but bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax o reilly said lindwall bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl he always seemed to have situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into task and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler o reilly p 72 arlott praised lindwall for his subtle variations in pace line and length and how he kept batsman guessing as to what was coming to them arlott p 63 thumb barnes pictured here in a photo at age of 16 top scored with 141 in second innings alt a teenage boy leans over his bat in front of stumps in readiness to face a ball he is wearing a white shirt trousers and a cap weather was fine as australia started their second innings just after noon from second ball of innings bowled by bedser barnes got off mark to avoid his pair coxon took new ball at other end and barnes and morris saw it off in contrast to their english counterparts australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with avoiding hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit stumps and established a solid start for themselves o reilly pp 72 73 yardley then introduced laker who induced morris to hit a ball back down pitch in air but bowler was slow to react to possibility of a caught and bowled according to o reilly most other bowlers would have been able to reach ball and attempt a catch barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from laker in same over when he was on 18 he came down pitch and ball bounced out of footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump but evans fumbled it and it went away for four byes fingleton p 113 o reilly p 73 arlott p 65 barnes took advantage of his reprieve to combine with morris in an opening stand of 122 as yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt their progress wright came on and bowled a no ball which morris lofted into crowd for six morris stopped shuffling while barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre emptively moving down pitch to laker earlier in tour barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into leg side he drove laker into pavilion and australia were 73 0 at lunch with morris on 40 and barnes 25 an overall lead of 208 fingleton p 140 after lunch morris was bowled for 62 knocking a ball from wright onto his stumps after attempting a sweep from a long hop fingleton p 116 this brought bradman in to join barnes yardley surrounded australian captain with fielders and laker beat his bat thrice in an over bedser was brought in with leg trap again in place as he bowled on bradman s pads with second new ball australian captain decided to avoid danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding inswingers away with his front leg bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers beating outside edge of his bat three times in a row narrowly missing off stump on one occasion o reilly pp 73 74 barnes responded by manipulating strike and shielding bradman from bedser australian opener had little trouble against leg trap bedser set for him scoring freely into leg side and taking shine off new ball o reilly p 74 barnes was also quiet after lunch and after one long period of defence he drove laker for four through covers eliciting a round of ironic applause australian opener responded by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to spectators fingleton p 117 barnes had started slowly but he accelerated after reaching his half century bradman took two consecutive boundaries from wright to bring up his fifty this left barnes on 96 and australia at 222 1 half an hour after tea by this time pace of pitch appeared to have slowed making batting relatively easy barnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a straight drive from laker he had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours after registering his century barnes became particularly aggressive barnes stepped out to attack laker but missed luckily for him evans failed to collect ball as it turned down leg side barnes dispatched one laker over for 21 runs including two successive blows over long on boundary for six and two fours and australia s lead went past 400 mark with nine wickets still in hand yardley then brought on part time left arm unorthodox spin of compton and himself in an attempt to stem barnes hitting australian finally fell for 141 caught by washbrook on boundary from yardley fingleton p 118 ball would have gone for another six had it not been intercepted by washbrook arlott p 66 barnes had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings speed of his batting had allowed australia to reach 296 2 in minutes after a 174 run partnership with bradman yardley bowled hassett for a golden duck off inside edge so miller came to crease at 296 3 to face yardley s hat trick ball australian all rounder survived a loud lbw appeal on his first ball denying english captain his hat trick despite yardley s failure to complete hat trick he had taken four wickets in match and was going through an unusually productive period with his semi regular bowling while england s front line bowlers struggled yardley managed 9 wickets at a bowling average of 22 66 for series his average was second only to lindwall among all bowlers and only bedser 18 among his players dismissed more batsmen in contrast yardley averaged less than two wickets every three matches throughout his first class career at an average above 30 bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last test innings at lord s when he fell to bedser again this time courtesy of a one handed diving effort from edrich bradman had been worried by bedser s angle into his pads and leg trap but seamer s leg cutter moved ball other way towards slips and caught bradman s outside edge fingleton p 120 bedser had dismissed bradman all four times so far in test series brown joined miller at 329 4 after australia had lost 3 33 tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss miller striking one six over square leg into grandstand he had also offered two chances but none of catches were completed this gave australia a lead of 478 at end of third day with miller on 22 and brown on 7 in all england had missed seven catches or stumpings arlott p 67 o reilly said loss of three quick wickets in afternoon was not so much a sign of an english revival but australian complacency due to large size of lead o reilly p 75 28 june day four after sunday rest day australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages which increased england s chances of saving game just ten minutes after start of day s play heavy rain intervened weather cleared and miller and brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively having advanced australia to 409 4 miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into air dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare but dropped catch fingleton pp 120 121 in 88 minutes of play australia added a further 66 runs during this time third new ball became available but england opted not to use it immediately as wet and slippery ground had made it hard for bowlers to grip ball or run up to crease with confidence hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over ball however after a period of using his slower bowlers yardley opted to take new ball and miller hit three boundaries to pass 50 and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring it appeared that aside from need to score quickly in preparation for declaration both players found new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor miller hooked coxon repeatedly and drove bedser for many runs arlott p 69 bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack english openers for a short period before adjournment but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so as his bowlers would have struggled to grip ball lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times o reilly p 76 after resumption of play brown was caught behind from coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score ending an 87 run partnership with miller and bringing lindwall to crease at 416 5 miller and lindwall attacked at every opportunity before declaration miller s innings was noted for its driving and he was out for 74 playing a hook shot that was caught by bedser at square leg from laker in pursuit of quick runs he was followed by lindwall who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit laker across line to boundary missed and was stumped for 25 prompting bradman to declare with australia at 460 7 with a lead of 595 runs tourists had added 51 runs for loss of three wickets in approximately an hour s batting after lunch fingleton p 121 yardley and laker had been only multiple wicket takers with two each australians had punished spinners most taking more than 3 50 runs per over from each of wright laker and compton it would take a world record chase from england to win match perry 2005 p 241 yardley decided to use medium roller to flatten out surface but further showers breathed more life into pitch forcing a rain break immediately after start of england s run chase rain immediately stopped after players returned to pavilion but upon promptly returning to middle rain started again arlott p 70 players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour before washbrook and hutton unsuccessfully appealed against light rain then came again for another 40 minutes which included tea break weather cleared in time for normal resumption of play at 4 30 after scheduled adjournment when players returned lindwall and johnston extracted steep bounce with new ball troubling english batsmen however washbrook changed his tactics and decided to eschew hook shot even allowing some short balls to hit him on body washbrook drove johnston for three runs and then pulled lindwall for a four almost collecting barnes who was standing close in at short leg in nose he proceeded to score england s first 16 runs lindwall dropped hutton from johnston s bowling before english batsman had scored johnston usually moved ball into right handed batsmen but on this occasion ball went straight on and took outside of edge of bat hutton had trouble dealing with lindwall and played and missed multiple times in deteriorating light hampered by lack of a sightscreen fingleton described it as probably hutton s worst effort in a test in a fidgety display hutton played loosely outside off stump and missed four times in one johnston over o reilly said hutton seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to gallows and that he was little more than a compared to hutton of 1938 o reilly p 77 hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of innings hutton and washbrook took score to 42 england s highest opening partnership of series thus far before former edged lindwall to johnson in slips and was out for 13 edrich and washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls and latter was hit several times on fingers while fending down lindwall s bouncers having decided to avoid hook shot edrich ducked so low and so quickly that top of stumps could often be seen behind his back soon after toshack removed both edrich and washbrook in quick succession to leave england at 65 3 edrich having played only one scoring shot in preceding 20 minutes arlott p 71 edged an overpitched delivery to johnson low down in slips and decided to stand his ground after catch was taken batsman thought he may have hit a bump ball into ground before it flew to johnson but umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out tallon then took a difficult catch to remove washbrook washbrook inside edged a toshack full toss directly downwards at tallon s ankle bradman described catch as miraculous because tallon had to reach so low so quickly in order to take catch perry 2001 p 199 up until this point washbrook had been beginning to find some fluency and was striking ball confidently arlott speculated that edrich and washbrook may have lost concentration after lindwall was replaced by toshack lulled into a false sense of security once australia s leading bowler was no longer operating however compton and dollery added 41 in last 30 minutes to take england to 106 3 at close of play compton was on 29 and dollery 21 latter was particularly fluent in scoring on leg side and he defied australian bowlers resolutely o reilly p 78 lindwall was brought back to put pressure on dollery having bowled him for a duck in first innings but batsman had already been in middle for a short period and played pace bowling with more assurance in second innings 29 june day five final day started poorly for england after failing to hit a leg stump full toss for a boundary from first ball of day o reilly p 79 compton edged johnston to a diving miller at second slip from second ball of morning compton had aimed a square drive but delivery was johnston s variation ball which went away instead of into batsman it took outside edge and flew to a diving miller who knocked ball upwards before falling on his back and completing catch as ball went down fingleton p 122 compton stood his ground and waited for umpire to confirm whether miller had caught ball cleanly and was duly given out by official o reilly described miller s effort as perhaps very best slips catch of whole series and a real match winner england had lost a wicket without adding to their overnight total yardley and dollery took score to 133 before toshack bowled former for 11 he trapped new man coxon two balls later in same over for a duck leaving england at 133 6 coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery which hit him in front of stumps and prompted a loud lbw appeal and did same thing to next ball during this spell toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs but was taken off as bradman wanted to take new ball and utilise lindwall and johnston in meantime dollery had continued to bat effectively watching ball closely onto his bat and scoring three leg side boundaries from johnston s bowling eight runs after coxon s dismissal dollery shaped to duck a lindwall bouncer but it skidded through low and bowled him lindwall bowled laker without scoring later in same over to leave england at 141 8 evans continued to resist stubbornly remaining 24 not out as england were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409 run victory perry 2005 pp 240 241 johnston had bedser caught by hassett for nine before wright hit toshack to lindwall for four toshack ended innings with 5 40 while lindwall and johnston took 3 61 and 2 62 respectively dominance of australia s three man seam attack was such that off spinner johnson bowled only two of 78 1 overs arlott said that while toshack had best figures lindwall was pivotal figure he said that when lindwall so patently disturbed hutton he struck a blow at morale of english batting that was never overcome arlott p 75 o reilly said england s second innings had developed into an undignified scramble and had allowed australian bowlers to pick up wickets as though they were playing against a weak county team o reilly p 80 he blamed low standards of county cricket for allowing english batsmen to accumulate large tallies of runs easily while not testing them against formidable bowling o reilly said they had become soft after many matches against weak opposition which had not forced them to concentrate as intensely as they would have had to in test cricket o reilly p 81 gross attendance was 132 000 and receipts were ps43 000 a record for a test in england allen pp 106 107 a report by r j hayter aftermath wisden s verdict was that this convincing victory confirmed first test realisations of australia s clear superiority at all points only on first day did england provide comparable opposition and their selectors must have been very disappointed at lack of determination by some of batsmen against an attack again below full strength australia were better team in batting bowling fielding and tactics but england could not complain of lack of opportunities to wrest initiative bowes considered england s attacking policy to be a failure and that unlike first test there were no saving graces bowes pp 189 190 main talking point after test was controversial omission of england s leading batsman hutton for third test reason was said to be hutton s struggles with lindwall s short pitched bowling in second test perry 2001 p 224 observers noticed hutton backing away from fast bowlers english selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on rest of side which was not in good batting form as it was a poor example from a leading batsman omission generated considerable acrimony and pleased australians who felt hutton was their most formidable opponent with bat former australian batsman jack fingleton pointed out that while hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in previous test fingleton pp 128 130 he also had a strong track record against tourists having made 52 and 64 for marylebone cricket club against australia in lead up matches a game in which no other englishman passed 35 and made 94 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three test innings during previous ashes series of 1946 47 fingleton p 126 hutton s position was taken by debutant george emmett who made only 10 and a duck in a rain shortened draw and was subsequently dropped for fourth test hutton s controversial exile thus ended after just one test however both e w swanton and bill bowes believed hutton to be a better batsman once he returned to side bowes p 190 he and washbrook put on 168 for first wicket first time england had put on more than 42 for opening stand during series as hosts went on to make 496 their highest score for series pair added another triple figure partnership in second innings despite this australia s batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on final day to win by seven wickets and take a series winning 3 0 lead events of second test also affected career paths of other players england s inability to cut down australians resulted in dropping of three of their bowlers wright laker and coxon after lord s test coxon s debut was his only test match something believed to be caused more by off field events than sporting merit there was a story that he punched compton whom he disliked and considered self important in dressing room but coxon always denied this however there was certainly an altercation and coxon was never selected again match was last ever test for brown who had struggled out of position in middle order scoring 73 runs at 24 33 in three test innings during season he had scored centuries on his previous test outings at lord s in 1934 and 1938 but third visit proved to be end of his international career cashman et al pp 37 40 after historic win in fourth test australia had five tour matches before final test they won three while two ended in rain curtailed draws fingleton pp 190 210 australia completed series in style with an innings victory in fifth test at oval to complete a 4 0 result fifth test was last international match and tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil bradman s aim of going through tour undefeated apart from two matches that were washed out after australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200 bradman s men had little difficulty winning remaining five fixtures by an innings they thus became first touring test team to complete an english season undefeated earning themselves sobriquet invincibles harte and whimpress p 405 see also notes references category
