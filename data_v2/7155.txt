true flies are insects of order diptera name being derived from greek di di two and pteron pteron wings insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres which act as high speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1 000 000 species including horse flies crane flies hoverflies and others although only about 125 000 species have been described flies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eyes and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking mosquitoes black flies and robber flies or for lapping and sucking in other groups their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces flies undergo complete metamorphosis eggs are laid on larval food source and larvae which lack true limbs develop in a protected environment often inside their food source pupa is a tough capsule from which adult emerges when ready to do so flies mostly have short lives as adults diptera is one of major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance flies are important pollinators second only to bees and their hymenopteran relatives flies may have been among evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination fruit flies are used as model organisms in research but less mosquitoes are vectors for malaria dengue west nile fever yellow fever encephalitis and other infectious diseases and houseflies commensal with humans all over world spread food borne illnesses flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of world where they can occur in large numbers buzzing and settling on skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids larger flies such as tsetse flies and cause significant economic harm to cattle blowfly larvae known as gentles and other dipteran larvae known more generally as maggots are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals they are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds taxonomy and phylogeny relationships to other insects dipterans are insects that undergo radical metamorphosis they belong to mecopterida alongside mecoptera siphonaptera lepidoptera and trichoptera possession of a single pair of wings distinguishes most true flies from other insects with fly in their names however some true flies such as hippoboscidae louse flies have become secondarily wingless cladogram represents current consensus view thumb right upright 0 7 fossil nematoceran in dominican amber psychodidae early miocene c 20 million years ago relationships between fly subgroups and families thumb left upright 0 7 fossil brachyceran in baltic amber lower eocene c 50 million years ago first true dipterans known are from middle triassic around 240 million years ago and they became widespread during middle and late triassic modern flowering plants did not appear until cretaceous around 140 million years ago so original dipterans must have had a different source of nutrition other than nectar based on attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets it has been suggested that they may have fed on honeydew produced by sap sucking bugs which were abundant at time and dipteran mouthparts are well adapted to softening and lapping up crusted residues basal clades in diptera include and enigmatic three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on fossil record many new species of lower diptera developed in triassic about 220 million years ago many lower brachycera appeared in jurassic some 180 million years ago a third radiation took place among schizophora at start of paleogene 66 million years ago phylogenetic position of diptera has been controversial monophyly of holometabolous insects has long been accepted with main orders being established as lepidoptera coleoptera hymenoptera and diptera and it is relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties diptera is widely thought to be a member of mecopterida along with lepidoptera butterflies and moths trichoptera caddisflies siphonaptera fleas mecoptera scorpionflies and possibly strepsiptera twisted wing flies diptera has been grouped with siphonaptera and mecoptera in but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies diptera were traditionally broken down into two suborders nematocera and brachycera distinguished by differences in antennae nematocera are identified by their elongated bodies and many segmented often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae b b 1964 trans inst acad sci ussr moscow v 100 subsequent studies have identified nematocera as being non monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in nematocera construction of a phylogenetic tree has been subject of ongoing research following cladogram is based on flytree project abbreviations used in cladogram cal cyc ere mus muscomorpha sch schizophora tab diversity thumb gauromydas heros is largest fly in world flies are often abundant and are found in almost all terrestrial habitats in world apart from antarctica they include many familiar insects such as house flies blow flies mosquitoes gnats black flies midges and fruit flies more than 150 000 have been formally described and actual species diversity is much greater with flies from many parts of world yet to be studied intensively suborder nematocera include generally small slender insects with long antennae such as mosquitoes gnats midges and crane flies while brachycera includes broader more robust flies with short antennae many nematoceran larvae are aquatic there are estimated to be a total of about 19 000 species of diptera in europe 22 000 in nearctic region 20 000 in region 23 000 in oriental region and 19 000 in australasian region while most species have restricted distributions a few like musca domestica are cosmopolitan gauromydas heros with a length of up to is generally considered to be largest fly in world while smallest is which at is smaller than a grain of salt brachycera are ecologically very diverse with many being predatory at larval stage and some being parasitic animals parasitised include molluscs woodlice millipedes insects mammals and amphibians flies are second largest group of pollinators after hymenoptera bees wasps and relatives in wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators compared to bees they need less food as they do not need to provision their young many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies it is thought that some of earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies greatest diversity of gall forming insects are found among flies principally in family cecidomyiidae gall midges many flies most importantly in family agromyzidae lay their eggs in mesophyll tissue of leaves with larvae feeding between surfaces forming blisters and mines some families are or fungus feeding these include cave dwelling mycetophilidae fungus gnats whose larvae are only diptera with bioluminescence are also fungus feeders some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowers larvae of megaselia phoridae are almost omnivorous and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish mella walker fly are considered generalists and parasitoids of a variety of hosts larvae of shore flies ephydridae and some chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers sp chironomidae hot springs geysers saline pools sulphur pools septic tanks and even crude oil adult hoverflies syrphidae are well known for their mimicry and larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being scavengers inside nests of social insects some are agricultural pests some bite animals and humans and suck their blood and some transmit diseases anatomy and morphology flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies first tagma of fly head bears eyes antennae and mouthparts labrum labium mandible and maxilla make up mouthparts second tagma thorax bears wings and contains flight muscles on second segment which is greatly enlarged first and third segments have been reduced to collar like structures and third segment bears halteres which help to balance insect during flight third tagma is abdomen consisting of 11 segments some of which may be fused and with 3 hindmost segments modified for reproduction some dipterans are mimics and can only be distinguished from their models by very careful inspection an example of this is longicornis which is a fly but mimics a vespid wasp thumb left head of a horse fly showing large compound eyes and stout piercing mouthparts flies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eyes on sides of head and in most species three small ocelli on top compound eyes may be close together or widely separated and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour antennae are well developed but variable being thread like feathery or comb like in different families mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking as in black flies mosquitoes and robber flies and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups female horse flies use knife like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross shaped incision in host s skin and then lap up blood that flows gut includes large diverticulae allowing insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal for visual course control flies optic flow field is analyzed by a set of motion sensitive neurons a subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using optic flow to estimate parameters of self motion such as yaw roll and sideward translation other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing content of visual scene itself such as separating figures from ground using motion parallax h1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across entire visual field of fly allowing fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw ocelli are concerned in detection of changes in light intensity enabling fly to react swiftly to approach of an object like other insects flies have chemoreceptors that detect smell and taste and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch third segments of antennae and maxillary palps bear main olfactory receptors while gustatory receptors are in labium pharynx feet wing margins and female genitalia enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it taste receptors in females at tip of abdomen receive information on suitability of a site for ovipositing flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions and use them to home in on their hosts and many blood sucking flies can detect raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals some tachinid flies which are parasitoids of bush crickets have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts thumb a showing hind wings reduced to drumstick shaped halteres diptera have one pair of fore wings on mesothorax and a pair of halteres or reduced hind wings on metathorax a further adaptation for flight is reduction in number of neural ganglia and concentration of nerve tissue in thorax a feature that is most extreme in highly derived muscomorpha infraorder some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true functional wings in addition to any form of halteres are strepsiptera in contrast to flies strepsiptera bear their halteres on mesothorax and their flight wings on metathorax each of fly s six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa trochanter femur tibia and tarsus with tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres at tip of limb is a pair of claws and between these are cushion like structures known as which provide adhesion abdomen shows considerable variability among members of order it consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups tenth and eleventh segments having fused last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite connected by an elastic membrane in some females sclerites are rolled into a flexible telescopic ovipositor flight thumb fly in flight flies are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to presence of halteres these act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with wings they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to wing steering muscles and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly wings and halteres move in synchrony but amplitude of each wing beat is independent allowing fly to turn sideways wings of fly are attached to two kinds of muscles those used to power it and another set used for fine control flies tend to fly in a straight line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path directional changes are called and typically involve an angle of 90deg being achieved in 50 milliseconds they are initiated by visual stimuli as fly observes an object nerves then activate steering muscles in thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn detecting this within four or five wingbeats halteres trigger a counter turn and fly heads off in a new direction flies have rapid reflexes that aid their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low flies in genus respond in less than 5 milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight in past deer bot fly was claimed to be one of fastest insects on basis of an estimate made visually by charles townsend in 1927 this claim of speeds of 600 to 800 miles per hour was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by irving langmuir langmuir suggested an estimated speed of 25 miles per hour although most flies live and fly close to ground a few are known to fly at heights and a few like chloropidae are known to be dispersed by winds at altitudes of up to 2000 ft and over long distances some hover flies like have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurts males of fly species such as cuterebra many hover flies bee flies bombyliidae and fruit flies tephritidae maintain territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species while these territories may be held by individual males some species such as a form leks with many males aggregating in displays some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks many flies mate in flight while swarming life cycle and development thumb mating flies diptera go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages egg larva pupa and adult larva in many flies larval stage is long and adults may have a short life most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion fruit vegetable matter fungi and in case of parasitic species inside their hosts they tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to air apart from brachycera most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks brachycera however have soft gelatinized head capsules from which sclerites are reduced or missing many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax thumb left life cycle of stable fly showing eggs 3 larval instars pupa and adult some other anatomical distinction exists between larvae of nematocera and brachycera especially in brachycera little demarcation is seen between thorax and abdomen though demarcation may be visible in many nematocera such as mosquitoes in brachycera head of larva is not clearly distinguishable from rest of body and few if any sclerites are present informally such brachyceran larvae are called maggots but term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent and abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci this lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion decaying detritus or host tissues surrounding endoparasites nematoceran larvae generally have well developed eyes and antennae while those of brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified dipteran larvae have no jointed true legs but some dipteran larvae such as species of simuliidae tabanidae and have prolegs adapted to hold onto a substrate in flowing water host tissues or prey majority of dipterans are oviparous and lay batches of eggs but some species are ovoviviparous where larvae starting development inside eggs before they hatch or viviparous larvae hatching and maturing in body of mother before being externally deposited these are found especially in groups that have larvae dependent on food sources that are short lived or are accessible for brief periods this is widespread in some families such as in hylemya anthomyiidae larva moults to second instar before hatching and in phoridae females have incubation pouches and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by adult and it almost immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage tsetse fly as well as other hippoboscidae and exhibits viviparity a single fertilised egg is retained in oviduct and developing larva feeds on glandular secretions when fully grown female finds a spot with soft soil and larva works its way out of oviduct buries itself and pupates some flies like chironomidae reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis and some gall midges have larvae that can produce eggs pupa pupae take various forms in some groups particularly nematocera pupa is intermediate between larval and adult form these pupae are described as having future appendages visible as structures that adhere to pupal body outer surface of pupa may be leathery and bear spines respiratory features or locomotory paddles in other groups described as appendages are not visible in these outer surface is a formed from last larval skin and actual pupa is concealed within when adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough desiccation resistant capsule it inflates a balloon like structure on its head and forces its way out adult adult stage is usually short its function only to mate and lay eggs genitalia of male flies are rotated to a varying degree from position found in other insects crampton g structures of male diptera in some flies this is a temporary rotation during mating but in others it is a permanent torsion of organs that occurs during pupal stage this torsion may lead to anus being below genitals or in case of 360deg torsion to sperm duct being wrapped around gut and external organs being in their usual position when flies mate male initially flies on top of female facing in same direction but then turns around to face in opposite direction this forces male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of female or torsion of male genitals allows male to mate while remaining upright this leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects and much quicker flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during mating season ecology as ubiquitous insects dipterans play an important role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey in some groups larvae complete their development without feeding and in others adults do not feed larvae can be herbivores scavengers decomposers predators or parasites with consumption of decaying organic matter being one of most prevalent feeding behaviours fruit or detritus is consumed along with associated micro organisms a sieve like filter in pharynx being used to concentrate particles while flesh eating larvae have mouth hooks to help shred their food larvae of some groups feed on or in living tissues of plants and fungi and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops some aquatic larvae consume films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants many of parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hosts whereas many dipteran larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations majority of adults live above ground and are capable of flight predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates such as honeydew for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce skin insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing blood that flows in this process certain diseases can be transmitted bot flies oestridae have evolved to parasitize mammals many species complete their life cycle inside bodies of their hosts in many dipteran groups swarming is a feature of adult life with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations these insects are mostly males and swarm may serve purpose of making their location more visible to females anti predator adaptations thumb large bee fly bombylius major is a batesian mimic of bees flies are eaten by other animals at all stages of their development eggs and larvae are parasitised by other insects and are eaten by many creatures some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume them as part of a mixed diet birds bats frogs lizards dragonflies and spiders are among predators of flies many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps ants and some species of fruit fly resembling spiders some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous their young live and grow within nests of ants they are protected from ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members bee flies such as bombylius major are short bodied round furry and distinctly bee like as they visit flowers for nectar and are likely also batesian mimics of bees in contrast drosophila subobscura a species of fly in

maggots found on corpses are useful to forensic entomologists maggot species can be identified by their anatomical features and by matching their dna maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well defined times after death of victim and so do their predators such as beetles in family thus presence or absence of particular species provides evidence for time since death and sometimes other details such as place of death when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland thumb left maggots used as animal feed at london zoo some species of maggots such as blowfly larvae gentles and bluebottle larvae are bred commercially they are sold as bait in angling and as food for carnivorous animals kept as pets in zoos or for research such as
