johannes kepler kepler random house webster s unabridged dictionary december 27 1571 november 15 1630 was a german astronomer mathematician and astrologer he is a key figure in 17th century scientific revolution best known for his laws of planetary motion and his books astronomia nova harmonices mundi and epitome astronomiae copernicanae these works also provided one of foundations for newton s theory of universal gravitation kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in graz where he became an associate of prince hans ulrich von eggenberg later he became an assistant to astronomer tycho brahe in prague and eventually imperial mathematician to emperor rudolf ii and his two successors matthias and ferdinand ii he also taught mathematics in linz and was an adviser to general wallenstein additionally he did fundamental work in field of optics invented an improved version of refracting or keplerian telescope and was mentioned in telescopic discoveries of his contemporary galileo galilei he was a corresponding member of accademia dei lincei in rome http www bl uk catalogues aspx 022 assoc retrieved july 9 2017 kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology but there was a strong division between astronomy a branch of mathematics within liberal arts and physics a branch of natural philosophy kepler also

copernican system kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on july 19 1595 while teaching in graz demonstrating periodic conjunction of saturn and jupiter in zodiac he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios which he reasoned might be geometrical basis of universe after failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations even with extra planets added to system kepler began experimenting with 3 dimensional polyhedra he found that each of five platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs nesting these solids each encased in a sphere within one another would produce six layers corresponding to six known planets mercury venus earth mars jupiter and saturn by ordering solids selectively octahedron icosahedron dodecahedron tetrahedron cube kepler found that spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to relative sizes of each planet s path assuming planets circle sun kepler also found a formula relating size of each planet s orb to length of its orbital period from inner to outer planets ratio of increase in orbital period is twice difference in orb radius however kepler later rejected this formula because it was not precise enough caspar kepler pp 60 65 see also barker and goldstein theological foundations of kepler s astronomy

removal of bible exegesis and addition of a simpler more understandable description of copernican system as well as kepler s new ideas mysterium was published late in 1596 and kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597 it was not widely read but it established kepler s reputation as a highly skilled astronomer effusive dedication to powerful patrons as well as to men who controlled his position in graz also provided a crucial doorway into patronage system caspar kepler pp 65 71 though details would be modified in light of his later work kepler never relinquished platonist polyhedral cosmology of mysterium cosmographicum his subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for spheres by calculating eccentricities of planetary orbits within it in 1621 kepler published an expanded second edition of mysterium half as long again as first detailing in footnotes corrections and improvements he had achieved in 25 years since its first publication field kepler s geometrical cosmology chapter iv p in terms of impact of mysterium it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing theory proposed by nicolaus copernicus in his de revolutionibus orbium coelestium whilst copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book he resorted to ptolemaic devices viz epicycles and eccentric circles in order to explain change in planets orbital speed and also continued to use as a point of reference center of earth s orbit rather than that of sun as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse reader by diverging too much from ptolemy modern astronomy owes much to mysterium cosmographicum despite

features focused especially on earth and one on effects of heavens on earth to include atmospheric optics meteorology and astrology caspar kepler pp 85 86 he also sought opinions of many of astronomers to whom he had sent mysterium among them reimarus ursus nicolaus bar imperial mathematician to rudolph ii and a bitter rival of tycho brahe ursus did not reply directly but republished kepler s flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over what is now called tychonic system with tycho despite this black mark tycho also began corresponding with kepler starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of kepler s system among a host of objections tycho took issue with use of inaccurate numerical data taken from copernicus through their letters tycho and kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems dwelling on lunar phenomena and copernican theory particularly its theological viability but without significantly more accurate data of tycho s observatory kepler had no way to address many of these issues caspar kepler pp 86 89 instead he turned his attention to chronology and harmony numerological relationships among music mathematics and physical world and their astrological consequences by assuming earth to possess a soul a property he would later invoke to explain how sun causes motion of planets he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena by 1599 however he again felt his work limited by inaccuracy of available data just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in graz in december of that year tycho invited kepler to visit him in prague on january 1 1600 before he even received invitation kepler set off in hopes that tycho s patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones caspar kepler pp 89 100 prague 1600 1612 work for tycho brahe thumb tycho brahe on february 4 1600 kepler met tycho brahe and his assistants franz and at nad 35 km from prague site where tycho s new observatory was being constructed over next two months he stayed as a guest analyzing some of tycho s observations of mars tycho guarded his data closely but was impressed by kepler s theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access kepler planned to test his tycho s data see two views of a system from mysterium cosmographicum based on mars data but he estimated that work would take up to two years since he was not allowed to simply copy data for his own use with help of johannes kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with tycho but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and kepler left for prague on april 6 kepler and tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements and in june kepler returned home to graz to collect his family caspar kepler pp 100 08 political and religious difficulties in graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to brahe in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to archduke ferdinand to that end kepler composed an essay dedicated to ferdinand in which he proposed a force based theory of lunar motion in terra virtus quae there is a force in earth which causes moon to move caspar kepler p 110 though essay did not earn him a place in ferdinand s court it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses which he applied during july 10 eclipse in graz these observations formed basis of his explorations of laws of optics that would culminate in astronomiae pars optica caspar kepler pp 108 11 on august 2 1600 after refusing to convert to catholicism kepler and his family were banished from graz several months later kepler returned now with rest of his household to prague through most of 1601 he was supported directly by tycho who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against tycho s by then deceased rival ursus in september tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on new project he had proposed to emperor rudolphine tables that should replace prutenic tables of erasmus reinhold two days after tycho s unexpected death on october 24 1601 kepler was appointed his successor as imperial mathematician with responsibility to complete his unfinished work next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be most productive of his life caspar kepler pp 111 22 advisor to emperor rudolph ii kepler s primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to emperor though kepler took a dim view of attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict future or divine specific events he had been casting well received detailed horoscopes for friends family and patrons since his time as a student in tubingen in addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders emperor sought kepler s advice in times of political trouble rudolph was actively interested in work of many of his court scholars including numerous alchemists and kept up with kepler s work in physical astronomy as well caspar kepler pp 149 53 officially only acceptable religious doctrines in prague were catholic and but kepler s position in imperial court allowed him to practice his lutheran faith unhindered emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family but difficulties of over extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle partly because of financial troubles his life at home with barbara was unpleasant marred with bickering and bouts of sickness court life however brought kepler into contact with other prominent scholars johannes matthaus wackher

process of tabulating rudolphine tables kepler also picked up investigation of laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600 both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena such as unexpected shadow sizes red color of a total lunar eclipse and reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations through most of 1603 kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory resulting manuscript presented to emperor on january 1 1604 was published as astronomiae pars optica optical part of astronomy in it kepler described inverse square law governing intensity of light reflection by flat and curved mirrors and principles of pinhole cameras as well as astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and apparent sizes of heavenly bodies he also extended his study of optics to human eye and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by eye s lens onto retina solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics although he did suggest that image was later corrected in hollows of brain due to activity of soul finger origins of neuroscience p 74 oxford university press 2001 today astronomiae pars optica is generally recognized as foundation of modern optics though law of refraction is conspicuously absent caspar kepler pp 142 146 with respect to beginnings of projective geometry kepler introduced idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work he argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along line joining foci geometric form would morph or degenerate one into another in this way an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another a circle is formed as foci of a hyperbola merge into one another hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines he also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity thus having properties of a large circle morris kline

cycle of great conjunctions astrologers associated two previous such periods with rise of charlemagne c 800 years earlier and birth of christ c 1600 years earlier and thus expected events of great portent especially regarding emperor it was in this context as imperial mathematician and astrologer to emperor that kepler described new star two years later in his de stella nova in it kepler addressed star s astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to many astrological interpretations then circulating he noted its fading luminosity speculated about its origin and used lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in sphere of fixed stars further undermining doctrine of immutability of heavens idea accepted since aristotle that celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging birth of a new star implied variability of heavens in an appendix kepler also discussed recent chronology work of polish historian laurentius suslyga he calculated that if suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind then star of bethlehem analogous to present new star would have coincided with first great conjunction of earlier 800 year cycle caspar kepler pp

nova a new astronomy including first two laws of planetary motion began with analysis under tycho s direction of mars orbit kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of mars orbit using an equant mathematical tool that copernicus had eliminated with his system eventually creating a model that generally agreed with tycho s observations to within two arcminutes average measurement error but he was not satisfied with complex and still slightly inaccurate result at certain points model differed from data by up to eight arcminutes wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to data caspar kepler pp 123 128 in kepler s religious view of cosmos sun a symbol of god father was source of motive force in solar system as a physical basis kepler drew by analogy on william gilbert s theory of magnetic soul of earth from de magnete 1600 and on his own work on optics kepler supposed that motive power or motive species on motive species see lindberg genesis of kepler s theory of light pp 38 40 radiated by sun weakens with distance causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it koyre astronomical revolution pp 199 202 perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order based on measurements of aphelion and perihelion of earth and mars he created a formula in which a planet s rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from sun verifying this relationship throughout orbital cycle however required very extensive calculation to simplify this task by late 1602 kepler reformulated proportion in terms of geometry planets sweep out equal areas in equal times kepler s second law of planetary motion caspar kepler pp 129 132 thumb diagram of geocentric trajectory of mars through several periods of apparent retrograde motion astronomia nova chapter 1 1609 he then set about calculating entire

assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked caspar kepler p 133 finding that an elliptical orbit fit mars data he immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses with sun at one focus kepler s first law of planetary motion because he employed no calculating assistants however he did not extend mathematical analysis beyond mars by end of year he

begin a collaboration with italian astronomer giovanni antonio some of his other work dealt with chronology especially dating of events in life of jesus and with astrology especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of roeslin caspar kepler pp 178 81 kepler and roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter attacks while physician philip feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether and roeslin s work in particular in response to what kepler saw as excesses of astrology on one hand and overzealous rejection of it on other kepler prepared tertius interveniens third party interventions nominally this work presented to common patron of roeslin and feselius was a neutral mediation between feuding scholars but it also set out kepler s general views on value of astrology including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls while kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be evil smelling dung in which an industrious hen scrapes there was an occasional grain seed indeed even a pearl or a gold nugget to be found by conscientious scientific astrologer caspar

reply dissertatio cum nuncio sidereo conversation with starry messenger he endorsed galileo s observations and offered a range of speculations about meaning and implications of galileo s discoveries and telescopic methods for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology later that year kepler published his own telescopic observations of moons in de jovis providing further support of galileo to kepler s disappointment however galileo never published his reactions if any to astronomia nova caspar kepler pp 192 197 after hearing of galileo s telescopic discoveries kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from duke ernest of cologne koestler sleepwalkers p 384 resulting manuscript was completed in september 1610 and published as dioptrice in 1611 in it kepler set out theoretical basis of double convex converging lenses and double concave diverging lenses and how they are combined to produce a galilean telescope as well as concepts of real vs virtual images upright vs inverted images and effects of focal length on magnification and reduction he also described an improved telescope now known as astronomical or keplerian telescope in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than galileo s combination of convex and concave lenses caspar kepler pp 198 202 thumb one of

had to deal with accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother katharina in protestant town of that blow happening only a few years after kepler s excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of full fledged assault waged by lutherans against kepler his first publication in linz was de vero anno 1613 an expanded treatise on year of christ s birth he also

his own harmonic theory caspar kepler pp 264 66 290 93 kepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids including figures that would come to be known as kepler s solids from there he extended his harmonic analysis to music meteorology and astrology harmony resulted from tones made by souls of heavenly bodies and in case of astrology interaction between those tones and human souls in final portion of work book v kepler dealt with planetary motions especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from sun similar relationships had been used by other astronomers but kepler with tycho s data and his own astronomical theories treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them caspar kepler pp 266 90 among many other harmonies kepler articulated what came to be known as third law of planetary motion he then tried many combinations until he discovered that approximately square of periodic times are to each other as cubes of mean distances although he gives date of this epiphany march 8 1618 he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion however wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until 1660s when conjoined with christiaan huygens newly discovered law of centrifugal force it enabled isaac newton edmund halley and perhaps christopher wren and robert hooke to demonstrate independently that presumed gravitational attraction between sun and its planets decreased with square of distance between them westfall never at rest pp 143 152

motion were not immediately accepted several major figures such as galileo and rene descartes completely ignored kepler s astronomia nova many astronomers including kepler s teacher michael maestlin objected to kepler s introduction of physics into his astronomy some adopted compromise positions ismael accepted elliptical orbits but replaced kepler s area law with uniform motion in respect to empty focus of ellipse while seth ward used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant for a detailed study of reception of kepler s astronomy see wilbur applebaum keplerian astronomy after

various modifications against astronomical observations two transits of venus and mercury across face of sun provided sensitive tests of theory under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed in case of transit of mercury in 1631 kepler had been extremely uncertain of parameters for mercury and advised observers to look for transit day before and after predicted date pierre gassendi observed transit on date predicted a confirmation of kepler s prediction this was first observation of a transit of mercury however his attempt to observe transit of venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in rudolphine tables gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of europe including paris jeremiah horrocks who observed 1639 venus

history of science beyond his role in historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy kepler has loomed large in philosophy and historiography of science kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as jean etienne s 1758 histoire des and jean baptiste delambre s 1821 histoire de l astronomie moderne these and other histories written from an enlightenment perspective treated kepler s metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval but later romantic era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success william whewell in his influential history of inductive sciences of 1837 found kepler to be archetype of inductive scientific genius in his philosophy of inductive sciences of 1840 whewell held kepler up as embodiment of most advanced forms of scientific method similarly ernst friedrich apelt first to extensively study kepler s manuscripts after their purchase by catherine great

cosmology and its influence in 1930s and 1940s koyre and a number of others in first generation of professional historians of science described scientific revolution as central event in history of science and kepler as a perhaps central figure in revolution koyre placed kepler s theorization rather than his empirical work at center of intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world views since 1960s volume of historical kepler scholarship has expanded greatly including studies of his astrology and meteorology his geometrical methods role of his religious views in his work his

revolution he would be first astrophysicist in era of modern science debate over kepler s place in scientific revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments one of most
