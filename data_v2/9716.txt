trespass is second studio album by english rock band genesis it was released in october 1970 on charisma records and is their last album with guitarist anthony phillips and their only one with drummer john mayhew genesis turned professional in autumn 1969 and began to rehearse intensely and play live shows after several months of touring including a residency at ronnie scott s a club in heart of soho london they secured a recording contract with charisma records and entered trident studios in london in july 1970 to record trespass music marked a departure from more pop oriented songs as displayed on their first album from genesis to revelation towards folk flavoured progressive rock this ranged from light acoustic pieces with multiple twelve string guitars to heavier live favourite knife cover was first of several to be designed by paul whitehead featuring a knife slashed across cover shortly after recording phillips decided to leave group which almost caused genesis to split after discussions they agreed to carry on replacing mayhew with phil collins trespass was not a major success upon release it failed to chart in uk and us and it received some mixed reviews from critics but it was commercially successful in belgium which helped sustain band s career a reissue briefly charted uk top 100 in 1984 background and recording in august 1969 genesis decided to become a professional band founders vocalist peter gabriel guitarist anthony phillips bassist mike rutherford and keyboardist tony banks had been joined by drummer john silver they split from producer jonathan king and decided to write more complex material than straightforward pop on their first album gabriel recalled group wanted to explore and mix musical styles group bought new equipment including a bass guitar and a hammond organ and recorded songs in regent studios as a demo including white mountain and family which became dusk silver then left to study in us in september genesis played their first live shows as a professional band touring local club and university circuit with new drummer john mayhew mayhew oldest and most experienced musician came from a different background to rest of band phillips recalled that despite their efforts to make him feel comfortable drummer was unsure of his playing in early 1970 they secured a six week residency at ronnie scott s jazz club in soho london during which they were spotted by charisma records producer john anthony he persuaded label boss tony stratton smith to sign them group wanted to branch out from their earlier pop oriented style and write and perform songs that were unlike any other band at time rutherford later said that gigging was tough but a good way of getting music into shape two songs that made it to next album looking for someone and stagnation were recorded for a bbc session in february 1970 after several months of gigs genesis had enough material written in june they retreated to trident studios in london to record a new album john anthony joined them as their producer and engineer and songs were recorded on 16 track tape phillips remembered that recording was only slightly more sophisticated than from genesis to revelation and thought anthony disliked having someone drop in individual parts he remembered a session in which rutherford had to listen to several minutes of track before putting down a guitar part by which time he had become too nervous and played it incorrectly group had enough material to record two albums but felt some songs were not strong enough they selected strongest material for trespass recording took of month trying various ideas and rearranging songs to extent that charisma thought they had taken up residence in studio they worked well with anthony and later recalled that his contributions were important and helped shape album we were in genesis trying to incorporate acoustic and electronic music in course of same number gabriel recalled in 1982 at that time there were a number of groups trying to get pieces to change moods in that way i listen back now to it and some of it makes me cringe and some of it we could have done a lot better but i knew certain things were going in right direction but at time we were all learning capital radio interview with alan freeman broadcast october 1982 transcribed in gabriel fanzine white shadow 3 by editor fred songs songs on album originated from one or two members bringing along ideas to develop or group working out an arrangement as a whole banks later said that we had played live quite a bit and every song on album had been performed on stage we had a selection of at least twice as many songs as appeared on album and versions changed rapidly rutherford complained that songs had already been composed and arranged in advance and there was little opportunity to change their sound arrangement or direction in studio band drew from gabriel s soul influences along with classical pop and folk music and made regular use of phillips and rutherford s twelve string guitar playing gabriel was particularly fond of combined twelve string guitars and thought they gave group a more unique and innovative sound group s songwriting during this period often originated in pairs with phillips and rutherford and banks and gabriel developing songs separately and presenting them to group for further development album opens with looking for someone beginning with gabriel s vocal accompanied only by an organ later described as being idiosyncratic enough to set them apart from herd within seconds he came up with song which was then extended and developed by group starting with soul influences which move towards folk as it progresses coda at end of song was written by group as a whole paul stump wrote in 1997 that there is presence of a riff from i am walrus by beatles in song white mountain and dusk had been worked out by banks and rutherford before deciding to record album whole group worked on music for stagnation originally called movement that gabriel added lyrics to visions of angels was recorded for previous album from genesis to revelation but not used as band did not think any takes of it were good enough so it was re recorded for trespass it originated from 1968 a piano piece by phillips at a time when his piano technique was limited but could produce a plodding style similar to songs by beach boys and beatles it has a more straightforward verse chorus structure than some of other songs stagnation and dusk showed phillips and rutherford s combined twelve string sound along with banks taking a lead on piano organ and mellotron this subsequently became a trademark of early genesis rutherford later recalled there were around ten acoustic guitars on part of stagnation but they cancelled each other out in final mix gabriel described track as a journey song with its lack of a more typical verse chorus structure and variety of mood changes it presents at one point during its development song was around 13 minutes long before sections were removed or altered but introduction remained unchanged knife was written by gabriel and banks it was originally titled nice as a tribute to nice and organ on track was composed to resemble playing of nice keyboardist keith emerson as fans of group genesis were inspired to put together a heavier rock song which gabriel said was something more dangerous compared to their delicate acoustic numbers he added it was first peak of a darker energy that we discovered it lasted up to 19 minutes in concert but was reduced to 8 for album gabriel wrote lyrics as a parody of a protest song phillips later recalled that songs everywhere is here grandma little leaf going out to get you shepherd moss let us now make love and were ones that were not developed further in studio banks said that going out to get you was too long to fit on album as well as knife and latter song had to have a portion of it cut out to fit on lp aftermath despite describing recording sessions as pleasant and not considerably difficult phillips had become uncomfortable with band s musical direction and was unhappy about number of gigs which took away time to write complex material such as stagnation he also thought there were too many songwriters in group and it was difficult to get ideas across shortly afterwards matters came to a head and he quit group rutherford later recalled that phillips looked unwell during recording sessions and he worried that phillips s departure might mean end of genesis after group drove back from last gig in hayward s heath to gabriel s house in cobham they decided they would carry on in liner notes to genesis box set genesis archive 1967 75 banks claims let us now make love one of phillips s songs was not recorded for album because group thought it had potential of a single but following guitarist s sudden departure following album s completion it was never recorded in studio a live version was released on box set performed in february 1970 at same time group decided to replace mayhew with a more suitable drummer he was older than rest of band and considered an outsider not contributing much to writing and lacking confidence an urgent replacement was required to fulfil live dates to promote trespass phil collins auditioned and joined in august and album was released in october group could not find a suitable replacement for phillips so they resumed gigging as a four piece in late 1970 they appeared on television show disco 2 to promote album with phillips replacement mick barnard group mimed with gabriel singing live who recalled performance was disastrous artwork album cover was painted by paul whitehead who also did covers for band s next two albums cover showed two people looking out of a window at mountains which represented pastoral themes of some of songs whitehead had finished cover and then band added knife to running order feeling that cover no longer fit mood of album they asked whitehead to redo it when whitehead was reluctant to do so band members inspired him to slash canvas with an actual knife release trespass was first released in uk on charisma label in october 1970 in us it was first issued on abc s jazz label impulse knife was released as single split into two parts in may 1971 but did not chart album was reissued by main abc records label in 1974 then after mca records bought out abc it was reissued on mca label a sacd dvd double disc set including new 5 1 and stereo mixes was released in 2008 critical reception trespass sold 6 000 copies on its original release and helped band build up a live following knife was released as a single in january 1971 album charted at in belgium which led to band s first overseas concerts there in january 1972 album had a mixed reception by music press at time of its release jerry gilbert writing in sounds gave a positive review and singled out visions of angels and white mountain a review in melody maker said album was tasteful subtle and refined rolling stone printed an extremely brief but unambiguously negative review of 1974 reissue saying it s spotty poorly defined at times innately boring and should be avoided by all but most rabid genesis fans allmusic s later retrospective review was only slightly more forgiving summarising that album is more interesting for what it points toward than what it actually does they also commented that guitars are so low in mix that they are almost inaudible leaving banks s keyboard instruments to prominence they considered this troublesome because banks having a noticeable role isn t genesis that everyone came to know following band s growth in popularity in 1980s trespass
