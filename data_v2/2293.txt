dyspanopeus sayi is a species of mud crab that is native to atlantic coast of north america it has also become established outside its native range living in swansea docks since 1960 mediterranean sea since 1970s north sea since 2007 and black sea since 2010 it can reach a carapace width of and has black tips to its unequal claws it feeds on bivalves and barnacles and is in turn eaten by predators including atlantic blue crab callinectes sapidus eggs are produced from spring to autumn offspring reach sexual maturity following summer and individuals can live for up to two years closest relative of d sayi is d texanus which lives in gulf of mexico two species differ in subtle features of genitalia and last pair of walking legs description dyspanopeus sayi is a small crab similar in appearance to it reaches a maximum carapace width of with sexually mature females having a carapace or more across carapace is roughly hexagonal about 1 3 1 4 times as wide as long and strongly convex it has a finely granular surface and has a light covering of hair especially towards front and sides chelae claws are unequal right claw is stouter and left claw is narrower carapace is olive green to brown but tips of claws are black distribution natural range of d sayi extends from eastern canada to florida keys south eastern united states where it lives from intertidal zone down to depths of it tolerates a wide range of temperatures and salinities d sayi has also been recorded from a number of locations in europe first sighting was in swansea docks south wales united kingdom in 1960 and scientist who reported it e naylor believed there was no doubt that species had arrived through trans atlantic shipping first record from mediterranean sea was made in 1993 when species was discovered in venetian lagoon north eastern italy although it is thought to have been living there since late 1970s in 2007 d sayi was recorded from north sea coast of netherlands it was discovered in black sea in 2010 living in constanta harbour romania and in ebro delta of balearic sea western mediterranean sea in 2012 ecology thumb left bivalve mollusc chamelea gallina is a food item for d sayi in adriatic sea dyspanopeus sayi lives predominantly on muddy bottoms where it is a predator of bivalve molluscs in its native environment it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by atlantic blue crab callinectes sapidus it is an important predator of quahog mercenaria mercenaria in narragansett bay and of barnacle balanus in delaware bay in adriatic sea it has been observed to feed on striped venus clam chamelea gallina and introduced asian date mussel life cycle life cycle of d sayi begins with copulation which normally takes place shortly after female has moulted while her exoskeleton is still soft spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation and eggs are brooded on female s pleopods until they are ready to hatch females have been found carrying eggs from april to october in a study of crabs caught at gloucester point virginia in 1978 females were observed to carry between 686 and 14 735 eggs number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law extrapolation of power law suggests that largest d sayi females are capable of carrying over 32 000 eggs each at eggs can take only 9 or 10 days to develop and this increases to 16 days at temperatures of young crabs hatch as zoea larvae and pass through three further stages and one megalopa before becoming juveniles juveniles are thought to reach maturity in summer after they hatch total lifespan of an individual can be up to 2 years taxonomy species had been noticed by american zoologist thomas say and formed part of species he called cancer panope a junior homonym of cancer panope herbst 1801 which is itself a junior synonym of scaber fabricius 1798 in 1869 sidney irving smith described seven new species in genus panopeus including p sayi in addition to twelve species already placed in genus at that time common names for species include say s mud crab and say mud crab smith noted similarity of species to panopeus texanus which had been described ten years earlier by william stimpson and smith considered that two might be same species in 1880 john sterling kingsley and alphonse milne edwards independently synonymised p sayi with p texana which remained until mary j rathbun moved both taxa to genus and re established smith s taxon as a subspecies of n texana she argued that two taxa should be considered subspecies as hybrids between them occurred although specimens she saw are now thought to be d sayi in 1972 lawrence g abele re examined n texanus texanus n texanus sayi and n and concluded that they were all good species and so re elevated n sayi to rank of species in 1986 joel w martin and abele placed n texanus and n sayi in a separate genus dyspanopeus reaffirming their close relationship however p texana only occurs in gulf of mexico and can be distinguished from p sayi by form of fifth pereiopod last walking leg and that of male gonopod references category category crustaceans of atlantic ocean category crustaceans described in 1869
