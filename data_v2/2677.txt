thumb 200px a library book shelf in hong kong classified using new classification scheme for chinese libraries an adaptation of dewey classification scheme dewey decimal classification ddc colloquially dewey decimal system is a proprietary library classification system first published in united states by melvil dewey in 1876 originally described in a four page pamphlet it has been expanded to multiple volumes and revised through 23 major editions latest printed in 2011 it is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries oclc a non profit cooperative that serves libraries currently maintains system and licenses online access to webdewey a continuously updated version for catalogers decimal classification introduced concepts of relative location and relative index which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to order of acquisition rather than topic classification s notation makes use of three digit arabic numerals for main classes with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail using arabic numerals for symbols it is flexible to degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects chapter 17 in a library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in library on basis of its subject number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on library shelves consider as an example a book on network protocol it will be located at 004 62 after general networking books 004 6 shelf location is thus defined classification system is used in 200 000 libraries in at least 135 countries history thumb melvil dewey inventor of dewey decimal classification 1873 1885 early development melvil dewey 1851 1931 was an american librarian and self declared reformer he was a founding member of american library association and can be credited with promotion of card systems in libraries and business he developed ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at amherst college library he applied classification to books in that library until in 1876 he had a first version of classification in 1876 he published classification in pamphlet form with title a classification and subject index for cataloguing and arranging books and pamphlets of a library he used pamphlet published in more than one version during year to solicit comments from other librarians it is not known who received copies or how many commented as only one copy with comments has survived that of ernest cushing richardson his classification system was mentioned in an article in first issue of library journal and in an article by dewey in department of education publication public libraries in america in 1876 in march 1876 he applied for and received copyright on first edition of index comaromi 1976 p 88 edition was 44 pages in length with 2 000 index entries and was printed in 200 copies comaromi 1976 p 155 1885 1942 period of adoption thumb 165px 1885 dewey decimal classification second edition of dewey decimal system published in 1885 with title note that title makes use of dewey s reformed spelling in some areas comprised 314 pages with 10 000 index entries five hundred copies were produced editions 3 14 published between 1888 and 1942 used a variant of this same title dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for second edition in an introduction to that edition dewey states that nearly 100 persons hav spelling of have per english language spelling reform which dewey championed contributed criticisms and suggestions comaromi 1976 p 171 one of innovations of dewey decimal system was that of positioning books on shelves in relation to other books on similar topics when system was first introduced most libraries in us used fixed positioning each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on book s height and date of acquisition library stacks were generally closed to all but most privileged patrons so shelf browsing was not considered of importance use of dewey decimal system increased during early 20th century as librarians were convinced of advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons new editions were readied as supplies of previously published editions were exhausted even though some editions provided little change from previous as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand comaromi 1976 p 218 in next decade three editions followed closely on 3rd 1888 4th 1891 and 5th 1894 editions 6 through 11 were published from 1899 to 1922 6th edition was published in a record 7 600 copies although subsequent editions were much lower during this time size of volume grew and edition 12 swelled to 1243 pages an increase of 25 over previous edition comaromi 1976 p 315 in response to needs of smaller libraries which were finding expanded classification schedules difficult to use in 1894 first abridged edition of dewey decimal system was produced abridged edition generally parallels full edition and has been developed for most full editions since that date by popular request in 1930 library of congress began to print dewey classification numbers on nearly all of its cards thus making system immediately available to all libraries making use of library of congress card sets dewey s was not only library classification available although it was most complete charles ammi cutter published expansive classification in 1882 with initial encouragement from melvil dewey cutter s system was not adopted by many libraries with one major exception it was used as basis for library of congress classification system in 1895 international institute of bibliography located in belgium and led by paul contacted dewey about possibility of translating classification into french and using classification system for bibliographies as opposed to its use for books in libraries this would have required some changes to classification which was under copyright dewey gave permission for creation of a version intended for bibliographies and also for its translation into french dewey did not agree however to allow international institute of bibliography to later create an english version of resulting classification considering that a violation of their agreement as well as a violation of dewey s copyright shortly after dewey s death in 1931 however an agreement was reached between committee overseeing development of decimal classification and developers of french classification decimal english version was published as universal decimal classification and is still in use today comaromi 1976 pp 297 313 according to a study done in 1927 dewey system was used in us in approximately 96 of responding public libraries and 89 of college libraries comaromi 1976 p 321 after death of melvil dewey in 1931 administration of classification was under decimal classification committee of lake placid club education foundation and editorial body was decimal classification editorial policy committee with participation of american library association ala library of congress and forest press by 14th edition in 1942 dewey decimal classification index was over 1 900 pages in length and was published in two volumes comaromi 1976 p 376 1942 present forging an identity thumb right children being taught top level categories of dewey decimal classification system at a library in edmonton alberta canada in 1960s growth of classification to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use abridged edition but found full classification overwhelming dewey had intended issuing classification in three editions library edition which would be fullest edition bibliographic edition in english and french which was to be used for organization of bibliographies rather than of books on shelf and abridged edition comaromi 1976 p 381 in 1933 bibliographic edition became universal decimal classification which left library and abridged versions as formal dewey decimal classification editions 15th edition edited by milton ferguson implemented growing concept of standard edition designed for majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy needs of very largest or of special libraries comaromi 1976 p 345 it also reduced size of dewey system by over half from 1 900 to 700 pages this revision was so radical that an advisory committee was formed right away for 16th and 17th editions 16th and 17th editions under editorship of library of congress grew again to two volumes however by now dewey decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries with library of congress classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries chan 2007 pp 321 323 first electronic version of dewey was created in 1993 hard copy editions continue to be issued at intervals online webdewey

educational foundation a not for profit organization founded by melvil dewey managed administrative affairs ala set up a special advisory committee on decimal classification as part of cataloging and classification division of ala in 1952 previous decimal classification committee was changed to decimal classification editorial policy committee with participation of ala division of cataloging and classification and of library of congress comaromi 1976 p 416 melvil dewey edited first three editions of classification system and oversaw revisions of all editions until his death in 1931 may seymour became editor in 1891 and served until her death in 1921 she was followed by dorcas fellows who was editor until her death in 1938 constantin j edited 14th edition milton ferguson functioned

conveyed copyrights and control of all editions to lake placid club educational foundation a non profit chartered in 1922 comaromi 1976 p 286 online computer library center oclc of dublin ohio us acquired trademark and copyrights associated with dewey decimal classification system when it bought forest press in 1988 in 2003 dewey decimal classification came to attention of u s press when oclc sued library hotel for trademark infringement for using classification system as hotel theme case was settled shortly thereafter oclc has maintained classification since 1988 and also publishes new

study main divisions include philosophy social sciences science technology and history scheme comprises ten classes each divided into ten divisions each having ten sections system s notation uses arabic numbers with three whole numbers making up main classes and sub classes and decimals designating further divisions classification structure is hierarchical and notation follows same hierarchy libraries not needing full level of detail of classification can trim right most decimal digits from class number to obtain more general classifications chan 2007 pp 326 331 for example 500 natural sciences and mathematics 510 mathematics 516 geometry 516 3 analytic geometries 516 37 metric differential geometries 516 375 geometry classification was originally enumerative meaning that it listed all of classes explicitly in schedules over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects language and bibliographic forms for example a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics 9 for geographic treatment 04 for europe to create class 330 94 european economy or one could combine class 973 for united states 05 for periodical publications on topic to arrive at number 973 05 for periodicals concerning united states generally classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas such that number 5 represents country italy in classification numbers like 945 history of italy 450 italian language 195 italian philosophy combination of faceting and mnemonics makes classification synthetic in nature with meaning built into parts of classification number chan 2007 p 331 dewey decimal classification has a number for all subjects including fiction although many libraries maintain a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of author s surname each assigned number consists of two parts a class number from dewey system and a book number which prevents confusion of different books on same subject a common form of book number is called a cutter number which represents author and distinguishes book from other books on same topic chan 2007 p 333 362 classes from ddc 23 000 computer science information general works 100 philosophy psychology 200 religion 300 social sciences 400 language 500 pure science 600 technology 700 arts recreation 800 literature 900 history geography tables from ddc 23 t1 standard subdivisions t2 geographic areas historical periods biography t3 subdivisions for arts for individual literatures for specific literary forms subdivisions for works by or about individual authors subdivisions for works by or about more than one author notation to be added where instructed in table 3b 700 4 791 4 808 809 t4 subdivisions of individual languages and language families t5 ethnic and national groups t6 languages relative index relative index or as dewey spelled it index is an alphabetical index to classification for use both by classifiers but also by library users when seeking books by topic index was relative because index entries pointed to class numbers not to page numbers of printed classification schedule in this way dewey decimal classification itself had same relative positioning as library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to classification by catalogers or as an index to dewey classed library itself influence and criticism dewey decimal classification numbers formed basis of universal decimal classification udc which combines basic dewey numbers with selected punctuation marks comma colon parentheses etc adaptations of system for specific regions outside english speaking world include korean decimal classification new classification scheme for chinese libraries and nippon decimal classification japanese despite its widespread usage classification has been criticized for its complexity and limited scope of scheme adjustment in particular arrangement of has been described as archaic and as being biased towards an anglo american world view in 2007 08 maricopa county library district in arizona abandoned ddc in favor of book industry standards and communications bisac system one that is commonly used by commercial bookstores in an effort to make their libraries more accessible for patrons several other libraries across united states and other countries including canada and netherlands followed suit classification has also been criticized as being a proprietary system licensed by a single entity oclc making it expensive to adopt however book classification critic justin stands by dewey decimal system stating newer more advanced book classification systems are too confusing to understand for newcomers treatment of homosexuality in 1932 topics relating to homosexuality were first added to system under 132 mental derangements and 159 9 abnormal psychology in 1952 homosexuality was also included under 301 424 study of sexes in society in 1989 it was added to 363 49 social problems a classification that continues in current edition in 1996 homosexuality was added to 306 7 sexual relations which remains preferred location in current edition although books can also be found under 616 8583 sexual practices viewed as medical disorders however official direction states that use 616 8583 for homosexuality only when work treats homosexuality as a medical disorder or focuses on arguing against views of those who consider homosexuality to be a medical disorder if in doubt prefer a number other than 616 8583 treatment of religion subject of religion has been very heavily favored toward christianity with nearly whole 200s being used for christianity and only 290s being used for all other religions of which there are thousands while christianity is a popular religion with 33 of world subscribing to it islam has a very large following as well and has only ddc 297 to work with entire 200 section has been largely same since ddc 1 and it would likely be a large undertaking to completely rewrite this section particularly for individual libraries to adapt to despite topics such as islam having only a single digit associated with them there is adequate room in that number due to ability to expand beyond decimal point treatment of women topics of women have had bias in them as well as far as classification scheme but have been easier to edit than religion schema and changes have been made some changes that have been made have been on what items are side by side numerically those items that are side by side are related to each other in classification scheme for example topic on women used to be next to etiquette those two terms being next to each other would associate women with etiquette rather than etiquette being gender neutral this was changed in ddc version 17 see also books in united states
