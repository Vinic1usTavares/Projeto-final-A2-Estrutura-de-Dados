where it strikes paddle winner is first player to reach eleven or fifteen points depending on game settings development of rebound began in late 1973 as one of several variations they produced in 1974 on gameplay of successful pong 1972 atari s first game and fourth ever arcade game around same time atari launched kee games a subsidiary meant to produce clone games of atari s products and act as a competitor in order to expand into more distribution channels in same region than industry typically supported kee s first game released in march 1974 was spike a clone of rebound which added a spike button to game that made paddle jump up and attempt to bounce ball downwards instead of up in addition to base game atari sold a conversion kit to convert any atari two player pong variant into rebound and in 1977 rebound was included in video olympics for atari 2600 a collection of pong variants gameplay thumb left screenshot of gameplay two players are tied at 0 points net is at its lowest level and ball is falling from top towards left side rebound is a two player volleyball sports game in which players each controlling a paddle representing a person on either side of a volleyball net attempt to score points horizontal paddles are moved by players left and right on their side of net represented by a short dashed line ball represented by a square dot is dropped from top of screen in a parabolic arc if it hits a player s paddle it bounces in another arc according to where on paddle it hit bounces from closer to center are more vertical while those towards sides move mostly horizontally this method of changing angle of deflection is similar to mechanics of pong 1972 atari s first arcade game if ball reaches bottom of screen without being deflected by a paddle bounces on same paddle four times hits net or is deflected into side of screen then a sound is played and a point is awarded to player on opposing side after a point is scored ball is dropped from top of screen again every two times ball is bounced across net by players without a point being scored net is grows slightly higher up to ten times it resets in height when a point is scored two large numbers at top of screen record points for each player each game costs a quarter and machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game rounds can be set to play until a player reaches either eleven or fifteen points whenever a game is won game resets into its attract mode where paddles are stretched across screen allowing ball to bounce along to side and be re dropped indefinitely atari subsidiary kee games made a version of game named spike which was functionally almost identical with addition of a spike button this button made player s paddle jump into air potentially bouncing ball into a downward trajectory like a volleyball spike development thumb right 150px a spike arcade cabinet featuring a different cabinet than rebound but nearly identical graphics and controls with addition of two spike buttons rebound was developed by atari inc beginning in late 1973 final schematics are dated november 31 1973 and use code name volleyball 1973 was near beginning of start of arcade game industry after success of atari s pong 1972 first game by new company and fourth arcade game ever produced nascent industry was largely composed of variations on concept called ball and paddle games while atari created games with other gameplay types in 1973 and 1974 such as space race 1973 and gran trak 10 1974 it also created several pong like games rebound was a variation on that theme featuring controls and gameplay similar to pong with addition of gravity arcing ball and both paddles moved to bottom of screen rebound was released by atari in february 1974 with a release announcement on february 16 other atari ball and paddle games from 1974 include and both of which were variations on original pong gameplay arcade game market is split into manufacturers distributors and operators manufacturers like atari sell game machines to distributors who handle several types of electronic machines who in turn sell them to operators of locations in early 1970s distributors bought games on an exclusive basis meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer restricting manufacturer to only operators that distributor sold to atari in 1973 just over a year old and largely based on their hit first game pong felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games they could only contract with a limited number of distributors who would only buy a limited number of games per year to work around this atari set up a secret subsidiary company in september 1973 kee games which was intended to sell clones of atari s games in effect doubling their potential reach first such game by kee released in march 1974 was spike a clone of rebound with addition of spike button that made paddle jump up to attempt to knock ball downwards other than that addition it is functionally same game legacy rebound has been described by retro gamer as one of more notable pong variants despite this unlike many other games of time atari did not make a sequel game sales numbers are not available for rebound or spike additionally a table made in 1976 by ralph h baer in his book videogames in beginning containing sales numbers for most games of time period does not contain any numbers for two games in addition to stand alone game atari sold conversion kits which could modify any two player pong variant they produced into a rebound game kits included a circuit board to plug in to existing game and decal stickers to cover up original name on cabinets with rebound in 1977 rebound was included as one of games in video olympics for atari 2600 home video game console a collection of pong variants as volleyball references sources external links category
