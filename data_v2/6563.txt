in 2010 to live life and to be inspired by things again during her hiatus she killed sasha fierce alter ego used in her previous studio album as she felt she could now merge her two personalities she severed professional ties with father and manager mathew knowles who had guided her career since 1990s with destiny s child noting that decision made her feel vulnerable in an interview for complex beyonce expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio she intended 4 to help change that status commenting figuring out a way to get r b back on radio is challenging with 4 i tried to mix r b from 70s and 90s with rock n roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting i wanted musical changes bridges live instrumentation and classic songwriting on her website she wrote album is definitely an evolution it s bolder than music on my previous albums because i m bolder more mature i become and more life experiences i have more i have to talk about i really focused on songs being classics songs that would last songs that i could sing when i m 40 and when i m 60 beyonce also sought to make more artistic music rather than purely commercially oriented songs although much of 4s inspiration came from touring travelling watching rock bands and attending festivals album s early musical direction was influenced by nigerian afrobeat musician fela kuti whose passion for music motivated beyonce she worked with band from fela broadway musical based on kuti s life dj swivel one of 4s engineers later described how kuti s use of percussion and horns influenced track end of time

georgia six weeks later in may 2010 she asked swivel to work on entire project concerning his working relationship with beyonce he commented there was no we re doing this today it was a very kind of open project where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we d work on it was based on how she felt her mood and also her listening to demos that writers would give us with swivel she experimented with horns drums guitars and percussion instruments mostly inspired by fela sessions swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from fela project was moved to kma studios for a week and a half because roc mic was not large enough there they began recording i care best thing i never had and rather die young and completed party they recorded songs schoolin life 1 1 and start over at jungle city studios in new york msr studios was final new york city based studio used and where most of 4 was recorded only party and i was here were recorded entirely at

there and performed by jeff bhasker and shea taylor beyonce asked frank ocean to write and record i miss you at msr saying to complex jay z had a cd playing in car one sunday when we were driving to brooklyn i noticed his tone his arrangements and his storytelling i immediately reached out to him literally next morning i asked him to fly to new york and work on my record after listening to each song beyonce would often request addition of specific instruments leaving her production team to make sounds cohesive her vocals were recorded through an avalon design 737 preamp and compressed in a 1176 peak limiter with a 4 1 ratio after recording lead vocals for a track swivel cut them in different ways and he and beyonce picked best then recording backing vocals beyonce composed her own vocal

twelve tracks on standard edition and eighteen on deluxe edition three of which are remixes of run world girls critics viewed 4 as a major departure from beyonce s previous catalogue with a distinctive mellower sound album consists mostly of mid tempo r b songs with 1970s funk 1980s pop and 1990s soul influences second half was more eclectic exploring a variety of genres including hard rock reggae and adult contemporary guardian complimented album s divergence from layering of euro synths on pop step that characterize music of beyonce s contemporaries balladry of first half of 4 combines diverse vocal styles with use of live instrumentation 1 1 demonstrates beyonce s vocal flexing over magnificent guitar bombast and a soft backing beat while start over a mid tempo r b ballad uses a futuristic beat with electric elements and synthesizers i miss you with its layers of atmospheric keyboards ambient synthesizers and tinny 808 drums was sung in a half whisper to exhibit intense emotion i was here an understated pop r b ballad with indie rock inflections primarily concerns self reflection with dramatic vocals on other songs beyonce explores womanhood best thing i never had 4s fourth track was described as a moment of self realization and a female call to arms with vocals that allude to a wounded bird turned resilient lioness song is built on a piano riff and beefy bass drums dance for you conveys a more sexual tone through breathy vocals and blaring electric guitars it forgoes her typical empowerment themes in favor of sensual imagery and comfort with one s partner run world girls a female empowerment anthem reminiscent of beyonce s more contemporary work on i am sasha fierce uses an energetic sample of major lazer s pon de floor song incorporates layered most prominently a military marching drumbeat while beyonce s near chanted delivery encompasses her full vocal range tracks countdown and end of time were distinguished by their musical and lyrical experimentalism countdown was described as everywhere on genre map although predominantly dancehall led with a bristling brass arrangement its chorus describes a relationship by counting backwards from ten using a sample from boyz ii men s uhh ahh end of time s pulsating brass sound reminiscent of a marching band was heavily influenced by afrobeat musician fela kuti kuti s use of horns and percussion instruments was recreated and combined with elements of electronic music and synthesizers lay up under me is also built on retro horns featuring upbeat vocals a sound ryan dombal of pitchfork associated with michael jackson s 1979 album off wall other tracks were noted for their retro stylization rather die young is a throwback to 1960s doo wop and philadelphia soul with a slow tempo and modern drums party achieves a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth funk groove song is unique for its conversation like structure in which beyonce and guest vocalist andre 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties elements of prince s style was found on schoolin life and 1 1 schoolin life is an uptempo funk song with lyrics that advise listener to live life to fullest while cautioning them about consequences of excess chorus of 1 1 was compared to purple rain with themes of sadness and resentment song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion love on top was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone evoking work of michael and janet jackson its retro sound is marked by a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus title and artwork in an interview for billboard beyonce stated that despite having another concept
