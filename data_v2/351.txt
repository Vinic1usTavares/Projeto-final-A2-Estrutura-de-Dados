travelling exhibition was relaunched in 1998 for a two year tour of sweden new zealand and australia most of artifacts in exhibit had been confiscated by nazi germany for a planned museum to an extinct race but now belong to jewish museum in prague objects dating from early 17th to mid 20th centuries included silverwork pottery textiles paintings drawings and ritual and household items exhibition was noted for being a mixture of fine art folk art and anthropological study for irony by which fascists and communists had preserved merits of culture and for showing a continuity of culture across multiple social upheavals it was first major exhibition of judaica to be displayed in north america or australia with items rarely shown outside of synagogues international exhibit also served as a vehicle for publicizing existence and history of jewish museum in prague during its u s tour exhibit drew more than 550 000 visitors with a record breaking attendance of over 110 000 in its seven week run at smithsonian s national museum of natural history history of collection exhibit had its origins in jewish museum established in 1906 in prague one of oldest continuous jewish communities in europe museum was founded by historian salomon hugo lieben to preserve items from demolished synagogues he collected 1 000 ceremonial and folk art objects and 1 500 rare books in 1912 community provided a building that had belonged to a burial society and in 1926 museum received a larger building for growing collection success prompted other jewish communities to start their own museums and by 1940 collection included about 2 500 objects in 1942 nazi regime took over museum and wrote a new charter renaming collection central jewish museum and designating it as a repository for confiscated jewish property nazis prioritised museums functions as collection and storage of numerous hitherto scattered jewish possessions of both historical and artistic value on territory of entire protectorate owners of these artifacts were deported to extermination camps from personal possessions confiscated precious metals were initially melted down and manuscripts burned but sheer volume of material overwhelmed mechanisms of destruction such material was then transported to prague where museum s jewish curators were forced to catalogue thousands of items received each day reinhard heydrich nazi official in charge of protectorate of bohemia and moravia with its capital at prague sought to preserve and exhibit material as decadent barbaric and depraved to advance theory that jews were an inferior race which had to be exterminated nazi purpose in collecting and preserving so many jewish artifacts was to demonstrate greatness of nazi prowess in annihilating large jewish communities it was nazis intention to incorporate these and other items into a museum to an extinct race museum s jewish curators were set to work cataloguing between 140 000 and 150 000 artifacts ranging from wedding portraits and infant cradles to torah scrolls and hand embroidered synagogue fabrics materials had been seized by fascist regime from 77 297 moravian and bohemian jews who had been sent to death camps in words of art critic jo ann lewis a donor list without precedent in history of mankind between 1942 and 1945 incoming flow of artifacts filled museum s premises as well as those of eight other buildings and more than 50 warehouses jewish curators only one of whom survived war believed that preservation would become mute but compelling testimony of a prosecuted people according to historian david altshuler they quietly rebelled with hebrew text describing true use of items central jewish museum s only exhibition was a private showing arranged for schutzstaffel ss last items received by museum came from theresienstadt ghetto czech terezin which was liberated by soviet union on may 8 1945 this included clothing and secret possessions of camp s residents at its peak collection held about one million pieces about 150 000 remained after post war dispersal in particular between 1945 and 1950 several thousand prayer books and other ritual objects were distributed to estimated 50 jewish communities and prayer quorums that had been re established in bohemia moravia and slovakia however as many of these congregations disbanded some of artifacts were returned to museum s coffers in 1949 prague jewish community council of remnant jewish community in czech lands ceded control of museum to communist regime on april 4 1950 it was renamed state jewish museum a cultural institution spread over six synagogues a ceremonial hall and a cemetery established as a memorial an historic preservation agency and research institute communists suppressed judaism forbade contact with foreign researchers and only exhibitions allowed were of children s drawings from terezin following soviet invasion of 1968 few new exhibitions were held although museum was czechoslovakia s largest tourist attraction annually drawing 700 000 visitors judaica collection was known only to scholars in field following 1989 velvet revolution control of museum and its collection was returned to jewish community exhibit history right thumb jewish museum in prague idea for exhibit was born in 1968 when u s congressman charles a descendant of czech catholic immigrants and his jewish aide mark e talisman visited prague on a mission of east west understanding during cold war in that era only a small selection of museum s collection was on display but two americans were shown some of items museum had in its storage rooms according to talisman collection was over a thousand times larger than anyone had known what moved talisman most was that whole horror of holocaust was brought to life again when i realized that each carefully labeled and recorded artifact was attached to a person talisman worked for next 15 years to arrange for loan of a traveling exhibition other western countries and museums also sought an exhibition of collection first to obtain a loan from state jewish museum was whitworth art gallery at university of manchester u k in 1980 whitworth director charles reginald dodwell had spent eight years to negotiate an exchange of exhibitions and considered it his career highlight whitworth provided a loan from its permanent collection of pre raphaelites and related artists which was exhibited in bratislava now capital of slovakia and prague some months prior to loan from prague s judaica collection it was first show of collection in west and first time many of objects were publicly shown outside of czechoslovakia in meantime talisman had become chairman of project judaica and obtained government corporate and jewish agency support for a u s tour among obstacles was fact that in 1945 allies had taken czech gold bullion storing it in fort knox and promising to return it when czech government settled wartime claims once that issue was settled in 1982 arrangements for exhibition rapidly moved forward talisman recruited art historian anna cohn from national jewish museum b nai b rith in 1982 she joined smithsonian curatorial team and became project director for north american tour altshuler a professor of judaic studies also joined curatorial team 109 individuals and organizations donated a

reasons there is little pure art aside from a few portraits with most of objects being functional items made for a specific purpose objects have a familiarity in universal experiences of birth work family life and death salem writing for globe and mail described it as a collection of beautiful functional items with a relationship to a living culture with mixed opinions on whether show was fine art folk art or an anthropological display he noted richness and humanity of culture and its almost incomprehensible endurance in a study of how they lived rather than how they died nancy of ottawa citizen wrote that objects give a sense of stability and continuity despite many upheavals in community s thousand year history she felt that final exhibition area legacy of tragedy and transcendence which addresses holocaust showed a sense of unprecedented horror however she felt that religious items and children s drawings secretly made at to be most moving testifying to a continuity of culture
