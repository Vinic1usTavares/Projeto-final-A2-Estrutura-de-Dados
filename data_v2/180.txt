to draw another line of succession in ad 4 augustus adopted tiberius on condition that tiberius adopt germanicus suetonius lives of twelve caesars life of tiberius 15 this made tiberius heir of augustus and germanicus heir of tiberius like sons of agrippa it was intention of augustus that germanicus and drusus would rule together while this did place germanicus ahead of drusus in line of succession adoption served to make germanicus equal in rank to drusus and two were meant to progress through their careers on a similar path until it was time for them to rule cassius dio roman history lv 13 later that year drusus was married to his paternal cousin livilla to bring him closer to julians tacitus says she was unattractive as a child but grew up to be beautiful tacitus annals

their offices at same age and progressed through cursus honorum at same pace both held office of quaestor at same age both were exempted from holding praetorship they held their first and second consulships at same age and both were given proconsular imperium maius when they were sent to govern germania and illyricum respectively career thumb statue of drusus julius caesar from sardinia italy drusus first office was that of quaestor in ad 10 being politically inclined he was made a permanent member of senate committee augustus had founded in ad 13 to draw up senate s daily business in august of 14 his adoptive grandfather augustus died in his honor drusus read a eulogy before rostra at his funeral next month on 17 september senate met to confirm his father as princeps among his first acts as emperor tiberius instituted a priesthood of cult of augustus which members of imperial family such as drusus joined tacitus annals i 54 this wasn t his first religious post though as he had been a pontifex since ad 7 8 an important step to prestigious pontifex maximus since 14 may ad 14 he was a member of fratres as well drusus had little time to mourn death of augustus or celebrate ascendance of his father tiberius legions in rhine and illyricum were in mutiny they had not received bonuses promised to them by augustus and when it became clear a response from tiberius was not forthcoming they revolted tacitus annals i 16 17 on 17 or 18 september drusus was sent to deal with troops in illyricum and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon germanicus who dealt with situation on rhine cassius dio roman history lvii 6 drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate revolt in pannonia three legions in pannonia viii augusta xix and xv apollinaris were under command of junius blaesus who allowed his men a rest from military duties to mourn death of augustus tacitus annals i 16 there was a breakdown in discipline and soldiers stopped obeying orders as a result they soon became restless and lashed out against their officers including blaesus and a prefect named rufus tacitus annals i 20 having been dispatched with two praetorian cohorts drusus and praetorian prefect sejanus reached pannonian legions at on 26 september soldiers met with him upon his arrival and let drusus into their entrenchments soldiers were rowdy but as tacitus says their demands were a discharge from military service after only sixteen years down from twenty a reward for service an increase of pay to one denarius a day and that veterans not be detained under a standard however negotiations broke down and soldiers began stoning members of drusus party tacitus annals i 26 next morning a lunar eclipse before dawn convinced soldiery that their mutiny was doomed and order was restored by daybreak as a result drusus was allowed into camp by blaesus before an assembly of troops in which drusus commended controlled behavior of soldiery and promised to write a letter to his father addressing their demands if drusus letter was dispatched on 28 september it should have reached rome by 3 or 4 october having gained control of soldiers his next move according to tacitus was executing leaders of mutiny he sent out a search party into surrounding forest to kill those leaders not present for assembly having settled these matters drusus returned to rome tacitus annals i 28 30 first consulship and command of illyricum thumb left province of illyricum in ad 15 he held consulship alongside gaius flaccus it was this year that he hosted gladiatorial games in his and germanicus name which he enjoyed in such excess that it disturbed other spectators he reportedly carried out his duties as consul well although he was prone to violence and earned nickname castor from fighting an equestrian there was also an incident at a theater between praetorians and claqueurs actors in which drusus reportedly sided with actors preventing praetorian guard from punishing unruly actors in annals 1 77 tacitus says unruly behavior of actors and crowds were later addressed by senate which passed measures allowing praetors to punish riotous spectators such were his excesses that tiberius decided to make him governor of illyricum following year both to give him experience in war and bolster his popularity with troops perhaps also to keep him away from indulgences of city life tacitus annals i 76 for those reasons drusus was sent to illyricum with proconsular imperium maius and would be governor there from ad 17 to 20 since germanicus had left rhine in ad 16 german tribes that formerly fought alongside each other against romans had turned on each other two major forces in region marcomanni under king maroboduus and cherusci under arminius clashed and after an indecisive battle maroboduus withdrew to heart of his kingdom in forests of bohemia before that two tribes and had defected to arminius realizing his situation maroboduus requested roman aid it had been two years since refused to help romans against forces of arminius and so tiberius refused to send aid instead tiberius sent drusus to further roman interests at maroboduus expense as he knew marcomanni were vulnerable during summer of 18 drusus received intelligence from a former captive of maroboduus catualda that maroboduus was weak and that it was a good time to attack hence drusus led a powerful force into heart of marcomanni and stormed their royal stronghold maroboduus fled but was forced to seek asylum in rome which tiberius granted later catualda lost a battle against hermunduri and he too was granted asylum senate decreed that drusus be given an ovation for his success which he received on his return to rome on 28 may 20 heir to principate thumb 140px bust of germanicus while drusus was in illyricum his adoptive brother germanicus had died in syria of illness or poison on 10 october 19 death of germanicus made drusus new heir for which germanicus wife agrippina suspected murder she believed tiberius had her husband murdered to allow drusus to become his heir historian levick says this is unlikely given advancement of her son nero s career following year in ad 20 nero was brought into forum by tiberius and drusus to receive toga virilis he was also promised quaestorship five years in advance and was wed to drusus daughter julia later that year also on 10 october 19 his wife livilla had given birth to twin sons tiberius gemellus and germanicus whom he named after his adoptive brother tacitus annals ii 84 their birth was celebrated by his father who claimed that never before in history of rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as drusus and event was commemorated on reverse of coins tiberius had hoped that drusus would keep imperial family together and entrusted him with guardianship of germanicus sons nero and drusus he returned to rome in december and was present in march 20 when agrippina arrived with germanicus ashes he was also present for trial of gnaeus calpurnius piso who was posthumously found guilty for crime of maiestas treason on 16 december his father gave a eulogy for germanicus during a senate meeting and he gave a eulogy next meeting it was decided that their eulogies would both be inscribed in bronze that of tiberius for future generations but libellus eulogy of drusus to demonstrate devotion of drusus for his adoptive brother in a show of pietas piety several changes affected his father s reign following death of germanicus in addition to losing his adoptive son and heir tiberius lost a friend gnaeus piso whose family had been close supporters of principate since early days of augustus loss of germanicus and trial of piso dealt a significant blow to tiberius popularity and he came to resent role of princeps second consulship thumb left a bust of tiberius kept in romano germanic museum in cologne maintaining same interval of three years between germanicus and drusus first and second term as consul drusus was given consulship again in ad 21 which he held with his father hardship of last two years on his father had made him reclusive for tiberius drusus holding consulship was a welcome sight and with state of his health he retreated to campania leaving drusus alone in carrying out obligations of consulship tiberius retreat lasted about twenty months tacitus annals iii 31 as consul he took part in a number of senate debates his first chance to shine in senate came in dispute between ex praetor gnaeus domitius corbulo and lucius cornelius sulla cornelius failed to give his seat to at a gladiatorial show and incident sparked a debate between rights of age and defenders of tradition in which drusus argued a rapprochement in another it was proposed by caecina severus that wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in provinces caecina delivered a speech in support of bill followed with speeches by both valerius and drusus in opposition to it proposal was then abandoned not because of arguments made but because of intervention of an external force auctoritas of drusus same reason for later repeal of law lex tacitus annals iii 31 ab urbe condita xxiv 1 8 drusus then settled an incident involving abuse of protection afforded by icons of princeps in which emperor s images were being used to shield guilty gaius cestius gallus brought a complaint into senate and claimed he was being abused under this safeguard by annia rufilla drusus was soon brought in to weigh on matter for senate felt only a member of imperial family could speak on such a delicate issue at request of many senators drusus had rufilla arrested and imprisoned tacitus annals iii 36 later he was given credit for condemnation of two roman equites and coelius cursor who had attacked praetor with false charges of maiestas it is unlikely that he himself was responsible for every verdict was given by senate with tiberius authority but this did not prevent his popularity tacitus annals iii 37 meanwhile there had been a rebellion in gaul led by and florus gauls with roman citizenship but rebellion was settled by gaius silius commander of legions of lower rhine without intervention of tiberius or drusus tacitus annals iii 40 46 after praising loyalty of legions in gaul tiberius defended statement he had made in 14 that neither he nor drusus should have to quit capital in response to every minor revolt in empire tacitus annals iii 47 thus consulship of drusus was successful but at end of year he fell ill his illness prompted equestrian clutorius priscus believing his life to be in jeopardy to write his elegy priscus had previously written an elegy for germanicus for which he was paid he thought that he would be rewarded again and so recited his elegy before an audience in preparation for drusus death an unamused informer brought matter before senate and it was voted that he be executed his execution was decreed and carried out without first consulting emperor this induced tiberius to introduce a law where senate must wait 10 days after such condemnations before making such decrees public as to allow him to learn of their decisions first following year tiberius asked senate of rome to grant drusus tribunicia potestas tribunician power which they responded to senate decreed statues shrines temples an arch and other customary honors upon princeps and his son thus in spring of ad 22 drusus received tribunicia potestas a distinction no senator could then aspire to as honor was reserved exclusively for emperor and his immediate successors only two men had been honored this way by augustus first marcus agrippa and then tiberius himself but tiberius had never bestowed power on germanicus it was then that drusus shared symbol of supreme power with his father downfall while it was officially drusus who was heir to tiberius in practice it was praetorian prefect sejanus who was second man in empire as early as ad 20 sejanus had sought to strengthen his ties to imperial family by his daughter to son of claudius claudius drusus tacitus annals iii 29 at time girl was only 4 years old but marriage was prevented when boy accidentally died a few days later of asphyxiation regardless his ambition to further expand his power was clear suetonius lives of twelve caesars life of claudius 27 by ad 23 sejanus had come to exert considerable influence over emperor such was his relationship with emperor that he was referred to by tiberius as socius laborum my partner in my toils tacitus annals iv 2 sejanus influence and position allowed him to be elevated to rank of praetor a position typically confined to members of equestrian order cassius dio roman history lvii 19 his supporters in senate were given advancement in their offices and statues were being erected in his honor such as one in theatre of pompey seneca younger essays to marcia on consolation xxii 4 6 by this time enmity between drusus and sejanus had reached a critical point drusus had struck prefect with his fist tacitus annals iv 3 and openly lamented that a stranger was invited to assist in government while emperor s son was alive tacitus annals iv 7 according to levick there is nothing to suggest bad relations between two before this point especially not as far back as 14 during their expedition to pannonia she says however it may have been clash between theatrical claqueurs and praetorian guard in 15 that began quarrel but not enough is known to say for certain of more concern to drusus was perhaps that in 20 his father mentioned sejanus to senate in terms that treated him as his partner in power for drusus heir of that exact position this was a legitimate cause for concern at time tiberius was in his sixties so there was a realistic possibility of drusus succeeding his father in near future in account of tacitus sejanus began plotting against drusus in secrecy to secure his position after seducing drusus wife livilla sejanus convinced her that he loved her and went as far as to divorce his own wife apicata they involved livilla s physician eudemus whom they met in secret for some time with help of livilla drusus was poisoned and died of what passed as natural causes on 14 september 23 tacitus annals iv 8 cassius dio says actions of sejanus were revealed in a letter by apicata following his death in october 31 cassius dio roman history lviii 11 post mortem thumb left 120px reconstructed bust of emperor gaius caligula unlike germanicus drusus was given a full funeral and his body was interred in mausoleum of augustus alongside other deceased members of imperial family like germanicus stories of poison abounded with sejanus as murderer modern historians like ronald syme believe that he may have simply died of illness his death not only devastated tiberius but also challenged future of principate tiberius still trusted sejanus and had no suspicion since drusus son was too young tiberius adopted his grandchildren by germanicus nero and drusus and recommended them to senate suetonius lives of twelve caesars life of tiberius 54 1 2 nero was given office of quaestor five years in advance and was married to julia livia daughter of drusus to combine families of both possible successors however neither would live to succeed tiberius by 26 emperor had withdrawn from politics altogether and moved to capri leaving management of empire to sejanus who then began eliminating other members of imperial family in 28 29 nero was exiled to island of ponza as an enemy of state germanicus son drusus was imprisoned within dungeon under imperial palace on palatine hill where he starved to death not long after nero died in exile in 33 sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in october 31 exact reasons for which remain unclear on 26 october 31 just eight days after his death his wife apicata committed suicide according to cassius dio she left a message for emperor his son had been murdered by his wife livilla and her lover sejanus story should be read with caution levick says that sejanus must have murdered drusus in self defense because only tiberius stood between praetorian prefect and end of his career at hands of drusus furthermore he says it is even less likely that livilla would have been complicit in destruction of her family key to her children s future levick dismisses accusation of apicata as revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another deaths of germanicus oldest sons elevated his
