found that lengthening hull as was done in earlier led to longitudinal weakness her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside she also carried less armour than earlier class and was nearly a knot slower however as she was built to serve in distant waters
