just one man that s really a true american george lincoln rockwell i know that he hates commies cus he picketed movie exodus after exhausting possibilities of new places to find communists narrator begins to investigate himself in bob dylan prophet mystic poet seth rogovoy wonders why picketing exodus would indicate anti communist tendencies rogovoy theorizes that dylan could be referencing association between jews and communism or fact that exodus was scripted by dalton trumbo one of hollywood ten who were blacklisted for being communists rogovoy also notes that song s reference to exodus illustrates dylan s love of that film singer would later introduce performances of all along watchtower with a snippet of theme from exodus by ernest gold a writer for pbs interpreted song as being about importance of freedom of speech david e kaufman says in sixties american celebrity and jewish identity that talkin john birch society blues includes some of dylan s few explicit references to his own jewishness though none of its lines are exactly a ringing endorsement of his identity as a jew critical reception left thumb upright scott beauchamp compared song s narrator to people who call president donald trump a fascist 150px joe lynch of billboard said that while dylan is not exactly weird al yankovic or tom lehrer he has given us many wry witty and hilariously outlandish lyrics over years and listed song s line about betsy ross as one of funniest in dylan s discography amanda petrusich of pitchfork wrote that infamous song exemplified that dylan s comedic timing was at its apex in 64 growling perfect punchlines i heard some footsteps by front porch door so i grabbed my shotgun from floor i snuck around house with a huff and a hiss saying hands up you communist it was mailman he punched me out every single time pbs called song a prime example of how dylan s early 60s songs often have a whimsical touch a sort of audio camouflage for radical content of lyrics houston chronicle chris gray felt that talkin john birch society blues prefigures later satirical songs like green day s holiday st vincent s los ageless and kendrick lamar s humble tim murphy of progressive publication mother jones wrote in 2010 that talkin john birch paranoid blues seemed especially relevant as john birch society was allowed to participate in that year s conservative political action conference and had been embraced by ron paul murphy said that given society s newfound relevance perhaps dylan should have played song when he performed at white house earlier that year in a 2017 article for american conservative scott beauchamp writes that track is a great example of dylan skewering diffuse paranoia of time by lending articulation to logic of a situation beauchamp also opined that half a century later humor of this muddy paranoid thinking persists albeit in reverse political polarity wherein people will incorrectly use term fascist to refer to conservatives president donald trump or anything they dislike he added that definition of fascism should be deeply grounded in historical and political specificity lest we come to believe that what made nazis fascist was their rude demeanor or failure to vote for hillary clinton ed sullivan show controversy talkin john birch paranoid blues was at center of a controversy that brought national attention to dylan and
