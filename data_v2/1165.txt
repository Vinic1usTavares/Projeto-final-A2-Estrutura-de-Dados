rotavirus is a genus of double stranded rna viruses in family rotaviruses are most common cause of diarrhoeal disease among infants and young children nearly every child in world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by age of five immunity develops with each infection so subsequent infections are less severe adults are rarely affected there are nine species of genus referred to as a b c d e f g h and i rotavirus a most common species causes more than 90 of rotavirus infections in humans virus is transmitted by faecal oral route it infects and damages cells that line small intestine and causes gastroenteritis which is often called stomach flu despite having no relation to influenza although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by ruth bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children its importance has historically been underestimated within public health community particularly in developing countries in addition to its impact on human health rotavirus also infects animals and is a pathogen of livestock rotaviral enteritis is usually an easily managed disease of childhood but in 2013 rotaviruses caused 37 percent of deaths of children from diarrhoea and 215 000 deaths worldwide and almost two million more became severely ill most of these deaths occurred in developing countries in united states before initiation of rotavirus vaccination programme in 2000s rotavirus caused about 2 7 million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children almost 60 000 hospitalisations and around 37 deaths each year following rotavirus vaccine introduction in united states hospitalisation rates have fallen significantly public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing oral rehydration therapy for infected children and vaccination to prevent disease incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies virology types of rotavirus there are nine species of rotavirus referred to as a b c d e f g h and i humans are primarily infected by species rotavirus a a e species cause disease in other animals species e and h in pigs d f and g in birds and i in cats within rotavirus a there are different strains called serotypes as with influenza virus a dual classification system is used based on two proteins on surface of virus glycoprotein vp7 defines g serotypes and protease sensitive protein vp4 defines p serotypes because two genes that determine g types and p types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses different combinations are found a whole genome genotyping system has been established for rotavirus a which has been used to determine origin of atypical strains prevalence of individual g types and p types varies between and within countries and years structure genome of rotaviruses consists of 11 unique double helix molecules of rna dsrna which are 18 555 nucleotides in total each helix or segment is a gene numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size each gene codes for one protein except genes 9 which codes for two rna is surrounded by a three layered icosahedral protein capsid viral particles are up to 76 5 nm in diameter and are not enveloped proteins thumb a simplified diagram of location of rotavirus structural proteins alt a cut up image of a single rotavirus particle showing rna molecules surrounded by vp6 protein and this in turn surrounded by vp7 protein v4 protein protrudes from surface of spherical there are six viral proteins vps that form virus particle virion these structural proteins are called vp1 vp2 vp3 vp4 vp6 and vp7 in addition to vps there are six nonstructural proteins that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus these are called nsp1 nsp2 nsp3 nsp4 nsp5 and nsp6 at least six of twelve proteins encoded by rotavirus genome bind rna role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood their functions are thought to be related to rna synthesis and packaging in virion mrna transport to site of genome replication and mrna translation and regulation of gene expression structural proteins thumb electron micrograph of gold nanoparticles attached to rotavirus small dark circular objects are gold nanoparticles coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for rotavirus protein vp6 alt an electron micrograph of many rotavirus particles two of which have several smaller black spheres which appear to be attached to them is located in core of virus particle and is an rna polymerase enzyme in an infected cell this enzyme produces mrna transcripts for synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of rotavirus genome rna segments for newly produced virus particles vp2 forms core layer of virion and binds rna genome vp3 is part of inner core of virion and is an enzyme called transferase this is a capping enzyme that catalyses formation of 5 cap in post transcriptional modification of mrna cap stabilises viral mrna by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases vp4 is on surface of virion that protrudes as a spike it binds to molecules on surface of cells called receptors and drives entry of virus into cell vp4 has to be modified by protease enzyme trypsin which is found in gut into and vp8 before virus is infectious vp4 determines how virulent virus is and it determines p type of virus in humans there is an association between blood group secretor status and susceptibility to infection non seem resistant to infection by types p 4 and p 8 indicating that blood group antigens are receptors for these genotypes vp6 forms bulk of capsid it is highly antigenic and can be used to identify rotavirus species this protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus a infections vp7 is a glycoprotein that forms outer surface of virion apart from its structural functions it determines g type of strain and along with vp4 is involved in immunity to infection nonstructural viral proteins nsp1 product of gene 5 is a nonstructural rna binding protein nsp1 also blocks interferon response part of innate immune system that protects cells from viral infection nsp1 causes to degrade key signaling components required to stimulate production of interferon in an infected cell and to respond to interferon secreted by adjacent cells targets for degradation include several transcription factors required for interferon gene transcription nsp2 is an rna binding protein that accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and is required for genome replication nsp3 is bound to viral mrnas in infected cells and it is responsible for shutdown of cellular protein synthesis nsp3 inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mrna first nsp3 ejects poly a binding protein pabp from translation initiation factor pabp is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a 3 poly a tail which is found on most host cell transcripts second nsp3 inactivates by stimulating its phosphorylation efficient translation of rotavirus mrna which lacks 3 poly a tail does not require either of these factors nsp4 is a viral enterotoxin that induces diarrhoea and was first viral enterotoxin discovered nsp5 is encoded by genome segment 11 of rotavirus a in virus infected cells nsp5 accumulates in viroplasm nsp6 is a nucleic acid binding protein and is encoded by gene 11 from an out of phase open reading frame rotavirus genes and proteins

thumb a simplified drawing of rotavirus replication cycle stages are 1 attachment of virus to host cells which is mediated by vp4 and vp7 2 penetration of cell by virus and of viral capsid 3 plus strand ssrna synthesis this acts as mrna synthesis which is mediated by vp1 vp3 and vp2 4 formation of viroplasm viral rna packaging and minus strand rna synthesis and formation of double layered virus particles 5 virus particle maturation and release of progeny virions virus enters cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome proteins in third layer vp7 and vp4 spike disrupt membrane of endosome creating a difference in calcium concentration this causes breakdown of vp7 into single protein subunits leaving vp2 and vp6 protein coats around viral dsrna forming a double layered particle dlp eleven dsrna strands remain within protection of two protein shells and viral rna dependent rna polymerase creates mrna transcripts of double stranded viral genome by remaining in core viral rna evades innate host immune responses including rna interference that are triggered by presence of double stranded rna during infection rotaviruses produce mrna for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication most of rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm where rna is replicated and dlps are assembled in viroplasm positive sense viral rnas that are used as templates for synthesis of viral genomic dsrna are protected from induced degradation viroplasm is formed around cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins nsp5 and nsp2 inhibition of nsp5 by rna interference in vitro results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication dlps migrate to endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third outer layer formed by vp7 and vp4 progeny viruses are released from cell by lysis transmission right thumb rotaviruses in faeces of an infected child alt many rotavirus particles packed together which all look similar rotaviruses are transmitted by faecal oral route via contact with contaminated hands surfaces and objects and possibly by respiratory route viral diarrhoea is highly contagious faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person rotaviruses are stable in environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1 5 infectious particles per us gallon viruses survive between 9 and 19 days sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus as incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar signs and symptoms rotaviral enteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by nausea vomiting watery diarrhoea and low grade fever once a child is infected by virus there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear period of illness is acute symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea dehydration is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens and is most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection rotavirus a infections can occur throughout life first usually produces symptoms but subsequent infections are typically mild or asymptomatic as immune system provides some protection consequently symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards 45 years of age most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age elderly and those with immunodeficiency due to immunity acquired in childhood most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain transmission of infection in community there is some evidence to suggest blood group secretor status and predominant bacteria in gut can impact on susceptibility to infection by rotaviruses disease mechanisms right thumb electron micrograph of a rotavirus infected top compared to an uninfected cell bottom bar approx 500 nm alt micrograph at top shows a damaged cell with a destroyed surface micrograph at bottom shows a healthy cell with its surface intact rotaviruses replicate mainly in gut and infect enterocytes of villi of small intestine leading to structural and functional changes of epithelium there is evidence in humans and particularly in animal models of dissemination of infectious virus to other organs and macrophages diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of virus malabsorption occurs because of destruction of gut cells called enterocytes toxic rotavirus protein nsp4 induces age and calcium ion dependent chloride secretion disrupts sodium glucose 2 transporter mediated reabsorption of water apparently reduces activity of brush border membrane and activates calcium ion dependent secretory reflexes of nervous system elevated concentrations of calcium ions in cytosol which are required for assembly of progeny viruses is achieved by nsp4 acting as a this increase in calcium ions leads to autophagy self destruction of infected enterocytes nsp4 is also secreted this extracellular form which is modified by protease enzymes in gut is an enterotoxin which acts on uninfected cells via integrin receptors which in turn cause and increase in intracellular calcium ion concentrations secretory diarrhoea and autophagy vomiting which is a characteristic of rotaviral enteritis is caused by virus infecting cells on lining of digestive tract infection stimulates production of 5 hydroxytryptamine serotonin this activates afferent nerves which in turn activates cells of brain stem that control vomiting reflex healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into small intestine milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection which can persist for weeks a recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows reintroduction of milk into child s diet due to bacterial fermentation of disaccharide lactose in gut immune responses specific responses rotaviruses elicit both b and t cell immune responses antibodies to rotavirus vp4 and vp7 proteins neutralise viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo specific antibodies of classes igm iga and igg are produced which have been shown to protect against rotavirus infection by passive transfer of antibodies in animals maternal trans placental igg might play a role in protection neonates from rotavirus infections but on other hand might reduce vaccine efficacy innate responses following infection by rotaviruses there is a rapid innate immune response involving types i and iii interferons and other cytokines particularly th1 and th2 which inhibit replication of virus and recruit macrophages and natural killer cells to rotavirus infected cells rotavirus dsrna activates pattern recognition receptors such toll like receptors that stimulate production of interferons rotavirus protein nsp1 counteracts effects of type 1 interferons by suppressing activity of interferon regulatory proteins and markers of protection levels of igg and iga in blood and iga in gut correlate with protection from infection rotavirus specific serum igg and iga at high titres e g 1 200 have been claimed to be protective and there is a significant correlation between iga titres and rotavirus vaccine efficacy diagnosis and detection diagnosis of infection with a rotavirus normally follows diagnosis of gastroenteritis as cause of severe diarrhoea most children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis are tested for specific diagnosis of infection with is made by finding virus in child s stool by enzyme immunoassay there are several licensed test kits on market which are sensitive specific and detect all serotypes of other methods such as electron microscopy and pcr polymerase chain reaction are used in research laboratories reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr can detect and identify all species and serotypes of human rotaviruses treatment and prognosis treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and most importantly management of dehydration if untreated children can die from resulting severe dehydration depending on severity of diarrhoea treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy during which child is given extra water to drink that contains specific amounts of salt and sugar in 2004 world health organisation who and unicef recommended use of low osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation and child s electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child prognosis is excellent probiotics have been shown to reduce duration of rotavirus diarrhoea and according to european society for pediatric gastroenterology effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as lactobacillus or saccharomyces or prevention rotaviruses are highly contagious and cannot be treated with antibiotics or other drugs because improved sanitation does not decrease prevalence of rotaviral disease and rate of hospitalisations remains high despite use of oral rehydrating medicines primary public health intervention is vaccination in 1998 a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in united states clinical trials in united states finland and venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100 effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus a and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects manufacturer however withdrew it from market in 1999 after it was discovered that vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for a type of bowel obstruction in one of every 12 000 vaccinated infants experience provoked intense debate about relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine in 2006 two new vaccines against infection were shown to be safe and effective in children and in 2009 who recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation a 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49 92 percent and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17 55 percent in mexico which in 2006 was among first countries in world to introduce rotavirus vaccine diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under in nicaragua which in 2006 became first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half in united states rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent vaccines may also have prevented illness in non vaccinated children by limiting number of circulating infections in developing countries in africa and asia where majority of rotavirus deaths occur a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post introduction impact and effectiveness studies of and have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants in september 2013 vaccine was offered to all children in uk aged between two and three months and it is expected to halve cases of severe infection and reduce number of children admitted to hospital because of infection by 70 percent in europe hospitalisation rates following infection by rotaviruses have decreased by 65 to 84 following introduction of vaccine globally vaccination has reduced hospital admissions and emergency department visits by a median of 67 rotavirus vaccines are licensed in over 100 countries and more than 80 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination almost half with support of gavi vaccine alliance to make rotavirus vaccines available accessible and affordable in all countries particularly low and middle income countries in africa and asia where majority of rotavirus deaths occur path formerly program for appropriate technology in health who u s centers for disease control and prevention and gavi have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence lower prices and accelerate introduction vaccine may prevent type 1 diabetes epidemiology left thumb seasonal variation of rotavirus a infections in england rates of infection peak during winter months rotavirus a which accounts for more than 90 of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans is endemic worldwide each year rotaviruses cause millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries almost 2 million of which result in hospitalisation in 2013 an estimated 215 000 children younger than five died from rotavirus infections 90 percent of whom were in developing countries almost every child has been infected with rotaviruses by age five rotaviruses are leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children is responsible for about a third of cases requiring hospitalisation and causes 37 of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5 of all deaths in children younger than five boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus infections in pre vaccination era rotavirus infections occurred primarily during cool dry seasons number attributable to food contamination is unknown outbreaks of rotavirus a diarrhoea are common among hospitalised infants young children attending day care centres and elderly people in nursing homes an outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in colorado in 1981 during 2005 largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in nicaragua this unusually large and severe outbreak was associated with mutations in rotavirus a genome possibly helping virus escape prevalent immunity in population a similar large outbreak occurred in brazil in 1977 rotavirus b also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or adrv has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of people of all ages in china these epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water rotavirus b infections also occurred in india in 1998 causative strain was named cal unlike adrv cal strain is endemic to date epidemics caused by rotavirus b have been confined to mainland china and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in united states rotavirus c has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children and small outbreaks have occurred in families other animals rotaviruses infect young of many species of animals and they are a major cause of diarrhoea in wild and reared animals worldwide as a pathogen of livestock notably in young calves and piglets rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates these rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses there is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans either by direct transmission of virus or by contributing one or several rna segments to with human strains history thumb 220px one of flewett s original electron micrographs showing a single rotavirus particle when examined by negative stained electron microscopy rotaviruses often resemble wheels in 1943 jacob light and horace hodes proved that a filterable agent in faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours livestock diarrhoea in cattle three decades later preserved samples of agent were shown to be rotavirus in intervening years a virus in mice was shown to be related to virus causing scours in 1973 ruth bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis in 1974 thomas henry flewett suggested name rotavirus after observing that when viewed through an electron microscope a rotavirus particle looks like a wheel rota in latin name was officially recognised by international committee on taxonomy of viruses four years later in 1976 related viruses were described in several other species of animals these viruses all causing acute gastroenteritis were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and animals worldwide rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980 and in following year rotaviruses from humans were first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys by adding trypsin an enzyme found in duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate to culture medium ability to grow rotaviruses in culture accelerated pace of research and by mid 1980s first candidate vaccines were being evaluated references external links who rotavirus web page
