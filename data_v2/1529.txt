austria hungary naval technical committee initiated design and development of a coastal torpedo boat specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours this specification was based on an expectation that strait of otranto where adriatic sea meets ionian sea would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict in such circumstances there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from austro hungarian navy base at bocche di cattaro bay of kotor to strait during night locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning after first contract for eight 250t class torpedo boats was signed another tender was requested for four more boats but when ganz danubius reduced their price by ten percent a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them

were powered by two aeg curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers using steam generated by two yarrow water tube boilers one of which burned fuel oil and other coal turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and designed to propel boats to a top speed of they carried of coal and of fuel oil which gave them a range of at f group had two funnels rather than single funnel of preceding t group due to inadequate funding 97 f and rest of 250t class were essentially coastal vessels despite original intention that they would be used for high seas operations they were first small austro hungarian navy boats to use turbines and this contributed to ongoing problems with them boats were armed with two skoda l 30 guns and four torpedo tubes they could also carry 10 12 naval mines 97 f
