development naughty dog began developing last of us in 2009 following release of uncharted 2 among thieves for first time in company s history naughty dog split into two teams while one team developed uncharted 3 drake s deception 2011 other began work on last of us director bruce straley and creative director neil druckmann led team responsible for developing last of us while at university druckmann had an idea to merge gameplay of ico 2001 in a story set during a zombie apocalypse like that of george a romero s night of living dead 1968 with a lead character similar to john hartigan from sin city 1991 2000 lead character a police officer would be tasked with protecting a young girl however due to lead character s heart condition players would often assume control of young girl reversing roles druckmann later developed it when creating story of last of us druckmann views last of us as a coming of age story in which ellie adapts to survival after spending time with joel as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child a major motif of game is that life goes on this is presented in a scene in which joel and ellie discover a herd of giraffes which concept artist john sweeney explained was designed to reignite ellie s lust for life after her suffering following her encounter with david infected a core concept of game were inspired by a segment of bbc nature documentary planet earth 2006 which featured cordyceps fungi though fungi mainly infect insects taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate fungus game explores concept of fungus evolving and infecting humans and direct results of an outbreak of this infection thumb left 170px argentinian musician gustavo santaolalla composed and performed score for last of us alt a 56 year old man with dark gray hair talking into a microphone looking at something beneath camera relationship between joel and ellie was central focus of game all other elements were developed around it troy baker and ashley johnson were cast as joel and ellie respectively and provided voice and motion capture performances baker and johnson contributed to development of characters for example baker convinced druckmann that joel would care for tess due to his loneliness and johnson convinced druckmann that ellie should be stronger and more defensive ellie s physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to johnson game s other characters also underwent changes character tess was originally intended to be main antagonist of last of us but team found it difficult to believe her motives sexuality of character bill was originally left vague in script but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality last of us features an original score composed primarily by gustavo santaolalla along with compositions by andrew anthony caruso and jonathan mayer known for his minimalist compositions santaolalla was contacted early in development he used various instruments to compose score including some that he was unfamiliar with giving a sense of danger and innocence this minimalist approach was also taken with game s sound and art design sound of infected was one of first tasks during development team experimented with sound in order to achieve best work possible to achieve sound of clicker they hired voice actress misty lee who provided a sound that audio lead phillip kovats described as originating in back of throat art department took various pieces of work as inspiration such as robert polidori s photographs following hurricane katrina which were used as a reference point when designing flooded areas of pittsburgh art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include due to strong differing opinions of team during development ultimately team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail while straley and druckmann preferred former art team preferred latter game s opening credits were produced by sony s san diego studio last of us game designer ricky cited video games ico and resident evil 4 as influences on game design he said emotional weight of relationship needed to be balanced with tension of world s issues stating that they wanted to take character building and interaction of ico and blend it with tension and action of resident evil 4 team created new engines to satisfy their needs for game artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players addition of ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to engine lighting engine was also re created to incorporate soft light in which sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces gameplay introduced difficulty to team as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis game s user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development last of us was announced on december 10 2011 at spike video game awards alongside its debut
