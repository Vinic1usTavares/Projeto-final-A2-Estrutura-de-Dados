brill railway station was terminus of a small railway line in buckinghamshire england known as brill tramway built and owned by 3rd duke of buckingham it was later operated by london s metropolitan railway and in 1933 briefly became one of two north western termini of london underground despite being and over two hours travelling time from city of london approximately of a mile 1 2 km north of brill station was opened in march 1872 as result of lobbying from local residents and businesses as line was cheaply built and ungraded and locomotives were of poor quality services were very slow initially taking 1 hour 45 minutes to traverse six miles 10 km from brill to junction station with main line services at quainton road although serving a lightly populated area and little used by passengers station was a significant point for freight traffic particularly as a carrier of milk from dairy farms of buckinghamshire to aylesbury and london a brickworks was also attached to station but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening during 1890s plans were made to extend tramway to oxford but scheme was abandoned instead operation of line was taken over by metropolitan railway in 1899 and line became one of railway s two north western termini it was upgraded and better quality locomotives were introduced making journey time three times faster in 1933 metropolitan railway was taken into public ownership and became metropolitan line of london transport management of london transport aimed to reduce goods services and it was felt that there was little chance of more distant parts of former metropolitan railway ever becoming viable passenger routes line was closed on 30 november 1935 and all buildings and infrastructure at brill associated with line were sold at auction most of infrastructure was subsequently demolished though three station cottages survive wotton tramway on 23 september 1868 small aylesbury and buckingham
