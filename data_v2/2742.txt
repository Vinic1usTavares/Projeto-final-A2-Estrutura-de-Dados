new signing john arne riise included in team while midfielder steven gerrard was absent with an ankle injury there was also no place for striker robbie fowler who was expected to captain side manchester united lined up in a 4 4 1 1 formation with paul scholes playing just off main striker ruud van nistelrooy who made his debut for club van nistelrooy s fellow new signing juan sebastian veron was on international duty with argentina national team his place in midfield was taken by nicky butt match first half manchester united kicked off match but within first two minutes they had conceded a goal a foul on liverpool midfielder danny murphy by united captain roy keane resulted in a liverpool penalty which gary mcallister subsequently scored to give liverpool a 1 0 lead minutes later liverpool were awarded a free kick but mcallister was unable to score hitting manchester united s defensive wall united had their first chance two minutes later but van nistelrooy miscued his shot in front of goal in 11th minute liverpool s lead was almost extended as united midfielder nicky butt almost diverted a cross from riise into his own goal five minutes later liverpool did extend their lead united defender jaap stam slipped after liverpool striker emile heskey headed ball down to michael owen allowing owen to sidestep gary neville and place his shot into united goal to make score 2 0 frustration of united players was beginning to show and immediately after goal paul scholes was shown a yellow card for a challenge on dietmar hamann united s best chance of half so far came in 25th minute keane met a free kick from david beckham with a header which was saved by liverpool goalkeeper sander westerveld three minutes later united felt they should have had a penalty when mikael silvestre s shot hit arm of liverpool defender stephane henchoz but referee andy d urso did not award a penalty liverpool continued to be dangerous on attack and came close to extending their lead in 34th minute united goalkeeper fabien barthez failed to claim a cross from mcallister and ball fell to nick barmby but his shot was cleared off line by denis irwin united came closest to scoring in 36th minute but keane s shot from hit crossbar with westerveld beaten united continued to enjoy majority of possession but were unable to make it count as they could not find a way past liverpool s defence second half manchester united started second half in attacking fashion as they had chances immediately a silvestre run down pitch resulted in a pass that found van nistelrooy on edge of liverpool penalty area but his shot went high and wide of goal he had another chance a minute later but despite beating offside trap set by liverpool defence he could not beat westerveld who saved his shot united s attacking start to half was underlined by a third chance in as many minutes but scholes shot went wide of liverpool goal however two minutes later united s pressure told and they scored a move that involved beckham keane and ryan giggs resulted in ball being played to van nistelrooy who went around westerveld and subsequently scored to reduce liverpool s lead to 2 1 beckham came close to levelling match in 62nd minute when he had two chances to score he was unable to get his shot on target after liverpool failed to clear a cross from giggs and he was unable to score with a long range shot in an effort to find equalising goal united manager alex ferguson moved giggs from centre of midfield to left in order to restore width of his team and brought on striker dwight yorke for butt yorke would spearhead attack with van nistelrooy a partnership that worked on club s pre season tour of asia united had another chance in 68th minute but scholes was unable to beat westerveld who saved his shot liverpool manager gerard houllier made his first substitutions of match soon after in an attempt to regain control of possession he brought on igor biscan and patrik berger to replace barmby and murphy liverpool s first chance of half came in 81st minute biscan and owen exchanged passes before biscan shot wide of goal united went straight on attack and a goal bound shot by keane was saved by westerveld liverpool replaced riise with defender jamie carragher minutes later in order to see out game a minute later referee d urso declined to award united a penalty for second time when van nistelrooy s shot appeared to be blocked by arm of henchoz united continued to push forward for an equaliser but a long range shot by irwin which went wide was their only notable chance before match ended liverpool won 2 1 to win shield for 14th time details gk 1 sander 6 markus babbelcb 2 stephane 4 sami hyypia c lb 18 john arne riise rm 13 danny murphy cm 16

win marked liverpool s third consecutive victory against manchester united but despite this manager houllier refused to get carried away at moment i am worried because team which has won charity shield in recent years has not won title i don t think you can draw conclusions from this match man of match sander westerveld echoed similar sentiments it doesn t say too much about season last year chelsea beat them 2 0 and had high expectations we played well and it s a good result but it doesn t say anything about championship questions were asked about exclusion of striker robbie fowler from match day squad with houllier confirming striker had been left out after a training ground bust up with assistant manager phil thompson it is a regrettable moment for team and club but i m sure at some stage common sense will prevail i am leaving it to him i brokered a get together between phil and robbie which i attended at beginning then i left two scousers together but so far it has been unsuccessful houllier added that he had tried to resolve issue before start of match i waited until sunday lunchtime before charity shield game i again insisted yesterday i took them together again i think at some stage it will be solved i am a patient man manchester united manager ferguson was critical of performance of referee d urso i felt sorry for referee today it doesn t matter how much training you have in any job it s about temperament and i just think lad was too nervous for that today despite losing their fourth consecutive charity shield match ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into start of season we certainly hope we can go on to win title again like we have in previous years we just need to keep standards up and show desire we did in second half he was also unsure whether liverpool would be able to challenge for premier league it s difficult to assess liverpool at moment they started with confidence but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago you would also expect us to be sluggish at start because we are bloody good at it match was marred by a series of hooligan incidents occurring near stadium it was being played day before a cardiff city game a group of cardiff city fans entered prince of wales public house in city to find it occupied by manchester united fans staying in city overnight a series of running battles between fans of two clubs followed resulting in 22 arrests including two boys aged just 11 and 13 as well as a man suffering stab wounds and a police officer suffering a broken arm on day of game an army of around 50 cardiff and liverpool hooligans were seen attacking united supporters in wood street area see also 2001 02 fa premier league 2001 02 fa cup liverpool f c
