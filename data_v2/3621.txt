brown dog affair was a political controversy about vivisection which raged in england from 1903 until 1910 it involved infiltration of university of london medical lectures by swedish feminists pitched battles between medical students and police police protection for statue of a dog a libel trial at royal courts of justice and establishment of a royal commission to investigate use of animals in experiments affair became a cause celebre which divided country controversy was triggered by allegations that william bayliss of department of physiology at university college london performed an illegal vivisection in february 1903 before an audience of 60 medical students on a brown terrier dog dog was adequately anaesthetized according to bayliss and his team but it was conscious and struggling according to swedish activists procedure was condemned as cruel and unlawful by national anti vivisection society bayliss s research on dogs led to discovery of hormones and he was outraged by assault on his reputation he sued for libel and won anti vivisectionists commissioned a bronze statue of dog as a memorial unveiled on latchmere recreation ground in battersea in 1906 but medical students were angered by its provocative plaque men and women of england how long shall these things be this led to frequent vandalism of memorial and need for a 24 hour police guard against so called

melted down by council s blacksmith despite a 20 000 strong petition in its favour a new statue of brown dog was erected in battersea park in 1985 commissioned by anti vivisection groups according to

royal commission on vivisection 1876 commission learned that researchers did not use anaesthetics regularly and recommended a series of measures including a ban on experiments on dogs cats horses donkeys and mules general medical council and british medical journal objected so additional protection was introduced instead result was cruelty to animals act 1876 criticized by navs as infamous but

douglas who was unsympathetic to anti vivisectionist cause ernest starling and william bayliss in early 20th century ernest starling professor of physiology at university college london and his brother in law william bayliss were using vivisection on dogs to determine whether nervous system controls pancreatic secretions as postulated by ivan pavlov bayliss had held a licence to practice vivisection since 1890 and had taught physiology since 1900 according to starling s biographer john henderson starling and bayliss were compulsive experimenters and starling s lab was busiest in london men knew that pancreas produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in duodenum and jejunum because of arrival of there by severing duodenal and nerves in anaesthetized dogs while leaving blood vessels intact then introducing acid into duodenum and jejunum they discovered that process is not mediated by a nervous response but by a new type of chemical reflex they named chemical messenger secretin because it is secreted by intestinal lining into bloodstream stimulating pancreas on circulation in 1905 starling coined term hormone from greek meaning i arouse or i excite to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable in extremely small quantities of stimulating organs from a distance bayliss and starling had also used vivisection on anaesthetized dogs to discover peristalsis in 1899 they went on to discover a variety of other important physiological phenomena and principles many of which were based on their experimental work involving animal

institute in paris in 1900 a centre of animal experimentation and were shocked by rooms full of caged animals given diseases by researchers they founded anti vivisection society of sweden when they returned home and enrolled as students at london school of medicine for women in 1902 a vivisection free college that had visiting arrangements with other london colleges to gain medical training for their anti vivisectionist campaigns two women attended 100 lectures and demonstrations at king s and university college including 50 experiments on live animals of which 20 were what mason called full scale vivisection they kept a diary calling it eye witnesses and later shambles of science extracts from diary of two students of physiology shambles was a name for a slaughterhouse women were present when brown dog was vivisected and wrote a chapter about it entitled fun referring to laughter which they said they heard in lecture room during procedure brown dog vivisection of dog according to starling brown dog was a small brown mongrel allied to a terrier with short hair about 14 15 lb c 6 kg in weight he was first used in a vivisection in december 1902 by starling who cut open his

inspect results of previous surgery which took about 45 minutes after which he clamped wound with forceps and handed dog over to bayliss bayliss cut a new opening in dog s neck to expose lingual nerves of salivary glands to which he attached electrodes aim was to stimulate nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure dog was then carried to lecture theatre stretched on his back on an operating board with his legs tied to board his head clamped and his mouth muzzled according to bayliss dog had been given a morphine injection earlier in day then was anaesthetized during procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol chloroform and ether ace delivered from an ante room to a tube in his trachea via a pipe hidden behind bench on which men were working swedish students disputed that dog had been adequately anaesthetized they said dog had appeared conscious during procedure had tried to lift himself off board and that there was no smell of anaesthesia or usual hissing sound of apparatus other students said dog had not struggled but had merely in front of around 60 students bayliss stimulated nerves with electricity for half an hour but was unable to demonstrate his point dog was then handed to a student henry dale a future nobel laureate who removed dog s pancreas then killed him with a knife through heart this became a point of embarrassment during libel trial when bayliss s laboratory assistant charles scuttle testified that dog had been killed with chloroform or ace mixture after scuttle s testimony dale told court that he had in fact used a knife women s diary on 14 april 1903 lind af hageby and schartau showed their unpublished 200 page diary to barrister stephen coleridge secretary of national anti vivisection society stephen coleridge was son of john duke coleridge former lord chief justice of england and great grandson of poet samuel taylor coleridge his attention was drawn to account of brown dog 1876 cruelty to animals act forbade use of an animal in more than one experiment yet it appeared that brown dog had been used by starling to perform surgery on pancreas used again by him when he opened dog to inspect results of previous surgery and used for a third time by bayliss to study salivary glands diary said of procedures on brown dog today s lecture will include a repetition of a demonstration

thumb left upright 0 8 alt photograph stephen coleridge according to mason coleridge decided there was no point in relying on a prosecution under act which he regarded as deliberately obstructive instead he gave an angry speech about dog on 1 may 1903 to annual meeting of national anti vivisection society at st james s hall in piccadilly attended by 2 000 3 000 people mason writes that support and apologies for absence were sent by writers jerome k jerome thomas hardy and rudyard kipling coleridge accused scientists of torture if this is not torture let mr bayliss and his friends tell us in heaven s name what torture is details of speech were published next day by radical daily news founded in 1846 by charles dickens and questions were raised in house of commons particularly by sir frederick banbury a conservative mp and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending vivisection demonstrations bayliss demanded a public apology and when by 12 may it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel ernest starling decided not to sue lancet no friend of coleridge wrote that it may be contended that professor starling committed a technical infringement of act coleridge tried to persuade

isaacs called starling as his first witness starling admitted that he had broken law by using dog twice but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs bayliss testified that dog had been given one and a half grains of morphia earlier in day then six ounces of alcohol chloroform and ether delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to dog s trachea bayliss said tubes were fragile and that had dog been struggling they would have broken a veterinarian alfred sewell said system bayliss was using was unlikely to be adequate but other witnesses including frederick hobday of royal veterinary college disagreed there was even a claim that bayliss had used too much anaesthesia which is why dog had failed to respond to electrical stimulation bayliss said dog had been suffering from a disease that causes involuntary spasm and that any movement lind af hageby and schartau had seen was not purposive four students three women and a man were called by bayliss s counsel and testified that dog had appeared to be unconscious coleridge s barrister john lawson walton called lind af hageby and schartau they repeated they had been first students to arrive and had been left alone with dog for about two minutes they had observed scars from previous operations and an incision in neck where two tubes had been placed they had not smelled anaesthetic and had not seen any apparatus delivering it they said mason wrote that dog had arched his back and jerked his legs in what they regarded as an effort to escape when experiment began dog continued to its abdomen and tremble they said movements they regarded as violent and purposeful bayliss s lawyer criticized coleridge for having accepted women s statements without seeking corroboration and for speaking about issue publicly without first approaching bayliss despite knowing that doing so could lead to litigation coleridge replied that he had not sought verification because he knew claims would be denied and that he continued to regard women s statement as true times wrote of his testimony defendant when placed in witness box did as much damage to his own case as time at his disposal for purpose would allow
