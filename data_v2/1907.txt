attacked and captured ugandan capital kampala as a result ugandan president idi amin was deposed his forces were scattered and a unlf government was installed amin had seized power in uganda in 1971 and established a brutal dictatorship seven years later he attempted to invade tanzania to south tanzania repulsed assault and launched a counter attack into ugandan territory after routing ugandans and their libyan allies in entebbe tanzanians revised their existing offensive designs for kampala plans called for 208th brigade to advance from south spearheaded by lieutenant colonel ben msuya s 800 strong 19th battalion which was to secure centre of city 207th brigade and a unlf battalion were to attack from west while 201st brigade was to establish roadblocks to north to prevent ugandan units from withdrawing an eastern corridor was left open to allow libyans to evacuate to jinja and fly out of country amin prepared for defence of kampala but fled through gap tanzanians began their assault on city on morning of 10 april 19th battalion moved cautiously down entebbe kampala road other battalions of 208th advanced on port bell 201st brigade established its roadblocks north of kampala and intercepted both forces attempting to reinforce kampala from bombo and those attempting to effect a breakout 207th brigade advanced from west in tandem with unlf battalion which secured nateete and passed through rubaga one of 207th s battalions seized kasubi hill and royal tomb of kabakas 19th battalion encountered only sporadic resistance and was greeted by crowds of rejoicing civilians upon reaching kampala s city centre unit lacking maps had trouble navigating streets tanzanians secured radio station and set up a command post on kololo hill unlf battalion occupied republic house uganda army s headquarters at edge of city unopposed but was unable to take state research bureau at nakasero men of 207th and 208th brigades seized southern and western portions of city few libyan units in area put up little resistance most having retreated to jinja by dawn on april 11 tanzanian troops had cut off all routes out of kampala including road to jinja and began eliminating remaining pockets of resistance some unlf forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with amin regime while others attacked kakwa and nubians both ethnic groups that had benefited from dictatorship later in morning tanzanian artillery bombarded parts of city remaining ugandan soldiers in city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles casualty statistics are not exact though tanzanian losses are estimated to have been light and dozens of ugandan soldiers and civilians are believed to have died battle marked first time in recent history of continent that an african state seized capital of another african country and deposed its government in immediate aftermath civilians engaged in rampant looting despite attempts of tanzanian and unlf troops to maintain order a new ugandan government was established by unlf though pro amin forces were left scattered and disjointed by seizure of capital combat operations in country continued until 3 june when tanzanian forces reached sudanese border and eliminated last resistance background in 1971 idi amin launched a military coup that overthrew president of uganda milton obote precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring tanzania tanzanian president julius nyerere had close ties with obote and had supported his socialist orientation amin installed himself as president of uganda and ruled country under a repressive dictatorship nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of new government and offered asylum to obote and his supporters he tacitly supported a failed attempt by obote to overthrow amin in 1972 and after a brief border conflict he and amin signed a peace accord nevertheless relations between two presidents remained tense and amin made repeated threats to invade tanzania uganda s economy languished under amin s corrupt rule and instability manifested in armed forces following a failed mutiny in late october 1978 ugandan troops crossed over tanzanian border in pursuit of rebellious soldiers on 1 november amin announced that he was annexing kagera salient in northern tanzania tanzania halted sudden invasion mobilised anti amin opposition groups and launched a counter offensive nyerere told foreign diplomats that he did not intend to depose amin but only teach him a lesson claim was not believed nyerere despised amin and he made statements to some of his colleagues about overthrowing him tanzanian government also felt that its northern border would not be secure unless threat presented by amin was eliminated after initial advances into ugandan territory major general david msuguri was appointed commander of tanzania people s defence force tpdf s 20th division and ordered to push further into country tpdf seized masaka on 24 february 1979 nyerere originally planned to halt his forces there and allow ugandan exiles to attack kampala ugandan capital and overthrow amin he feared that scenes of tanzanian troops occupying city would reflect poorly on country s image abroad fall of masaka surprised and deeply troubled ugandan commanders who felt that defeat made kampala vulnerable to attack they mobilised additional forces and began planning for a defence of city some troops were sent to where they vainly attempted to halt tanzanian advance ugandan opposition groups met in moshi in late march they elected yusuf lule chairman of uganda national liberation front unlf and established a cabinet shortly thereafter president muammar gaddafi of libya an ally of amin attempted to stem advance by sending an ultimatum to nyerere demanding that he withdraw his forces in 24 hours or face opposition of libyan troops which were already operating in uganda nyerere rejected threat in a radio broadcast announcing that libya s entry into war did not change tanzanian government s view of amin ugandan rebel forces did not have strength to defeat libyan units so nyerere decided to use tpdf to take kampala tanzanian leaders were also inclined to capture city after ugandan planes bombed kagera and following amin s announcement that inhabitants of masaka and mbarara would face retaliation for welcoming tanzanian invasion successful formation of unlf government eased tanzanian concerns about aftermath of a seizure of capital on 25 march amin imposed a curfew in kampala which was home to 400 000 residents four days later united nations announced that it would evacuate approximately 140 dependents of its kampala staff to kenya on 31 march tanzanians drew up their plans of attack prelude in early april tanzanian forces began to concentrate their efforts on weakening ugandan position in kampala jets conducted several sorties against military targets in city tanzanian commanders had originally assumed that amin would station bulk of his forces in capital and their initial plans called for a direct attack on city however from high ground in mpigi they could see entebbe peninsula where there was heavy libyan air traffic and a large contingent of ugandan and libyan soldiers if tpdf seized kampala before securing town of entebbe it would be susceptible to a flanking attack taking entebbe would cut off uganda s libyan reinforcements and permit an assault on capital from south msuguri made decision to attack peninsula first and ordered 208th brigade to secure it a preliminary bombardment frightened amin in his official residence entebbe state house and he fled via helicopter to kampala on 7 april brigade advanced into town many libyan soldiers attempted to evacuate to kampala but were intercepted and killed following seizure of entebbe hundreds of ugandan soldiers garrisoning kampala fled remnants of libyan force joined remaining ugandan troops and took up positions around capital their morale was extremely low thumb map of kampala and its surroundings alt map of kampala and surrounding locales including mpigi entebbe bombo and jinja left on morning of 8 april tanzanian officers held a final meeting in entebbe state house before attack on kampala brigadier mwita marwa commander of 208th brigade conducted briefing nyerere requested that his commanders leave eastern road from city leading to jinja clear so that libyan troops and foreign diplomats could evacuate he thought that by letting libyans escape libya could avoid humiliation and quietly withdraw from war nyerere also feared that further conflict with libyan troops would incite afro arab tensions and invite armed belligerence of other arab states he sent a message to gaddafi explaining his decision saying that libyans could be airlifted out of uganda unopposed from airstrip in jinja he further requested that his forces avoid damaging key buildings in kampala including mulago hospital makerere university and parliament of uganda tanzanian plan of attack called for an advance by 207th brigade and a unlf battalion from west along road from masaka with a simultaneous assault from entebbe in south by 208th brigade latter s 19th battalion under lieutenant colonel ben msuya was earmarked for seizure of city centre while other units were to cover their flanks in bush 201st brigade was to maintain a blocking action north of kampala to prevent ugandan forces from escaping entire operation was supposed to take three days to complete amin made final preparations for defence of capital and general sabuni was left in charge of defences according to africa research bulletin there were approximately 1 000 soldiers garrisoning city while journalist john darnton reported on 9 april an estimate that amin had 2 000 to 3 000 men just south of capital as a last line of defence kampala garrison included members of chui battalion and personnel of ugandan air force in addition to ugandan and libyan soldiers a small number of allied palestine liberation organisation plo militants belonging to fatah took up positions in outskirts of kampala commanded by colonel mahmoud da as these palestinians were reportedly ready to fight but prepared to evacuate country at same time many civilians fled in anticipation of a battle though minister of commerce muhammad declared that they had to return within two days or have their property reallocated most of students at makerere university went to their family homes outside city

retreated upon realising that their ugandan allies were no longer willing to fight on da as and his men consequently withdrew northwards and eventually crossed into sudan thumb clock tower by entebbe road in 2017 alt clock tower by entebbe road at edge of kampala city centre 19th battalion began its advance at 03 36 accompanied by freelance journalists tony avirgan and martha honey tpdf initiated a heavy 90 minute long artillery bombardment of kampala at dawn and another barrage later in morning windows were shattered by explosions and several buildings and roads were struck only a few civilian casualties were reported as most of city s residents left streets and sought shelter indoors as 19th battalion moved down entebbe kampala road with its three tanks a t 59 and two t 62s it was joined by an increasing number of celebratory civilians eager for removal of amin regime column did not encounter resistance until it came under small arms fire near makindye roundabout from a marketplace by left side of road about two kilometres from centre of city tanzanian troops took cover in a drainage ditch and returned fire while civilians scattered fire was exchanged for 10 minutes until source of opposition a limousine occupied by five ugandan soldiers armed with semi automatic weapons emerged from cover and drove towards tanzanian column it was quickly destroyed with small arms fire a rocket propelled grenade and a 75 mm tank shell tanzanians searched market but found no more ugandans and subsequently resumed their march into capital joined by cheering civilians battalion received some harassing fire but took no casualties and at 17 00 reached clock tower in kampala where entebbe road entered downtown msuya was eager to complete his battalion s objectives in two hours remaining before nightfall his decisions were complicated by fact that he had no map of kampala and had to rely upon a ugandan guide for directions he resolved to secure radio station first leaving a guard behind to prevent civilians from following battalion moved out into in city streets but with only guide s confused and limited directions its progress was slow bank of uganda post office parliament and nile mansion hotel were secured with only minimal resistance tanzanians faced stiffer opposition at ministry of internal affairs building most of ugandan leadership had fled leaving their defences confused and uncoordinated aside from a brief firefight with ugandan soldiers positioned in a balcony 19th battalion located radio uganda station without incident though its equipment was intact msuya was under orders not to make any broadcasts he told a junior officer this is almost worth getting court martialed for tanzanians repulsed a brief ambush from an adjacent skyscraper before considering their next move they were supposed to secure nakasero hill location of state research bureau amin s secret police organisation and presidential residence and kololo hill home to amin s personal command post before nightfall msuya determined that only one area could be seized in time frame and of two choices kololo presented a safer location for an overnight encampment meanwhile unlf battalion occupied republic house uganda army s headquarters at edge of city they were unopposed but five men were killed by friendly fire when tanzanian artillery bombarded site gunners unaware that it had been taken at around nightfall unlf force approached state research bureau at nakasero in belief that it had been abandoned when unit was close ugandan soldiers opened fire destroying a land rover and forcing unlf to retreat ugandans later abandoned bureau but threw grenades into holding cells in an attempt to kill last prisoners while bulk of 19th battalion set out for kololo a detached company set up an ambush position in a park overlooking a street that led towards jinja road tanzanians attacked two passing ugandan land rovers killing their three occupants in one of vehicles soldiers recovered a detailed plan for kampala s defence which specified battalions and commanders responsible for each sector most had already dispersed by nightfall 19th battalion had not located command post kampala was quiet and there was no electricity in entire city with exception of a single traffic light eventually ugandan guide directed unit to a golf course which troops cut across to base of kololo by 21 00 tanzanians were following residential streets up hill frustrated by his guide s inability to locate command post msuya decided to forgo location and establish his own command post in an abandoned home whilst his battalion dug trenches and established roadblocks according to him by 22 00 kampala was under tanzanian control at 23 00 he held a toast with his officers to celebrate capture of city overnight several other battalions of 208th moved into southern portion of kampala while 207th occupied west brigadier walden oversaw capture of amin s residence few libyan units in city put up little resistance most retreated to jinja and then to ethiopia and kenya to await repatriation amin also fled to jinja though how and precisely when are not agreed upon unlf battalion established its camp in golf course as troops were settling down a small white car drove by and an occupant opened fire mortally wounding an officer unlf subsequently erected roadblocks around location men maintaining them grew drunk throughout night on pillaged beer and whisky 11 april by dawn of 11 april tanzanian troops had cut off all routes leaving kampala including road to jinja and began eliminating remaining pockets of resistance some unlf forces conducted revenge killings against suspected collaborators with amin regime while others attacked kakwa and nubians both ethnic groups that had benefited from dictatorship at 04 00 east german ambassador gottfried lessing and his wife left their residence in a small white car with another vehicle following in an attempt to escape city when they drove by golf course unlf fired two rocket propelled grenades destroying cars and killing four occupants as morning progressed unlf soldiers manning roadblocks drunkenly harassed passing civilians and tanzanian soldiers ojok proceeded to radio uganda to announce fall of amin s regime according to honey and avirgan ojok had long desired to inform ugandan people that they were free of dictatorship but lule had sent a message to unlf forces prohibiting ojok from making any broadcasts lule feared that ojok would declare restoration of obote s presidential regime ojok and obote had been long time allies in resistance against amin honey and avirgan stated that upon reaching station ojok placed two phone calls to dar es salaam first was to nyerere who was not present though a message was recorded by a security officer second was to obote ojok reportedly told obote that he intended to announce capture of kampala in name of unlf to which obote expressed his approval according to historian kenneth ingham ojok asked obote for direction on what to say and he was instructed to appeal for support of a new national government without mentioning obote or his party uganda people s congress journalist timothy kalyegira wrote that obote dictated an announcement which ojok wrote on an envelope obote claimed that immediately after phone call he telephoned nyerere to inform him of fall of kampala and nyerere came to his residence to celebrate occasion msuya asserted that ojok had initially refused to make any declaration saying if our friends in moshi and dar es salaam hear me reading this they will think i have taken over msuya told daily monitor i literally held a gun on oyite ojok s head to read communique i told him someone has got to say something and that person has got to be a ugandan despite persistence of gunfire several technicians arrived for their scheduled workday and assisted ojok in making broadcast his declaration was straightforward he stated that amin s government was deposed and that kampala was under control of unlf and appealed to residents to remain calm and for ugandan soldiers to surrender lule was infuriated by broadcast and a prerecorded speech by him was not played on radio uganda until later that evening later in morning tanzanian artillery bombarded parts of city most ugandan soldiers quickly broke and fled upon being subjected to shelling more civilians seeing that troops on their streets were tanzanian came out from their dwellings to celebrate and loot some pointed out remaining pockets of resistance to tpdf meanwhile diplomatic staff resident on kololo hill felt it was safe enough to begin visiting msuya s command post to pay their respects to him civilians raided files of state research bureau in search of records that contained whereabouts of missing family members tanzanians found among documents a copy of their top secret plan of attack for kampala lieutenant colonel salim hassan boma led a detachment on a sweep of capital and on edge of city they discovered prison where over 1 700 prisoners were held boma ordered them all to be set free remaining ugandan soldiers in city desperately attempted to escape by changing into civilian clothes and requisitioning civilian vehicles they robbed residents at gunpoint and in some cases murdered them to secure items as tanzanian patrols secured kampala s neighbourhoods some of them stumbled across ugandan soldiers and exchanged fire with them three of latter attempted to rob residence of first secretary of french embassy but were driven away by gunfire from secretary s wife withdrawing troops also looted properties on mulago hill at least 10 ugandan soldiers were beaten to death by enraged civilians armed with furniture and pieces of wood lieutenant colonel juma butabika one of amin s top commanders was killed in a firefight with soldiers of 205th and 208th brigades in kawempe area as they moved in from to secure northern section of city lieutenant colonel abdul kisule commander of an artillery unit based in masindi surrendered in capital as did uganda army s chief medical officer brigadier g d meanwhile kampala s residents engaged in rampant looting despite attempts of tanzanian and unlf troops to maintain order a few looters were active in morning and only targeted homes of amin s lieutenants but by afternoon many were crowding streets and pillaging property indiscriminately stores had their windows smashed and were cleared of furniture documents were destroyed and new cars were pushed out of show rooms and onto streets some buildings were set on fire ministry of health s offices were raided by its own employees in what most observers described as boldest incident of looting in entire war six foot thick door to vault of barclays bank of uganda main branch building was breached with plastic explosives and 2 25 million shillings were stolen msuya felt that only way to stop pillaging would be to open fire on crowds which would generate a highly negative response from population instead he ordered his men to quietly assist looters in breaking into warehouses and try to keep situation calm this strategy failed as two civilians were accidentally killed in pandemonium eventually tanzanians were authorised to seize a radio and a watch each from abandoned homes according to a newsweek report evening of 11 april came to be called night of wheel barrows in allusion to civilians carting away property aftermath thumb left idi amin pictured denied over radio that kampala had fallen to tanzanians and unlf on 11 april following reception of news of fall of kampala sudanese guards were placed on alert at ugandan frontier shortly thereafter ugandan refugees began steadily fleeing over border on 12 april amin delivered a rambling radio broadcast via a mobile transmitter in which he denounced ojok s speech and declared that his forces still held kampala he then boarded an aircraft in and flew to libya he eventually settled in exile in saudi arabia and never returned to uganda next day a band of lingering ugandan soldiers in kampala shot a tanzanian sentry in front of bank of uganda tanzanian sappers promptly razed building group was hiding in looting decreased over following days but random shootings occurred throughout city a small number of ugandan and libyan troops remained in hiding and on 15 april three libyans were killed while attempting to steal a car in days following city s capture tanzanian soldiers maintained roadblocks and checkpoints kampala was left damaged by tanzanian artillery bombardment and looting electricity and water services were restored to a portion of population a few days after battle in early may civilians and municipal officials cleaned up most of debris and boarded up smashed windows when petrol became available tow trucks recovered vehicles abandoned across kampala makerere university students created a campaign to return looted office equipment to government buildings reconstruction efforts were slow and city displayed signs of dilapidation several years after battle as late as 2000 ruins from conflict remained along kampala road in city centre casualty statistics were unclear in immediate aftermath of battle according to honey fewer than 100 ugandan soldiers were killed tanzanians estimated that 25 to 30 ugandan soldiers had died in city superintendent of mortuaries supervised collection of bodies and by 15 april he had recovered over 200 dead ugandan soldiers and civilians he estimated that total count could be as high as 500 journalist baldwin stated that 300 corpses were found time reported deaths of dozens of soldiers and civilians according to daily monitor potentially several dozen ugandan civilians were killed over 500 ugandan soldiers were captured by tpdf they were temporarily housed on kololo before being deported to prisoner of war camps in tanzania kisule was attached to a battalion of tpdf s 205th brigade to act as its guide and assist it in capture of masindi sabuni fled to kenya but was arrested by local authorities in may after being indicted by kampala chief magistrate for murder he later died in unlf custody from undernourishment libyans few casualties during battle included some deaths tpdf casualties were also deemed to be light only three members of 19th battalion were wounded in fighting large stocks of libyan munitions were seized as were significant caches of ugandan weapons imported from soviet union united kingdom israel and spain tanzanians recovered body of hans poppe a biracial tanzanian police officer who had been killed by ugandans in a 1971 border clash his corpse had been put on display by amin as evidence that foreign mercenaries were being deployed against him body was repatriated and buried searches of amin s residence at nakasero uncovered a basement occupied by starving prisoners and rotting corpses immediately after seizure of kampala tpdf began establishing a new ugandan government a significant number of unlf politicians subsequently settled in city and occupied its most luxurious hotels social tensions between former exiles and rest of kampala s population quickly grew as politicians flaunted their role as liberators regardless of their involvement in war and began to live in style while common citizens still suffered from a lack of basic necessities msuya was tasked with running errands on behalf of unlf ministers while walden s 207th brigade was ordered to assume occupation duties throughout entirety of kampala tanzanian soldiers subsequently occupied kampala intercontinental hotel looting it and tossing thousands of which had been given by libya to uganda stored in it from its balconies ojok began recruiting for his unlf faction kikosi maalum successfully bringing in hundreds of fighters of northeastern origin into group disagreement between ojok and another unlf commander yoweri museveni over control of surrendered uganda army soldiers in kampala led to a leadership dispute as a compromise all unlf forces were withdrawn from city 201st brigade proceeded from its position in north to take bombo and 208th moved out to capture jinja amin s forces were left scattered and disjointed by seizure of capital discipline in uganda army faltered and command hierarchy collapsed according to ugandan major bernard rwehururu news of defeat provoked desertions among ugandan ranks and many officers withdrew to west nile sub region or fled country many northern soldiers feeling conflict was primarily a southern affair had little motivation to continue fighting away from their home territories while some men began accusing units which had fought in south of performing poorly and losing war 250 strong garrison of mbale defected and established roadblocks around town to protect it from amin s forces while awaiting arrival of tpdf a handful of forces rallied in masindi to plan a counterattack to retake kampala further tanzanian advances prompted ugandans to abandon town ugandan officials in unoccupied portions of country fled to kenya precipitating a collapse in administration after kampala s capture little further damage was caused by fighting in uganda combat operations in country continued until 3 june when tanzanian forces reached sudanese border and eliminated last resistance caught unprepared by fall of kampala lule hurriedly compiled a list of ministers meant to represent ethnic balances of country on 13 april he was flown into city and installed as president of uganda unlf government s operations were greatly hampered by theft of equipment from state offices though a decree was issued that prohibiting looting authorities did not pursue legal action against looters and an appeal for return of state property was modestly successful nyerere s decision to use his army to drive far into ugandan territory and depose amin resulted in tanzania becoming deeply involved in ugandan affairs in aftermath of war against his intentions after a three year long occupation tpdf withdrew from uganda in 1981 legacy fall of kampala marked first time in history of continent that an african state seized capital of another african country overthrow of a sovereign head of state by a foreign military had never occurred in africa and had been strongly discouraged by organisation of african unity oau at an oau conference in july 1979 president gaafar nimeiry of sudan said that war had set a serious precedent and noted that organisation s charter prohibits interference in other people s internal affairs and invasion of their territory by armed force nigerian head of state shared similar concerns some observers dissented from this line of thought and argued that situation demonstrated that oau charter needed reform nyerere accused oau of shielding black african leaders from criticism noting that amin s regime had killed more people than white minority governments in southern africa president godfrey lule s successor praised tanzanian intervention despite controversy most western and african states tacitly accepted action according to roy may and oliver furley amin s removal marked a mile post in history of africa on fifth anniversary of fall of kampala obote delivered a speech to commemorate liberation of uganda from amin regime footage from battle was included in 1980 tanzania film company and audio visual institute colour documentary chronicling war vita kagera avirgan and honey included an account of event in
