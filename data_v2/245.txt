also called eliminativism is claim that people s common sense understanding of mind or folk psychology is false and that certain classes of mental states that most people believe in do not exist it is a materialist position in philosophy of mind some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire since they are poorly defined rather they argue that psychological concepts of behaviour and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to biological level lycan w g pappas g 1972 what is

journal of philosophy 40 295 6 most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes as expressed by paul and patricia churchland and eliminativism about qualia subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience as expressed by daniel dennett and georges rey these philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion in context of materialist understandings of psychology eliminativism stands in opposition to reductive materialism which argues that mental states as conventionally understood do exist and that they directly correspond to physical state of nervous system http plato stanford edu entries materialism eliminative by william ramsey an intermediate position is revisionary materialism which will often argue that mental state in question will prove to be somewhat reducible to physical phenomena with some changes needed to common sense concept since eliminative materialism claims that future research will fail to find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena it must necessarily wait for science to progress further one might question position on these grounds but other philosophers like churchland argue that eliminativism is often necessary in order to open minds of thinkers to new evidence and better explanations overview various arguments have been put forth both for and against eliminative materialism over last forty years most of arguments in favor of view are based on assumption that people s commonsense view of mind is actually an implicit theory it is to be compared and contrasted with other scientific theories in its explanatory success accuracy and ability to allow people to make correct predictions about future eliminativists argue that based on these and other criteria commonsense folk psychology has failed and will eventually need to be replaced with explanations derived from neurosciences these philosophers therefore tend to emphasize importance of neuroscientific research as well as developments in artificial intelligence to sustain their thesis philosophers who argue against eliminativism may take several approaches simulation theorists like robert r 1986 folk psychology as simulation mind and language 1 158 171 and alvin a 1992 in defense of simulation theory mind and 104 119 argue that folk psychology is not a theory but rather depends on internal simulation of others and therefore is not subject to falsification in same way that theories are jerry fodor among others argues that folk psychology is in fact a successful even indispensable theory another view is that eliminativism assumes existence of beliefs and other entities it seeks to eliminate and is thus self refuting boghossian p 1990 status of content philosophical review 99 157 84 thumb 380px right schematic overview eliminativists suggest that some sciences can be reduced blue but that theories that are in principle irreducible will eventually be eliminated orange eliminativism maintains that common sense understanding of mind is mistaken and that neurosciences will one day reveal that mental states that are talked about in everyday discourse using words such as intend believe desire and love do not refer to anything real because of inadequacy of natural languages people mistakenly think that they have such beliefs and desires some eliminativists such as frank jackson claim that consciousness does not exist except as an of brain function others such as georges rey claim that concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses jackson f 1982 qualia philosophical quarterly 32 127 136 consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not other roots of eliminativism go back to writings of wilfred sellars w v quine paul feyerabend and richard rorty sellars w 1956 empiricism and philosophy of mind in h and m eds foundations of science and concepts of psychology and psychoanalysis minnesota studies in philosophy of science vol 1 minneapolis university of minnesota press 253 329 online term eliminative materialism was first introduced by james cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by rorty later ludwig wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism particularly with his attack on private objects as grammatical fictions early eliminativists such as rorty and feyerabend often confused two different notions of sort of elimination that term eliminative materialism entailed on one hand they claimed cognitive sciences that will ultimately give people a correct account of workings of mind will not employ terms that refer to common sense mental states like beliefs and desires these states will not be part of ontology of a mature cognitive science but critics immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from identity theory of mind savitt s 1974 rorty s disappearance theory philosophical studies 28 433 36 quine himself wondered what exactly was so eliminative about eliminative materialism after all on other hand same philosophers also claimed that common sense mental states simply do not exist but critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways either mental states exist and will ultimately be explained in terms of lower level neurophysiological processes or they do not modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people s thinking about brain in same way that demons have been eliminated from people s thinking about mental illness and psychopathology while it was a minority view in 1960s eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during 1980s ilkka critical scientific realism pg 156 oxford university press 2002 proponents of this view such as b f skinner often made parallels to previous superseded scientific theories such as that of four humours phlogiston theory of combustion and vital force theory of life that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis about nature of mental in these cases science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories but rejected them altogether as obsolete radical behaviorists such as skinner argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment skinner b f 1971 beyond freedom and dignity new york alfred knopf such views were eventually abandoned patricia and paul churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures eliminativism is not only motivated by philosophical considerations but is also a prediction about what form future scientific theories will take eliminativist philosophers therefore tend to be concerned with data coming from relevant brain and cognitive sciences churchland p s 1986 neurophilosophy toward a unified science of mind brain cambridge massachusetts mit press in addition because eliminativism is essentially predictive in nature different theorists can and often do make different predictions about which aspects of folk psychology will be eliminated from folk psychological vocabulary none of these philosophers are eliminativists tout court churchland p m and p s 1998 reduction

who deny existence of propositional attitudes a subclass of intentional states and with daniel dennett who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness one way to summarize difference between churchlands s views and dennett s view is that churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes but concerning qualia while

eliminativists such as paul and patricia churchland argue that folk psychology is a fully developed but non formalized theory of human behavior it is used to explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior this view is often referred to as theory of mind or just simply theory theory for it is a theory which theorizes existence of an unacknowledged theory as a theory in scientific sense eliminativists maintain folk psychology needs to be evaluated on basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for investigation of mind brain carruthers p smith p 1996 theories of theories of mind cambridge cambridge university j 1994 simulation vs theory theory what s at issue in c peacocke ed objectivity simulation and unity of consciousness oxford oxford university press such eliminativists have developed different arguments to show that folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory and needs to be abolished they argue that folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can and are being examined and explained by modern neurosciences some examples are dreaming consciousness mental disorders learning processes and memory abilities furthermore they argue folk psychology s development in last 2 500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory ancient greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views but in contrast to this lack of development neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that in their view can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot churchland p m 1981 eliminative materialism and propositional attitudes journal of philosophy 78 2 67 90 folk psychology retains characteristics of now obsolete theories or legends from past ancient societies tried to explain physical mysteries of nature by ascribing mental conditions to them in such statements as sea is angry gradually these everyday folk psychological explanations were replaced by more efficient scientific descriptions today eliminativists argue there is no reason not to accept an effective scientific account of people s cognitive abilities if such an explanation existed then there would be no need for folk psychological explanations of behavior and latter would be eliminated same way as mythological explanations ancients used jackson f pettit p 1990 in defense of folk psychology philosophical studies 59 31 54 another line of argument is meta induction based on what eliminativists view as disastrous historical record of folk theories in general ancient pre scientific theories of folk biology folk physics and folk cosmology have all proven to be radically wrong eliminativists argue same in case of folk psychology there seems no logical basis to eliminativist for making an exception just because folk psychology has lasted longer and is more intuitive or instinctively plausible than other folk theories indeed eliminativists warn considerations of intuitive plausibility may be precisely result of deeply entrenched nature in society of folk psychology itself it may be that people s beliefs and other such states are as theory laden as external perceptions and hence intuitions will tend to be biased in favor of them specific problems with folk psychology much of folk psychology involves attribution of intentional states or more specifically as a subclass propositional attitudes eliminativists point out that these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties an example of this is language of thought hypothesis which attributes a discrete combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics have no place in neurosciences which speak of action potentials spiking frequencies and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature hence syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can have no place in such a structure as brain against this there have been two responses on one hand there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and see this as a straw man argument horgan t and graham g 1990 in defense of southern fundamentalism philosophical studies 62 107 d 1991 two contrasts folk craft versus folk science and belief versus opinion in greenwood j ed future of folk psychology new york cambridge university press other view is represented by those who subscribe to a language of thought they assert that mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher level characterizations of what s happening at physical level mclaughlin b and warfield t 1994 allure of connectionism reexamined synthese 101 365 400 fodor j and pylyshyn z 1984 connectionism and cognitive architecture a critical analysis cognition 28 3 71 it has also been argued against folk psychology that intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities specifically their meaning is determined by things that they are about in external world this makes it difficult to explain how they can play causal roles that they are supposed to in cognitive processes stich s 1983 from folk psychology to cognitive science cambridge massachusetts mit press in recent years this latter argument has been fortified by theory of connectionism many connectionist models of brain have been developed in which processes of language learning and other forms of representation are highly distributed and parallel this would tend to indicate that there is no need for such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires ramsey w stich s and garon j 1990 connectionism eliminativism and future of folk psychology philosophical perspectives 4 499 533 arguments against eliminativism intuitive reservations thesis of eliminativism seems to be so obviously wrong to many critics under claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds that argumentation seems unnecessary this sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states lycan w a particularly compelling refutation of eliminative materialism online retrieved sept 26 2006 eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken analogies from history of science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation it may appear obvious that sun travels around earth for example but for all its apparent this conception was proved wrong nevertheless similarly it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions nevertheless this could equally turn out to be false but even if one accepts susceptibility to error of people s intuitions objection can be reformulated if existence of mental conditions seems perfectly obvious and is central in people s conception of world then enormously strong arguments are needed in order to successfully deny existence of mental conditions furthermore these arguments to be consistent need to be formulated in a way which does not pre suppose existence of entities like mental states logical arguments and ideas otherwise they are self contradictory john points out that such philosophers expect more attention to their works that we would give to scribblings of a mere automaton those who accept this objection say that arguments in favor of eliminativism are far too weak to establish such a radical claim therefore there is no reason to believe in eliminativism self refutation some philosophers such as paul boghossian have attempted to show that eliminativism is in some sense self refuting since theory itself presupposes existence of mental phenomena if eliminativism is true then eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth supposing that in order to assert something one must believe it hence for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis eliminativist must believe that it is true if that is case then there are beliefs and eliminativist claim is false boghossian p 1991 status of content revisited pacific philosophical quarterly 71 264 78 georges rey and michael devitt reply to this objection by invoking deflationary semantic theories that avoid analysing predicates like x is true as expressing a real property they are construed instead as logical devices so that asserting that a sentence is true is just a quoted way of asserting sentence itself to say god exists is true is just to say god exists this way rey and devitt argue insofar as replacements of claims and deflationary accounts of true are coherent eliminativism is not self refuting devitt m rey g 1991 transcending transcendentalism in pacific philosophical quarterly 72 87 100 qualia another problem for eliminativist is consideration that human beings undergo subjective experiences and hence their conscious mental states have qualia since qualia are generally regarded as characteristics of mental states their existence does not seem to be compatible with eliminativism nagel t 1974 what is it like to be a bat philosophical review 83 435 456 eliminativists such as daniel dennett and georges rey respond by rejecting qualia rey g 1988 a question about consciousness in h otto j eds perspectives on mind reidel 5 24 dennett d 1978 intentional stance cambridge massachusetts mit press this is seen to be problematic to opponents of eliminativists since many claim that existence of qualia seems perfectly obvious many philosophers consider elimination of qualia implausible if not incomprehensible they assert that for instance existence of pain is simply beyond denial admitting that existence of qualia seems obvious dennett nevertheless states that qualia is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from cartesian intuitions he argues that a precise analysis shows that term is in long run empty and full of contradictions eliminativist s claim with respect to qualia is that there is no unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes in other words they do not deny that pain exists but that it exists independently of its effect on behavior influenced by ludwig wittgenstein s philosophical investigations dennett and rey have defended eliminativism about qualia even when other portions of mental are accepted efficacy of folk psychology some philosophers argue that folk psychology is a quite successful theory kitcher p s 1984 in defense of intentional psychology journal of philosophy 81 89 106 r 1992 amazing predictive power of folk psychology australasian journal of philosophy 70 99 105 simulation theorists doubt that people s understanding of mental can be explained in terms of a theory at all rather they argue that people s understanding of others is based on internal simulations of how they would act and respond in similar situations jerry fodor is one of objectors that believes in folk
