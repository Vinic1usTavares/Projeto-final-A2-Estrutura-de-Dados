fastest as mercedes drivers were split by sebastian vettel even though latter suffered from electrical problems that lost him track time rosberg in turn was unable to improve on his time set on soft compound tyre due to his super soft run being compromised by yellow flags shown after a spin by romain grosjean behind top three kimi raikkonen was again fourth ahead of daniel ricciardo and valtteri

earlier nico rosberg went on to secure pole position even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13 sebastian vettel was closest to rosberg but a five place grid penalty meant that he would start race from seventh on grid moving valtteri bottas into first row kimi raikkonen was fourth fastest ahead of massa ricciardo perez kvyat and verstappen after qualifying mercedes decided to switch hamilton s car back to his spare power unit which had been rebuilt following its failure at chinese grand prix thereby avoiding a grid penalty which they would have incurred

out to allow for cars and debris to be cleared from track several cars headed to pit lane to repair damage among them daniel ricciardo daniil kvyat and sergio perez order at restart on lap four was rosberg raikkonen bottas massa and hamilton who had stayed clear of incidents to move up to fifth on restart bottas moved ahead of raikkonen while hamilton made a successful move on massa into fourth kvyat s early pit stop left him in 15th at that point and he soon served a ten second stop and go penalty for his contacts with vettel dropping him to last meanwhile hamilton overtook raikkonen to move into third on lap seven felipe nasr came into pit lane on lap 12 to replace a slow puncture on his tyres order at front remained same until bottas became first front runner to pit for fresh tyres on lap 17 hamilton followed suit one lap later but still emerged behind bottas overtaking him into turn two another lap later on lap 20 raikkonen made a pit stop as well coming back out behind hamilton but ahead of bottas all while rosberg led comfortably ahead of max verstappen who made his first stop on lap 23 and dropped back while racing for position on lap 23 sainz forced jolyon palmer

position to kvyat his teammate ricciardo overtook kevin magnussen for eighth on lap 29 but lost position again and was in turn passed by romain grosjean as nico rosberg started to lap backmarkers on lap 31 gap to second placed hamilton started to come down with his advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds to a little more than seven seconds by lap 36 meanwhile verstappen was forced to retire due to power unit failure on lap 34 while running in sixth place as hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem his gap to rosberg started to increase again staying at 13 seconds by lap 41 wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on same lap but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute resulting in him moving into last place on road

lap 49 on next lap button passed sainz for tenth and ricciardo moved ahead of palmer for 12th another lap later rosberg crossed line to take his seventh consecutive victory a feat to that point only

first grand slam of his career meaning he won race recorded fastest lap achieved pole position and led every lap he was 24th driver in history to achieve feat post race thumb bernie ecclestone second from left and vladimir putin second from right in grandstands during race first lap collision between kvyat and vettel that put latter out of race was a major talking point afterwards two had already been embroiled in an argument after previous grand prix in china when vettel felt that kvyat had caused a collision between two ferrari drivers this time around vettel reacted to his retirement with what telegraph described as one of most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years he later demanded an apology from kvyat as did red bull teammate ricciardo who felt that kvyat who pushed vettel into him had ruined his race as well red bull announced that they would summon kvyat to talks about incident calling their race a disaster with helmut marko team s young driver coordinator calling him over motivated kvyat received three penalty points on his licence as a result of incident he himself said after race i apologise to everyone who is involved and i will learn from it i think we have to speak it is easy now to attack me and i guess everyone will but i am ok with that on 5 may red bull announced that they had relegated kvyat back to their junior squad toro rosso team for which he made his debut in for remainder of season switching him with 18 year old max verstappen red bull s team principal christian horner explained driver swap with verstappen s talent also stressing that move to red bull would tie him to team for foreseeable future following multiple collision shortly after start jenson button pressed for changes to be made to turn two of sochi autodrom saying bollard at turn two is problem at start because people are trying to fight through turns two and three i think that needs some looking at apart from kvyat two more drivers received penalty points to their licences two points each were given to carlos sainz jr who was deemed to have forced jolyon palmer off track and esteban gutierrez who collided with nico hulkenberg at start as a result of race nico rosberg cemented his position at top of drivers championship having taken maximum number of 100 points available from first four rounds lewis hamilton followed in second with 57 points while kimi raikkonen moved up to third with 43 points vettel s retirement dropped him to fifth in standings behind daniel ricciardo in constructors standings mercedes increased their points tally to 157 now 81 points clear of second placed ferrari red bull s poor performance saw their advantage over fourth placed williams reduced to just six points classification qualifying 36 1191 35 35
