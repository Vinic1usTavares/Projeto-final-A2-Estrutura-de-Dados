snorts for sven were all provided by frank welker who was not credited in film production development origins thumb concept art from disney s shelved hand drawn film adaptation of snow queen walt disney productions began exploring a possible live action animation biographical film of author and poet hans christian andersen in late 1937 before december premiere of its film snow white and seven dwarfs first feature length hand drawn animated film in march 1940 walt disney suggested a co production to film producer samuel goldwyn where goldwyn s studio would shoot live action sequences of andersen s life and disney s studio would animate andersen s fairy tales animated sequences would be based on some of andersen s best known works such as little mermaid little match girl steadfast tin soldier snow queen thumbelina ugly duckling red shoes and emperor s new clothes however studio encountered difficulty with snow queen as it could not find a way to adapt and relate snow queen character to modern audiences after united states entered world war ii disney focused on making wartime propaganda which caused development on disney goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942 goldwyn went on to produce his own live action film version in 1952 entitled hans christian andersen with danny kaye as andersen charles vidor directing moss hart writing and frank loesser penning songs all of andersen s fairy tales were instead told in song and ballet in live action like rest of film it went on to receive six academy award nominations following year back at disney snow queen along with other andersen fairy tales including little mermaid were shelved later efforts in late 1990s walt disney feature animation started developing a new adaptation of snow queen after tremendous success of their recent films during disney renaissance era 1989 1999 but project was scrapped completely in late 2002 when glen keane reportedly quit project and went on to work on another project which became tangled 2010 even before then harvey fierstein pitched his version of story to disney s executives but was turned down paul and gaetan dick and dave goetz reportedly all tried their hand at it but failed after a number of unsuccessful attempts from 2000 to 2002 disney shelved project again during one of those attempts michael eisner then chairman and chief executive officer of walt disney company offered his support to project and suggested doing it with oscar winning director john lasseter at pixar after then expected renewal of pixar s contract with disney but negotiations between pixar and disney collapsed in january 2004 and that contract was never renewed instead eisner s successor bob iger negotiated disney s purchase of pixar in january 2006 for 7 4 billion and lasseter was promoted to chief creative officer of both pixar and disney animation next attempt started in 2008 when lasseter was able to convince chris buck who co directed 1999 film tarzan for studio to return to walt disney animation studios from sony pictures animation where he had recently co directed oscar nominated 2007 film surf s up that september buck pitched several ideas to lasseter one of which was snow queen buck later revealed that his initial inspiration for snow queen was not andersen fairy tale itself but that he wanted to do something different on definition of true love disney had already done kissed by a prince thing so i thought it was time for something new he recalled it turned out lasseter had been interested in snow queen for a long time back when pixar was working with disney on toy story in 1990s he saw and was blown away by some of pre production art from disney s prior attempts development began under title anna and snow queen which was planned to be traditionally animated according to josh gad he first became involved with film at that early stage when plot was still relatively close to original andersen fairy tale and megan mullally was going to play elsa by early 2010 project entered development hell once again when studio again failed to find a way to make story and snow queen character work revitalization on december 22 2011 following success of tangled disney announced a new title for film frozen and a release date of november 27 2013 a month later it was confirmed that film would be a computer animated feature in stereoscopic 3d instead of originally intended hand drawn animation due to complex elements in script regarding strong visuals kristen anderson lopez and robert lopez joined project and started writing songs for frozen in january 2012 on march 5 2012 it was announced that buck would be directing with lasseter and peter del vecho producing after disney decided to advance snow queen into development again one of main challenges buck and del vecho faced was character of snow queen who was then a villain in their drafts studio has a tradition of screening animated films in development every twelve weeks then holding lengthy notes sessions in which its directors and screenwriters from different projects provide extensive notes on each other s work buck and del vecho presented their storyboards to lasseter and entire production team adjourned to a conference to hear his thoughts on project art director michael giaimo later acknowledged lasseter as game changer of film i remember john saying that latest version of snow queen story that chris buck and his team had come up with was fun very light hearted but characters didn t resonate they aren t multi faceted which is why john felt that audiences wouldn t really be able to connect with them production team then addressed film s problems drafting several variations on snow queen story until characters and story felt relevant at that stage first major breakthrough was decision to rewrite film s protagonist anna who was based on gerda character from snow queen as younger sibling of elsa thereby effectively establishing a family dynamic between characters this was unusual in that relationships between sisters are rarely used as a major plot element in american animated films with notable exception of disney s lilo stitch 2002 to fully explore unique dynamics of such relationships disney animation convened a sister summit at which women from all over studio who grew up with sisters were asked to discuss their relationships with their sisters writing in march 2012 jennifer lee one of writers of wreck it ralph was brought in as screenwriter before lee was brought on board efforts of previous screen and songwriters had imploded which allowed songwriters to put a lot of their dna into new script production team essentially started over and had 17 months which resulted in a very intense schedule and implied a lot of choices had to be made fast while developing story jennifer lee and chris buck drew influence from several sources they said biggest influence on film was country of norway when art department visited country drawing inspiration from country s culture and environment they also cited influence of several films including hayao miyazaki s anime productions along with david lean productions lawrence of arabia 1962 and doctor zhivago 1965 stating that they were inspired by their sense of epic adventure and that big scope and scale and then intimacy of funny quirky characters according to lee several core concepts were already in place such as film s frozen heart hook that was a concept and phrase an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart they already knew ending involved true love in sense of emotional bond between siblings not romance in that anna was going to save elsa we didn t know how or why lee said edwin catmull president of disney animation told her early on about film s ending you have to earn that ending if you do it will be great if you don t it will suck however final version differed sharply from earlier ones in original elsa had been evil from start kidnapping anna from her own wedding to intentionally freeze her heart and later descending upon town with an army of snowmen whole second act was about anna trying to get to hans and to kiss him and then elsa trying to stop her buck revealed that original plot attempted to make anna sympathetic by focusing on her frustration as spare in relation to heir pacing of revised plot focused on musical comedy with less action and adventure a breakthrough was composition of song let it go by lopez and anderson lopez which forced a reimagining of elsa as a more complex vulnerable and sympathetic character in daily telegraphs words songwriters saw elsa not as a villain but as a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift bobby and kristen started talking about what would it feel like to be elsa lee said and this concept of letting out who she is that she s kept to herself for so long and she s alone and free but then sadness of fact that last moment is she s alone del vecho explained that let it go changed elsa into a person ruled by fear and anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive which caused lee to rewrite first act and then that rippled through entire movie so that was when we really found movie and who these characters were another breakthrough was developing plot twist that prince hans having not even been in first drafts would be revealed as true villain only near end del vecho said if we were going to make ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that hans was answer when he s not answer it s kristoff i f you can get audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it other way lee acknowledged that hans was written as sociopathic and twisted it was difficult to lay foundation for anna s belated turn to kristoff without also making hans betrayal of anna too predictable in that audience had to feel her feeling something but not quite understanding it because minute it is understood it deflated in earlier drafts anna openly flirted with kristoff at their first meeting but that was changed after walt disney studios chairman alan horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since anna was already engaged to hans lee had to work through how to write anna s personality some of her colleagues felt anna should be more dysfunctional and co dependent lee disagreed but it took her almost a year to convincingly articulate this is what anna s journey is no more than that no less than that in end lee successfully argued for a simple coming of age story where she goes from having a naive view of life and love because she s lonely to most sophisticated and mature view of love where she s capable of ultimate love which is sacrifice lee also had to let go of ideas that she liked such as a scene portraying anna and elsa s relationship as teenagers because they needed to maintain separation between anna and elsa to construct anna and elsa s relationship lee found inspiration from her own relationship with her older sister lee called her older sister my elsa in an op ed in los angeles times and walked red carpet with her at 86th academy awards lee explained h to lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults that was a big part of my life team also turned olaf from elsa s obnoxious sidekick into anna s comically innocent one lee s initial response to original mean version of olaf had been kill f ing snowman and she found olaf by far hardest character to deal with problem of how anna would save elsa at climax was solved by story artist john ripa at story meeting where ripa pitched his take on story lasseter said i ve never seen anything like that before followed by a standing ovation along way team abandoned a lot of detail of earlier drafts such as a troll with a brooklyn accent to explain backstory behind elsa s magical powers and a regent for whom lee was hoping to cast comedian louis c k these were excised because they amounted to a much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this 90 minute film as del vecho put it more we tried to explain things at beginning more complicated it got given lee s extensive involvement in development process she was promoted to co director by studio heads lasseter and catmull in august 2012 which was announced that november making lee first woman to direct a full length animated film from walt disney animation studios lee later said that she was really moved by a lot of what chris had done and that they shared a vision of story having very similar sensibilities by november 2012 team thought they had finally cracked film s story but according to del vecho in late february 2013 it was realized that it still wasn t working which necessitated more rewriting from february through june 2013 he explained we rewrote songs we took out characters and changed everything and suddenly movie gelled but that was close in hindsight piece of cake but during it was a big struggle looking back anderson lopez joked she and lopez thought they could have ended up working as birthday party clown s if final product pull ed down their careers and recalled that we were really writing up until last minute in june five months before announced release date songwriters finally got film working when they composed song for first time in forever which in lopez s words became linchpin of whole movie that month disney conducted test screenings of part completed film with two audiences one of families and other of adults in phoenix arizona at which lasseter and catmull were present lee recalled that it was moment when they realized they had something because reaction was huge catmull told her afterwards you did it casting actress kristen bell was cast as voice of anna on march 5 2012 filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks bell had recorded when she was young in which she performed several songs from little mermaid including part of your world bell completed her frozen recording sessions while she was pregnant and rerecorded some lines after her pregnancy as her voice had deepened bell was called in to re record dialogue for film probably 20 times which is normal for lead roles in disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving as for her approach to role of anna bell enthused that she had dreamed of being in a disney animated film since she was four years old saying i always loved disney animation but there was something about females that was unattainable to me their posture was too good and they were too well spoken and i feel like i really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and and more excitable and awkward i m really proud of that idina menzel a broadway veteran was cast as elsa menzel had formerly auditioned for tangled but did not get part however tangleds casting director jamie sparer roberts preserved a recording of menzel s performance on her iphone and on basis of that asked her to audition along with bell for frozen before they were officially cast menzel and bell deeply impressed directors and producers at an early table read after reading entire script out loud they sang wind beneath my wings together as a duet since no music had been composed yet bell had suggested that idea when she visited menzel at her california home to prepare together for table read songwriters were also present for table read anderson lopez said lasseter was in heaven upon hearing menzel and bell sing in harmony and from that moment forward he insisted kristen bell and idina menzel have to be in movie lee said they sung it like sisters and what you mean to me a nd there wasn t a dry eye in house after they sang between december 2012 and june 2013 casting of additional roles was announced including jonathan groff as kristoff alan tudyk as duke of weselton santino fontana as prince hans and josh gad as olaf animation similar to tangled frozen employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer generated imagery cgi and traditional hand drawn animation from beginning buck knew giaimo was best candidate to develop style he had in mind which would draw from best disney hand drawn films of 1950s disney little golden books and mid century modern design and persuaded him to come back to disney to serve as art director for frozen buck lasseter and giaimo were all old friends who had first met at california institute of arts and giaimo had previously served as art director for disney s pocahontas 1995 which buck had worked on as a supervising animator to create look of frozen giaimo began pre production research by reading extensively about entire region of scandinavia and visiting danish themed city of solvang near los angeles but eventually zeroed in on norway in particular because 80 percent of visuals that appealed to him were from norway emanuel levy frozen setting and visual look emanuel levy cinema 24 7 december 26 2013 disney eventually sponsored three research field trips animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to jackson hole wyoming to experience walking running and falling in deep snow in a variety of types of attire including long skirts which both female and male personnel tried on while lighting and arts teams visited an ice hotel in quebec city quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice finally giaimo and several artists traveled to norway to draw inspiration from its mountains fjords architecture and culture we had a very short time schedule for this film so our main focus was really to get story right but we knew that john lasseter is keen on truth in material and creating a believable world and again that doesn t mean it s a realistic world but a believable one it was important to see scope and scale of norway and important for our animators to know what it s like del vecho said there is a real feeling of lawrence of arabia scope and scale to this he finished during 2012 while giaimo and animators and artists conducted preparatory research and developed film s overall look production team was still struggling to develop a compelling script as explained above that problem was not adequately solved until november 2012 and script would later require even more significant revisions after that point as a result single most daunting challenge facing animation team was a short schedule of less than 12 months to turn lee s still evolving shooting script into an actual film other films like pixar s toy story 2 had been successfully completed on even shorter schedules but a short schedule necessarily meant late nights overtime and stress lee estimated total size of entire team on frozen to be around 600 to 650 people including around 70 lighting people 70 plus animators and 15 to 20 storyboard artists del vecho explained how film s animation team was organized on this movie we do have character leads supervising animators on specific characters animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it s always under one lead i think it was different on tangled for example but we chose to do it this way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to crew hyrum osmond supervising animator on olaf is quiet but he has a funny wacky personality so we knew he d bring a lot of comedy to it anna s animator becky bresee it s her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead anna acting coach warner loughlin was brought in to help film s animators understand characters they were creating in order to get general feeling of each scene some animators did their own acting i actually film myself acting scene out which i find very helpful said animation supervisor rebecca wilson bresee this helped her discover elements that made scene feel real and believable elsa s supervising animator was wayne unten who asked for that role because he was fascinated by complexity of character unten carefully developed elsa s facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against anna s fearlessness he also studied videos from menzel s recording sessions and animated elsa s breathing to match menzel s breathing head of animation lino disalvo said goal for film was to animate most believable cg characters you ve ever seen regarding look and nature of film s cinematography giaimo was greatly influenced by jack cardiff s work in black narcissus 1947 according to him it lent a hyper reality to film because this is a movie with such scale and we have norwegian fjords to draw from i really wanted to explore depth from a design perspective since i was stressing horizontal and vertical aspects and what fjords provide it was perfect we encased sibling story in scale ted d mccord s work in sound of music was another major influence for giaimo it was also giaimo s idea that frozen should be produced in cinemascope widescreen process which was approved by lasseter this made frozen first animated film to be completely produced in cinemascope since 2000 s titan a e giaimo also wanted to ensure that norway s fjords architecture and rosemaling folk art were critical factors in designing environment of arendelle giaimo whose background is in traditional animation said that art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors which is typically ill advised in computer animation for further authenticity a live reindeer named sage was brought into studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for character sven another important issue giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes in that he knew from start it would be a costume film to realize that vision he brought in character designer jean gillmore to act as a dedicated costume designer while traditional animation simply integrates costume design with character design and treats clothing as merely part of characters computer generated animation regards costume as almost a separate entity with its own properties and behaviors and frozen required a level of as yet untried detail down to minutiae like fabrics buttons trim and stitching gillmore explained that her general approach was to meld historic silhouettes of 1840 western europe give or take with shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early norway circa 19th century this meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet linen and silk during production giaimo and gillmore ran around supplying various departments with real world samples to use as references they were able to draw upon both studio s own in house library of fabric samples and resources of walt disney parks and resorts costume division in fullerton california film s look development artists disney job title for texture artists created digitally painted simulation of appearance of surfaces while other departments dealt with movement rigging and weight thickness and lighting of textile animation during production film s english title was changed from snow queen to frozen a decision that drew comparisons to another disney film tangled peter del vecho explained that title frozen came up independently of title tangled it s because to us it represents movie frozen plays on level of ice and snow but also frozen relationship frozen heart that has to be thawed we don t think of comparisons between tangled and frozen though he also mentioned that film will still retain its original title snow queen in some countries because that just resonated stronger in some countries than frozen maybe there s a richness to snow queen in country s heritage and they just wanted to emphasize that technology development thumb left test animation demonstrating snow effects employed in film studio also developed several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots particularly heavy and deep snow and its interactions with characters disney wanted an all encompassing and organic tool to provide snow effects but not require switching between different methods as noted above several disney artists and special effects personnel traveled to wyoming to experience walking through deep snow dr kenneth a professor from california institute of technology was invited to give lectures to effects group on how snow and ice form and why snowflakes are unique using this knowledge effects group created a snowflake generator that allowed them to randomly create 2 000 unique snowflake shapes for film another challenge that studio had to face was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality according to principal software engineer andrew selle snow s not really a fluid it s not really a solid it breaks apart it can be compressed into snowballs all of these different effects are very difficult to capture simultaneously in order to achieve this software engineers used advanced mathematics material point method and physics with assistance from mathematics researchers at university of california los angeles to create a snow simulator software application called matterhorn tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in film including several key sequences software engineer alexey referred to snow as an important character in film therefore it attracted special attention from filmmakers when you stretch it snow will break into chunks since snow doesn t have any connections it doesn t have a mesh it can break very easily so that was an important property we took advantage of explained selle there you see kristoff walking through and see his footprints breaking snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see anna being pulled out and snow having packed together and broken into pieces it s very organic how that happens you don t see that they re pieces already you see snow as one thing and then breaking up tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow as it ensured that snow reacted naturally to each step other tools designed to help artists complete complicated effects included spaces which allowed olaf s parts to be moved around and rebuilt flourish which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art directed snow which helped preview final look of snow especially when characters were interacting with an area of snow by walking through a volume and tonic which enabled artists to sculpt their characters hair as procedural volumes tonic also aided in animating fur and hair elements such as elsa s hair which contains 420 000 computer generated strands while average number for a real human being is only 100 000 number of character rigs in frozen is 312 and number of simulated costumes also reached 245 cloth rigs which were far beyond all other disney films to date fifty effects artists and lighting artists worked together on technology to create one single shot in which elsa builds her ice palace its complexity required 30 hours to render each frame with 4 000 computers rendering one frame at a time besides 3d effects filmmakers also used 2d artwork and drawings for specific elements and sequences in film including elsa s magic and snow sculptures as well as freezing fountains and floors effects group created a capture stage where entire world of frozen gets displayed on monitors which can be filmed on special cameras to operate a three dimensional scene we can take this virtual set that s mimicking all of my actions and put it into any one of our scenes in film said technology manager evan goldberg scandinavian and sami inspiration setting was principally based on norway and cultural influences in film come from scandinavian culture several landmarks in norway appear in film including akershus fortress in oslo nidaros cathedral in trondheim and bryggen in bergen numerous other typical cultural scandinavian elements are also included in film such as stave churches trolls viking ships a hot spring fjord horses clothes and food such as lutefisk a maypole is also present in film as well as brief appearance of runes in a book that anna and elsa s father opens to figure out where trolls live a scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to perennial norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly film also contains several elements specifically drawn from sami culture such as usage of reindeer for transportation and equipment used to control these clothing styles outfits of ice cutters and parts of musical score decorations such as those on castle pillars and kristoff s sled are also in styles inspired by sami decorations during their field work in norway disney s team for inspiration visited a sami family owned company in village that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events arendelle was inspired by a branch of norway s longest fjord which has been listed as a unesco world heritage site while a castle in oslo with beautiful hand painted patterns on all four walls served as inspiration for kingdom s royal castle interior filmmakers trip to norway provided essential knowledge for animators to come up with design aesthetic for film in terms of color light and atmosphere according to giaimo there were three important factors that they had acquired from norway research trip fjords and massive vertical rock formations characteristic of fjords which serve as setting for secluded kingdom of arendelle medieval stave churches whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired castle compound and rosemaling folk art whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed architecture decor and costumes music and sound design thumb upright left christophe beck composed film s score songs for frozen were written and composed by husband and wife songwriting team of robert lopez and kristen anderson lopez both of whom had previously worked with disney animation on winnie pooh 2011 also produced by del vecho who then hired them for frozen and before that with disney parks on finding nemo musical 2007 lopez first heard disney animation s pitch while in los angeles working on book of mormon but disney was so eager to get both of them on board that production team traveled to new york city to also pitch film in person to anderson lopez who was busy raising couple s two young daughters lopez believes disney was particularly interested in his wife s strong story talent decision of course was easy whenever disney asks if you want to do a fairy tale musical you say yes about 23 minutes of film are dedicated to their musical numbers because they live in new york city collaborating closely with production team in burbank required two hour long transcontinental nearly every weekday for about 14 months for each song they composed they recorded a demo in their home studio with both of them singing lyrics and lopez accompanying on piano then emailed it to burbank for discussion at next videoconference lopez and anderson lopez were aware of fact that their work would be compared to that of alan menken and howard ashman from disney renaissance era and whenever they felt lost they asked what would ashman do in end they wrote 25 songs for film of which eight made it into final version one song for first time in forever had a reprise and other let it go was covered by demi lovato over final credits for a total of ten songs seven of 17 that did not make it were later released on deluxe edition soundtrack in february 2013 christophe beck was hired to score film following his work on a disney animated short film released year prior to frozen it was revealed on september 14 2013 that sami musician frode fjellheim s would be film s opening song as it contains elements of traditional sami singing style if necessary view a rough translation for reference music producers recruited a norwegian linguist to assist with lyrics for an old norse song written for elsa s coronation and traveled to trondheim norway to record all female choir cantus for a piece inspired by traditional sami music under supervision of sound engineer david boucher lead cast members began recording film s vocal tracks in october 2012 at sunset sound recording studio in hollywood before songs had been orchestrated meaning they heard only lopez s demo piano track in their headphones as they sang most of dialogue was recorded at roy e disney animation building in burbank under supervision of original dialogue mixer gabriel guy who also mixed film s sound effects some dialogue was recorded after recording songs at both sunset sound and capitol studios for scenes involving anna and elsa both studios offered vocal isolation booths where menzel and bell could read dialogue with line of sight with one another while avoiding between their respective tracks additional dialogue was recorded at an adr facility on walt disney studios lot in burbank across street from disney animation building and at soundtrack group s new york studio since production team had to work around busy schedules of film s new york based cast members like fontana lopez and anderson lopez s piano vocal scores for songs along with vocal tracks were sent to salem oregon based dave metzger for arrangement and orchestration metzger also orchestrated a significant portion of beck s score for orchestral film score beck paid homage to norway and inspired setting by employing regional instruments such as and traditional vocal techniques such as beck worked with lopez and anderson lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements in score trio s goal was to create a cohesive musical journey from beginning to end similarly beck s scoring mixer casey stone who also supervised recording of score worked with boucher to align their microphone setups to ensure transitions between songs and score were seamless even though they were separately recorded on different dates final orchestrations of both songs and score were all recorded at eastwood scoring stage on warner bros pictures studio lot in burbank by an 80 piece orchestra featuring 32 vocalists including native norwegian christine hals boucher supervised recording of anderson lopez and lopez s songs from july 22 to 24 2013 then stone supervised recording of beck s score from september 3 to 6 and 9 to 10 boucher mixed songs at eastwood stage while stone mixed score at beck s personal studio in santa monica california regarding sound of frozen director jennifer lee stated that sound played a huge part in making film visceral and transported she explained i n letting it tell story emotionally sound of ice when it s at its most dangerous just makes you shudder complete silence at climax of film right after anna freezes was lasseter s idea one he really wanted in that scene even ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out in order to make it feel unusual lee explained that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended to obtain certain snow and ice sound effects sound designer odin benitez traveled to mammoth mountain california to record them at a frozen lake however foley work for film was recorded on foley stage on warner bros pictures lot by a warner bros crew foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds 22 6 kg of snow ice while working to help them record all necessary snow and ice sounds for film because film s visuals were finalized so late five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded corresponding to five different types of snow then one was later selected during mixing to match snow as rendered in final version of each scene one issue that production team was particular about was sound of elsa s footsteps in ice palace which required eight attempts including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice they ended up using a mix of three sounds although vocals music sound effects and almost all dialogue were all recorded elsewhere final re recording mix to dolby atmos format was performed at disney lot by casey e fluhr of disney digital studio services localization like other disney media products which are often localized through disney character voices international frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages compared with only 15 for lion king a major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching menzel s warm vocal tone and three octave vocal range in their native languages rick dempsey unit s senior executive regarded process of translating film as exceptionally challenging he explained it s a difficult juggling act to get right intent of lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to music and then you have to go back and adjust for lip sync it requires a lot of patience and precision lopez explained that they were told by disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs to ensure film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics for casting of dubbed versions disney required native speakers in order to ensure that film feels local they used bell and menzel s voices as their blueprint in casting and tried to match voices as much as possible meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill 41 slots for elsa alone for nearly 15 dubbed versions they cast elsa s singing and speaking parts separately since not all vocalists could act part they were singing after casting all other roles for all 41 languages international cast ended up including more than 900 people who voiced their roles through approximately 1 300 recording sessions italian version of movie was awarded best foreign dubbing worldwide frozen snow kralstvo kralstvo frozen xue qi yuan mo kei yun enchanted snow el

commercial analysis ray subers writing for box office mojo compared film to disney s 2010 animated feature tangled by saying that film s story was not as immediately interesting and that marketing has yet to sell this to boys way tangled did noting that 2013 holiday season thanksgiving and christmas lacked compelling content for families subers predicted that film would play well all way through christmas and end up grossing 185 million in north america similar to wreck it ralph boxoffice noted success of previous disney s animated films released during holiday season tangled and wreck it ralph but argued that cast might not attract audiences due to lack of major stars they issued a 170 000 000 north america box office forecast for film chris agar from screenrant expressed a similar opinion he cited a string of recent box office successes of studio and thought that frozen would fill a void of kid friendly films in marketplace but did not expect it to surpass catching fire in terms of box office gross clayton dillard of slant magazine commented that while trailers made film seem pallid positive critical reviews could attract interest from both core demographics and adult audiences and therefore he believed frozen stood a good chance of surpassing tangleds thanksgiving three day opening record brad brevet of com described film s marketing as a severely hit and miss campaign which could affect its box office performance after frozen finished its first weekend with a record 93 6 million during thanksgiving most box office watchers predicted that it would end up grossing between 250 and 300 million in north america at time box office mojo reissued a 250 million box office gross prediction for north america box office mojo noted that it would be exclusive choice for family audiences and attributed its successful opening to strong word of mouth and studio s marketing which highlighted connection between frozen and disney s previous successful releases like tangled and wreck it ralph as well as elements of humor when frozen became a box office success bilge ebiri of vulture analyzed film s elements and suggested eight factors that might have led to its success he thought frozen managed to capture spirit of disney renaissance films and early disney features such as snow white and seven dwarfs and cinderella he also wrote that film has olaf a wisecracking irreverent sidekick with mild humor which is a requirement of modern animated kids movies and its witty catchy songs were pretty good furthermore ebiri noted that frozen was a revisionist film that didn t have a typical villain elsa person who should be villain didn t turn out to be a villain but a girl who s having trouble she was one who created most of challenges for film s more typical heroes princess anna story of two sisters who were separated as they grew up held real life overtones for many audience members who had siblings and struggle of elsa to overcome shame and fear of her powers was also relatable finally he identified several factors which he believed attracted female audiences two strong female characters a twist on usual romantic subplot when traditional prince charming hans turned out to be a gold digging villain and act of true love which saved anna was her own sacrifice in saving elsa scott davis of forbes credited film s commercial success to its marketing aimed at both sexes and to success of its soundtrack commercial success of frozen in japan was considered to be a phenomenon which received widespread media coverage released in that market as anna and snow queen film increased its gross each week in its three first weeks of release and only started to drop in fourth while other films usually peak in opening week and decline in latter ones frozen has received over 7 million admissions in japan as of april 16 and nearly 18 7 million admissions as of june 23 many cinemagoers were reported to have watched both original and japanese dubbed version japan today also reported that local dubbed version was particularly popular in country gavin j blair of hollywood reporter commented on film s earnings in japan even after its 9 6 million y 986 4 million three day opening a record bow for a disney animation in japan few would have predicted kind of numbers frozen has now racked up disney s head of distribution dave hollis said in an interview that it s become very clear that themes and emotions of frozen transcend geography but what s going on in japan is extraordinary frozens success doesn t benefit from a general appetite for american films in japan as reported by international business times but according to akira of usc school of cinematic arts there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon besides fact that animated films are held in great regard in japan and disney brand name with all of its heritage is extremely valuable biggest reason is primary audience 13 to 17 year old teenage girls he further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping japanese pop culture and frozen has so many elements that appeal to them with its story of a young girl with power and mystique who finds her own sort of good in herself he compared film s current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with titanic in 1997 when millions of japanese teen girls turned out to watch leonard o dicaprio go under several times and thought same would happen with frozen another reason that contributed to film s success in market was that disney took great care in choosing high quality voice actors for japanese dubbed version since japan s pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences disney japan s marketing project leader for frozen said in an interview with wall street journal we really put effort into finding actors who could not only play role but also belt out tunes as well we found perfect match in takako matsu and sayaka kanda and they really added a whole new dimension to storytelling when asked about success of frozen director chris buck stated we never expected anything like this we just hoped to make a movie that did as well as tangled i hoped audience would embrace it and respond to it but there s no way we could have predicted this he cited a number of reasons for film s popularity there are characters that people relate to songs are so strong and memorable we also have some flawed characters which is what jen lee and i like to do we essentially create two imperfect princesses as frozen approached first anniversary of its release menzel mentioned film s continuing popularity in an october 2014 interview it s just a remarkable thing usually you do a project and it has its moment this just feels like it keeps going critical response frozen opened to positive reviews with several critics comparing it favorably to films of disney renaissance particularly little mermaid beauty and beast aladdin and lion king some journalists felt that film s success marked a second disney renaissance film was praised for its visuals themes musical numbers screenplay and vocal performances especially those of bell menzel and gad let it go musical sequence was also particularly praised by critics review aggregation website rotten tomatoes reports that 90 of critics gave film a positive review based on 241 reviews with an average rating of 7 69 10 site s critical consensus reads beautifully animated smartly written and stocked with singalong songs frozen adds another worthy entry to disney canon metacritic which determines a rating out of 100 from reviews of mainstream critics calculated a score of 74 based on 43 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews cinemascore gave frozen an a on an a to f scale

pointed out that 55 of audiences identified let it go as their favorite song while do you want to build a snowman and for first time in forever held proportions of 21 and 9 respectively frozen was named seventh best film of 2013 by richard corliss of time and kyle smith of new york post alonso duralde of thewrap wrote that film is best animated musical to come out of disney since tragic death of lyricist howard ashman whose work on little mermaid and beauty and beast helped build studio s modern animated division into what it is today he also said that while it lags tiniest bit on its way to conclusion script really delivers it offers characters to care about along with some nifty twists and surprises along way todd mccarthy of hollywood reporter observed frozen as a true musical and wrote you can practically see broadway musical frozen is destined to become while watching disney s 3d animated princess tale mccarthy described film as energetic humorous and not too cloying as well as first hollywood film in many years to warn of global cooling rather than warming this tuneful toon upgrades what has been a lackluster year for big studio animated fare and beginning with its thanksgiving opening should live up to box office expectations as one of studio s hoped for holiday spanning blockbusters kyle smith of new york post awarded film 3 5 out of 4 stars and praised film as a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core brilliant broadway style songs and a crafty plot its first and third acts are better than jokey middle but this is rare example of a walt disney animation studios effort that reaches as deep as a pixar film scott mendelson of forbes wrote frozen is both a declaration of disney s renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of disney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity it s also a just plain terrific bit of family entertainment los angeles times extolled film s ensemble voice talent and elaborate musical sequences and declared frozen was a welcome return to greatness for walt disney animation studios entertainment weeklys owen gleiberman gave film a b grade and labeled it as a squarely enchanting fairy tale that shows you how definition of what s fresh in animation can shift richard corliss of time stated that it s great to see disney returning to its roots and blooming anew creating superior musical entertainment that draws on walt disney tradition of animation splendor and verve of broadway present richard roeper wrote that film was an absolute delight from start to finish both michael phillips of chicago tribune and stephen holden of new york times praised film s characters and musical sequences which also drew comparisons to theatrics found in wicked emma dibdin of digital spy awarded film five out of five stars and called film a new disney classic and an exhilarating joyous human story that s as frequently laugh out loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant hot on heels of 90th anniversary it s impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything disney is at its best frozen was also praised in norwegian sami media as showcasing sami culture to a broad audience in a good way composer frode fjellheim was lauded by norwegian sami president for his contributions to film during president s 2014 new year s speech scott foundas of variety was less impressed with film describing it as formulaic though he praised its voice acting and technical artistry tactile snow capped arendelle landscape including elsa s ice castle retreat is frozens other true marvel enhanced by 3d and decision to shoot in widescreen a nod to cinemascope richness of sleeping beauty and lady and tramp that s almost but not quite enough to make up for somewhat slack plotting and generic nature of main characters neither princess here is a patch on tangleds babe in woods rapunzel while both hans and kristoff are cut from pretty standard issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third act twist somewhat ups ante only olaf is unimpeachable get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own seattle times gave film two out of four stars stating while it is an often gorgeous film with computer generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors important thing that glues all this stuff together story is sadly lacking joe williams of st louis post dispatch also criticized story as film s weakest point writing on roger ebert s website christy lemire gave a mixed review in which she awarded two and a half stars out of four christy lemire november 27 2013 frozen rogerebert com ebert digital llc retrieved december 26 2013 lemire praised visuals and performance of let it go as well as positive messages frozen sends however she referred to film as cynical and criticized it as an attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much she also noted similarity between elsa and another well known fictional female who unleashes paranormal powers when agitated carrie white controversies portrayal of emotions allegations of sexism occurred following a statement by lino disalvo film s head of animation who said to fan voice s jenna busch historically speaking animating female characters are really really difficult because they have to go through these range of emotions but you have to keep them pretty however a disney spokesperson later told time that disalvo s quote was widely misinterpreted stating that he was describing some technical aspects of cg animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters director lee also said that disalvo s words were recklessly taken out of context and that he was talking in very technical terms about cg animation it is hard no matter what gender is i felt horrible for him she said in an august 2014 interview disalvo re emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2d emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3d character model translating that emotional range onto a cg character is one of most difficult parts of process male female snowman animal he added really sad thing is people took that catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere people didn t get back to me for comments and sad thing is that s way internet works they don t want truth perceived lgbt parallels several viewers outside film industry such as evangelical pastors and commentators argued that frozen promotes normalization of homosexuality while others believed that main character elsa represents a positive image of lgbt youth viewing film and song let it go as a metaphor for coming out these claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and lgbt community writing for film international robert has argued that while film offers a superficially progressive vision of homosexuality it perpetuates conservative notions about sexuality and gender whereas elsa s female homosexuality is rendered visually pleasurable to a male gaze male transgressions of heterosexuality are coded in various negative ways when asked about perceptions of a homosexual undertone in film lee said we know what we made but at same time i feel like once we hand film over it belongs to world so i don t like to say anything and let fans talk i think it s up to them she also mentioned that disney films were made in different eras and were all celebrated for different

cultural assault of frozen at preschool and all social and extracurricular activities and how he had arranged for a skype call with lead actress bell after laszlo began asking why film was made when

hollywood reporter lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for frozen to having to apologize when they said we re still listening to those songs with their children lee also said that she used film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter who had experienced bullying at school and admitted that she herself as a
