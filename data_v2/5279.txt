1947 atlantic hurricane season was first atlantic hurricane season to have tropical storms labeled by united states air force season officially began on june 16 1947 and ended on november 1 1947 these dates conventionally delimit period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in atlantic basin however first tropical cyclone developed on june 13 while final system was absorbed by a cold front on december 1 there were 10 tropical storms 5 of them attained hurricane status while two became major hurricanes which are category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson scale operationally third tropical storm was considered two separate tropical cyclones resulting in storm receiving two names eighth tropical storm went undetected and was not listed in hurdat until 2014 nearly all tropical storms impacted land during season some of which caused many fatalities and left destruction second storm caused severe flooding and mudslides in mexico leaving at least 48 dead and 43 others missing in september strongest and costliest hurricane of season fort lauderdale hurricane left severe damage in florida louisiana and mississippi due to strong winds heavy rainfall and abnormally high tides there were 51 fatalities and about 160 2 million 1947 usd in damage ninth storm also known as cape sable hurricane caused additional flooding in south florida and left wind damage in georgia and south carolina storm left about 20 million in damage overall systems of season caused about 184 2 million in damage and at least 101 fatalities toc season summary atlantic hurricane season officially began on june 16 1947 however tropical cyclogenesis began with development of a tropical depression on june 13 there was a total of seven tropical storms five of them strengthened into hurricanes while two of those became major hurricanes category 3 or higher on modern day saffir simpson scale final system a tropical depression was absorbed by a cold front on december 1 one month after official end of season on november 1 1947 four hurricanes and four tropical storms made landfall during season overall tropical cyclones of this season caused about 184 2 million in damage and at least 101 fatalities united states death toll of 53 was low compared to 20 years earlier in spite of fort lauderdale george and cape sable king hurricanes crossing urban areas weather bureau attributed this to adequate warnings from hurricane warning office and mass evacuations a then record total of 159 bulletins were issued from weather bureau offices first tropical cyclone of season a tropical depression existed from june 13 to june 14 however activity went dormant for over a month and a half on july 31 baker developed in gulf of mexico in august two tropical storms developed charlie and dog easy september featured five tropical cyclones including fox george and how as well as two tropical depressions george more commonly known as fort lauderdale hurricane was most intense tropical cyclone of season peaking as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph 230 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of october also had five tropical cyclone including item king love an unnamed storm and a tropical depression with four tropical storms this was most in month of october since 1933 season s final tropical cyclone a depression developed on november 28 and was absorbed by a cold front on december 1 season s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 88 ace is broadly speaking a measure of power of hurricane multiplied by length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces it is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph 63 km h which is tropical storm strength systems tropical storm one baker a low pressure area in bay of campeche developed into a tropical depression at 06 00 utc on july 31 moving north northwestward depression deepened into a tropical storm six hours later storm identified as baker by united states air force then intensified slowly and gradually curved to northwest at 00 00 utc on august 2 storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph 85 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of latter was observed at port isabel texas while former was estimated based on pressure wind relationship simultaneously baker made landfall in tamaulipas about south of mexico united states border system weakened to a tropical depression by 12 00 utc on august 2 and dissipated near reynosa shortly thereafter small craft were advised between lower and middle coast of texas were advised to remain in port american red cross recommended that residents of port aransas evacuate as a precaution but mainly only tourists in area fled most of damage was done to cotton crops due to heavy rainfall with up to observed at raymondville however precipitation was more beneficial than damaging storm caused just over 2 million in damage hurricane two charlie a tropical depression developed about 125 mi 200 km north northwest of colombia early on august 9 depression moved northwestward across caribbean sea and remained weak for a few days before reaching tropical storm status on 00 00 utc on august 12 about 16 hours later cyclone known to united states air force as tropical storm charlie made landfall near punta allen quintana roo with winds of after entering bay of campeche on august 13 system resumed strengthening becoming a hurricane early on august 14 later that day charlie peaked as a category 2 hurricane on modern day saffir simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph 175 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of both of which were observed by during a reconnaissance aircraft flight on august 15 system curved southwestward and made landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas around 10 00 utc at same intensity storm rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated by 06 00 utc on august 16 heavy rainfall strong winds and storm surge walloped portions of mexico especially in tampico and state of veracruz in former storm surge forced evacuation of residents near coast winds unroofed several homes and resulted in closure of many businesses signs atop buildings fell while some equipment used by servicio meteorologico nacional was destroyed additionally city of tampico was left without electricity for about five hours heavy rainfall caused small lakes and rivers to rise rapidly flooding homes in poorer sections and forcing a number of families to flee to higher ground in el one of worst impacted communities panuco river exceeded its bank inundating village with over of water most of one story buildings were submerged while water approached second story of taller buildings thirty six deaths occurred in city in 24 homes were destroyed flooding and mudslides in san luis potosi resulted in another 12 deaths overall hurricane caused at least 48 fatalities and left 43 other people missing hurricane three dog easy a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression just northeast of havana cuba late on august 18 depression briefly moved inland along north coast of cuba before emerging into gulf of mexico early on august 19 at 06 00 utc system intensified into a tropical storm shortly thereafter cyclone curved northwestward before turning westward late on august 19 about 24 hours later storm curved north northwestward at 14 00 utc on august 22 system made landfall near golden meadow louisiana with winds of 45 mph 75 km h however cyclone turned southwestward and soon reemerged into gulf of mexico storm then curved northwestward on august 23 and finally began to strengthen significantly at 06 00 utc on august 24 it intensified into a hurricane about 12 hours later hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph 130 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of latter was observed on land and was used to estimate former cyclone made landfall in galveston texas at 22 00 utc moving inland system weakened to a tropical storm early on august 25 and to a tropical depression later that day thereafter depression slowly weakened until dissipating over oklahoma on august 27 operationally this cyclone was believed to have been two systems causing united states air force to inadvertently assign it two names dog and easy storm left little impact in louisiana with mainly squalls reported and winds up to observed at grand isle in texas tides reached above normal in galveston a sustained wind speed exceeding was observed in city damaging roofs signs and interior of dwellings numerous power wires were downed causing electricity to be shut down to avoid residents coming into contact with a live wire but not before a man touched a downed power line and died in galveston county but outside city crop damage reached about 32 500 while property damage totaled about 150 000 at texas city communication lines were downed signs were toppled homes were deroofed and boats were washed ashore or set adrift in dickinson several dwellings were destroyed farther north 35 to 40 people at a prison near houston escaped in midst of storm though 10 of them were recaptured by following day overall total damage was estimated at 757 000 with 500 000 of that amount incurred to buildings and improvements while remainder was to crops hurricane four george fort lauderdale hurricane of 1947 a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression about 175 mi 280 km west southwest of senegal early on september 4 several hours later depression strengthened into a tropical storm which was named george by united states air force in real time after moving generally westward for several days storm failed to intensify significantly and turned northwestward on september 10 by following day george finally became a category 1 hurricane storm intensified further over next few days and later peaked as a category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph 230 km h and a minimum barometric pressure of early on september 16 george weakened to a category 3 and curved westward while approaching northern bahamas at 19 00 utc hurricane struck abaco islands with winds of 120 mph 195 km h in bahamas storm produced a large storm surge and strong winds damaging or destroying many homes and docks on western end of grand bahama thereafter george continued westward and re intensified into a category 4 at 12 00 utc on september 17 just three and a half hours before storm made landfall near fort lauderdale florida with winds of 130 mph 210 km h in florida advance warnings and stringent building codes were credited with minimizing structural damage and reducing loss of life to 17 people but nevertheless widespread flooding and coastal damage resulted from heavy rainfall and high tides many vegetable plantings citrus groves and cattle were submerged or drowned as storm exacerbated already high water levels and briefly threatened to breach dikes surrounding lake okeechobee however dikes held firm and evacuations were otherwise credited with minimizing potential death toll on west coast of state storm caused further flooding extensive damage south of tampa bay area and loss of cuban fishing vessel antonio offshore fort myers resulting in seven deaths damage in florida reached 31 8 million on september 18 hurricane entered gulf of mexico and threatened florida panhandle later george made landfall southeast of new orleans louisiana on september 19 as a strong category 2 with winds of 110 mph 175 km h george weakened to a tropical storm later that day and then to a tropical depression on september 20 cyclone was absorbed by a cold front over missouri on following day strong winds in vicinity of lake pontchartrain caused water to over top levees leaving some lakefront streets inundated waist deep and many areas of city under about of water new orleans alone suffered about 100 million in damage widespread flooding spurred flood protection legislation and creation of an enlarged levee system to safeguard flood prone area some coastal flooding also occurred in mississippi state suffered slightly more than 28 4 million in damage storm destroyed 1 647 homes and structurally impacted 25 000 others in both louisiana and mississippi throughout its path hurricane caused 160 2 million in damage and 51 casualties tropical storm five fox at 00 00 utc on september 7 a low pressure area developed into a tropical depression about 135 mi 215 km south southwest of cape st george island florida depression moved northward and intensified reaching tropical storm status about 18 hours later and being assigned name fox by united states air force around that time cyclone curved north northwestward early on september 8 fox peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph 95 km h which was observed by a ship between 07 00 and 10 00 utc an observation station in mobile alabama recorded a barometric pressure of lowest known in association with cyclone at 14 00 utc on september 8 storm made landfall on dauphin island alabama and later near bayou la batre by early next day system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over southern mississippi shortly thereafter some coastal areas reported strong wind gusts including in mobile alabama and in pensacola florida at mobile bay two ships were beached but were re floated later that day overall damage from storm was minimal tropical storm six how a tropical wave developed into a tropical storm just north jamaica on september 20 storm assigned name how by united states air force moved west northwestward to northwestward and slowly intensified at 22 00 utc on september 21 cyclone struck cuba s isla de la juventud with winds of 50 mph 85 km h about five hours before making landfall near modern day border of artemisa and pinar del rio provinces thereafter storm moved northward to north northeastward how made landfall near crystal river florida with winds of 65 mph 100 km h around 22 00 utc on september 23 wind speed highest associated with storm was estimated based on an observation of a barometric pressure of at st leo storm was already losing tropical characteristics prior to landfall and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 00 00 utc on september 24 just two hours after moving inland remnants moved northeastward over georgia and carolinas before emerging into atlantic from north carolina on september 25 by early following day remnants of cyclone dissipated throughout florida wind speeds of were observed with winds of common between sarasota and cedar key a series of tornadoes left damage across central and north florida a tornado in destroyed three homes and damaged several trees in ocala a tornado downed trees and power lines and deroofed two homes two twisters in jacksonville damaged roofs trees and electrical and power lines while another tornado in arlington which was later annexed by jacksonville moved a home off its foundation damaged roofs and downed trees heavy rainfall in some areas worsened flooding situation that began with fort lauderdale hurricane above normal tides caused some erosion between bradenton and tarpon springs storm left about 100 000 in damage in florida storm and its remnants brought heavy rainfall to georgia including of precipitation at brunswick in 24 hours street flooding was reported there with water nearly entering businesses in savannah streets were inundated with several feet of water resulting in rescue of several families tropical storm seven item an extratropical low pressure area transitioned into a tropical storm offshore north florida on october 7 after acquiring a more symmetrical structure and strongest winds moving closer to center however system had characteristics of a subtropical cyclone including a moderate temperature gradient still existing at center and an upper level trough remaining associated with storm united states air force referred to this system as item at 00 30 utc on october 7 a ship observed winds of and a barometric pressure of former was used to estimate storm s maximum sustained wind speed of 60 mph 95 km h while latter was lowest barometric pressure in association with cyclone item made landfall near kings bay georgia at peak intensity around 04 00 utc on october 7 storm weakened to a tropical depression about eight hours later it executed a cyclonic loop briefly emerging into gulf of mexico near apalachicola florida before moving inland again over rural taylor county thereafter item moved north northeastward and continued weakening before dissipating over northern georgia on october 9 in north florida coast was hit by abnormally high tides after previously experiencing above normal tides for more than a week storm spawned a tornado in jacksonville that was on ground for about twister crossed a wartime housing project a trailer park and a business section of town twenty eight trailers were flipped over or smashed against each other while dwellings in housing project were deroofed walls and interiors of some stores in a four block area were damaged trees and automobiles also suffered damage overall tornado left 100 000 in damage 40 people homeless and at least 13 injured persons tropical storm eight a low pressure area detached from a cold front and developed into a tropical depression on october 8 about southwest of flores island in azores moving slowly northeastward cyclone strengthened despite relatively cool air and sea surface temperatures with sustained winds reaching 60 mph 95 km h later that day early on october 9 system curved east northeastward following day a ship observed a barometric pressure of lowest pressure associated with storm by early on october 11 system was absorbed by an extratropical cyclone about west southwest of flores island hurricane nine king a tropical depression was detected off coast of nicaragua on october 8 depression drifted northward becoming tropical storm king next day tropical storm then passed over western tip of cuba producing a peak wind gust of 57 mph 92 km h king strengthened over southeastern gulf of mexico to attain hurricane status on october 11 after brushing florida keys hurricane made landfall near cape sable florida on october 12 with winds of and a central pressure of about hurricane moved offshore near pompano beach and later turned back to west toward southeastern united states storm strengthened as it turned to west and on october 15 king made its final landfall near georgia south carolina state line as a category 2 hurricane after moving inland king quickly weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression early on october 16 before dissipating over alabama later that day hurricane was noted for first time hurricane seeding was conducted in atlantic basin by united states weather bureau through an operation called project cirrus a boeing b 17 flying fortress dropped of dry ice onto storm from above its after it had moved off jacksonville florida shortly afterward storm reversed course and headed for savannah scientists conducting experiment believed they had caused this change but a 1906 hurricane followed a similar path an airport in south florida recorded peak winds of 80 mph 130 km h hurricane dropped of rain across central and southern part of state including in hialeah where storm produced in a one hour period and over in a 75 minute period flooding rains left many neighborhoods in up to six feet of water due to a previously wet summer and left over 2 000 miami dade county residents homeless flooding also closed route 1 from miami to fort lauderdale as well as a highway to everglades city hurricane spawned a tornado in both coral gables and miami one of which destroyed three warehouses following passage of hurricane hialeah mayor henry declared a state of emergency and restricted access to city in miami many residents had to use boats and rafts to survey damage and look for survivors due to flooding winds in georgia peaked at 85 mph 135 km h in savannah elsewhere in state storm caused 500 000 in damage mainly due to a tornado that touched down near tides above normal were reported from georgia to south carolina high tides in charleston south carolina caused minor beach erosion and isolated street flooding and one person was killed there by a falling tree in north carolina high tides caused minor flooding overall hurricane caused about 20 million in damage hurricane ten love tenth and final tropical storm of season likely developed from a tropical wave just north of leeward islands early on october 17 storm designated as love in real time by united states air force moved west northwestward and re curved to northwest avoiding landfall in leeward islands greater antilles and bahamas around 06 00 utc on october 18 love intensified into a category 1 hurricane shortly before beginning to move northward early following day cyclone strengthened into a category 2 hurricane while re curving to north northeast upon reaching category 3 intensity around 12 00 utc on october 19 love became second major hurricane of season about six hours later storm attained maximum sustained winds of 120 mph 195 km h estimated based on averaging out sustained wind speeds by a reconnaissance aircraft on october 19 hurricane love became first storm to be flown into at low levels by 53d weather reconnaissance squadron around 12 00 utc on october 20 hurricane passed close to bermuda island reported sustained winds of and gusts up to winds downed many tree limbs and damaged crops especially bananas and tomatoes winds also toppled electrical and telephone wires leaving hamilton without those services for several days ten buildings were destroyed though little damage occurred to structures with bermuda s standard building codes hurricane sank 11 boats in vicinity of island overall 10 people were injured and damaged totaled over 1 million late on october 20 a reconnaissance aircraft flight observed a barometric pressure of lowest in association with hurricane early following day love weakened to a category 2 hurricane cyclone then accelerated and curved east northeastward late on october 21 at 00 00 utc on october 22 storm weakened to a category 1 hurricane and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about six hours later while situated about southeast of newfoundland remnants were soon absorbed by a larger extratropical storm other systems several other tropical depressions developed throughout season first formed over bay of campeche near southeast coast of mexico by june 13 by following day depression either dissipated over moved rapidly northeastward ahead of a cold front and was last noted in northeastern gulf of mexico on september 1 another tropical depression formed offshore carolinas from a low pressure area that detached from a frontal system depression moved northward and merged with another frontal system on following day a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression south of capo verde islands on september 15 depression tracked slowly west northwestward for several days before turning northeastward on september 23 thereafter depression began moving erratically with multiple small cyclonic loops from september 24 to september 28 before curving northward and then northeastward by september 30 depression became extratropical while well southwest of azores next tropical depression developed from a low which formed along either a trough or decaying front to northeast of lesser antilles on october 25 however depression transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by following day final tropical cyclone of season developed just north of martinique on november 28 depression moved westward and then curved northwestward passing near eastern tip of dominican republic on november 30 early following day depression was absorbed by a cold front to northeast of turks and caicos islands storm names this was first season in which air weather service began assigning names to tropical cyclones using joint army navy phonetic alphabet however use of these names were limited to internal communications between weather centers and aircraft not in public
