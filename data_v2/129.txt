report underlined necessity for extensive testing in january 2009 antony gormley creator of angel of north to which b of bang is often compared spoke out in support of sculpture stating that it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground breaking work was commissioned to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of council s nerve despite gormley s plea removal of b of bang began in april 2009 more substantial hoarding was erected around site and demolition firm connell brothers limited began removing spikes with cutting equipment although council had promised to store complex central core and legs these too were cut apart during removal casting doubt on future prospects for landmark sculpture s return and in early july 2012 core was
