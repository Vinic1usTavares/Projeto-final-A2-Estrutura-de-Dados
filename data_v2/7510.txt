action of 18 august 1798 was a minor naval engagement of french revolutionary wars fought between british fourth rate ship hms leander and french ship of line genereux both ships had been engaged at battle of nile three weeks earlier in which a british fleet under rear admiral sir horatio nelson had destroyed a french fleet at aboukir bay on mediterranean coast of egypt genereux was one of only four french ships to survive battle while leander had been detached from british fleet by nelson on 6 august on board captain edward berry sailed as a passenger charged with carrying despatches to squadron under earl st vincent off cadiz on 18 august while passing western shore of crete leander was intercepted and attacked by genereux which had separated from rest of french survivors day before captain thomas thompson on leander initially tried to escape much larger french ship but it rapidly became clear that genereux was faster than his vessel at 09 00 ships exchanged broadsides engagement continuing until 10 30 when captain louis jean nicolas lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board leander suffering heavy casualties in attempt for another five hours battle continued thompson successfully raking genereux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvred by larger warship eventually wounded thompson surrendered his dismasted ship by ordering his men to wave a french tricolour on a pike as french sailors took possession of british ship lejoille encouraged systematic looting of sailors personal possessions even confiscating surgeon s tools in middle of an operation against established conventions of warfare he forced captured crew to assist in bringing leander safely into corfu and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co operated with their captors lejoille s published account of action greatly exaggerated scale of his success and although he was highly praised in french press he was castigated in britain for his conduct thompson berry and most of british officers were exchanged and acquitted at court martial and captains were knighted for their services while leander and many of crew were recaptured in march 1799 by a russian squadron that seized corfu and returned to british control by order of tsar paul genereux survived another year in mediterranean but was eventually captured off malta in 1800 by a british squadron under lord nelson background on 1 august 1798 a british fleet of 13 ships of line and one fourth rate ship under rear admiral sir horatio nelson discovered a french fleet of 13 ships of line and four frigates at anchor in aboukir bay on mediterranean coast of egypt clowes p 355 nelson had been in pursuit of french for three months crossing mediterranean three times in his efforts to locate fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried french army commanded by napoleon bonaparte intended for invasion of egypt convoy successfully eluded nelson and army landed at alexandria on 31 june capturing city and advancing inland fleet was too large to anchor in alexandria harbour and instead bonaparte ordered its commander vice admiral francois paul brueys d aigalliers to take up station in aboukir bay james p 159 on discovering french nelson attacked immediately ordering his ships to advance on french line and engage beginning battle of nile as he closed with french line captain thomas foley on lead ship hms goliath realised that there was a gap at head of french line wide enough to allow his ship passage pushing through gap foley attacked french van from landward side followed by four ships while nelson engaged van from seaward side with three more adkins p 24 remainder of fleet attacked french centre except for hms culloden which grounded on a shoal and became stuck smaller ships in squadron fourth rate hms leander and sloop hms mutine attempted to assist culloden but it was soon realised that ship was immobile clowes p 363 determined to participate in battle captain thomas thompson of leander abandoned stranded culloden and joined second wave of attack against french centre focusing fire on bow of 120 gun french first rate orient clowes p 364 within an hour orient caught fire under combined attack of three ships and later exploded effectively concluding engagement in nelson s favour james p 171 during next two days lightly damaged leander was employed in forcing surrender of several grounded french vessels and by afternoon of 3 august nelson was in complete control of aboukir bay only four french ships two ships of line and two frigates escaped sailing north out of bay on afternoon of 2 august under command of rear admiral pierre charles villeneuve gardiner p 38 having won battle nelson needed to send despatches to his commander vice admiral earl st vincent reporting on destruction of french mediterranean fleet these messages were entrusted to captain edward berry who had served as nelson s flag captain on hms vanguard during battle tracy p 277 thompson was ordered to escort berry to st vincent believed to be with blockade squadron off cadiz in leander although leander had not suffered serious damage in battle thompson had manning problems casualties from battle of santa cruz de tenerife in july 1797 had never been replaced 14 men had been wounded in battle at aboukir bay and two officers and fifty men had been detached to man captured french prizes this left thompson with just 282 men on board leander following nelson s orders thompson sailed on 5 august clowes p 513 battle thumb louis jean nicolas lejoille portrait by antoine maurin after fleeing aboukir bay admiral villeneuve had been delayed in eastern mediterranean by northeasterly winds and on 17 august he decided to split his forces sailing for malta with his flagship guillaume tell and two frigates while captain louis jean nicolas lejoille on genereux was ordered to french possession of corfu before they departed a number of men were transferred to genereux which was already carrying survivors from timoleon one of ships destroyed in aboukir bay giving genereux a crew of 936 men as genereux rounded island of goza off western tip of crete then known as candia on following morning his lookouts reported a sail to northwest this vessel was leander learning of strange ship to southeast captain thompson deduced that it must be one of villeneuve s ships and immediately ordered all sails set in an effort to avoid an unequal combat genereux carried 30 more guns than leander and was more strongly built tracy p 278 carrying a broadside of over 1 000 lbs to leander s 432 lbs gardiner p 42 assisted by a strong breeze behind his ship that did not carry to thompson s vessel woodman p 113 lejoille rapidly gained on fourth rate hoisting neapolitan and then ottoman flags in an unsuccessful attempt to confuse thompson into approaching his ship by 09 00 it was inevitable that genereux would catch leander and thompson responded by shortening sail and turning northwards to aim his broadside at french ship within minutes genereux had fired a shot across leander s bows and thompson responded to threat by ordering a full broadside against genereux clowes p 514 lejoille replied with his own broadside and two ships continued firing as they sailed to east genereux gradually closing range with leander smaller british vessel took worst of damage and at 10 30 combatants were so close that lejoille decided to attempt to board british ship thompson unable to manoeuvre battered leander out of way james p 231 genereux s bow collided with bow of leander and french ship swung alongside lejoille preparing his men to board thompson was prepared for this manoeuvre and mustered his royal marines and teams of sailors armed with muskets along rail of quarterdeck and poop deck volleys of musket fire were sufficient to kill any frenchman who attempted to board british ship and tangled ships turned southwards together their main batteries continuing to exchange broadsides at extreme close range gradually strengthening breeze dragged genereux free of leander french ship faster as more of its sails and rigging were intact as genereux pulled away to west thompson who had already been wounded several times succeeded in turning his battered ship so that his broadside was directed at stern of genereux despite collapsed wreckage of mizzenmast and fore topmast his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of obstruction to fire a raking broadside at french vessel although leander had inflicted severe damage size and power of french ship was beginning to tell and lejoille was able to turn genereux southwards again james p 232 ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15 30 by which time leander s crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at french ship eventually lejoille succeeded in bringing genereux across leander s bow and hailed british ship asking if they had surrendered unable to continue fighting due to wreckage that lay across forward guns thompson ordered a french flag raised on a pike which was sufficient for lejoille to cease firing french were initially unable to take possession of fourth rate as every single one of boats on board had been smashed by british shot in end a french midshipman and a boatswain dived into sea and swam to british ship to take formal surrender leander had lost a third of crew 35 men killed and 57 wounded latter including thompson three times and berry who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm clowes p 515 ship had been completely dismasted except stubs of fore and main masts and bowsprit and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes tracy p 279 genereux had also been damaged losing mizzen topmast and almost losing foremast as well losses on crowded decks had been far more severe than on leander with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded again approximately a third of total james p 233 aftermath two french sailors that reached leander immediately began a systematic pillaging of british officers personal effects gardiner p 43 rather than tossing men into sea as historian william james suggests they should have done thompson instead ordered one of british boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to french ship and bring back captain lejoille in belief that he would end looting james p 234 however when french captain arrived he immediately joined his officers commandeering all but two of captain thompson s shirts and wounded officer s cot when captain berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him lejoille summoned thief to quarterdeck and took them for himself sailors who accompanied lejoille were equally voracious among many things taken were ship surgeon mr mulberry s operating tools stolen in middle of an operation without correct equipment surgeon could not assist many wounded including captain thompson who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm james p 235 when captain berry complained lejoille replied j en suis mais le fait est que les francais sont bons au pillage i m sorry but fact is that french are good at plunder tracy p 280 dividing captured british sailors lejoille transferred half to genereux and left half on leander with a french prize crew under louis gabriel in direct contravention of established conventions of war both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to vessels only once both ships were ready for journey to corfu were prisoners given bread and water although wounded were still denied medical attention clowes p 516 for ten days after engagement battered ships sailed northwards against wind genereux forced to attach a tow to leander to avoid leaving prize behind on 28 august a sail appeared to south panic broke out on genereux and lejoille ordered prisoners confined below and for preparations to be made to abandon leander and make all speed for corfu new arrival was in fact 16 gun british sloop hms mutine under lieutenant thomas bladen capel carrying second copies of nelson s despatches to britain capel sighted ships to north but assumed that they were genereux and guillaume tell and so passed by displaying french colours lejoille was not fooled by disguise but did not pursue small vessel continuing his passage to corfu once mutine had sailed out of sight at corfu prisoners were confined but wounded were still not provided with treatment thompson was only able to have musket ball removed from his arm when mulberry was smuggled aboard genereux in corfu harbour without lejoille s knowledge or permission british officers were eventually paroled and returned to britain although carpenter thomas was detained because he refused to supply lejoille with specifications of leander s masts james p 236 most of ship s regular seamen were held prisoner at corfu they were subsequently encouraged to join french navy lejoille attempting to enlist them on genereux when a russian squadron blockaded port lejoille s demands were met with a response from a named george bannister who called out no you damned french rascal give us back our little ship and we ll fight you again until we sink genereux subsequently escaped from corfu and anchored off brindisi where lejoille was killed by artillery fire from neapolitan castle overlooking town james p 271 ship was captured in a battle in february 1800 by a squadron under nelson off malta clowes p 419 leander was captured by a russian force that seized corfu in march 1799 and was returned to royal navy by tsar paul along with sailors held on island account of battle captain lejoille sent to france was inaccurate in a number of important features describing leander as a 74 gun ship and claiming that his men actually boarded british ship only to subsequently retreat tracy p 281 coming so soon after their disaster at battle of nile and encouraged by lejoille s highly inaccurate reports french newspapers exaggerated scale of victory le moniteur universel publishing several imaginative accounts in months after battle james p 237 despite defeat action was celebrated in britain thompson and berry praised for their defiance against a much larger vessel rather than criticised for losing their ship james p 238 lejoille s conduct in treatment of his prisoners was derided in popular press and on 17 december 1798 thompson berry and ship s officers were brought before a court martial on hms america at sheerness for loss of their ship and honourably acquitted court announcing that thompson and berry were subsequently voted thanks of parliament and in december 1798 berry was made a knight bachelor given freedom of city of london and a chest worth 100 guineas he was subsequently made commander of new 80 gun hms foudroyant in early 1799 and returned to mediterranean to operate as nelson s flag captain again during siege of malta thompson was knighted in january 1799 and given a pension of ps200 per annum returning to service that spring as captain of hms bellona attached to channel fleet under lord bridport captain who had commanded bomb ship chartered to ferry thompson and his staff from corfu to trieste wrote a letter to answer charges of pillage he stated that 30 men french prize crew was unarmed having had to swim to leander because all boats on genereux and leander had been destroyed in battle and that 200 men still able on leander would have stopped them from plundering their effects that neither captain not surgeon of ship had complained at corfu nor at trieste and that on his ship he had seen thompson with three trunks of personal effects and other members of his staff with their own as well troude p 143 in his
