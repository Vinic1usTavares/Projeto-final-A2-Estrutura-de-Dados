given tasks that they must work on together and whose results they must present in front of entire group on last day history hyman created skeptic s toolbox in 1989 to teach people how to be better skeptics he tells james underdown that we were putting out more fires by skeptics than by believers they were going overboard first toolbox was in buffalo ny with himself james alcock and steve shaw now called banachek with exception of one year when toolbox was held in boulder colorado toolbox has been held at university of oregon in eugene in general faculty likes to keep numbers at about 90 in order to give everyone personalized attention and allow everyone chance to participate at 1993 toolbox more than a hundred people participated from 19 states canada and hong kong and their enthusiasm continued to grow with each passing day ending on fifth day with what appeared to be a unanimous if only we had more time in 1997 skeptical inquirer announced that cfi would begin offering an academic certificate for students in a three year program students needed to complete 30 units in academic work as well as in workshops two certificates offered were humanistic studies and science and paranormal attending skeptic s toolbox would satisfy one of workshop requirements methodology and focus while critical thinking is overall focus lectures designed around theme focus on specialties of faculty a reporter for register guard attended 2003 toolbox and wrote of his experience hearing lectures on post traumatic stress syndrome repressed memory court cases communication with dead healing through prayer traditional chinese medicine and psychic dogs all that and jerry andrus s display of optical illusions too goal of toolbox is to help skeptics add to their arsenal of tools and techniques with which to both guard against deception and properly evaluate paranormal claims learning how to communicate with believers is also considered important skeptics search for truths believers tend to want validation of their experiences thumb 250px august 9 12 2012 evaluating evidence garbage in garbage out faculty ray hyman lindsay beyerstein harriet hall james alcock loren pankratz and richard getting skeptical message across to believers was a focus at 1993 event faculty felt that non skeptics might be more receptive if attendees understood how they were perceived by others many people view skeptics as die hard cynics and debunkers even as enemies of free speech often hear only cop in csicop in 2010 interviewed by d j hyman explained give people tools to think help them to become better thinkers mentalist bob fellows performed at second conference and told audience effect of a magic trick on audiences who believe trick is real magic can be enormously powerful and when deceit is involved they can be potentially harmful as well hyman felt that it was necessary to teach attendees with a case based approach concrete examples as a first step toward extracting broad examples giving benefit of context to learning experience faculty loren pankratz a founding faculty member of skeptic s toolbox pankratz explained to harriet hall about beginnings of toolbox ray hyman jerry andrus and i were meeting together once a month or so and we decided that maybe three of us could put a toolbox together barry beyerstein one of many enjoyable tasks i undertake for csicop is to lecture in ray hyman s annual summer workshop at university of oregon not only is it towering presence of ray himself and joy of observing sheer brainpower of my fellow faculty at work it is also people literally from around world who enroll in this and other csicop functions that keep me from suffering that occupational hazard skeptic s burnout they are a remarkable lot genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving place a bit better than they found it they make me very pleased that my fate was to become a skeptical inquirer barry beyerstein
