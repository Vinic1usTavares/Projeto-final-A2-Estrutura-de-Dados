studies scholar charles barr in his examination of ealing films observes that in opposing british government burgundians recover spirit resilience and local autonomy and unity of wartime london barr suggests actions re enact in miniature war experience of britain itself film historian mark duguid writing for british film institute considers that opposition is a yearning nostalgia for social unity of war years film historians anthony aldgate and jeffrey richards describe passport to pimlico as a progressive comedy because it upsets established social order to promote well being of a community view of community put forward in film has been criticised as being anachronistic as wartime unity had already passed by 1949 according to aldgate and richards welcome return to ration books at end of film signifies an acceptance that measures of british government are in best interests of people device of pitting a small group of british against a series of changes to status quo from an external agent leads british film institute to consider passport to pimlico along with other of ealing comedies as conservative but mildly anarchic daydreams fantasies at close of story when summer heatwave turns to a torrential downpour film has something of quality of a fever dream according to aldgate and richards according to film historian robert sellers passport to pimlico captures most quintessential english traits of individualism tolerance and compromise duguid sees examination of english character as being at heart of film this was one of aspects that appealed to margaret
