charles thom november 11 1872 may 24 1956 was an american microbiologist and mycologist born and raised in illinois he received his phd from university of missouri first such degree awarded by that institution he was best known for his work on microbiology of dairy products and soil fungi and in particular his research into genera aspergillus and penicillium his work influenced establishment of standards for food handling and processing in usa he pioneered use of culture media to grow microorganisms and with food chemist james n currie developed a process to mass produce citric acid using aspergillus thom played an important role in development of penicillin in world war ii early life thom was born in minonk illinois in 1872 fifth of six boys his parents were angus sutherland thom and louisa thom scottish irish farmers who had settled in illinois shortly before american civil war charles thom was raised in a strongly religious household his father was an elder in presbyterian church thom upheld presbyterian values throughout his life kept active in church affairs and became a staunch prohibitionist his early years spent working on his father s farm instilled value of a strong work ethic and first hand knowledge of agricultural practices that would prove useful in his later career after graduating from high school thom attended lake forest academy a preparatory institution for college in 1889 he earned a bachelor s degree from lake forest college in 1895 next year he spent as a science teacher in a danville high school before returning to lake forest college to receive his master s degree in 1897 in 1899 working under supervision of howard ayers he received his phd from university of missouri on topic of fertilization in ferns and adiantum this was first doctorate awarded by that institution thom married ethel winifred slater in 1906 with whom he had three children one died during childbirth ethel thom died in october 1942 shortly before his retirement in 1944 he remarried to charlotte j bayles with whom he lived until her death thom died two years after charlotte at his home in port jefferson new york on may 24 1956 career in 1902 thom went to study with george f atkinson at cornell university two colleagues included benjamin and herbert who both later became noted botanists two years later he accepted a position as dairy mycologist working with herbert william conn in charge of cheese investigations at storrs agricultural experiment station in connecticut he remained in this institution a branch of u s department of agriculture usda holding various research and administrative positions until his retirement in 1942 during his employment there thom investigated process of cheese ripening and sought to understand composition of microbiological flora required for imparting certain flavors on cheeses through this work he isolated and identified fungi penicillium camemberti and penicillium roqueforti thumb left thom identified fungi responsible for imparting flavors to cheeses such as roquefort in 1914 thom became chief of microbiological laboratory at usda bureau of chemistry where his job was to study problems with handling and processing of foods and to enforce pure food and drug act a united states federal law that mandated federal inspection of food products known for his dedication to maintaining high standards in food industry he relished arguing court cases in defense of sanitary practices in handling and processing of perishable foods in one noted case involving of tomato catsup he presented partially rotten tomatoes to jury and concluding his testimony asked them should american people have to eat these in their catsup selman waksman who would later be another key contributor to antibiotic development spent some months in 1915 1916 at usda in washington dc under thom studying soil fungi thom s work with food chemist james n currie in 1916 17 enabled them to develop a process to mass produce citric acid using aspergillus and a few years later first large scale mold fermentation factory had been established in brooklyn new york this early work ultimately led to department of agriculture s establishing four regional research laboratories in 1938 that were devoted to industrial mold during his time at usda thom became a world authority on genera aspergillus and penicillium thom pioneered technique of using defined reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms most of taxa he described are still valid today together with margaret b church thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for american type culture collection established in 1925 in 1929 a year after discovering penicillin alexander fleming published a well known paper in which he identified mold penicillium rubrum as one responsible for creating drug harold raistrick succeeded in growing organism on a simple culture medium but could not isolate penicillin produced by mold when grown this way with thom s assistance they correctly identified organism as penicillium notatum and in 1941 developed a method to scale up production at department of agriculture s northern regional research laboratory in peoria illinois which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of drug thom held his job with bureau of chemistry until 1927 when position was abolished he was then appointed principal mycologist of division of soil microbiology for newly created bureau of chemistry and soils in a few years thom became known as an authority on soil microbiology and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings in one of thom s important contributions to field he led research group responsible for advances that enabled control of cotton root rot which at time was a major problem in southwestern united states in collaboration with his protege kenneth raper they published manual of penicillin in 1940 thom formally retired in 1942 although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death memberships and honors thom was u s delegate to 1905 international dairy congress held in paris france he helped establish a graduate education program at usda in 1907 he became a charter member of dairy association of america and in 1918 was appointed president of bacteriological association of washington he attended 1935 international soil congress in oxford england and was vice president of 1939 international microbiological congress in new york he was a member of national academy of sciences a charter member of mycological society of america and president of society of american bacteriologists in 1940 and society of industrial microbiology in 1950 thom was awarded an honorary doctor of science degree by lake forest college in 1936 for his work on penicillin he and his research group received lasker group award in 1946 and usda distinguished service award in 1947 same year he received a gold medal from spanish national research council for his contributions to microbiology and medicine described taxa aspergillus thom church 1926 aspergillus raper thom 1944 aspergillus thom raper 1945
