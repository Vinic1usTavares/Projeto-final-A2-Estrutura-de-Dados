acute myeloid leukemia aml is a cancer of myeloid line of blood cells characterized by rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cells symptoms may include feeling tired shortness of breath easy bruising and bleeding and increased risk of infection occasionally spread may occur to brain skin or gums as an acute leukemia aml progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated risk factors include smoking previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy myelodysplastic syndrome and exposure to chemical benzene underlying mechanism involves replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemia cells which results in a drop in red blood cells platelets and normal white blood cells diagnosis is generally based on bone marrow aspiration and specific blood tests aml has several subtypes for which treatments and outcomes may vary aml typically is initially treated with chemotherapy with aim of inducing remission people may then go on to receive additional chemotherapy radiation therapy or a stem cell transplant specific genetic mutations present within cancer cells may guide therapy as well as determine how long that person is likely to survive arsenic trioxide may be tried in cases that have recurred following usual treatments in 2015 aml affected about one million people and resulted in 147 000 deaths globally it most commonly occurs in older adults males are affected more often than females aml is curable in about 35 of people under 60 years old and 10 over 60 years old older people whose health is too poor for intensive chemotherapy have a typical survival of 5 10 months it accounts for roughly 1 8 of cancer deaths in united states signs and symptoms thumb upright 1 4 diffusely swollen gums due to infiltration by leukemic cells in a person with acute myelomonocytic leukemia most signs and symptoms of aml are caused by replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells a lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections while leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors they have no infection fighting capacity a drop in red blood cell count anemia can cause fatigue paleness and shortness of breath a lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma early signs of aml are often vague and nonspecific and may be similar to those of influenza or other common illnesses some generalized symptoms include fever fatigue weight loss or loss of appetite shortness of breath anemia easy bruising or bleeding petechiae flat pin head sized spots under skin caused by bleeding bone and joint pain and persistent or frequent infections enlargement of spleen may occur in aml but it is typically mild and asymptomatic lymph node swelling is rare in aml in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia skin is involved about 10 of time in form of leukemia cutis rarely sweet s syndrome a inflammation of skin can occur with aml some people with aml may experience swelling of gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into gum tissue rarely first sign of leukemia may be development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of bone marrow called a chloroma occasionally a person may show no symptoms and leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test risk factors a number of risk factors for developing aml have been identified including other blood disorders chemical exposures ionizing radiation and genetics other blood disorders preleukemic blood disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome mds or myeloproliferative neoplasms mpn can evolve into aml exact risk depends on type of mds mpn presence of asymptomatic clonal hematopoiesis also raises risk of transformation into aml to 0 5 1 0 per year chemical exposure exposure to anticancer chemotherapy in particular alkylating agents can increase risk of subsequently developing aml risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy other chemotherapy agents specifically and anthracyclines have also been associated with treatment related leukemias which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in leukemic cells occupational chemical exposure to benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial as a cause of aml benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro while some studies have suggested a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of aml others have suggested attributable risk if any is slight linet ms leukemias epidemiologic aspects oxford university press new york 1985 radiation high amounts of ionizing radiation exposure can increase risk of aml survivors of atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had an increased rate of aml as did radiologists exposed to high levels of x rays prior to adoption of modern radiation safety practices people treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer non hodgkin lymphoma lung cancer and breast cancer have highest chance of acquiring aml but this increased risk returns to background risk observed in general population after 12 years genetics a hereditary risk for aml appears to exist multiple cases of aml developing in a family at a rate higher than predicted by chance alone have been reported several congenital conditions may increase risk of leukemia most common is probably down syndrome which is associated with a 10 to 18 fold increase in risk of aml in a second example inactivating mutations in one of two parental gata2 genes lead to a reduction i e a in cellular levels of gene s product gata2 transcription factor and thereby to a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease gata2 deficiency this disease is associated with a highly variable set of disorders including an exceedingly high risk of developing aml specific genetic abnormalities causing aml usually vary between those who develop disease as a child versus an adult however gata2 deficiency induced aml may first appear in children or adults diagnosis thumb upright 1 4 bone marrow myeloblasts with auer rods seen in acute myeloid leukemia first clue to a diagnosis of aml is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count while an excess of abnormal white blood cells is a common finding with leukemia and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen aml can also present with isolated decreases in platelets red blood cells or even with a low white blood cell count leukopenia abeloff martin et al 2004 p while a presumptive diagnosis of aml can be made by examination of peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia vitamin b12 deficiency folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency marrow or blood is examined under light microscopy as well as flow cytometry to diagnose presence of leukemia to differentiate aml from other types of leukemia e g acute lymphoblastic leukemia all and to classify subtype of disease a sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as flt3 nucleophosmin and kit which may influence outcome of disease stains on blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in distinction of aml from all and in subclassification of aml combination of a myeloperoxidase or sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide desired information in most cases myeloperoxidase or sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing identity of aml and distinguishing it from all nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in amls and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from all diagnosis and classification of aml can be challenging and should be performed by a qualified hematopathologist or in straightforward cases presence of certain morphologic features such as auer rods or specific flow cytometry results can distinguish aml from other leukemias however in absence of such features diagnosis may be more difficult abeloff martin et al 2004 p 2835 two most commonly used classification schemata for aml are older french american british fab system and newer world health organization who system according to widely used who criteria diagnosis of aml is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20 of blood and or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts except in three best prognosis forms of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities t 8 21 inv 16 and t 15 17 in which presence of genetic abnormality is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent french american british fab classification is a bit more stringent requiring a blast percentage of at least 30 in bone marrow bm or peripheral blood pb for diagnosis of aml aml must be carefully differentiated from preleukemic conditions such as myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes which are treated differently because acute promyelocytic leukemia apl has highest and requires a unique form of treatment it is important to quickly establish or exclude diagnosis of this subtype of leukemia fluorescent in situ hybridization performed on blood or bone marrow is often used for this purpose as it readily identifies chromosomal translocation t 15 17 q22 q12 that characterizes apl there is also a need to molecularly detect presence of pml rara fusion protein which is an oncogenic product of that translocation world health organization who 2008 classification of aml attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more meaningful prognostic information than fab criteria each of who categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories of interest to hematopathologist and oncologist however most of clinically significant information in who schema is communicated via categorization into one of subtypes listed below who subtypes of aml are name description icd o

type of aml with previous history of mds or mpd that has gone unnoticed in past but cytogenetics is still suggestive of mds mpd history this category of aml occurs most often in elderly people and often has a worse prognosis includes aml with complex karyotype unbalanced abnormalities aml with deletions of chromosome 7 del 7q aml with deletions of chromosome 5 del 5q aml with unbalanced

myeloid sarcoma myeloid related to down syndrome this category includes so called transient abnormal and myeloid leukemia associated with down syndrome blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm this category includes so called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm aml not otherwise categorized includes subtypes of aml that do not fall into above categories aml with minimal differentiation aml without maturation aml with maturation acute myelomonocytic leukemia acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia acute erythroid leukemia acute megakaryoblastic leukemia acute basophilic leukemia acute with acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage also known as mixed phenotype or acute leukemia occur when leukemic cells can not be classified as either myeloid or cells or where both types of cells are present french american british french american british fab classification system divides aml into eight subtypes m0 through to m7 based on type of cell from which leukemia developed and its degree of maturity this is done by examining appearance of malignant cells with light microscopy and or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy although who classification see above may be more useful fab system is still widely used six fab subtypes m1 through to m6 were initially proposed in 1976 although later revisions added m7 in 1985 and m0 in 1987 type name cytogenetics percentage of adults with aml m0 acute myeloblastic leukemia minimally differentiated 5 m1 acute

leukemias including and very rare pure erythroid leukemia 5 m7 acute megakaryoblastic leukemia t 1 22 5 morphologic subtypes of aml also include rare types not included in fab system such as acute basophilic leukemia which was proposed as a ninth subtype m8 in 1999 pathophysiology thumb upright 1 4 diagram showing cells where aml develops malignant cell in aml is myeloblast in normal hematopoiesis myeloblast is an immature precursor of myeloid white blood cells a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell in aml though a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which freeze cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation such a mutation alone does not cause leukemia however when such a differentiation arrest is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation result is uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells leading to clinical entity of aml much of diversity and heterogeneity of aml is because leukemic transformation can occur at a number of different steps along differentiation pathway modern classification schemes for aml recognize that characteristics and behavior of leukemic cell and leukemia may depend on stage at which differentiation was halted specific cytogenetic abnormalities can be found in many people with aml types of chromosomal abnormalities often have prognostic significance abeloff martin et al 2004 pp 2831 32 chromosomal translocations encode abnormal fusion proteins usually transcription factors whose altered properties may cause differentiation arrest for example in acute promyelocytic leukemia t 15 17 translocation produces a pml rara fusion protein which binds to retinoic acid receptor element in promoters of several myeloid specific genes and inhibits myeloid differentiation clinical signs and symptoms of aml result from growth of leukemic clone cells which tends to displace or interfere with development of normal blood cells in bone marrow abeloff martin et al 2004 p this leads to neutropenia anemia and thrombocytopenia symptoms of aml are in turn often due to low numbers of these normal blood elements in rare cases people with aml can develop a chloroma or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside bone marrow which can cause various symptoms depending on its location an important pathophysiological mechanism of in aml is epigenetic induction of by genetic mutations that alter function of epigenetic enzymes such as dna tet2 and metabolic enzymes idh1 and idh2 which lead to generation of a novel d 2 which inhibits activity of epigenetic enzymes such as tet2 hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes and or activation of proto oncogenes treatment first line treatment of aml consists primarily of chemotherapy and is divided into two phases induction and postremission or consolidation therapy goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses although transplantation is also sometimes used as front line therapy for people with high risk disease efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in aml continue induction all fab subtypes except m3 are usually given induction chemotherapy with cytarabine ara c and an anthracycline most often daunorubicin abeloff martin et al 2004 pp 2835 39 this induction chemotherapy regimen is known as 7 3 or 3 7 because cytarabine is given as a continuous iv infusion for seven consecutive days while anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an iv push up to 70 of people with aml will achieve a remission with this protocol other alternative induction regimens including high dose cytarabine alone flag like regimens or investigational agents may also be used because of toxic effects of therapy including and an increased risk of infection induction chemotherapy may not be offered to very elderly and options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care m3 subtype of aml also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia apl is almost universally treated with drug all trans retinoic acid atra in addition to induction chemotherapy usually an anthracycline care must be taken to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation dic complicating treatment of apl when release contents of their granules into peripheral circulation apl is eminently curable with well documented treatment protocols goal of induction phase is to reach a complete remission complete remission does not mean disease has been cured rather it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods complete remission is obtained in about 50 75 of newly diagnosed adults although this may vary based on prognostic factors described above length of remission depends on prognostic features of original leukemia in general all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy consolidation even after complete remission is achieved leukemic cells likely remain in numbers too small to be detected with current diagnostic techniques if no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given almost all people with aml will eventually relapse therefore more therapy is necessary to eliminate disease and prevent relapse that is to achieve a cure specific type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person s prognostic factors see above and general health for good prognosis leukemias i e inv 16 t 8 21 and t 15 17 people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy known as consolidation chemotherapy for people at high risk of relapse e g those with high risk cytogenetics underlying mds or therapy related aml stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if person is able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor best postremission therapy for intermediate risk aml normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good risk or high risk groups is less clear and depends on specific situation including age and overall health of person person s values and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available for people who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant immunotherapy with a combination of histamine and interleukin 2 after completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce absolute relapse risk by 14 translating to a 50 increase in likelihood of maintained remission relapsed aml for people with relapsed aml only proven potentially curative therapy is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant if one has not already been performed abeloff martin et al 2004 pp 2840 41 in 2000 monoclonal antibody linked cytotoxic agent mylotarg was approved in united states for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed aml who are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy this drug was voluntarily withdrawn from market by its manufacturer pfizer in 2010 but newer data aided its reintroduction in 2017 http www pfizer com files products mylotarg hcp letter pdf since treatment options for relapsed aml are so limited palliative care or enrollment in a clinical trial may be offered for relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia apl arsenic trioxide is approved by us fda like atra arsenic trioxide does not work with other subtypes of aml prognosis thumb upright 1 4 expected survival upon diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in united states thumb upright 1 4 chromosomal translocation 9 11 associated with aml aml is a curable disease chance of cure for a specific person depends on a number of prognostic factors cytogenetics single most important prognostic factor in aml is cytogenetics or chromosomal structure of leukemic cell certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes for example 15 17 translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia about half of people with aml have normal cytogenetics they fall into an intermediate risk group a number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment first publication to address cytogenetics and prognosis was mrc trial of 1998 risk year 8 21 t 15 17 inv 16 70 33 8 21 22 del 7q del 9q abnormal all other structural or numerical 50 poor 5 7 del 5q abnormal 3q complex 78 later southwest oncology group and eastern cooperative oncology group and later still cancer and leukemia group b published other mostly overlapping lists of cytogenetics prognostication in leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome aml arising from a pre existing myelodysplastic syndrome mds or myeloproliferative disease so called secondary aml has a worse prognosis as does treatment related aml arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities other prognostic markers in some studies age 60 years and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level were also associated with poorer outcomes as with most forms of cancer performance status i e general physical condition and activity level of person plays a major role in prognosis as well five year survival rate is about 25 overall age plays a significant role 40 of people under age of 60 but just 10 of those over it live five years after diagnosis genotype a large number of molecular alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in aml however only flt3 itd npm1 cebpa and c kit are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema these are expected to increase rapidly in near future flt3 internal tandem duplications have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in aml with normal cytogenetics several flt3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials with mixed results two other mutations npm1 and cebpa are associated with improved outcomes especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms researchers are investigating clinical significance of c kit mutations in aml these are prevalent and potentially clinically relevant because of availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib and that can block activity of c kit pharmacologically it is expected that additional markers e g runx1 and that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations prognostic importance of other mutated genes e g idh1 idh2 is less clear expectation of cure cure rates in clinical trials have ranged from 20 45 although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies overall cure rate for all people with aml including elderly and those unable to tolerate aggressive therapy is likely lower cure rates for promyelocytic leukemia can be as high as 98 relapse relapse is common and prognosis is poor long term survival after a relapse is so rare that only known case was submitted to catholic church as evidence of a miracle attributed to marie marguerite d youville epidemiology aml is a relatively rare cancer there are approximately 10 500 new cases each year in united states and incidence rate has remained stable from 1995 through 2005 aml accounts for 1 2 of all cancer deaths in united states incidence of aml increases with age median age at diagnosis is 63 years aml accounts for about 90 of all acute leukemias in adults but is rare in children rate of therapy related aml that is aml caused by previous chemotherapy is rising therapy related disease currently accounts for about 10 20 of all cases of aml aml is slightly more common in men with a male to female ratio of 1 3 1 there is some geographic variation in incidence of aml in adults highest rates are seen in north america europe and oceania while adult aml is rarer in asia and latin america in contrast childhood aml is less common in north america and india than in other parts of asia these differences may be due to population genetics environmental factors or a combination of two aml accounts for 34 of all leukemia cases in uk and around 2 900 people were diagnosed with disease in 2011 history thumb upright alfred velpeau first published description of a case of leukemia in medical literature dates to 1827 when french physician alfred armand louis marie velpeau described a 63 year old florist who developed an illness characterized by fever weakness urinary stones and substantial enlargement of liver and spleen velpeau noted blood of this person had a consistency like gruel and speculated appearance of blood was due to white corpuscles hoffman et al 2005 p 1071 in 1845 a series of people who died with enlarged and changes in colors and consistencies of their blood was reported by edinburgh based pathologist j h bennett he used term to describe this pathological condition term leukemia was coined by rudolf virchow renowned german pathologist in 1856 as a pioneer in use of light microscope in pathology virchow was first to describe abnormal excess of white blood cells in people with clinical syndrome described by velpeau and bennett as virchow was uncertain of etiology of white blood cell excess he used purely descriptive term leukemia greek white blood to refer to condition further advances in understanding of acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with development of new technology in 1877 paul ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells wilhelm introduced term acute leukemia in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from more indolent chronic leukemias term myeloid was coined by franz ernst christian neumann in 1869 as he was first to recognize white blood cells were made in bone marrow greek bone marrow as opposed to spleen technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by mosler finally in 1900 myeloblast which is malignant cell in aml was characterized by otto naegeli who divided leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic in 2008 aml became first cancer genome to be fully sequenced dna extracted from leukemic cells were compared to unaffected skin leukemic cells contained acquired mutations in several genes that had not previously been associated with disease pregnancy leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy affecting only about 1 in 10 000 pregnant women how it is handled depends primarily on type of leukemia acute leukemias normally require prompt aggressive treatment
