germans until after war had it been provided in time operation overlord preparations for d day could have been compromised he also provided intelligence that might have made germans believe that there was no danger of attack in balkans information that he leaked is believed to have been among potentially more damaging disclosures made by an agent during second world war german foreign office questioned intelligence provided by cicero due to large quantity of transmitted documents which meant that little if any of it was acted upon once british became aware that there was a spy operating within turkish embassy they investigated bazna installed a new alarm system and initiated an unsuccessful sting to catch him selling intelligence he stopped selling information to germans by end of february 1944 and left embassy within a month or so after war bazna was questioned for war crimes but he was never charged with espionage he attempted to buy and operate a hotel in ankara with

to protect turkey should germany attack it turkey maintained its neutrality by preventing german troops from crossing its borders into syria or ussr during this time turkey had lucrative trade relationships with germany and britain germany had significant business interests in turkey including banks and beginning in 1941 it was reliant on chromite ore from turkey for its armament production in 1943 all of chromite ore germany imported for its weaponry came from turkey throughout war turkey s economy was reliant on and prospered by virtue of its affiliation with both allies and axis powers as a result country s gold reserve had risen to 216 tons by end of 1945 from 27 tons at beginning of war thumb british prime minister winston churchill and turkish president ismet inonu in conversation during a two day conference in a train at adana circa 30 january 1943 alt starting in 1942 allies provided military aid and then began imposing economic sanctions in 1943 to force turkey to enter war allied powers wanted turkey to become engaged in a fight against germany s eastern flank however turkey was afraid of being overrun by russian and german armies both of which were led by dictators allied and axis powers became increasingly involved in espionage in turkey to protect their own strategic interests beginning in 1943 there were two allied factions western allies and soviet union germany was third entity engaged in intelligence gathering germans were able to fund their espionage propaganda and diplomacy efforts from profits of its banks in turkey by august 1944 turkey broke off relations with germany as its defeat began to seem inevitable in february 1945 it declared war on germany and japan a symbolic move that allowed turkey to join emerging united nations employment by diplomats bazna worked for foreign diplomats and consulates as a doorman driver and guard upon his return to turkey aided by his ability to speak french he served as a or valet first to yugoslav ambassador to turkey in 1942 he worked as a valet for albert jenke a german businessman and later embassy staff member who came to fire bazna for reading his mail before he worked for sir hughe knatchbull hugessen in 1943 bazna was hired to do some household and vehicle repairs for douglas busk first secretary of british embassy due to bazna s poor english he answered all interview questions in french although he supplied some written biographical information excluding having been employed and fired by jenke none of biographical information was checked turkish secret service apparently warned embassy at some point about bazna over few months that he worked for busk bazna secretly photographed a few documents and with help of mrs busk s nursemaid mara he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence busk agreed to recommend bazna for open position of valet to sir hughe knatchbull hugessen british ambassador to turkey who hired him in 1943 assuming that a background check had been performed knatchbull hugessen had been british ambassador in riga latvia until 1935 anthony cave brown author of bodyguard of lies wrote soon bazna had ingratiated himself to extent that sir hughe elevated him from purely household duties to a position of some power within residency and embassy he dressed him in an imposing blue uniform gave him a peaked cap and used him as a guard to door of his study bazna excluded visitors when sir hughe was thinking or napping for ceremonial occasions sir hughe dressed him in richly embroidered brocade shoes with turned up toes a fez with a tassel gave him an immense scimitar and placed him on main door sir hughe also paid him more than 100 turkish lira that was standard for a valet and quietly turned a blind eye to fact that bazna was having an affair with lady knatchbull hugessen s handmaiden in servants quarters bazna often sang german lieder after lunch while knatchbull hugessen played piano much to ambassador s enjoyment beginning of espionage career while at riga knatchbull hugessen had developed a habit of taking secret papers to his home from british embassy and continued that practice in ankara bazna gained access to documents in ambassador s document box and safe using his locksmithing skills including making impressions and then copies of key for document box he began photographing secret documents about war strategy troop movements and negotiations with turkey to enter war he took photographs while ambassador slept took a bath or played piano bazna approached german embassy in ankara on 1943 indicating that he wanted two rolls of film of ambassador s documents he became a spy through connection with his former employer albert jenke jenke was brother in law of joachim von ribbentrop german foreign minister although bazna was fired by jenke his wife contacted german intelligence officer ludwig carl moyzisch serving as sd officer attached to german embassy in ankara and told him of photographs that bazna had taken of classified information at british embassy he became a paid german agent under moyzisch and was given sicherheitsdienst sd code name cicero by german ambassador franz von papen due to bazna s astonishing eloquence his nazi made about of his payments in counterfeit bank notes under operation bernhard according to mummer kaylan author of islamic revival and fate of secular turkey bazna said that he began spying for germans because he needed money and although he was not a nazi he liked germans and disliked british he also alluded to involvement with milli emniyet hizmeti which became turkish national security service in 1965 british historian richard wires wrote that bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to germans wires described bazna as a typical petty criminal from balkans a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich but who was easily duped by germans intelligence thumb right enigma cipher machine during first three months of 1944 cicero supplied germans with copies of documents taken from his employer s dispatch box or safe photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in moyzisch s car which was parked inconspicuously on an ankara street on one occasion this led to a high speed chase around ankara as someone had taken an interest in hand over bazna who had perhaps been tailed escaped ultra british codebreaking system based at bletchley park routinely read german messages coded by enigma machine from that information codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach but did not know that source was british embassy in turkey guy liddell who worked for mi5 recorded that there was a breach in security at embassy on 1943 which was later reported by isos intelligence service oliver strachey leak involved an embassy diplomat bag and two agents on liddell talked to stewart menzies head of british secret intelligence service from discussion liddell learned that leak of diplomatic bag occurred during or after air attache brought it back from cairo which put not yet deployed re tables at risk and required abandonment of tables there were also missing blueprints for a gun at office of a military attache menzies stated that there was an investigation underway at embassy but nothing more was said about leak for a few months thumb allied leaders at cairo conference held in cairo egypt in november 1943 seated are gen chiang kai shek franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill as cicero bazna passed on important information about many of allied leaders conferences including moscow tehran and cairo conferences fortunately for british knatchbull hugessen only had possession of one document of notes from conferences intelligence provided by cicero included a document instructing knatchbull hugessen to request use of turkish air bases to maintain a threat to germans from eastern mediterranean until overlord is launched document carried highest security restriction bigot list cicero conveyed limited information about operation overlord code name for invasion of normandy in june 1944 which was not correlated by germans until after war when films about cicero were released according to british foreign office s postwar review of cicero s potential impacts it bazna s intelligence provided germans with streams of information from desk of ambassador about british and allied intentions in near and middle east and for conduct of war generally and might easily have compromised operation overlord preparations for d day when cicero documents predicted allied bombing missions in balkans which took place on predicted date authenticity of information was supported and his reputation enhanced moyzisch told cicero that at end of war hitler intended to give him a villa appraisal by germans copies of developed film or summaries prepared by moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior german leaders ribbentrop showed initial set of photographs to hitler immediately upon receipt hitler entered a conference with some cicero materials in december 1943 and declared that invasion in west would come in spring 1944 he concluded though that there would also be attacks in other locations such as norway or balkans according to moyzisch german foreign office did not make much use of documents because officers there were divided about their reliability for several reasons there was a steady stream of documents which was highly unusual cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images which raised question of whether he acted alone antipathy between von papen and ribbentrop added to ineffective analysis of intelligence aware of allied forces attempts to bring turkey into war however von papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy izmir and istanbul if turkey declared war against germany being able to postpone turkey s alliance with allied forces and use of their airfields von papen told ribbentrop that way was now clear to take balkans double agent hypothesis abwehr was right to worry about presence of british double agents within their secret service they were at that time already running garbo juan pujol zig zag eddie chapman and tricycle dusan popov supposedly german agents to whom they were paying large sums of money but who were in reality working for british and supplying germans with false information head of british secret intelligence service stewart menzies stated that cicero was indeed a double agent and that among documents submitted to germans were documents of misinformation author james states in his biography of allen dulles that some british historians believed that cicero was turned into a double agent to send disinformation via von papen malcolm gladwell author of pandora s briefcase said that an interviewer had questioned menzies before he died about whether he was telling truth menzies told interviewer of course cicero was under our control but his truthfulness is questioned gladwell stated in an article in new yorker if you had been wartime head of m i 6 giving an interview shortly before your death you probably would say that cicero was one of yours gladwell also mentions that while ribbentrop was wary of bazna which curtailed dissemination of some of bazna s intelligence most german intelligence officials were not wary of him anthony cave brown suggests in his book bodyguard of lies that mi6 s continental secret service chief lt col montague reaney who was responsible for security of embassy would not have overlooked bazna as a potential threat and may have fed documents that bazna found in ambassador s keeping or directly led cicero as a double agent brown states that bazna was indeed under british control within a short time after he started to photograph documents and he was a participant in plan and operation bodyguard mummer kaylan states that through his personal knowledge of bazna he thought that bazna supported turkish interests and was not guided by british intelligence further he says that bazna having passed on genuine important intelligence and codeword for operation overlord to germans supports his theory that bazna was not a double agent if he was a double agent kaylan believes he was an agent for turkish security service milli emniyet hizmeti walter schellenberg too wondered if bazna passed on intelligence to turkish secret service discovery of intelligence leaks thumb fritz kolbe a german diplomat who became america s most important spy against nazis in world war ii office of strategic services allen dulles said of him george wood our code name for kolbe was not only our best source on germany but undoubtedly one of best secret agents any intelligence service has ever had kolbe identified that there was a spy operating out of a british embassy in december 1943 fritz kolbe assistant to german diplomat karl ritter screened german cable messages for information to summarize and supply to allen dulles who was office of strategic services oss chief representative in bern in late december 1943 kolbe reported that there was a spy operating out of a british embassy with code name cicero dulles forwarded this information to mi6 agent frederick vanden heuvel on 1944 cave brown contends that dulles passed information to london in december since bazna was about to carry out acts of espionage in december brown concludes that bazna was likely a double agent american agents in ankara investigated cicero s identity based upon dulles intelligence british intelligence which was asked by dulles to interrogate cicero gave impression that it believed bazna could not speak english and furthermore was too stupid to be a spy british foreign office workers though were concerned about operation overlord leaks and thought that bazna might be cicero they implemented a sting in january 1944 using a false cabinet office document that was drafted by chair of joint intelligence committee victor cavendish bentinck and given forged signature of foreign secretary anthony eden document was planted in embassy but sting was unsuccessful in trapping bazna around january 1944 moyzisch hired a new secretary named cornelia kapp also known as nele kapp who had spied for british and americans in exchange for permission to emigrate to us she had worked at german embassy in sofia bulgaria beginning in july 1943 and within a month had become a spy in january 1944 she moved to ankara to work at german embassy under moyzisch kapp was asked by oss to learn about spy that moyzisch met with she was adept at gathering intelligence within office she flirted with cicero when he called office to schedule a meeting with moyzisch when she could she also followed two men to try to see what spy looked like but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with oss over months that she worked at embassy including all that she felt she could learn about cicero once embassy had been tipped off that there was a spy operating in facility in early 1944 bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence british field office had warned embassy of a security leak bazna forwarded document to germans warning had come to churchill from roosevelt who obtained information given by a defector to us a new alarm system in british embassy now required bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in ambassador s safe bazna gave notice about third week of january 1944 that he would be leaving ambassador s employment he stopped selling information to germans by end of february 1944 and left embassy at end of month or about without any trouble bazna was identified as cicero after war ended potential consequences in march 2005 british foreign and commonwealth office historians issued cicero papers an analysis of potential consequences of cicero affair in it they identified four important ways in which cicero s intelligence could have harmed allied forces during world war ii one of key potential consequences was possibility of alerting german regime to scope of project overlord fortunately location and date of planned invasion were not conveyed allied forces wanted turkey to declare war and join them in their efforts against germany particularly after they had taken dodecanese islands and had secured italy as a partner against germany turkish airfields were important to maintain their strategic advantage in area particularly to support operation accolade british assault on rhodes and dodecanese islands with cicero s intelligence von papen was able to delay turkey s entry into war bazna passed on details for tehran conference plans once british were aware of leak they were concerned that cicero had leaked information that might help crack british cipher but that did not occur lastly intelligence might have made germans believe that there was no danger of attack in balkans which may have been most potentially damaging information gleaned by cicero for germans after war after war ended oss conducted an investigation into cicero interviewing key german players including moyzisch it was postulated that of intelligence conveyed by cicero to germans most notable information came from knatchbull hugessen s notes particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with turkish government many of other documents were considered by head of british section of amt vi one of 11 departments of volksdeutsche to be too old to be of much value to germans moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by allies and was a witness at nuremberg trials after which he wrote a book to address rumours and explain his role during war he was never charged with a war crime knatchbull hugessen s reputation was severely affected by cicero affair particularly as he had been previously warned about leaving his keys and document boxes unattended on 1945 knatchbull hugessen received a formal severe reprimand but was not court martialed abwehr paid bazna ps300 000 which he kept hidden after war he tried to build a hotel with a partner but when his sterling notes were checked by bank of england they were found to be mostly counterfeit see operation bernhard spy remarked that notes were not worth even price of turkish linen out of which they had been manufactured bazna served some time in prison for using counterfeit money bazna lived in an apartment in european aksaray neighbourhood of istanbul with his family in 1950s he gave singing lessons and worked as a used car salesman and a night watchman much of money he earned went to creditors who had been paid with forged money he contacted west german government to be reimbursed for counterfeit money that he received although he tried many times and in many ways to get a payment he never received any money in 1960 bazna moved to germany and worked in munich as a night watchman bazna and hans wrote i was cicero which was published in 1962 it told story of cicero affair from bazna s perspective following moyzisch s book operation cicero published in 1950 bazna died in munich of kidney disease in december 1970 in popular culture according to british foreign office tale has become a popular and frequently mis told war story moyzisch published his memoirs titled operation cicero in 1950 franz von papen and allen dulles suggested that there was more to story than was published in book but neither provided any details twelve years later in 1962 i was cicero was published by cicero himself a film based on book operation cicero by moyzisch was released by 20th century fox in 1952 it was titled 5 fingers and directed by joseph l mankiewicz bazna renamed ulysses was played by james mason notes references
