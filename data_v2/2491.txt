progressive rock shortened as prog sometimes called art rock classical rock or symphonic rock is a broad genre of rock music that developed in united kingdom and united states throughout mid to late 1960s initially termed progressive pop style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz folk or classical music additional elements contributed to its progressive label lyrics were more poetic technology was harnessed for new sounds music approached condition of art and studio rather than stage became focus of musical activity which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing prog is based on fusions of styles approaches and genres involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism due to its historical reception prog s scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos long albums fantasy lyrics grandiose stage sets and costumes and an obsessive dedication to technical skill while genre is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music genre coincided with mid 1960s economic boom that allowed record labels to allocate more creative control to their artists as well as new journalistic division between pop and rock that lent generic significance to both terms prog saw a high level of popularity in early to mid 1970s but faded soon after conventional wisdom holds that rise of punk rock caused this but several more factors contributed to decline music critics who often labelled concepts as pretentious and sounds as pompous and overblown tended to be hostile towards genre or to completely ignore it after late 1970s progressive rock fragmented in numerous forms some bands achieved commercial success well into 1980s albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures or crossed into symphonic pop arena rock or new wave early groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as proto prog canterbury scene originating in late 1960s denotes a subset of prog bands who emphasised use of wind instruments complex chord changes and long improvisations rock in opposition from late 1970s was more avant garde and when combined with canterbury style created avant prog in 1980s a new subgenre neo progressive rock enjoyed some commercial success although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation post progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and avant garde since mid 1970s definition and characteristics scope and related terms term progressive rock is synonymous with art rock classical rock and symphonic rock historically art rock has been used to describe at least two related but distinct types of rock music first is progressive rock as it is generally understood while second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and hippie counterculture in favour of a modernist avant garde approach similarities between two terms are that they both describe a mostly british attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility however art rock is more likely to have experimental or avant garde influences prog was devised in 1990s as a shorthand term but later became a transferable adjective also suggesting a wider palette than that drawn on by most popular 1970s bands progressive rock is varied and is based on fusions of styles approaches and genres tapping into broader cultural resonances that connect to avant garde art classical music and folk music performance and moving image although a unidirectional english progressive style emerged in late 1960s by 1967 progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes when progressive label arrived music was dubbed progressive pop before it was called progressive rock with term progressive referring to wide range of attempts to break with standard pop music formula a number of additional factors contributed to acquired progressive label lyrics were more poetic technology was harnessed for new sounds music approached condition of art some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th century classical music album format overtook singles and studio rather than stage became focus of musical activity which often involved creating music for listening not dancing critics of genre often limit its scope to a stereotype of long solos overlong albums fantasy lyrics grandiose stage sets and costumes and an obsessive dedication to technical skill while progressive rock is often cited for its merging of high culture and low culture few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree and only a handful of groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music writer emily robinson says that narrowed definition of progressive rock was a measure against term s loose application in late 1960s when it was applied to everyone from bob dylan to rolling stones debate over genre s criterion continued to 2010s particularly on internet forums dedicated to prog according to musicologists paul hegarty and martin halliwell bill martin and edward macan authored major books about prog rock while effectively accept ing characterization of progressive rock offered by its critics they each do so largely unconsciously academic john s cotner contests macan s view that progressive rock cannot exist without continuous and overt assimilation of classical music into rock author kevin holm hudson agrees that progressive rock is a style far more diverse than what is heard from its mainstream groups and what is implied by unsympathetic critics relation to art and social theories in early references to music progressive was partly related to progressive politics but those connotations were lost during 1970s on progressive music holm hudson writes that it moves continuously between explicit and implicit references to genres and strategies derived not only from european art music but other cultural domains such as east indian celtic folk and african and hence involves a continuous aesthetic movement between formalism and eclecticism cotner also says that progressive rock incorporates both formal and eclectic elements it consists of a combination of factors some of them within others or social without one way of conceptualising rock and roll in relation to progressive music is that progressive music pushed genre into greater complexity while retracing roots of romantic and classical music sociologist paul willis believes we must never be in doubt that progressive music followed rock n roll and that it could not have been any other way we can see rock n roll as a deconstruction and progressive music as a reconstruction author will romano states that rock itself can be interpreted as a progressive idea ironically and quite paradoxically progressive rock classic era of late 1960s through mid and late 1970s introduces not only explosive and exploratory sounds of technology but traditional music forms classical and european folk and often a pastiche compositional style and artificial constructs concept albums which suggests postmodernism history 1966 70 origins background and roots thumb right beatles working in studio with their producer george martin circa 1965 in 1966 level of social and artistic correspondence among british and american rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like beatles beach boys and byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with vernacular traditions of rock progressive rock was predicated on progressive pop groups from 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as indian ragas oriental melodies and gregorian chants like beatles and yardbirds beatles paul mccartney said in 1967 we band got a bit bored with 12 bars all time so we tried to get into something else then came dylan who and beach boys we re all trying to do vaguely same kind of thing rock music started to take itself seriously paralleling earlier attempts in jazz as swing gave way to bop a move which did not succeed with audiences in this period popular song began signalling a new possible means of expression that went beyond three minute love song leading to an intersection between underground and establishment for listening publics hegarty and halliwell identify beatles beach boys doors pretty things zombies byrds grateful dead and pink floyd not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days according to musicologist walter everett beatles experimental timbres rhythms tonal structures and poetic texts on their albums rubber soul 1965 and revolver 1966 encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in early 1970s dylan s poetry mothers of invention s album freak out 1966 and beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band 1967 were all important in progressive rock s development productions of phil spector were key influences as they introduced possibility of using recording studio to create music that otherwise could never be achieved same is said for beach boys pet sounds 1966 which brian wilson intended as an answer to rubber soul and which in turn influenced beatles when they made sgt pepper dylan introduced a literary element to rock through his fascination with surrealists and french symbolists and his immersion in new york city art scene of early 1960s trend of bands with names drawn from literature such as doors steppenwolf and ides of march were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture dylan also led way in blending rock with folk music styles this was followed by folk rock groups such as byrds who based their initial sound on that of beatles in turn byrds vocal harmonies inspired those of yes and british folk rock bands like fairport convention who emphasised instrumental virtuosity some of these artists such as incredible string band and shirley and dolly collins would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music pet sounds and sgt pepper s pet sounds and sgt pepper with their lyrical unity extended structure complexity eclecticism experimentalism and influences derived from classical music forms are largely viewed as beginnings in progressive rock genre and as turning points wherein rock which previously had been considered dance music became music that was made for listening to between pet sounds and sgt pepper beach boys released single good vibrations 1966 dubbed a pocket symphony by derek taylor band s publicist song contained an eclectic array of exotic instruments and several disjunctive key and modal shifts scott interrante of popmatters wrote that its influence on progressive rock and psychedelic movement can t be overstated martin likened song to beatles a day in life from sgt pepper in that they showcase same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to although sgt pepper was preceded by several albums that had begun to bridge line between disposable pop and serious rock it successfully gave an established commercial voice to an alternative youth culture and marked point at which lp record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of single bill bruford a veteran of several progressive rock bands said that sgt pepper transformed both musicians ideas of what was possible and audiences ideas of what was acceptable in music he believed that without beatles or someone else who had done what beatles did it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock in aftermath of sgt pepper magazines such as melody maker drew a sharp line between pop and rock thus eliminating roll from rock and roll which now refers to 1950s style only artists who remained rock would be those who were considered at vanguard of compositional forms far from radio friendly standards as americans increasingly used adjective progressive for groups like jethro tull family east of eden van der graaf generator and king crimson proto prog and psychedelia

popularity of symphonic rock when they recorded days of future passed together with london festival orchestra and procol harum began to use a greater variety of acoustic instruments particularly on their 1969 album a salty dog classical influences sometimes took form of pieces adapted from or inspired by classical works such as jeff beck s beck s bolero and parts of nice s ars longa vita brevis latter along with such nice tracks as rondo and america reflect a greater interest in music that is entirely instrumental sgt pepper s and days both represent a growing tendency towards song cycles

their experimentation with suites and extended compositions such as ballet for a girl in on chicago ii jazz influences appeared in music of british bands such as traffic colosseum and if together with canterbury scene bands such as soft machine and caravan canterbury scene bands emphasised use of wind instruments complex chord changes and long improvisations martin writes that in 1968 full blown progressive rock was not yet in existence but three bands released albums who would later come to forefront of music jethro tull caravan and soft machine term progressive rock which appeared in liner notes of caravan s 1968 self titled debut lp came to be applied to bands that used classical music techniques to expand styles and concepts available to rock music nice moody blues procol harum and

scene in germany came to be labelled as krautrock internationally and is variously seen as part of progressive rock genre or an entirely distinct phenomenon bands such as can which included two members who had studied under karlheinz stockhausen tended to be more strongly influenced by 20th century classical music than british bands whose musical vocabulary leaned more towards romantic era many of these groups were very influential even among bands that had little enthusiasm for symphonic variety of progressive rock decline and fragmentation political and social trends of late 1970s shifted away from early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to genre s development and popularity rise in punk cynicism made utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable virtuosity was rejected as expense of purchasing quality instruments and time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock s energy and immediacy there were also changes in music

and 1980 many bands had by mid 1970s reached limit of how far they could experiment in a rock context and fans had wearied of extended epic compositions sounds of hammond minimoog and mellotron had been thoroughly explored and their use became cliched those bands who continued to record often simplified their sound and genre fragmented from late 1970s onwards in robert fripp s opinion once progressive rock ceased to cover new ground becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated genre s premise had ceased to be progressive era of record labels investing in their artists giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing ended with late 1970s corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount of control over creative process that had previously belonged to artists and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter a number of symphonic pop bands such as supertramp 10cc alan parsons project and electric light orchestra brought orchestral style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional

punk and prog were not necessarily as opposed as is commonly believed both genres reject commercialism and punk bands did see a need for musical advancement author doyle green noted that post punk emerged as a kind of progressive punk post punk artists rejected high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like beatles and bob dylan as well as paradigms that defined rock as progressive art or studio perfectionism in contrast to punk rock it balances punk s energy and skepticism with art school consciousness dadaist experimentalism and atmospheric ambient soundscapes world music especially

his 1973 77 output merged aspects of progressive rock with a prescient notion of new wave and punk new wave which surfaced around 1978 79 with some of same attitudes and aesthetic as punk was characterised by martin as progressive multiplied by punk bands in genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than punks and there were crossovers such as fripp and eno s involvement with talking heads and yes replacement of rick wakeman and jon anderson with pop duo buggles when king crimson reformed in 1981 they released an album discipline which macan says inaugurated new post progressive style according to martin talking heads also created a kind of new wave music that was perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive rock sophistication and creativity a good deal of more interesting rock since that time is clearly post talking heads music but this means that it is post progressive rock as well neo progressive rock a second wave of progressive rock

also influenced by funk hard rock and punk rock genre s most successful band marillion suffered particularly from accusations of similarity to genesis although they used a different vocal style incorporated more hard rock elements and were very influenced by bands including camel and pink floyd authors paul hegarty and martin halliwell have pointed out that neo progressive bands were not so much plagiarising progressive rock as they were creating a new style from progressive rock elements just as bands of a decade before had created a new style from jazz and classical elements author

describe groups that follow in style of bands from ten to twenty years earlier is somewhat controversial as it has been seen as a contradiction of spirit of experimentation and progress these new bands were aided in part by availability of personal computer based recording studios which reduced album production expenses and internet which made it easier for bands outside of mainstream to reach widespread audiences record stores specialising in progressive rock appeared in large cities shred music of 1980s was a major influence on progressive rock groups of 1990s some of newer bands such as

support from critics then faded in mid to late 1970s and experienced revivals in early 1980s each genre experienced a fragmentation of styles at this time and many metal bands from new wave of british

bela bartok this desire to expand boundaries of rock combined with some musicians toward mainstream rock and pop dismayed critics and led to accusations of elitism its intellectual fantastic and apolitical lyrics and shunning of rock s blues roots were abandonments of very things that many critics valued in rock music progressive rock also represented maturation of rock as a genre but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence so rock and maturity were mutually exclusive criticisms over complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex genre s greatest appeal is to white males most of musicians involved were male as was case for most rock of time female singers were better represented in progressive folk bands who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members british and european audiences typically followed concert hall behaviour protocols associated with classical music performances and were more reserved in their behaviour than audiences for other forms of rock this confused musicians during us tours as they found american audiences less attentive and more prone to outbursts during quiet passages these aspirations towards high culture reflect progressive rock s origins as a music created largely by upper and middle class white collar college educated males from southern england music never reflected concerns of or was embraced by working class listeners except in us where listeners appreciated musicians virtuosity progressive rock s exotic literary topics were considered particularly irrelevant to british youth during late 1970s when nation suffered from a poor economy and
