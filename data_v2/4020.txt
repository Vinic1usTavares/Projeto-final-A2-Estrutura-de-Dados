advance copy of novel provided by graydon carter another of producers who was initially interested in project proposed whitewashing role of heroine rachel chu by casting a caucasian actress prompting kwan to option rights to film for just 1 in exchange for a continuing role for creative and development decisions in august 2013 producer nina jacobson acquired rights to adapt novel into a film jacobson and her partner brad simpson intended to produce under their production banner color force with bryan developing project their initial plan was to produce film adaptation outside studio system and to structure financing for development and production from asia and other territories outside united states freedom created by eschewing typical funding structure would enable an all asian cast jacobson stated getting something in development and even getting some upfront money is an easy way to not ever see your movie get made in 2014 us based asian film investment group ivanhoe pictures partnered with jacobson to finance and produce crazy rich asians john penotti president of ivanhoe stated for us book fell in our lap kind of like this is why we re doing company unlike hollywood second guessing oh my god will this work we don t know it s all asian it was exactly opposite for us that s exactly why it will work screenwriter peter chiarelli was hired to write screenplay before a director was brought on board director jon m chu entered negotiations with color force and ivanhoe pictures in may 2016 to direct film adaptation he was hired after giving executives a visual presentation about his experience as a first generation asian american chu was actually mentioned obliquely in source novel as kwan was friends with chu s cousin vivian upon joining project chu insisted on bringing in a screenwriter of asian descent adele lim to review and revise chiarelli s script chiarelli was credited with focusing plot on dynamic between eleanor rachel and nick lim who was born in malaysia added specific cultural details and developed eleanor s character in october 2016 warner bros pictures acquired distribution rights to project after what variety called a heated bidding war netflix reportedly fervently sought worldwide rights to project offering artistic freedom a greenlighted trilogy and huge seven figure minimum paydays for each stakeholder upfront however kwan and chu selected warner bros for cultural impact of a wide theatrical release although she had initially auditioned for role of rachel in mid 2016 constance wu could not accept due to a conflict with her work on television series fresh off boat however wu wrote to chu explaining her connection with rachel s character and convinced him to push back production

be part of something monumental something that s bigger than me i m so giddy i m part of this i can t even tell you casting of nick young golding s eventual role initially had been challenging for filmmakers as director jon m chu reportedly was unsatisfied with preliminary finalists from los angeles and china as he felt that none of actors could properly replicate british accent nick was described as having from original book after receiving a tip from his accountant lisa kim kuan chu began actively pursuing golding for role of nick who he felt had proper accent and look for character biscuit films a production company based in petaling jaya that provided support for film commissioned casting director lai to provide local talent which included carmen soo as francesca shaw a socialite and calvin wong peik lin s awkward brother film s casting prior to release was met with both praise in u s for its all asian cast and criticism for its lack of asian ethnic diversity based on issues ranging from non chinese actors golding and mizuno playing chinese roles film s ethnic chinese and east asian predominance as being poorly representative of singapore and as being a perpetuation of existing chinese dominance in its media and pop culture for more discussion on criticism of casting choices refer to filming thumb carcosa seri negara in malaysia featured in film as

co written crazy rich asians with peter chiarelli left production on film s sequels following a pay dispute lim had reportedly been offered 110 000 united states dollars to pen sequels while chiarelli had been offered 800 000 1 000 000 for same role lim stated that pay difference represented a greater issue of sexism and racism in hollywood as industry views women and people of color as soy sauce or simply a means to add minor cultural details to screenplays rather than to provide a substantial writing role director jon m chu voiced support for lim in a statement explaining that while he was disappointed she wouldn t return for sequels he would continue to work with lim elsewhere and that conversation this has started is much more important than ourselves so who am i to get in way of that

many years warner bros business affairs department issued a response as well stating that chiarelli had more experience working on films as lim s resume had only consisted of television credits prior to crazy rich asians and that making an exception would set a troubling precedent in business they also noted that an alternative offer for lim had been drafted which she did not take lim later voiced thanks for public support she had received writing on twitter to people going through their own fight you are not alone also i have only love for jon m chu and cast crew of crazy rich asians see also
