new york state route 74 ny 74 and vermont route 74 vt 74 are state highways in northeastern united states connected by one of last remaining cable ferries in north america together they extend for through essex county new york and addison county vermont ny 74 begins at exit 28 off interstate 87 i 87 in hamlet of severance in adirondack mountains region of northern part of new york state it extends to western shore of lake champlain in ticonderoga there seasonal fort ticonderoga larrabees point ferry carries cars across state border into vermont where vt 74 starts at lake s eastern shore and terminates later at a junction with vt 30 in town of cornwall ny 74 is a descendant of historic ticonderoga and schroon turnpike which was a privately owned highway chartered in 1832 and segments of it follow alignment of original 19th century turnpike connecting ferry route predating both ny 74 and vt 74 began operation in 1759 on an informal basis ferry operation was formalized at close of 18th century and upgraded to a cable system in 1946 due to extensive changes in designations in both states during 20th century entire length of present highway consists of renamed segments from other highways new york portion of cross state route 74 west of ticonderoga was designated as part of ny 73 in 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york while vermont section carried several different designations from 1920s to late 1930s when it became solely part of vermont route f 9 ny 73 was extended east to lake champlain in 1950s replacing new york state route 347 and vt f 9 was split into vt 73 and vt 74 shortly afterward schroon ticonderoga highway was redesignated as ny 74 after ny 73 was cut back to its current eastern terminus in elizabethtown route description ny 74 ny 74 originates at exit 28 of adirondack northway i 87 in town of schroon starting interchange is close to local landmark severance hill which reaches an elevation of ny 74 intersects north south u s route 9 us 9

mountains and hills on southern side of ny 74 near end of paradox lake cotters pond by state law is a water body that cannot be used for this was designated by new york state department of environmental conservation shortly afterward ny 74 passes bumbo pond and enters hamlet of paradox after leaving paradox ny 74 turns to southeast along base of skiff mountain highway then approaches a creek that flows into eagle lake ny 74 crosses over eagle lake and runs along base of eagle cliff and shores of lake after leaving eagle lake highway intersects with county route 2 cr 2 first numbered highway that ny 74 encounters after us 9 this stretch of ny 74 skirts base of keeney mountain which peaks at ny 74 then intersects with cr 56 which parallels main route to south cr 56 merges back with ny 74 which leaves mountainous region for hamlet of ticonderoga ny 74 intersects with ny 9n and ny 22 in hamlet latter of two highways becomes concurrent with ny 74 ny 22 and ny 74 continue to east heading around outskirts of ticonderoga ny 74 intersects with cr 49 before ny 74 turns to southeast ny 22 and ny 74 head southward toward center of ticonderoga at intersection with montcalm street ny 74 turns eastward off ny 22 which heads southward for washington county thumb view towards vermont as ny 74 descends to ticonderoga alt a road curving to left with a car on it and a sign warning of a steep grade it is descending toward a lower area with some buildings and another stretch of road in distance is a line of mountains ny 74 crosses local roads as it continues eastward toward lake champlain highway passes entrance to fort ticonderoga and ticonderoga amtrak station new york portion of ny 74 terminates at a ferry landing by lake champlain at state border fort ticonderoga larrabees point ferry fort ticonderoga larrabees point ferry is oldest and southernmost ferry on lake champlain its cable system consists of two steel cables in parallel alignment current ferry barge

passage operates during daylight hours vt 74 after crossing state line via fort ticonderoga larrabees point ferry vt 74 begins its track into vermont highway heads a short distance to north passing a thinly populated area in shoreham as intermittent forest yields to fields and farmlands after from border vt 74 intersects with vt 73 before encountering barnum hill road near barnum hill intersection vt 74 passes developed areas and bends more toward north vt 74 then turns to northeast at smith street and enters a patch of forest afterward vt 74 climbs a hill and intersects with harrington hill road where it turns northward once again left thumb signs at southern end of vt 74 s concurrency with vt 22a alt ground level view of a road with two green and white roadsigns a church is visible on left fields and forests surround this thinly populated stretch of highway at intersection with blue harbor road vt 74 turns to east and heads toward downtown shoreham within central shoreham vt 74 is known as main street and has a short concurrency with vt 22a as vt 74 leaves densely populated portion of shoreham concurrency ends and vt 74 takes an eastward turn toward cornwall as vt 74 returns to rural countryside it bends toward northeast for most of distance to cornwall through this stretch highway winds through forests and occasional farmland vt 74 straightens at an intersection with bates road a connector road called north palmer road merges with vt 74 shortly afterward vt 74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near intersection with elmendorf road as it continues toward cornwall intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas at clark road in cornwall vt 74 turns to northeast once again passing through more forests before terminating at vt 30 in cornwall early history schroon and its early highways settlers of european descent began to populate region near modern schroon around 1797 area s first municipality was town of crown point which originally included considerable portions of thinly populated land that later developed into separate townships first of these divisions occurred on march 20 1804 with establishment of town of schroon minerva split from crown point in march 1817 before another municipal reorganization in 1840 implemented further reductions to land area of crown point during this period two thoroughfares served area that correspond to parts of modern ny 74 and us 9 one of these old state roads traversed route covered by current alignment of ny 74 from schroon to ticonderoga ticonderoga and schroon turnpike entire length of ny 74 from ticonderoga to schroon covers same route as 19th century ticonderoga and schroon turnpike which was chartered in april 1832 two toll gates were erected specifically for use on highway and charter allowed for additional toll gates at a spacing of approximately one for every ten miles of completed highway turnpike management raised funds by selling 600 shares valued at 25 equivalent to in each 20 000 equivalent to in was also set aside for properties along highway designation history designations from 1913 to 1930s thumb a truss bridge on ny 74 in essex county alt a relatively small steel bridge seen from side in 1913 new york state legislature designated most of modern ny 74 as route 22 b an unsigned legislative route it ran for from route 22 now us 9 in schroon to western edge of then village of ticonderoga on march 1 1921 route 22 b became part of route 48 a new route created as part of a partial renumbering of new york s legislative route system in 1924 when state highways were first publicly signed with route numbers highway from schroon to ticonderoga remained unnumbered during 1930 renumbering of state highways in new york segment of modern ny 74 between us 9 in schroon and ny 22 in ticonderoga was designated as part of ny 73 a route extending from ny 28n in tahawus to ticonderoga ny 73 followed blue ridge road from tahawus to north hudson and had an overlap with us 9 from north hudson to schroon portion of ny 73 between tahawus and north hudson was removed from state highway system as a result ny 73 was truncated to a new western terminus at us 9 in schroon eliminating concurrency with us 9 blue ridge road is now designated as cr 84 from ny 28n in to adirondack northway in north hudson and as ny a short unsigned reference route from northway to us 9 on vermont side road connecting larrabees point to main north south highways in area was designated as vt f 9 by 1926 vt f 9 began at ferry landing at larrabees point and continued northeast to shoreham center where it briefly overlapped with then vt 30a modern vt 22a past vt 30a vt f 9 continued east along what are now town highways through whiting to leicester where it ended at a junction with us 7 at time modern vt 74 between shoreham and cornwall centers was known as vt f 9a while what is now vt 73 from larrabees point to brown lane north of town center of orwell was part of vt f 10a changes from 1933 onward by 1933 highway linking ny 22 in ticonderoga to ferry for larrabees point became part of ny 8 ny 8 was realigned to follow ny 22 north from ticonderoga to crown point where it left ny 22 to follow ny 347 modern ny 185 to champlain bridge ny 347 designation was reassigned to ny 8 s former routing between ny 22 and ferry landing east of ticonderoga thumb left vt 74 departing from point ferry landing alt ground level view of a road with a series of signs visible on right side vt f 9 meanwhile was extended southward to orwell over vt f 10a by 1938 like vt f 10a it initially bypassed orwell to north on brown lane however it was realigned in late 1930s to follow modern vt 73 into orwell around same time vt f 9 was realigned east of shoreham to follow vt f 9a northeast to cornwall vt f 9a designation was eliminated while former routing of vt f 9 between shoreham and leicester became unnumbered in november 1952 new york extended ny 73 east to ferry landing by way of ny 347 and wicker and montcalm streets vermont renumbered larrabees point orwell section of vt f 9 to vt 73 in 1954 in order to match new york route number at same time larrabees point cornwall section of vt f 9 was renumbered by vermont to vt 74 ny 73 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in underwood eliminating a lengthy overlap with us 9 while its former routing from schroon to lake champlain was renumbered to ny 74 matching other vermont route number that ends in larrabees point already existing ny 74 in chautauqua county in jamestown area was renumbered to ny 474 as a result opening of adirondack northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of western terminus of ny 74 from us 9 to i 87 by 1981 ny 74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around northeastern edge of ticonderoga on a concurrency with ny 22 highway has remained same since that date new york state department of transportation has announced a project to repave ny 74 from chilson to paradox project is in preliminary development with construction is expected to begin in early 2013 and reach completion about a year later funding will come from state sources and run an estimated cost of 8 6 million ferry history according to its website ferry operated informally from 1759 and in an organized way from 1799 earliest ferries are believed to have been rowboats or canoes a double ended sailing scow was in service by 1800 this vessel was about long with a mainsail that would swing completely around mast to provide a simple means of reversing course ferry size continued to increase with traffic until system upgraded to a cable guidance system in 1946 john s larrabee of vermont established first regular ferry at location in late 18th century vermont state legislature approved a franchise for a ferry from larrabees point to ticonderoga in 1907 to shoreham and ticonderoga ferry company new york state legislature granted ferry a franchise in 1918 major intersections see also references external links photographs of vt 74 termini state ends com 074 074 new york state route 074 vermont route 074
