reviews from critics a v club zack handlen rated episode an a finding it is like many episodes of this season before it a bit of mess a melange of concepts which don t always taste so great together handlen felt that episode began with an iffy premise which more closely resembled an episode of x files but by its end had managed to make it something more distinct and separate bill gibron writing for dvd talk rated episode 3 5 out of 5 writing that it was an episode that pays lip service to group s interest in this case to merely go back to same old killer of week conceit however gibron felt that acting is wonderful and actual story very moody and atmospheric robert shearman and lars pearson in their book wanting to believe a critical guide to x files millennium lone gunmen rated pest house three and a half stars out of five shearman praised guest star massee s performance and felt that script was great fun noting that it worked as a more serious version of 1996 film scream notes
