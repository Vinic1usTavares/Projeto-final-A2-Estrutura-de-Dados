special effects extravaganza aline mendelsohn of orlando sentinel noted influence from janet jackson in show s choreography and suggestive themes which had attracted many headlines due to heightened sensitivity of post janet jackson era mtv uk highlighted comparisons with early madonna tours such as girlie show world tour and added that show is a theatrical extravaganza complete with camp compere sexy dancers glitzy costumes and extravagant set pieces and its all fabulously raunchy bill dean of ledger reported that tour was big sloppy and sex filled he also added her presence remains captivating perhaps even onyx tour s most significant role may be foretelling a future in broadway or film musicals neil strauss of new york times claimed her show was more a theater and dance spectacle than an actual concert with staging equal parts and redeveloped times square at times show seemed more like a las vegas tribute to ms spears than a concert by ms spears herself chris willman of entertainment weekly believed that in britney paul verhoeven s fantastic notion of showgirl as superstar has become incarnate but every showgirl needs a show onyx hotel tour hardly counts as one with its arbitrary mishmash of madonna esque sex bomb skits and cirque du soleil surrealism seattle timess pamela sitt said it was high on spectacle and low on substance veering crazily from burlesque to fairy tale to peep show doug elfman of las vegas review journal stated that tour is an unfocused bore of false sexuality horrible songs trite choreography unfocused themes and less ambition than a house cat that sits around licking itself all day darryl morden of msnbc com commented at times it was entertaining but overall came off as a variation on same show she s been doing for several years commercial performance tickets sold slower than her previous tours this was attributed to change in audience since her new demographic tended to be typically a last second ticket purchaser a month before tour began seven dates were already sold out including fresno and toronto shows tour merchandise grossed 4 million on north american leg alone with an average of between 150 000 and 170 000 per

jonathan stoler who defended spears on case said these are same insurers who had provided her with policies on several tours and they had cleared her and were aware of previous injury alleged omission related to a question whereby ms spears was asked if in past five years she had had any surgery ms spears in all prior circumstances had indicated she had but at time she was going through this
