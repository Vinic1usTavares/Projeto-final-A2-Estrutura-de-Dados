sarcoscypha occidentalis commonly known as stalked scarlet cup or western scarlet cup is a species of fungus in family sarcoscyphaceae of pezizales order fruit bodies have small bright red cups up to wide atop a slender whitish stem that is between long a saprobic species it is found growing on hardwood twigs particularly those that are partially buried in moist and shaded humus rich soil fungus is distributed in continental united states east of rocky mountains central america caribbean and asia it is distinguished from related species s coccinea and s austriaca by differences in geographical distribution fruiting season and fruit body structure phylogenetic analysis has shown that it is most closely related to other sarcoscypha species that contain large oil droplets in their spores species molliardiomyces occidentalis is an imperfect form of fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle taxonomy and naming fungus originally collected from county ohio was named peziza occidentalis by lewis david de schweinitz in 1832 it was assigned its current name by pier andrea saccardo in 1888 andrew price morgan renamed species geopyxis occidentalis in 1902 because of a perceived similarity with geopyxis but name change was not adopted by subsequent authors in 1928 fred jay seaver overturned saccardo s naming and applied name plectania to sarcoscypha coccinea and other red cup fungi in later taxonomic revisions richard p korf reinstated genus name sarcoscypha specific epithet occidentalis derived from latin word for western may refer to distribution of species in western hemisphere it is commonly known as stalked scarlet cup or western scarlet cup phylogeny phylogenetic relationships in genus sarcoscypha were analyzed by francis harrington in late 1990s cladistic analysis combined comparison of sequences from internal transcribed spacer in non functional rna with fifteen traditional morphological characters such as spore features fruit body shape and degree of hair curliness based on this analysis s occidentalis is part of a clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes species s dudleyi s s s and s mesocyatha all of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores in contrast to other major clade of sarcoscypha containing type species s coccinea characterized by having smaller more numerous droplets species most closely related to s occidentalis is s mesocyatha known only from hawaii description thumb left s occidentalis grows on sticks and twigs depending on their age fruit bodies of s occidentalis may range in shape from deep cups to saucers to discs in maturity and they can reach diameters up to in young specimens edges of cup are curled inwards and crenulate with small rounded scallops cup edges in older specimens become with jagged edges cut into irregular segments cups rest atop a stem that is small to medium sized up to long and 1 5 2 mm thick and attached centrally or to side to underside of cup base of stem may be covered with translucent hairs fertile spore bearing inner surface of cups hymenium is bright red but fades to yellow or orange when dry it is smooth or becomes so with time fruit bodies are fleshy to rubbery when fresh but become leathery when dry flesh is thin and has no distinctive odor or taste s occidentalis is of no culinary value a jamaican variety has been named as plectania occidentalis var jamaicensis it has a pinker hymenium thumb right micrograph of spores and asci exipulum is a term used to refer to tissue or tissues containing hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body ectal outer tissue layer is thin 20 30 um thickness made of a tissue type known as consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction with wide lumina and non thickened walls medullary exipulum middle tissue layer is thick 200 600 um and made of textura a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between hyphae asci filamentous structures in which ascospores develop are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases eight spored and measure 240 280 by 12 15 um ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes usually with blunt ends and measure 19 22 by 10 12 um they have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops paraphyses sterile filamentous hyphae present in hymenium are cylindrical 2 3 um thick barely enlarged at their apices straight and mostly unbranched above they may sometimes but do not form a conspicuous network paraphyses contain numerous red granules anamorph form anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle and typically reproduce by process of mitosis in structures called conidia in some cases sexual stage or teleomorph stage is later identified and a teleomorph anamorph relationship is established between species international code of botanical nomenclature permits recognition of two or more names for one and same organisms one based on teleomorph other s restricted to anamorph anamorphic state of s occidentalis is molliardiomyces occidentalis described by john w paden this form produces smooth colorless conidiophores specialized stalks that bear conidia measuring 20 230 by 2 3 2 um conidia are roughly spherical to ovoid smooth translucent hyaline and 4 6 7 0 by 3 0 3 8 um similar species sarcoscypha occidentalis is frequently confused with s coccinea but is distinguished macroscopically from this species by its smaller fruit bodies smaller spores and less hairy exterior two also differ in seasonal and geographic distribution s coccinea fruits earlier in year and is distributed in eastern north america in midwest in valleys between pacific coast and sierras and cascades as well as europe africa australia and india another eastern north american species s austriaca has scarlet fruit bodies up to wide and fruits in early spring s occidentalis may also be mistaken for floccosum which occurs in same habitat m floccosum however has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs another cup fungus scutellinia scutellata is disc shaped without a stem and is fringed with black hairs around its rim ecology habitat and distribution as a saprobic fungus sarcoscypha occidentalis is part of a community of fungi that play an important role in forest ecosystem by breaking down complex insoluble molecules cellulose and lignin of wood and leaf litter into smaller oligosaccharides that may be used by a variety of microbes fruit bodies of s coccinea may grow either solitarily scattered or grouped together on sticks twigs and fragments of dead wood usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in top of soil and forest litter it prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of humus like all sarcoscypha species it prefers wood of angiosperms such as oak maple and basswood one field guide notes a preference for shagbark hickory in united states it fruits from late spring to early autumn which contrasts it with s coccinea found usually in spring fungus is found in north america east of rocky mountains and at higher elevations in central america and caribbean it has also been collected in japan and taiwan references external links category sarcoscyphaceae category fungi of asia category fungi of north america category fungi described in 1832
