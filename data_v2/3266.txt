thumb 400px photograph of crescent of planet neptune top and its moon triton center taken by voyager 2 during its 1989 flyby definition of planet since word was coined by ancient greeks has included within its scope a wide range of celestial bodies greek astronomers employed term asteres planetai asteres planetai wandering stars for star like objects which apparently moved over sky over millennia term has included a variety of different objects from sun and moon to satellites and asteroids by end of 19th century word planet though it had yet to be defined had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in solar system after 1992 however astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond orbit of neptune as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars these discoveries not only increased number of potential planets but also expanded their variety and peculiarity some were nearly large enough to be stars while others were smaller than earth s moon these discoveries challenged long perceived notions of what a planet could be issue of a clear definition for planet came to a head in january 2005 with discovery of trans neptunian object eris a body more massive than smallest then accepted planet pluto in its august 2006 response international astronomical union iau recognised by astronomers as world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature released its decision on matter during a meeting in prague this definition which applies only to solar system states that a planet is a body that orbits sun is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round and has cleared its neighbourhood of smaller objects around its orbit under this new definition pluto and other trans neptunian objects do not qualify as planets iau s decision has not resolved all controversies and while many scientists have accepted definition some in astronomical community have rejected it outright in particular some favor a strictly geophysical definition of a planet history planets in antiquity thumb upright philosopher plato while knowledge of planets predates history and is common to most civilizations word planet dates back to ancient greece most greeks believed earth to be stationary and at center of universe in accordance with geocentric model and that objects in sky and indeed sky itself revolved around it an exception was aristarchus of samos who put forward an early version of heliocentrism greek astronomers employed term asteres planetai asteres planetai wandering stars to describe those starlike lights in heavens that moved over course of year in contrast to asteres aplaneis asteres aplaneis fixed stars which stayed motionless relative to one another five bodies currently called planets that were known to greeks were those visible to naked eye mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn graeco roman cosmology commonly considered seven planets with sun and moon counted among them as is case in modern astrology however there is some ambiguity on that point as many ancient astronomers distinguished five star like planets from sun and moon as 19th century german naturalist alexander von humboldt noted in his work cosmos of seven cosmical bodies which by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart have ever since remotest antiquity been distinguished from orbs of heaven of fixed stars which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged five only mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn wear appearance of stars cinque while sun and moon from size of their disks their importance to man and place assigned to them in mythological systems were classed apart thumb left planets as understood before acceptance of heliocentric model in his timaeus written in roughly 360 bc plato mentions sun and moon and five other stars which are called planets his student aristotle makes a similar distinction in his on heavens movements of sun and moon are fewer than those of some of planets in his phaenomena which set to verse an astronomical treatise written by philosopher eudoxus in roughly 350 bc poet aratus describes those five other orbs that intermingle with constellations and wheel wandering on every side of twelve figures of zodiac in his almagest written in 2nd century ptolemy refers to sun moon and five planets hyginus explicitly mentions five stars which many have called wandering and which greeks call planeta marcus manilius a latin writer who lived during time of caesar augustus and whose poem astronomica is considered one of principal texts for modern astrology says now is divided into five parts for so many are stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven single view of seven planets is found in cicero s dream of scipio written sometime around 53 bc where spirit of scipio africanus proclaims seven of these spheres contain planets one planet in each sphere which all move contrary to movement of heaven in his natural history written in 77 ad pliny elder refers to seven stars which owing to their motion we call planets though no stars wander less than they do nonnus 5th century

rejected geocentric model was ambivalent concerning whether sun and moon were planets in his de revolutionibus copernicus clearly separates sun moon planets and stars however in his dedication of work to pope paul iii copernicus refers to motion of sun and moon and of five other planets earth thumb upright copernicus eventually when copernicus s heliocentric model was accepted over geocentric earth was placed among planets and sun and moon were reclassified necessitating a conceptual revolution in understanding of planets as historian of science thomas kuhn noted in his book structure of scientific revolutions thomas s kuhn 1962 structure of scientific revolutions 1st ed chicago university of chicago press pp 115 128 9 who denied its traditional title planet to sun were changing meaning of planet so that it would continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies were seen differently from way they had been seen before looking at moon convert to copernicanism says i once took moon to be or saw moon as a planet but i was mistaken copernicus obliquely refers to earth as a planet in de revolutionibus when he says having thus assumed motions which i ascribe to earth later on in volume by long and intense study i finally found that if motions of other planets are correlated with orbiting of earth galileo also asserts that earth is a planet in dialogue concerning two chief world systems t he earth no less than moon or any other planet is to be numbered among natural bodies that move modern planets thumb upright william herschel discoverer of uranus in 1781 astronomer william herschel was searching sky for elusive stellar parallaxes when he observed what he termed a comet in constellation of taurus unlike stars which remained mere points of light even under high magnification this object s size increased in proportion to power used that this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to herschel five planets beyond earth had been part of humanity s conception of universe since antiquity as asteroids had yet to be discovered comets were only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope however unlike a comet this object s orbit was nearly circular and within ecliptic plane before herschel announced his discovery of his comet his colleague british astronomer royal nevil maskelyne wrote to him saying i don t know what to call it it is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to sun as a comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis i have not yet seen any coma or tail to it comet was also very far away too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself eventually it was recognised as seventh planet and named uranus after father of saturn gravitationally induced irregularities in uranus s observed orbit led eventually to discovery of neptune in 1846 and presumed irregularities in neptune s orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find perturbing object it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of neptune s mass but did find pluto in 1930 initially believed to be roughly mass of earth observation gradually shrank pluto s estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large far too small to have influenced neptune s orbit at all in 1989 voyager 2 determined irregularities to be due to an overestimation of neptune s mass satellites thumb upright galileo galilei when copernicus placed earth among planets he also placed moon in orbit around earth making moon first natural satellite to be identified when galileo discovered his four satellites of jupiter in 1610 they lent weight to copernicus s argument because if other planets could have satellites then earth could too however there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were planets galileo referred to them as four planets flying around star of jupiter at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness similarly christiaan huygens upon discovering saturn s largest moon titan in 1655 employed many terms to describe it including planeta planet stella star luna moon and more modern satellite attendant giovanni cassini in announcing his discovery of saturn s moons iapetus and rhea in 1671 and 1672 described them as nouvelles planetes autour de new planets around saturn however when journal de scavans reported cassini s discovery of two new saturnian moons in 1686 it referred to them strictly as satellites though sometimes saturn as primary planet when william herschel announced his discovery of two objects in orbit around uranus in 1787 he referred to them as satellites and secondary planets all subsequent reports of natural satellite discoveries used term satellite exclusively see primary citations in timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moons though 1868 book smith s illustrated astronomy referred to satellites as secondary planets minor planets thumb upright giuseppe piazzi discoverer of ceres one of unexpected results of william herschel s discovery of uranus was that it appeared to validate bode s law a mathematical function which generates size of semimajor axis of planetary orbits astronomers had considered law a meaningless coincidence but uranus fell at very nearly exact distance it predicted since bode s law also predicted a body between mars and jupiter that at that point had not been observed astronomers turned their attention to that region in hope that it might be vindicated again finally in 1801 astronomer giuseppe piazzi found a miniature new world ceres lying at just correct point in space object was hailed as a new planet then in 1802 heinrich olbers discovered pallas a second planet at roughly same distance from sun as ceres that two planets could occupy same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking even shakespeare had ridiculed idea two stars keep not their motion in one sphere even so in 1804 another world juno was discovered in a similar orbit in 1807 olbers discovered a fourth object vesta at a similar orbital distance herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification asteroids meaning starlike since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled stars though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets this conception was entrenched by fact that due to difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet uncharted stars those four remained only asteroids known until 1845 science textbooks in 1828 after herschel s death still numbered asteroids among planets with arrival of more refined star charts search for asteroids resumed and a fifth and sixth were discovered by karl ludwig in 1845 and 1847 by 1851 number of asteroids had increased to 15 and a new method of classifying them by affixing a number before their names in order of discovery was adopted inadvertently placing them in their own distinct category ceres became 1 ceres pallas became 2 pallas and so on by 1860s number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred and observatories in europe and united states began referring to them collectively as minor planets or small planets though it took first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such to this day minor planet remains official designation for all small bodies in orbit around sun and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in iau s minor planet catalogue pluto thumb upright clyde tombaugh discoverer of pluto long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by ceres is mirrored in story of pluto which was named a planet soon after its discovery by clyde tombaugh in 1930 uranus and neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits large masses and proximity to ecliptic plane none of these applied to pluto a tiny and icy world in a region of gas giants with an orbit that carried it high above ecliptic and even inside that of neptune in 1978 astronomers discovered pluto s largest moon charon which allowed them to determine its mass pluto was found to be much than anyone had expected only one sixth mass of earth s moon however as far as anyone could yet tell it was unique then beginning in 1992 astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond orbit of neptune that were similar to pluto in composition size and orbital characteristics they concluded that they had discovered long hypothesised kuiper belt sometimes called edgeworth kuiper belt a band of icy debris that is source for short period comets those with orbital periods of up to 200 years pluto s orbit lay within this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question many scientists concluded that tiny pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet just as ceres had been a century earlier mike brown of california institute of technology suggested that a planet should be redefined as any body in solar system that is more massive than total mass of all of other bodies in a similar orbit those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets in 1999 brian g marsden of harvard university s minor planet center suggested that pluto be given minor planet number 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet prospect of pluto s demotion created a public outcry and in response international astronomical union clarified that it was not at that time proposing to remove pluto from planet list copy kept at argonne national laboratory discovery of several other trans neptunian objects approaching size of pluto such as quaoar and sedna continued to erode arguments that pluto was exceptional from rest of trans neptunian population on july 29 2005 mike brown and his team announced discovery of a trans neptunian object confirmed to be more massive than pluto named eris in immediate aftermath of object s discovery there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a tenth planet nasa even put out a press release describing it as such however acceptance of eris as tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set pluto as an arbitrary minimum size many astronomers claiming that definition of planet was of little scientific importance preferred to recognise pluto s historical identity as a planet by it into planet list iau definition discovery of eris forced iau to act on a definition in october 2005 a group of 19 iau members which had already been working on a definition since discovery of sedna in 2003 narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three using approval voting definitions were thumb upright michael e brown discoverer of eris a planet is any object in orbit around sun with a diameter greater than 2000 km eleven votes in favour a planet is any object in orbit around sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity eight votes in favour a planet is any object in orbit around sun that is dominant in its immediate neighbourhood six votes in favour since no consensus could be reached committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at iau general assembly meeting in prague in august 2006 and on august 24 iau put a final draft to a vote which combined elements from two of three proposals it essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock or in new parlance small solar system body called dwarf planet and placed pluto in it along with ceres and eris vote was passed with 424 astronomers taking part in ballot orig link quote iau therefore resolves that planets and other bodies in our solar system except satellites be defined into three distinct categories in following way 1 a planet 1 is a celestial body that a is in orbit around sun b has sufficient mass for its self gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round shape and c has cleared neighbourhood around its orbit 2 a dwarf planet is a celestial body that a is in orbit around sun b has sufficient mass for its self gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium nearly round c has not cleared neighbourhood around its orbit and d is not a satellite 3 all other except satellites orbiting sun shall be referred to collectively as small solar system bodies footnotes 1 eight planets are mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 2 an iau process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories 3 these currently include most of solar system asteroids most trans neptunian objects tnos comets and other small bodies iau further resolves pluto is a dwarf planet by above definition and is recognised as prototype of a new category of trans neptunian objects iau also resolved that planets and dwarf planets are two distinct classes of objects meaning that dwarf planets despite their name would not be considered planets on september 13 2006 iau placed eris its moon dysnomia and pluto into their minor planet catalogue giving them official minor planet designations 134340 pluto 136199 eris and 136199 eris i dysnomia web archive other possible dwarf planets such as 2003 el61 2005 fy9 sedna and quaoar were left in temporary limbo until a formal decision could be reached regarding their status on june 11 2008 iau executive committee announced establishment of a subclass of dwarf planets comprising aforementioned new category of trans neptunian objects to which pluto is a prototype this new class of objects termed plutoids would include pluto eris and any other future trans neptunian dwarf planets but excluded ceres iau also determined that for naming purposes only those tnos with an absolute magnitude brighter than h 1 would be allowed into category to date only two other tnos 2003 el61 and 2005 fy9 meet absolute magnitude requirement while other potential dwarf planets such as sedna orcus and quaoar do not on july 11 2008 working group on planetary nomenclature included 2005 fy9 in plutoid class naming it makemake on september 17 2008 2003 el61 joined category with name haumea acceptance of iau definition thumb plot of current positions of all known kuiper belt objects set against outer planets among most vocal proponents of iau s decided definition are mike brown discoverer of eris steven soter professor of astrophysics at american museum of natural history and neil degrasse tyson director of hayden planetarium in early 2000s when hayden planetarium was undergoing a 100 million renovation tyson refused to refer to pluto as ninth planet at planetarium space com 2001 astronomer responds to pluto not a planet claim he explained that he would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them this decision resulted in tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail primarily from children colbert report august 17 2006 in 2009 tyson wrote a book detailing demotion of pluto in an article in january 2007 issue of scientific american soter cited definition s incorporation of current theories of formation and evolution of solar system that as earliest protoplanets emerged from swirling dust of protoplanetary disc some bodies won initial competition for limited material and as they grew their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material and thus grew larger eventually outstripping other bodies in solar system by a very wide margin asteroid belt disturbed by gravitational tug of nearby jupiter and kuiper belt too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before end of initial formation period both failed to win accretion competition when numbers for winning objects are compared to those of losers contrast is striking if soter s concept that each planet occupies an orbital zone is accepted then least dominant planet mars is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100 ceres largest object in asteroid belt only accounts for one third of material in its orbit pluto s ratio is even lower at around 7 percent mike brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong ongoing controversies despite iau s declaration a number of critics remain unconvinced definition is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing a number of pluto as planet proponents in particular alan stern head of nasa s new horizons mission to pluto have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter definition stern s claim is that since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it decision was not representative of entire astronomical community even with this controversy excluded however there remain several ambiguities in definition clearing neighbourhood one of main points at issue is precise meaning of cleared neighbourhood around its orbit alan stern objects that it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets and that since neither earth mars jupiter nor neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris none could properly be considered planets under iau definition thumb asteroids of inner solar system note trojan asteroids green trapped into jupiter s orbit by its gravity mike brown counters these claims by saying that far from not having cleared their orbits major planets completely control orbits of other bodies within their orbital zone jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit trojan asteroids but these bodies only exist in jupiter s orbit because they are in sway of planet s huge gravity similarly pluto may cross orbit of neptune but neptune long ago locked pluto and its attendant kuiper belt objects called plutinos into a 3 2 resonance i e they orbit sun twice for every three neptune orbits orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by neptune s gravity and thus neptune is gravitationally dominant in october 2015 astronomer jean luc margot of university of california los angeles proposed a metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone of extent 2 of its hill radius in a specific time scale this metric places a clear dividing line between dwarf planets and planets of solar system calculation is based on mass of host star mass of body and orbital period of body an earth mass body orbiting a solar mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 astronomical units from star a mars mass body at orbit of pluto clears its orbit this metric which leaves pluto as a dwarf planet applies to both solar system and to extrasolar systems some opponents of definition have claimed that clearing neighbourhood is an ambiguous concept mark sykes director of planetary science institute in tucson arizona and organiser of petition expressed this opinion to national public radio he believes that definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation but effectively by its location he believes that a mars sized or larger object beyond orbit of pluto would not be considered a planet because he believes that it would not have time to clear its orbit brown notes however that were clearing neighbourhood criterion to be abandoned number of planets in solar system could rise from eight to more than 50 with hundreds more potentially to be discovered hydrostatic equilibrium thumb left proteus a moon of neptune is irregular despite being larger than spheroidal mimas iau s definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own gravity to form them into a state of hydrostatic equilibrium this means that they will reach a round ellipsoidal shape up to a certain mass an object can be irregular in shape but beyond that point gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until object collapses into an ellipsoid none of large objects of solar system are truly spherical many are spheroids and several such as larger moons of jupiter and saturn and dwarf planet have been further distorted into by rapid rotation or tidal forces but still in hydrostatic equilibrium however there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium as soter noted in his article how are we to quantify degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and shapes so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice furthermore point at which an object s mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on chemical makeup of object objects made of ices such as enceladus and miranda assume that state more easily than those made of rock such as vesta and pallas heat energy from gravitational collapse impacts tidal forces or radioactive decay also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not saturn s icy moon mimas is ellipsoidal but neptune s larger moon proteus which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from sun is irregular in addition much larger iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is double planets and moons thumb a telescopic image of pluto and charon definition specifically excludes satellites from category of dwarf planet though it does not directly define term satellite in original draft proposal an exception was made for pluto and its largest satellite charon which possess a barycenter outside volume of either body initial proposal classified pluto charon as a double planet with two objects orbiting sun in tandem however final draft made clear that even though they are similar in relative size only pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet thumb a diagram illustrating moon s co orbit with earth however some have suggested that moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet in 1975 isaac asimov noted that timing of moon s orbit is in tandem with earth s own orbit around sun looking down on ecliptic moon never actually loops back on itself and in essence it orbits sun in its own right asimov isaac 1975 just mooning around in of time and space and other things avon also many moons even those that do not orbit sun directly often exhibit features in common with true planets there are 19 moons in solar system that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and would be considered planets if only physical parameters are considered both jupiter s moon ganymede and saturn s moon titan are larger than mercury and titan even has a substantial atmosphere thicker than earth s moons such as io and triton demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity and ganymede has a magnetic field just as stars in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets indeed mike brown makes just such a claim in his dissection of issue saying it is hard to make a consistent argument that a 400 km should count as a planet because it might have interesting geology while a 5000 km satellite with a massive atmosphere methane lakes and dramatic storms titan shouldn t be put into same category whatever you call it however he goes on to say that for most people considering round satellites including our moon planets violates idea of what a planet is alan stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in definition of a planet and proposes term satellite planet for a planet sized satellite in 2017 stern k d runyon et al proposed a new geophysical definition of planet that defined a planet simply as an object large enough to be spherical under its own gravity but not large enough to fuse this definition would add 19 moons to list of planets in our solar system extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs discovery since 1992 of extrasolar planets or planet sized objects around other stars such planets in planetary systems including multiple planetary systems as of has widened debate on nature of planethood in unexpected ways many of these planets are of considerable size approaching mass of small stars while many newly discovered brown dwarfs are conversely small enough to be considered planets material difference between a low mass star and a large gas giant is not clear cut apart from size and relative temperature there is little to separate a gas giant like jupiter from its host star both have similar overall compositions hydrogen and helium with trace levels of heavier elements in their atmospheres generally accepted difference is one of formation stars are said to have formed from top down out of gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium while planets are said to have formed from bottom up from accretion of dust and gas in orbit around young star and thus should have cores of silicates or ices as yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores though juno mission to jupiter could resolve issue if it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does then it raises question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low mass star rather than a planet thumb left brown dwarf gliese in orbit around its star traditionally defining characteristic for has been an object s ability to fuse hydrogen in its core however stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction too small to commence sustained hydrogen fusion they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse deuterium however due to relative rarity of that isotope this process lasts only a tiny fraction of star s lifetime and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery binary stars and other multiple star formations are common and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars therefore since they do not produce energy through fusion they could be described as planets indeed astronomer adam burrows of university of arizona claims that from theoretical perspective however different their modes of formation extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially same burrows also claims that such stellar remnants as white dwarfs should not be considered stars croswell p 119 a stance which would mean that an orbiting white dwarf such as sirius b could be considered a planet however current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed capability to sustain atomic fusion during its lifetime should be considered a star confusion does not end with brown dwarfs maria rosa osorio et al have discovered many objects in young star clusters of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort currently calculated to be roughly 13 jupiter masses these have been described as free floating planets because current theories of solar system formation suggest that planets may be ejected from their star systems altogether if their orbits become unstable however it is also possible that these free floating planets could have formed in same manner as stars thumb solitary cha 110913 773444 middle a possible sub brown dwarf set to scale against sun left and planet jupiter right in 2003 a working group of iau released a position statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes a brown dwarf to date it remains only guidance offered by iau on this issue 2006 planet definition committee did not attempt to challenge it or to incorporate it into their definition claiming that issue of defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets left thumb upright chxr 73 b an object which lies at border between planet and brown dwarf this definition makes location rather than formation or composition determining characteristic for planethood a free floating object with a mass below 13 jupiter masses is a sub brown dwarf whereas such an object in orbit around a fusing star is a planet even if in all other respects two objects may be identical further in 2010 a paper published by burrows david s spiegel and john a milsom called into question 13 jupiter mass criterion showing that a brown dwarf of three times solar metallicity could fuse deuterium at as low as 11 jupiter masses also 13 jupiter mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on composition of object as of 2011 extrasolar planets encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 jupiter masses saying fact that there is no special feature around in observed mass spectrum reinforces choice to forget this mass limit as of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 jupiter massesexoplanets versus brown dwarfs corot view and future jean schneider 4 apr 2016 based on a study of mass density relationships exoplanet data explorer includes objects up to 24 jupiter masses with advisory 13 jupiter mass distinction by iau working group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores and observationally problematic due to sin i ambiguity nasa exoplanet archive includes objects with a mass or minimum mass equal to or less than 30 jupiter masses exoplanet criteria for inclusion in archive nasa exoplanet archive another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs rather than deuterium burning formation process or location is whether core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure one study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and not core accretion and therefore should not be thought of as

least massive sub brown dwarf yet discovered semantics finally from a purely linguistic point of view there is dichotomy that iau created between planet and dwarf planet term dwarf planet arguably contains two words a noun planet and an adjective dwarf thus term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet even though iau explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being by this formulation therefore dwarf planet and minor planet are best considered compound nouns benjamin zimmer of language log summarised confusion fact that iau would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from real planets lumps lexical item dwarf planet in with such oddities as welsh rabbit not really a rabbit and rocky mountain oysters not really oysters as dava sobel historian and popular science writer who participated in iau s initial decision in october 2006 noted in an interview with national public radio a dwarf planet is not a planet and in astronomy there are dwarf stars which are stars and dwarf galaxies which are galaxies so it s a term no one can love dwarf planet mike brown noted in an interview with smithsonian that most of people in dynamical camp really did not want word dwarf planet but that was forced through by pro pluto camp so you re left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets conversely astronomer robert cumming of stockholm observatory notes that name minor planet has been more or less synonymous with asteroid for a very long time so it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with introduction of dwarf planet see also geophysical planet definition iau definition of planet list of gravitationally rounded objects of solar system list of former planets natural kind planemo

we define an as one that has not been able to do so and then a few paragraphs later our solar system clearly contains 8 and a far larger number of unterplanets largest of which are pluto and ceres while this may appear to contradict stern s objections stern noted in an interview with smithsonian air and space that unlike iau s definition his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets i do think from a dynamical standpoint there are planets that really matter in architecture of solar system and those that don t they re both planets just as you can have wet and dry planets or life bearing and non life bearing planets you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets density of an object is a rough guide to its composition lower density higher fraction of ices and lower fraction of rock n denser objects vesta and juno are composed almost entirely of rock with very little ice and have a density close to moon s while less dense such as proteus and enceladus are composed mainly of ice references bibliography and external links what is a planet steven soter why planets will never be defined robert roy britt on outcome of iau s
