thumb nock volley gun henry nock 1741 1804 was a british inventor and engineer of napoleonic period best known as a gunsmith nock produced many innovative weapons including screwless lock and seven barrelled volley gun although he did not invent latter despite it commonly being known as nock gun he was a major supplier to military during napoleonic wars his high quality duelling pistols and double barrelled shotguns were much sought after and it is largely through nock that latter became weapon of choice for hunters as well as supplying military and civilian markets nock made expensive pieces for aristocracy and royalty and was an appointed gunmaker to king nock s business eventually became wilkinson sword a company which today makes razor blades and other shaving equipment and until 2005 made ceremonial officer s swords for british army guns nock produced many innovative weapons in 1793 he made a double barrelled pistol with a removable stock for royal horse artillery however this weapon was impractical with stock removed and was usually used as a carbine in 1797 nock put into production a 9 inch pistol pattern 1796 for heavy dragoons with a calibre matching their carbines some of these pistols had a novel lock designed by nock originally intended for an abandoned musket design requested by duke of richmond in 1786 while serving as master general of ordnance new lock could be dismantled by removable pins rather than previous more cumbersome and time consuming screws pattern 1796 had no butt plate and ramrod was stored in holster rather than attached to barrel this feature made it unpopular with users and many guns were modified to take a conventional swivel ramrod kinard and tucker page pages 29 30 name of nock is perhaps best known today for multi barrelled nock gun due to it being featured in several films these include uses of this volley gun by characters patrick harper in sharpe harper s nock volley gun sharpe appreciation society accessed

page 1 despite its portrayal in film this weapon was not very practical as a hand weapon due its very severe recoil often causing injuries and time needed to reload seven barrels it was necessary to abandon rifling of early prototypes and reduce charge to keep this problem manageable wainright page 2 intended as a naval weapon fired from rigging to repel boarders on deck it was retired by royal navy in 1804 nock also produced some experimental rotating multi barrelled guns to fire one barrel at a time wainright page 3 in his own day nock was most well known for his double barrelled shotguns he was not first to make weapons in such a format but their high quality and nock s many innovations led to shotguns becoming highly popular as a hunting gun especially after nock became gun maker to king sawyer pages 206 207 nock was also well known for his duelling pistols sawyer page 193 nock made weapons covering whole field from pistols to muskets great variety is perhaps illustrated by his coach blunderbuss which like naval pistols had a more corrosion resistant brass barrel such weapons were intended to be used at short range and did not take a large enough charge to require iron barrels wainright page 8 nock continued to innovate until his death late in life he was making breech loading muskets wainright page 9 career nock started out as a locksmith but he took out a patent for a gun lock in 1775 nock jover and green lock for firearms gb patent 1095 1775 nock was not yet enrolled in worshipful company of gunmakers and could not trade under his own name he formed nock jover co with william jover a master of gunmakers company and patent bore jover s name as well as nock s along with one john green war with american colonies provided a strong market for nock s products wainright page 1 james wilson came to nock in 1779 to make prototypes for his volley gun design nock won subsequent competitive bid for production of gun weapon is consequently commonly referred to as nock gun nock also produced some volley guns and volley pistols for civilian market but in very small numbers this included a set of these weapons for royal household which is still in queen s collection today wainright pages 1 3 this set is not standard production it has for instance silver mounts by mark bock a london silversmith following conclusion of american revolutionary war there was a fall in demand for military small arms in this period nock turned to civilian market but also had profitable orders for locks for light to medium calibre 3 12 pounder naval guns wainright page 2 in 1784 nock finally became a freeman of gunmakers company a few years later french revolution and subsequent napoleonic wars ensured that nock was not short of government business duke of richmond preferred nock over his competitors for his innovations particularly screwless lock nock began delivering muskets in 1792 but orders for regular army dried up because nock s non standard design took too long to make and used a different calibre ammunition thereafter nock concentrated on supplying muskets to local militia preparing for an expected invasion wainright page 5 in 1804 government placed a contract with nock to replace all nock locks on their stock of duke of richmond pattern muskets with standard ones although nock locks were recognised as being superior need for standardisation took precedence wainright page 8 in 1789 nock was appointed gunmaker in ordinary to king george iii largely as a result of his patented breech for hunting guns and other inventions in 1802 nock became master of gunmakers company wainright page 8 he died at sutton in december 1804 aged 63 legacy nock s will was generous to his employees and specified that his business was to be continued for six months for their benefit he also left as much as ps100 inflation adjusted ps to some employees wainwright p 11 a nephew of henry samuel nock was an apprentice under him samuel also proved to be inventive holding a patent himself samuel nock pan for locks of firearms gb patent 1816 samuel became gunmaker in ordinary in succession to george iii george iv william iv and victoria and in 1836 became a master of gunmakers company however henry nock s own business was continued by his foreman and son in law james wilkinson wilkinson became gunmaker in ordinary to king in 1805 contracts with east india company ensured success of business name became james wilkinson son around 1818 when james son henry joined henry died in 1864 but company continued making firearms and bladed weapons and became known as wilkinson sword a series of new laws in uk starting with pistols act 1903 restricted sale of firearms to public malcolm page 136 that pushed company into changing direction and it henceforth concentrated on razor blades and other domestic products it continued to produce swords for british army and for royal ceremonial purposes until 2005 when sword
