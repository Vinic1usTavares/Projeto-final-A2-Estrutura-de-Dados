worked on star trek original series including episode journey to babel lonely among us was subsequently compared to journey to babel which fontana denied saying i wrote journey to babel and i wrote this too and i feel there is a difference there s a definite delineation and separation here both in intent and content gross altman 1993 p 159 director cliff bole did not recall much of episode later but did not think much of script saying subject matter affects end product there s some better written shows obviously it was first episode of next generation to be directed by bole who had previously worked on shows such as v and six million dollar man colm meaney made his second appearance in next generation after he originally appeared in pilot encounter at farpoint as a conn ensign on bridge in this episode he played a security ensign as it was not until season two that he began to play recurring character of miles o brien who would later become a series regular on star trek deep space nine another deep space nine actor who made his first trek appearance in this episode was marc alaimo who played an antican who was unnamed on screen but referred to in script as badar n d d alaimo went on

and costuming selay and anticans were nicknamed snakes and dogs by production staff westmore nazzaro 1993 p 58 designs were created by andrew probert reeves stevens 1998 p 54 who had previously been responsible for design of enterprise d makeup used on them were created by supervisor michael westmore which involved full headpieces and hands for two anticans and five selays because of limited space available anticans were made internally in paramount makeup studio while selays were outsourced to a different studio to sculpt head once completed a mold was made of selay head and unpainted pieces were cast in latex and sent to westmore to complete it was intended to cast them out of lightweight polyurethane but first batch of selay heads came out very heavy westmore had time to re cast two of heads from soft foam rubber but as each took five hours to make there was not enough time to re make all five heavier versions of selay heads were worn by actors in background of scenes although westmore described them as being very uncomfortable antican mask didn t allow for any movement at all with exception of actors being able to poke their tongues through mouth opening although this is only major appearance of either anticans or selay they continued to be used as background extras in other episodes of next generation and deep space nine westmore repainted selay masks prior to reusing them in order to give scales more of a three dimensional look this was first appearance of next generation era starfleet dress uniforms they were based on those used by royal navy in 18th century but would be slightly altered when they re appeared during season two one piece of a costume introduced in this episode which never returned was surgical cap and eyepiece worn by doctor crusher reception and home media release thumb right upright brent spiner received both positive and negative reviews for his sherlock holmes impression whilst portraying data in this episode lonely

previous week s where no one has gone before which received a rating of 10 5 following broadcast producers received a significant amount of mail from fans criticising apparent cannibalism on part of anticans in this episode several reviewers rewatched episode following end of series keith decandido reviewed lonely among us for tor com in may 2011 he gave it a score of three out of ten and was uninterested in episode finding alien delegation subplot to be mostly just silly and majority of episode was a weak beer mystery that s mostly an excuse for gates mcfadden and sir patrick stewart to act weird and for brent spiner to be a silly sherlock james hunt thought that spiner s sherlock impression was completely brilliant in his review for website den of geek in october 2012 he thought that episode shared some similarities with third season of original series saying by which i mean it looks cheap and appears to have been written by a child in yellow crayon cast member wil wheaton rewatched episode for aol tv in november 2006 he criticised writing of fontana in this episode saying that around this time she appeared on a panel at a convention about how to solve wesley problem but when rewatching episode he thought that maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me d c fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve wesley problem herself i don t know maybe she tried to do that and didn t get a lot of support from rest of producers and writing staff but even i know of dr channing s theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction and then blaming actor who is forced to deliver it overall he criticised very stiff dialogue throughout episode and called set up incredibly forced he did highlight that data acting out as sherlock holmes laid foundation of future episodes which would expand on this zack handlen reviewed episode for a v club in april 2010 he too thought that alien delegation subplot was poorly executed in a comedic fashion and said that this combined with slow pace and a number of dialog scenes that can be charitably described as character development or more accurately as padding this is an unmemorable episode that shows a series still unsure of its greatest strengths he gave episode a grade of c first home media release of lonely among us was on vhs cassette appearing on april 1 1992
