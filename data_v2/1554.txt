reluctant to be a hired gun citing band s refusal to record any of nine songs he submitted for their then upcoming album manson clarified there was talk early on about collaborating with different guitar players on record that was before twiggy and i got back together because once twiggy was back there was nobody else and i don t care what you have to offer this was our record manson and twiggy announced at 2008 scream awards in october that album was pretty much done and indicated it would sound more like antichrist superstar than band s recent material manson later described record as featuring lots of guitar solos and brutal reckless screaming and as being very ruthless heavy and violent album was co produced by manson twiggy and vrenna along with antichrist superstar and mechanical animals co producer sean beavan manson recorded his vocals at his hollywood hills home studio between november 2008 and his january 5 2009 birthday he described album as containing extreme autobiographical content relating to dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist dita von teese and his later relationship with then 19 year old actress evan rachel wood explaining some of things i say here it s sad to say them they re relationship destroying statements some of it is stuff i should have said to my ex wife some are things i ve never said to world manson used his home as a canvas to document disintegration of his relationship with wood writing album s lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings as well as used condoms bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia much of album s artwork was shot there music and lyrical themes songs on high end of low appear on album in order in which they were written album contains material which spans across a wide variety of genres such as industrial metal glam rock garage rock blues country and synthpop its first track devour is a mid tempo rock song which begins with an acoustic guitar with heavy drums and distorted screamed vocals becoming more prominent as it progresses it was written in response to shakespearean ideal of romance presented on eat me drink me lana cooper of popmatters said song runs an emotional gauntlet and could very well be most depressing break up song of all time lonely of guitar strings being tuned give way to manson s soul wrenching eruption of and i ll love you if you ll let me but he turns on a dime and a few lines later is vowing revenge spitting i will blow your heart to pieces metal hammer later included it on their list of 10 most underrated marilyn manson songs this is followed by pretty as a swastika a mosh pit ready heavy metal song manson described it as one of his proudest moments lyrically according to manson its title was something i said to a girl because of her complexion with black hair red lips and pale skin i mean it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse so i felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive at insistence of interscope records song was re titled on album s back cover manson was critical of this censorship saying rather than take it off album i decided to produce it on sleeve with a different name so it ll be sold in walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics so i put pretty as a because all of their motivations are based on money leave a scar was written by manson about and for evan on day we broke up maybe some of things i say in song are cruel but it is how i felt at time four rusted horses is a blues inspired rock song and was compared to work of doors and johnny cash manson described its lyric as being almost a nursery rhyme everyone thinks that i was singing about apocalypse but it s more just about four of us my band that managed to survive through all of this and where do we go from here arma goddamn motherfuckin geddon is an uptempo rock song which was described by quietus as classic manson caren gibson of metal hammer claimed that song was reminiscent of chain reaction by diana ross as well as work of depeche mode blank and white deals with censorship specifically reaction to time magazine s cover story is god dead which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs lyric god is dead but god is still white so shoot up mall school or president of whatever or whoever wants a fight was censored by interscope on all editions of album manson has said that this made him happy artistically as song is about censorship and they censored it running to edge of world is a david bowie inspired ballad which features manson singing in falsetto notes during its middle 8 i want to kill you like they do in movies is a primarily bass driven rock song at over 9 minutes it is longest song on album its lyrics document disintegration of manson s relationship with wood and his fantasies of smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer it was one of first tracks band recorded for high end of low and was originally 25 minutes long reluctant to release a double album they re recorded a shorter version following completion of album s final song 15 with manson asking band how many minutes do i have left on this cd and it was 9 minutes i said roll it i m going to sing it what appears on record is one unedited performance wow is an industrial dance song and manson has described it as a turning point for album explaining first half of record is kind of bitter and angry but there s a confidence that starts to rebuild itself at wow i wanted to do a song that represented who i am and why i started doing this in first place manson plays a one stringed guitar on song which also features sound of him snorting lines of something whatever it might have been as a percussion instrument in a review of leaked demo which was originally titled wow james gill of metal hammer described it as genuinely filthy and intensely sexy it doesn t have anything in way of memorable hooks but it s sort of track that would sound amazing in a goth strip club if one existed wight spider is one of heaviest songs on album and has been compared to work of mastodon metal hammer also said of track whether conscious or not what band learned from trent reznor is back track builds and builds without changing direction unkillable monster is a down tempo rock song which alternates between a quiet verse and loud chorus structure and features layered distorted vocals and guitars we re from america is most overtly political song on album referencing various aspects of neoconservatism in its lyrics such as pro war and anti abortion rhetoric i have to look up just to see hell was described by quietus as a maggot infested ride into trough of melancholy penultimate track into fire portrays vocalists mental state on christmas wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to contact wood 158 times and cut himself on hands or face with a razorblade for each corresponding attempt it was original album closer with manson describing it as a glorious epic that i think will make twiggy forever recognized as a guitar hero album s final song 15 was completed on manson s january 5 birthday he called it most important song that s been written by marilyn manson as an entity it s most unusual song i have ever heard i thought that album was done but what was happening in my life had not resolved itself so on january 5 one five i sang 15 and lyrics tell story of that day release and promotion title of album was revealed through smoking section of rolling stone magazine on february 2 2009 where it was also announced that

i m not talking about me i sat back and watched him be jealous of kurt cobain and billy corgan and a lot of other musicians in past i just don t find time to do that i stopped thinking about him a

themes rolling stone reviewer jody rosen gave album a mediocre review citing its diminished shock value when compared to band s previous material rosen considered ballads to be album s best songs as they illustrated a more endearing depiction of manson as a melancholic human rather than antichrist superstar phil freeman of allmusic criticized lack of variety on album he also criticized its lyrics

a one star review guardian called album unconvincing and criticized it for a lack of experimentation whilst entertainment ie writer lauren murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and completely misplaced summarizing if he d stuck to what he was good at ear piercing yelps liberal dashes of real controversy and big brawny metal songs with tough beats he may have had a comeback on his hands conversely mayer nissim from digital spy commended album for its diversity but was critical of its length and ill advised attempts at stadium anthems he awarded album three stars out of
