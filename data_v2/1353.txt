systems at a 60deg angle an flow that led to storm relative helicity values in excess of 500 m2s 2 indicative of extreme wind shear and a very high potential for rotating updrafts within supercells ample moisture from gulf of mexico was brought north across deep south leading to daytime high temperatures of and dewpoints of furthermore convective available potential energy cape values reached 2
