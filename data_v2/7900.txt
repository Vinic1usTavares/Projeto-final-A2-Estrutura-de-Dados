session was stopped early on when carbone entered start finish line straight too fast glanced a barrier at exit of reservoir bend corner and was stranded in centre of track almost immediately after restart a second red flag was prompted by a multi car collision between clarke salaquarda and moreau at police bend turn and a third was triggered by kimball whose spin at same corner made track impassable last stoppage came when de oliviera crashed into an wall kubica held pole position early on until duval took it with a new unofficial lap record of 2 minutes and 11 348 seconds with eleven minutes left and maintained it until end of qualifying a lack of a slipstream on main straight hindered di grassi who took second with a last minute lap kubica bettered his lap but fell to third and

started under dry and sunny weather conditions at 13 40 macau standard time utc 08 00 on 19 november on a pre race reconnaissance lap bamba came into reservoir bend corner too fast and ran into rear of cheong s car which had come to a stop in its grid slot both cars sustained damage to their suspensions and could not start race furthermore cheong s vehicle was pushed forwards into an unnamed female and injured her duval made a poor start while kubica was faster off line to take lead on run to mandarin oriental bend corner however duval reclaimed first from kubica going into lisboa turn as latter could not withstand his overtake and instead focused himself on avoiding risks and preserve his car for sunday s race di grassi out dragged teammate conway approaching reservoir turn and attempted a pass on kubica around outside but he backed out of manoeuvre carbone made worst start in field falling from ninth to nineteenth by end of first lap while watts gained five places entering lisboa corner to run in eighth duval pulled away from kubica and held a two second advantage at end of lap two as conway and di grassi battled over third place and montin duelled de oliviera for fifth position that lap senna stopped at teddy yip bend turn with an engine failure and red and striped flags were shown at that part of track because of possibility that oil had been laid there elsewhere down order vettel got past moreau and began to close up to watts as trio of kimball yokomizo and bakkerud duelled each other carbone lost control of his car at san francisco bend corner but avoided a collision with an barrier alongside track vettel moved ahead of watts and into eighth but kept position for a few seconds as watts retook it approaching conclusion of lap four di grassi made an error that lost him momentum conway challenged di grassi but latter remained in third bakkerud overtook yokomizo and then kimball at reservoir bend corner but kimball retook position entering straight linking mandarin oriental bend and lisboa turns while most cars were fairly spread out upfront it was not a major issue to get through traffic but cheong heavily delayed kubica at melco hairpin who had a poor handling car due to one of his wheels buckled from accident with bamba kubica waited until he was on a wider part of track before he lapped cheong in race s final laps more overtakes occurred as montin was passed by de oliviera while vettel overtook watts as kimball and bakkerud traded tenth twice watts blocked a pass from kimball at lisboa corner as moreau overtook bakkerud kimball then moved ahead of watts at lisboa turn on next lap cheong retired in lisboa turn escape road on final lap kubica closed up to duval but chose not to take risks and duval slowed slightly to win qualification race and pole position for grand prix itself by 1 577 seconds di grassi was third conway fourth and montin fifth de oliviera nakajima vettel kimball and watts completed top ten final classified finishers were bakkerud moreau clarke yokomizo perera grosjean reindler kane carbone ikeda jelley hirate salaquarda avila ho merszei and lei warm up two after qualifying race but before second warm up bamba was summoned to stewards office to explain incident with cheong stewards decided to bar bamba from main race on sunday for causing an avoidable collision second twenty minute warm up session took place on morning of main race di grassi continued his strong pace and was quickest with a lap of 2 minutes and 11 953 seconds duval was 0 973 seconds slower in second perera conway yokomizo vettel watts senna ikeda and grosjean made up positions three through ten midway through session moreau crashed heavily at reservoir bend corner but his team rebuilt his car before race main race race was delayed from its 15 45 start time on 20 november due to multiple incidents in asian formula renault challenge race and 2005 guia race of macau when it did begin under dry and sunny weather conditions duval moved slightly before five red lights extinguished he stopped on front of line marking his grid slot once he realised his error this did not stop duval from making a brisk start as kubica made an equally fast getaway kubica drew alongside duval on approach to lisboa corner but did not get through as field passed without incident further down order watts relinquished positions and vettel overtook montin for fourth conway ran into rear of montin and sustained a slow tyre puncture in meantime duval opened up a 2 2 second advantage upfront by end of first lap lap after stewards announced that duval had been adjudged to have jumped start as he continued to increase his advantage by one second per lap in order to strategically minimise his loss of position on lap two di grassi turned left onto outside line going into lisboa corner and overtook kubica for second behind them senna and hirate retired after two made contact at melco hairpin and temporarily blocked track thumb lucas di grassi pictured in 2010 took lead from kubica on penultimate lap and became first brazilian driver to win macau grand prix since mauricio gugelmin in 1985 conway slowed on his way to pit lane to have his punctured tyre replaced and he rejoined down order perera advanced through field and challenged bakkerud for tenth but latter held place kimball was fending off faster de oliviera while kubica attempted to pass di grassi but latter blocked all his manoeuvres two drivers retired during fourth and fifth laps salaquarda entered pit lane with an unknown problem and yokomizo missed braking point for lisboa corner and crashed into an wall just as officials were about to disqualify duval by waving black flag he entered pit lane at start of lap six and his hope of becoming fourth frenchman in a row to win at macau were over duval emerged in centre of a pack of cars led by watts in tenth and di grassi now led with kubica second as clarke passed kimball for seventh jelley lacked most of his front wing because he ran into back of reindler s vehicle and delayed a small pack of cars on eighth lap kubica attempted to overtake di grassi around outside but he lost control of his car and narrowly avoided taking himself out of contention further round lap kubica gently nudged di grassi at melco hairpin and fell back to give himself more space before a second try overtakes occurred further down field duval passed watts and began to draw closer to kimball after watts chose not to duel duval jelley s car gave way coming into reservoir bend corner and went into an barrier which he slid against before stopping since jelley was in a section of track that was not hazardous to others race was not interrupted and traffic jam dispersed as leaders went into mandarin bend to start lap ten a slower car impeded di grassi and kubica tucked into his slipstream kubica steered to outside of di grassi on run to lisboa turn for lead kubica immediately began to pull away as de oliviera gained fourth from montin and duval overtook kimball and clarke to advance into sixth clarke tried to follow duval through next sequence of turns but he braked too late and ran into an barrier at faraway hill corner kimball incorrectly guessed direction clarke was going and two made contact watts collected them and he then slid into an wall and stopped several yards down track since cars were adjudged to be in a dangerous position and rescue workers were needed at faraway hill turn safety car was dispatched and kubica s lead of 1 612 seconds was reduced to nothing and he lost his opportunity of taking a comfortable win under safety car cheong drove into pit lane to retire for unknown reasons while carbone made a pit stop but lost no time to leaders safety car was withdrawn at start of lap 14 and racing resumed di grassi noted an opportunity to overtake leader kubica going into mandarin bend corner and did so that lap kane spun and he could not restart his car because of an overheating engine on his second appearance in macau it was di grassi s victory achieving first win for a brazilian driver in macau since mauricio gugelmin triumphed in 1985 edition despite putting di grassi under extensive pressure kubica could not get back at him and was 0 659 seconds behind in second with vettel completing podium as highest placed rookie in third off podium de oliviera took fourth nakajima came fifth and duval sixth bakkerud took seventh from montin at line and grosjean and perera rounded out top ten moreau carbone reindler and conway filled positions
