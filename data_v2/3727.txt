thumb late model c 1998 ls3 5a from spendor one of bbc licencees ls3 5a each element pronounced separately without stroke is a small studio monitor loudspeaker originated by bbc for use by outside broadcast vans to ensure quality of their broadcasts speaker concept set out transparent and natural sound as goal and achievement of end result is widely acknowledged bbc granted licences to a small number of british firms who first manufactured product in 1975 product underwent a change in 1987 due to consistency issues in manufacturing and again in around 2003 when original parts from kef ran out upwards of 60 000 pairs of speaker have been sold reviewers have recognised its enormous importance as a bookshelf design history ls3 5a is a commercially produced loudspeaker driven by need of bbc to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality it was derived from ls3 5 which was conceived and developed by bbc engineering department in early 1970s when it was under stewardship of dudley harwood having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality bbc specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces as bbc broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of monitor it was found that supplier had modified drive units meaning ls3 5 design had to be fundamentally revised bbc s designs department was called upon to adapt product in light of supply changes modifications were made to adapt to new drive units and deal with altered resonance pattern and ls3 5 became ls3 5a bbc then licensed product to a small number of private sector companies production began in 1975 in 1987 as a result of reassessment of product due to consistency issues in manufacture of mid bass driver drivers were modified and crossover changed overall impedance of crossover fell to 11 ohms from original 15 ohms various official versions of ls3 5a from various licencees sold in significant numbers in its life of over a quarter of a century sales estimates range from 60 000 to 100 000 pairs in tail end of 1990s due to parts being discontinued 3 5 had technically reached end of road some licencees continued to make small numbers of speakers for a while using re manufactured parts however stirling broadcast one of last batch of licencees completely redesigned product based on audio signature of original and launched ls3 5a v2 with full endorsement of broadcaster in early 2006 in 2014 production of 15 ohm version of ls3 5a with a full bbc licence was re commenced by falcon acoustics 25 using re engineered versions of original drive units and original design bbc crossover 4 all produced in house speaker name product name is derived from bbc naming convention ls3 designation meant it was a loudspeaker intended for outside broadcasting as opposed to ls5 loudspeaker intended for studio monitoring number after stroke is model number ls3 5 is number 5 outside broadcasting loudspeaker letter that follows denotes alterations to original specification of which there was only one in this instance after ls3 5 thus a design thumb speaker with its characteristic diffraction absorbing foam surround for its outside broadcasting monitoring bbc required a small studio monitor suitable for near field monitoring of frequency range from 400 hz to about 20 khz principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory such as in mobile broadcasting vans there were no commercial constraints bbc research department then situated at kingswood warren were responsible for development work and commenced scaling tests in 1968 they were able to answer a request for a prototype in under a week because it resembled an experimental loudspeaker that department had already developed for some preliminary acoustic scaling tests speaker had to be voiced by ear an octave at a time because scale test results were inapplicable to a model of this size engineers took measurements comparisons were performed against ls5 8 a large grade i monitor already in use at time and with live sources in 1970 engineers came up with ls3 5 built using kef b110 a6362 and kef t27 a6340 drive units and a 9 ohm crossover filter estimated development costs of order of ps100 000 were said to have been incurred at time approximately 20 units of ls3 5 were produced in house bbc had initiated tendering to have ls3 5 made under licence as broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of monitor it was found that kef had discontinued b110 a6362 and t27 a6340 in favour of b110 sp1003 and t27 sp1032 specification and was already using them in coda one of their own brand commercial loudspeakers thus design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns 2 4 tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect dome tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by edge of cabinet crossover also had to undergo change and ls3 5 became ls3 5a in early summer of 1974 kef b110 sp1003 is a speaker with a doped bextrene a proprietary type of polystyrene cone and a neoprene surround kef t27 sp1032 has a 19mm mylar dome fitted and is with a perforated protection grille loudspeaker has an internal volume of approximately 5 litres speaker cabinet loudspeaker enclosure measuring is made using birch plywood strengthened at every joint with beech braces and heavily damped although there was no specification for wood of original ls3 5 cabinets bbc closely specified wood types in defining ls3 5a due to concerns that other hard woods specifically parana pine with which bbc conducted tests would cause noticeable colouration i e detract from sonic neutrality due to interaction with a resonance of bass drivers martin colloms notes in hi fi critic that hardly any component in either enclosure or driver may be substituted without blend suffering audible disturbance this is because 3 5a sets such a high standard for tonal balance that errors which would pass unnoticed in an ordinary speaker are readily exposed bbc then licensed product to a small number of private sector companies in a review in stereophile john atkinson remarked on how it was virtually unknown for a speaker to be still available virtually unchanged 14 years after its introduction construction j gordon holt indicates in stereophile that most of cost lay inside case having been spent on a complex equaliser and phase corrected crossover however holt s colleague john atkinson notes that cabinet alone costs manufacturer same as retail price of a typical speaker only specific speaker drivers manufactured to strict tolerances may be used there were other measures to control diffraction and ensure tonal neutrality circuitry provides equalisation in both high and low frequency sections 13 element crossover includes an inductor for treble section with seven positions that allows adjustment to match level of mid to treble sensitivities design also specifies high quality screened air gap inductors and film capacitors david in hi fi answers suggests it was a costlier speaker to build than imagined because tight specifications meant a high failure rate in production bbc had specified finest most expensive ingredients and representing an investment of hours of skilled labour signature sound typical of sealed box speakers of similar size 3 5a has little or no low bass but design reinforced its lower register by a boost at around 160 hz giving subjective impression that speaker is more bass rich it has a gently rising frequency response above leading reviewers to notice sound being a little bright at treble registers or that speakers reproduce high end roughness of solid state amplifiers mercilessly thus suggested partnering with valve amplification would be advantageous a slight nasal quality in midrange has also been noted in earlier versions accuracy and stability of its stereo imaging and its clean midrange reproduction are also appreciated qualities j gordon holt suggests that quality was comparable to that from quad electrostatics at far lower cost and with added bonuses of slightly smoother high end better stereo imaging a broader listening area john atkinson suggests in stereophile that ls3 5a is ideally suited to reproduction of program having a limited dynamic range requirement for example chamber music he said that ls3 5a has never and never will it s just too polite ever to cut mustard on rock or even jazz constructors thumb versions of speaker mostly from rogers of various vintages on display in a second hand total of 11 companies were ever granted licences by bbc to manufacture model a maximum of 3 at any given time product proved highly challenging to manufacture if for no other reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history audible differences could result from mounting screws grille fabric or origin of wool rogers audio was earliest but went out of business before producing a single unit rogers name was bought by who started manufacturing 3 5a under licence in 1975 rogers production accounted for majority of around 43 000 pairs by 1988 and 50 000 pairs in total of other main manufacturers spendor produced about 22 000 pairs and 10 000 dudley harwood bbc engineer instrumental in creation of 3 5a started harbeth and obtained a licence in 1977 but company produced no ls3 5as for a decade eventually harbeth accounted for 7 000 pairs kef who obtained its licence in 1993 claims approximately 4 000 pairs made other licencees included chartwell ram goodmans and stirling broadcast a current licence for 15 ohm ls3 5a is held by falcon acoustics reception despite not being a commercial product at outset ls3 5a was commercially successful in its twenty something year life from 1975 until approximately 2000 when availability of kef drive units came to an end speaker has amassed an enthusiastic focused and loyal following and none so large or vocal according to paul seydor in absolute sound estimates of their sales differ possibly due to scope and cut off when it ceased production in 1998 some 100 000 pairs were in circulation with 3000 pairs sold in its last year alone according to seydor in 2001 ken kessler similarly estimated in hi fi news that 100 000 pairs had been produced in 2007 martin colloms reported more than 60 000 pairs of original ls3 5as were made john atkinson noted that it had sold in excess of 60 000 up to 1988 of which rogers represented two thirds atkinson notes in 2007 that sound of speaker had not dated whilst many other speakers of 1960s and 70s had he guessed that ls3 5a remained competitive due to exhaustive considerations and top engineering talent that went into its design maybe some luck was involved art dudley commented in stereophile on ls3 5a s towering significance as a bookshelf design product revisions 1987 1990 it had become apparent in around 1987 that a number of units already in field were not up to specification in particular it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain kef drivers of acceptable tolerances particular woofer measurements of 1 1 5 khz peak of some units produced at time were up to higher kef underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive unit and associated crossover taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances kef specially redesigned b110 creating b110 where surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound kef also designed a new crossover designated crossover also redesigned to accommodate changes saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from original 15 ohms kef also manufactured and supplied crossover with drive units in kits where pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance martin colloms had implied in hi fi news in august 1988 that bbc had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise design to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained in 1990 bbc authorised licencees to manufacture models capable of being bi wired but stipulated that performance in single wired mode must meet original specification kef started making bi wire crossover designated available in 1991 2005 birth of ls3 5a v2 upon obtaining a bbc licence to produce legacy 11 ohm ls3 5a stirling broadcast commissioned kef to produce new t27 and b110 drive units stirling had to rethink product when kef finally ceased manufacturing drive units in about 2000 working with drivers from seas and scanspeak derek hughes developed for stirling a new crossover that enabled new proprietary drivers to mimic response of original kef drivers they replaced specifically t27 was replaced by a 19mm doped fabric dome tweeter mid bass unit is a formed polypropylene co polymer cone to which a damping coating has been applied and given a synthetic rubber roll surround crossover has three settings of relative high frequency level in steps of 0 each crossover is tuned to specific pairs of drive units while stirling s revision deviates technically from specification company took steps to research and test to ensure ls3 5a sound was preserved warts and all stirling added a v2 to designation when product was launched in 2005 in an act of transparency even though broadcaster has endorsed it 2014 15 ohm ls3 5a back in production falcon acoustics was granted a licence by bbc for 15 ohm version of ls3 5a in 2013 and commenced production in 2014 using drive units produced in house by falcon acoustics falcon f b110 bass unit is a re engineered version using same components of original kef b110 sp1003 with a doped bextrene cone and a neoprene surround falcon f t27 tweeter again uses same components as original kef t27 sp1032 and has a 19mm mylar dome fitted both falcon units were designed by malcolm jones who while employed at kef between 1962 and 1974 was responsible for design of kef b110 and t27 units originally used in ls3 5 and ls3 5a both units are graded

colloms j r loudspeakers jim rogers who set up j r loudspeakers ltd after collapse of rogers audio released jr149 in 1977 using same drive units as ls3 5a in a cylindrical aluminium cabinet a review of jr149 in may 1977 hi fi news and record review found that general quality was very comparable to ls3 5a shun mook audio in 1989 bill ying dr yu wah tan and andrew chow were set out to make a
