edition and can detect different types of mining related features underground such as sloping tunnels dwarven ability to detect a sloping passage underground is also taken directly from anderson s

and ultimately humanity as opposed to many other creatures who serve as a type of monstrous other dwarves usually worship moradin whom they believe is their creator according to their legends moradin fashioned dwarves into a likeness of himself using gems and metal he then breathed life into them in many campaign settings dwarven pantheon of gods consists of leader moradin as well as and other dwarven gods may be present in different campaign settings dwarves get along well with gnomes who are often regarded as close cousins of dwarven race dwarves are accepting of humans half elves and halflings dwarves often do not get to know humans well as they live longer than average human and prefer to become friendly with human s family in general dwarves do not trust half orcs and fail to
