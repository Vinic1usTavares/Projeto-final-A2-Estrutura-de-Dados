jaco moustique magazine 19 august 2014 in french it premiered at 68th cannes film festival on 17 may 2015 to critical acclaim themes van dormael s films while few have strong common themes between them they make distinctive use of naive voiceover and examine world from an innocent perspective young thomas in toto le heros mentally handicapped protagonist of le huitieme jour and unborn child of mr nobody these characters views are often colorful imaginative and somewhat removed from reality with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations his films also typically end with a death which is portrayed not as a tragedy but as a happy moving on where deceased looks down happily at world below between heaven and earth ends with a birth but it is similarly handled passing of a character into a new world this pattern is continued in mr nobody where two deaths open film and a unique twist on death at end of film conveys a wistful sense of happiness van dormael makes prominent use of nostalgic standards music as well featuring boum by charles in toto le heros and mexico by luis mariano in le huitieme jour as recurring themes mr nobody used mr sandman as its recurring musical theme all of van dormael s films contain surreal elements in his first two films these moments were few like dancing flowers in toto le heros or georges flying around room in le huitieme jour mr nobody makes much more extensive use of surreal imagery throughout film both toto le heros and le huitieme jour prominently featured characters with down syndrome and portrayed
