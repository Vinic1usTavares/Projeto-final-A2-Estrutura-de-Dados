una class submarine also known as type 911 was a class of six midget submarines built for yugoslav navy at brodogradiliste specijalnih objekata english special objects shipyard during 1980s they were designed with purpose of laying small minefields and transporting naval special forces with or without their submersibles in shallow waters that were inaccessible for larger submarines due to their mission profile that called for a small design as well as need to stay undetected they lacked torpedo armament and a generator for battery recharging during croatian war of independence and dissolution of sfr yugoslavia five of six boats were relocated to boka kotorska where they served with sr yugoslav navy one soca p 914 was captured in drydock by croatian forces it was later modified and entered service with croatian navy as all of boats have since been decommissioned development during 1970s institute bi from zagreb started working on a new class of submarines for yugoslav navy jrm project designated b 91 and led by lieutenant colonel was tasked with developing a class of midget submarines capable of operating in shallow waters of northern adriatic using their small dimensions submarines were to be able to maneuver in depths as shallow as such abilities were needed to conduct offensive minelaying near enemy coastline reconnaissance and transporting naval special forces in hostile waters all six boats were completed from 1985 to 1989 at brodogradiliste specijalnih objekata bso in split sr croatia and named after rivers in sfr yugoslavia tisa p 911 una p 912

breakup of yugoslavia happened before anything was realized description thumb right 200px interior of zeta p 913 after renovation una class featured a single hulled design measuring in length with an average draught of boats displaced when surfaced and when submerged because deploying naval commandos was one of their main tasks they were equipped with an underwater exit re entry chamber propulsion consisted of two electric motors mounted on a single shaft and powered by two battery groups with 128 cells each class lacked ability to recharge during surface drive making them dependent on external power sources such as harbours and depot ships maximum achievable speed was underwater and surfaced traveling at a speed of they had a range of maximum diving depth was sensor suite included an active passive krupp atlas sonar in accordance with their expected mission boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 6 12 m 66 or m 71 limpet mines also at their disposal were four large aim 70 71 bottom mines mounted on outside of submarines four r 1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of aim 70 71 mines with a full crew of six members boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if complement numbered ten personnel four crew members and six naval commandos boats name pennant number namesake builder completed decommissioned p specijalnih

captured soca in drydock at bso where it was undergoing an overhaul soca underwent a modification program that improved its autonomy by installing a diesel generator it was recommissioned now with croatian navy in 1996 as and remained in service until early 2000s when it was declared redundant remaining boats entered service with new sr yugoslav navy first ones to be decommissioned sometime between 1997 and 2001 were tisa and una in 2003 a decision was made that ongoing major overhaul of kupa would stop boat was decommissioned and broken up in 2008 it appears that last una class boats in service with sr yugoslav navy were zeta and vardar both of them being decommissioned in 2005 aftermath ownership of decommissioned boats passed on to montenegro after country declared independence in 2006 ending state of serbia and montenegro and its joint armed forces in 2009 ministry of defence announced that it is willing to donate three una class submarines to former sfr yugoslav republics of slovenia croatia and serbia although submariner society from pula was interested in accepting donation and exhibiting it in a museum croatian mod responded with a statement that accepting donation is against national interests since most of fleet of former yugoslav navy was relocated to montenegro at beginning of croatian war of independence croatia claims military equipment of former joint armed forces was stolen and should be a subject of succession mod further explains that state interest is in compensation for that equipment not returning obsolete damaged and corroded equipment which nowadays serbia and montenegro are unsuccessfully trying to sell thumb right 250px una p 912 slovenia on other hand reacted positively to offer in 2011 zeta was loaded on a truck and transported by
