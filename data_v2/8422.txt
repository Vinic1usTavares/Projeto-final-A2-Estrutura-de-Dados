for other units with same regimental number see 52nd regiment of foot disambiguation 52nd oxfordshire regiment of foot was a light infantry regiment of british army throughout much of 18th and 19th centuries regiment first saw active service during american war of independence and were posted to india during anglo mysore wars during napoleonic wars 52nd were part of light division and were present at most of major battles of peninsula campaign becoming one of most celebrated regiments described by sir william napier as a regiment never surpassed in arms since arms were first borne by men napier p 279 they had largest british battalion at waterloo 1815 where they formed part of final charge against napoleon s imperial guard they were also involved in various campaigns in india regiment was raised as a line regiment in 1755 and numbered as 54th foot they were renumbered as 52nd regiment of foot in 1757 in 1781 regional designation 52nd oxfordshire regiment of foot was given and in 1803 regiment was designated light infantry in 1881 regiment was merged with 43rd monmouthshire regiment of foot to become regiment later known as oxfordshire and buckinghamshire light infantry regimental structure throughout period of 52nd s existence british army comprised both infantry and cavalry line regiments as well as household divisions regiments of line were numbered and from 1781 were given territorial designations oxfordshire in 52nd s case which roughly represented area from which troops were drawn this was not rigid and most english regiments had a significant proportion of irish and scots haythornthwaite 1987 p 6 regiments comprised at least one battalion often two as 52nd did intermittently and occasionally more commanded by a lieutenant colonel an infantry battalion was composed of ten companies of which eight were centre companies and two flank companies one a grenadier and one in regular line regiments a specialist light company companies were commanded by captains with lieutenants and ensigns or subalterns beneath him ideally a battalion comprised 1000 men excluding ncos musicians and officers 1st or senior battalion of a regiment would frequently draw fit recruits from 2nd battalion to maintain its strength if also sent on active service 2nd battalion would consequently be weaker in periods of long service battalions were generally operating under strength haythornthwaite 1987 p 7 seriously under strength battalions might be dissolved or temporarily drafted into other regiments as happened to 52nd on several occasions 52nd was initially a one battalion regiment but increased recruiting resulted in creation of a second battalion in 1798 while 1st battalion saw some action in spain and portugal in 1800 1801 2nd remained stationed in england in 1803 regiment s fittest officers and men were concentrated in 1st battalion for training as light infantry and 2nd battalion was transferred to 96th foot a new second battalion was raised in 1804 both battalions saw extensive action during napoleonic wars and they were brigaded together for a time during peninsula campaign but heavy losses at badajoz in 1812 resulted in reduction of 2nd battalion to a cadre skeleton staff 2nd was eventually reformed with new recruits and saw service in holland in 1813 14 following conclusion of war in 1814 both battalions were billeted in england where 2nd s effectives were transferred to 1st battalion in preparation for further service wilkinson latham roffe p 11 2 52nd remained in england during waterloo campaign and were disbanded in 1815 subsequently 52nd remained a one battalion regiment until their merger with 43rd light infantry initially raised as a regular line regiment 52nd fought in line during american wars and early indian campaigns and did not become a light regiment until 1803 prior to this british army had relied on irregulars and mercenaries to provide most of its light infantry or when conditions demanded it temporarily seconded regular line companies chappell pp 6 7 while regular regiments were required to include one company of light infantry from 1758 training of such light troops was inconsistent and frequently inadequate chappell pp 6 9 consequently when beginning a restructure of british army in late 18th century duke of york recognised a need for dedicated light troops especially coming into a war against napoleon and his experienced light infantry chasseurs chappell pp 8 10 during early war against french british army was bolstered by light infantry mercenaries from germany and low countries but british light infantry companies proved inadequate against more effective french tirailleurs during flanders campaign and in netherlands in 1799 and infantry reform became urgent chappell pp 9 10 thumb left map of shorncliffe camp 1801 in 1801 experimental corps of riflemen was raised later designated 95th rifles and a decision was made to train some line regiments in light infantry techniques so they might operate as both light and line infantry sir john moore a proponent of light infantry model suggested that his own regiment of line infantry 52nd undergo this training at shorncliffe camp chappell p 11 they were followed shortly afterwards by 43rd foot by whose side they would fight many campaigns as part of light division several other famous line regiments were designated light infantry in 1808 such as 85th or king s regiment of light infantry bucks volunteers moore wrote of 52nd in his diary that it is evident that not only officers but that each individual soldier knows perfectly what he has to do discipline is carried on without severity officers are attached to men and men to officers quoted in glover p 74 this had much to do with method of training unlike other regiments light infantry officers drilled with men and were expected to be familiar with drill routines including weapons training chappell p 13 ranks also received additional training and were encouraged to develop initiative and self direction while skirmishing in field they would need to react without direct orders while most regiments of time fought in tight formation allowing easy administration of orders light infantry worked in small groups in advance of main line so complicated bugle calls were developed to pass orders chappell p 15 consequently bugle became emblem of light infantry regiments when skirmishing light infantry fought in pairs so that one soldier could cover other while loading line regiments fired in volleys but skirmishers fired at will taking careful aim at targets chappell pp 14 15 while some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles due to their improved accuracy expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in standard infantry musket being issued to most troops accuracy of musket decreased at long range and since french chasseurs and also used muskets it is likely that skirmishers firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards or less 10 yards provided accuracy of point blank range chappell pp 15 16 although french infantry and earlier americans frequently used multi shot and grapeshot in their muskets british light infantry used only standard ball ammunition chappell p 14 light infantry were equipped more lightly than regular line regiments and marched at 140 paces per minute wickes p 78 tasks of light infantry included advance and rear guard action flanking protection for armies and forward skirmishing they were also called upon to take regular line formations during battles or to act as part of fortification storming parties during peninsular war they were regarded as army s elite corps regimental history early history 52nd began as a standard infantry line regiment in 1755 when colonel hedworth lambton received papers to raise a new regiment to be numbered as 54th foot it was renumbered as 52nd regiment of foot in 1757 wickes p 77 and was

upon 11 french divisions in of war combat of casal novo and april 1811 an engagement of which wellington later wrote i consider that action that was fought by light division with whole of french 2nd

wore traditional british army red coats with buff facings during american wars coat was long tailed with buff facings buff waistcoat and breeches grenadier company wore a bearskin hat with king s crest and regimental number officers wore crimson sash gorget and silver epaulettes sons of revolution uniforms when becoming a light infantry regiment in 1803 uniform accordingly changed light infantry dress has its origins in american war of independence when uniforms were altered to allow ease in field wings similar to those worn by grenadiers were added to shoulders and lacing was dispensed with to make quick removal of coats possible at that time irregular light infantry also sought less conspicuous dress than traditional red coat chappell p 6 however conservatism returned with new regular light infantry while 95th rifles were permitted to retain green clothing used by german regiments seconded line regiments were required to retain red coat which remained an impediment to their skirmishing duties chappell p 16 thus throughout napoleonic wars 52nd foot continued to wear red uniforms with buff facings officers had silver lace while other ranks lace was worn in pairs red with orange stripes according to 1802 regulations in 1812 a commentator described lace as red with two blue stripes haythornthwaite 1987 p 100 light infantry officers wore short jackets rather than tailed coats of other line regiments with white piping silver buttons and silver and scarlet shoulder wings uniform was completed with a crimson sash to match buff facings and turn backs officers generally wore buff breeches or grey overalls field officers of 52nd wore silver epaulettes with regimental badge overtop light infantry wings to designate rank an 1810 order stipulated these be badged with a star for majors a crown lieutenant colonels or star and crown colonels haythornthwaite 1987 p 37 light infantry also commonly wore a narrow waist belt instead of customary shoulder belt 52nd did not adopt belgic cap but retained stovepipe shako throughout napoleonic period it was adorned with brass bugle badge and green plumes of light infantry haythornthwaite 1987 p 54 in 52nd officers plumes were made from horsehair officers generally carried a stirrup hilted sabre officers were responsible for providing and paying for their own uniforms consequently variable style and decoration was present according to officer s private means haythornthwaite 1987 p 14 equipment could consume a significant portion of an officer s pay during napoleonic era 52nd s plain regimental sabre for example cost 4 guineas approximately 16 days pay for an ensign haythornthwaite 1987 p 10 red coat remained standard uniform for british army until khaki was introduced as standard in 1885 although some allowances were made for colonial conditions with use of lighter materials and slight change of design haythornthwaite 1995 pp 34 35 however uniform and equipment remained quite restrictive particularly in colonial warfare in 1841 light bob s situation was compared unfavourably with his enemy s light marching order buckle him up in a tight red jacket when thermometer is about

museum and soldiers of oxfordshire museum whose archives are managed by oxfordshire county council some officers of 52nd recorded their experiences in regiment one of most notable was reverend william leeke who as a young ensign carried regimental colours at waterloo leeke vol i p 20 he believed that actions taken by sir john colborne lord seaton and 52nd to defeat imperial guard at close of battle had been unjustly overlooked in official dispatches and histories and wrote his memoirs so that truth with regard to what we knew 52nd had achieved at waterloo should see light leeke vol i p v in 1866
