thumb upright 1 35 a mule is a sterile hybrid of a male donkey and a female horse mules are smaller than horses but stronger than donkeys making them useful as pack animals in biology a hybrid is offspring resulting from combining qualities of two organisms of different breeds varieties species or genera through sexual reproduction hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents such as in blending inheritance but can show hybrid vigour sometimes growing larger or taller than either parent concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding where there is interest in individual parentage in genetics attention is focused on numbers of chromosomes in taxonomy a key question is how closely related parent species are species are reproductively isolated by strong barriers to hybridisation which include genetic and morphological differences differing times of fertility mating behaviors and cues and physiological rejection of sperm cells or developing embryo some act before fertilization and others after it similar barriers exist in plants with differences in flowering times pollen vectors inhibition of pollen tube growth somatoplastic sterility cytoplasmic genic male sterility and structure of chromosomes a few animal species and many plant species however are result of hybrid speciation including important crop plants such as wheat where number of chromosomes has been doubled human impact on environment has resulted in an increase in interbreeding between regional species and proliferation of introduced species worldwide has also resulted in an increase in hybridisation this genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging gene pools of many species for future breeding a form of often intentional human mediated hybridisation is crossing of wild and domesticated species this is common in both traditional horticulture and modern agriculture many commercially useful fruits flowers garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridisation one such flower oenothera lamarckiana was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy it is also more occasionally done in livestock and pet trades some well known wild x domestic hybrids are and human selective breeding of domesticated animals and plants has resulted is development of distinct breeds usually called cultivars in reference to plants crossbreeds between them without any wild stock are sometimes also imprecisely referred to as hybrids hybrid humans existed in prehistory for example neanderthals and anatomically modern humans are thought to have interbred as recently as 40 000 years ago mythological hybrids appear in human culture in forms as diverse as minotaur blends of animals humans and mythical beasts such as centaurs and sphinxes and nephilim of biblical apocrypha described as wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women etymology thumb upright liger a lion tiger hybrid bred in captivity term hybrid is derived from latin used for crosses such as of a tame sow and a wild boar term came into popular use in english in 19th century though examples of its use have been found from early 17th century conspicuous hybrids are popularly named with portmanteau words starting in 1920s with breeding of tiger lion hybrids liger and tigon when sire is a lion result is termed a liger whilst converse is a tigon edward george boulenger world natural history b t batsford ltd 1937 p 40 as seen by different disciplines animal and plant breeding from point of view of animal and plant breeders there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species such as between different breeds single cross hybrids result from cross between two true breeding organisms which produces an f1 hybrid first filial generation cross between two different homozygous lines produces an f1 hybrid that is heterozygous having two alleles one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and other recessive typically f1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous producing offspring that are all similar to each other double cross hybrids result from cross between two different f1 hybrids i e there are four unrelated grandparents three way cross hybrids result from cross between an f1 hybrid and an inbred line triple cross hybrids result from crossing of two different three way cross hybrids top cross or hybrids result from crossing of a top quality or pure bred male and a lower quality female intended to improve quality of offspring on average population hybrids result from crossing of plants or animals in one population with those of another population these include interspecific hybrids or crosses between different breeds in horticulture term stable hybrid is used to describe an annual plant that if grown and bred in a small monoculture free of external pollen e g an air filtered greenhouse produces offspring that are true to type with respect to phenotype i e a true breeding organism biogeography hybridisation can occur in hybrid zones where geographical ranges of species subspecies or distinct genetic lineages overlap for example butterfly arthemis has two major subspecies in north america l a arthemis white admiral and l a astyanax red spotted purple white admiral has a bright white band on its wings while red spotted purple has cooler blue green shades hybridisation occurs between a narrow area across new england southern ontario and great lakes suture region it is at these regions that subspecies were formed other hybrid zones have formed between described species of plants and animals genetics thumb upright oenothera lamarckiana is a permanent natural hybrid studied intensively by geneticist hugo de vries illustration by de vries 1913 from point of view of genetics several different kinds of hybrid can be distinguished a genetic hybrid carries two different alleles of same gene where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than other a structural hybrid results from fusion of gametes that have differing structure in at least one chromosome as a result of structural abnormalities a numerical hybrid results from fusion of gametes having different haploid numbers of chromosomes a permanent hybrid results when only heterozygous genotype occurs as in oenothera lamarckiana because all homozygous combinations are lethal in early history of genetics hugo de vries supposed these were caused by mutation taxonomy from point of view of taxonomy hybrids differ according to their parentage hybrids between different subspecies such as between bengal tiger and siberian tiger are called intra specific hybrids interspecific hybrids are offspring from interspecies mating these sometimes result in hybrid speciation intergeneric hybrids result from matings between different genera such as between sheep and goats interfamilial hybrids such as between chickens and guineafowl or pheasants are reliably described but extremely rare hybrids between different orders are few but have been made with sea urchin female and sand dollar male biology expression of parental traits thumb hybrid between lady amherst s pheasant chrysolophus and another species probably golden pheasant chrysolophus pictus when two distinct types of organisms breed with each other resulting hybrids typically have intermediate traits e g one plant parent has red flowers other has white and hybrid pink flowers commonly hybrids also combine traits seen only separately in one parent or other e g a bird hybrid might combine yellow head of one parent with orange belly of other mechanisms of reproductive isolation interspecific hybrids are bred by mating individuals from two species normally from within same genus offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents but are often sterile preventing gene flow between species keeton william t 1980 biological science new york norton p 800 sterility is often attributed to different number of chromosomes between two species for example donkeys have 62 chromosomes horses have 64 chromosomes and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes mules hinnies and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis meiosis is disrupted and viable sperm and eggs are not formed however fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as father a variety of mechanisms limit success of hybridisation including large genetic difference between most species barriers include morphological differences differing times of fertility mating behaviors and cues and physiological rejection of sperm cells or developing embryo some act before fertilization others after it m 1978 genetica omega barcelona espana p 874 879 futuyma d 1998 evolutionary biology 3a edicion sinauer sunderland in plants some barriers to hybridisation include blooming period differences different pollinator vectors inhibition of pollen tube growth somatoplastic sterility cytoplasmic genic male sterility and structural differences of chromosomes speciation thumb wheat is tetraploid derived from wild emmer wheat which is a hybrid of two diploid wild grasses triticum urartu and a wild goatgrass such as aegilops or ae a few animal species are result of hybridization fly is a natural hybrid american red wolf appears to be a hybrid of gray wolf and coyote although its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy j review of proposed rule regarding status of wolf under endangered species act january 2014 european edible frog is a semi permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs its population requires continued presence of at least one of parent species cave paintings indicate that european bison is a natural hybrid of aurochs and steppe bison plant hybridization is more commonplace compared to animal hybridization many crop species are hybrids including notably polyploid some have four sets of chromosomes tetraploid or six hexaploid while other wheat species have like most eukaryotic organisms two sets diploid so hybridization events likely involved doubling of chromosome sets causing immediate genetic isolation hybridization may be important in speciation in some plant groups however hybrid speciation not increasing number of sets of chromosomes may be rare by 1997 only 8 natural examples had been fully described experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation a prediction confirmed by fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes meaning that once hybridization has occurred new hybrid genome can remain stable many hybrid zones are known where ranges of two species meet and hybrids are continually produced in great numbers these hybrid zones are useful as biological model systems for studying mechanisms of speciation recently dna analysis of a bear shot by a hunter in north west territories confirmed existence of naturally occurring and fertile grizzly polar bear hybrids hybrid vigour thumb hybrid vigour salvia jurisicii x nutans hybrids top centre with flowers are taller than their parents salvia jurisicii centre tray or salvia nutans top left hybridization between reproductively isolated species often results in hybrid offspring with lower fitness than either parental however hybrids are not as might be expected always intermediate between their parents as if there were blending inheritance but are sometimes stronger or perform better than either parental lineage or variety a phenomenon called heterosis hybrid vigour or advantage this is most common with plant hybrids a transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of parent lines plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids including line breeding and formation of complex hybrids an economically important example is hybrid maize corn which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties hybrid seed dominates commercial maize seed market in united states canada and many other major maize producing countries in a hybrid any trait that falls outside range of parental variation and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents is considered heterotic positive heterosis produces more robust hybrids they might be stronger or bigger while term negative heterosis refers to weaker or smaller hybrids heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids for example hybrids between a lion and a tigress are much larger than either of two progenitors while lioness x tiger are smaller similarly hybrids between common pheasant phasianus colchicus and domestic fowl gallus gallus are larger than either of their parents as are those produced between common pheasant and hen golden pheasant chrysolophus pictus spurs are absent in hybrids of former type although present in both parents human influence anthropogenic hybridization hybridization is greatly influenced by human impact on environment through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions such impacts make it difficult to conserve genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time both intentionally for purposes such as biological control and unintentionally as with accidental escapes of individuals introductions can drastically affect populations including through hybridization management thumb examples of hybrid flowers from hybrid swarms of aquilegia pubescens and aquilegia formosa there is a kind of continuum with three semi distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization hybridization without introgression hybridization with widespread introgression backcrossing with one of parent species and hybrid swarms highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with parent species depending on where a population falls along this continuum management plans for that population will change hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization conservationists disagree on when is proper time to give up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm or to try and save still existing pure individuals once a population becomes a complete mixture goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss conservationists treat each case on its merits depending on detecting hybrids within population it is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy because hybridization can occur when it occurs naturally and when hybrid swarms are only remaining evidence of prior species they need to be conserved as well genetic mixing and extinction regionally developed ecotypes can be threatened with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype this is sometimes called genetic mixing hybridization and introgression which can happen in natural and hybrid populations of new genetic material can lead to replacement of local genotypes if hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over indigenous ecotype or species these hybridization events can result from introduction of non native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification bringing previously isolated species into contact genetic mixing can be especially detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats ultimately affecting population to such a degree that none of originally genetically distinct population remains potts brad m barbour robert c andrew b 2001 genetic pollution from farm forestry using eucalypt species and hybrids a report for rirdc l wa joint venture agroforestry program rirdc publication no 01 114 rirdc project no cpf 3a australian government rural industrial research and development corporation effect on biodiversity and food security thumb green revolution of 20th century relied on hybridization to create high yielding varieties along with increased reliance on inputs of fertilizers pesticides and irrigation in agriculture and animal husbandry green revolution s use of conventional hybridization increased yields by breeding high yielding varieties replacement of locally indigenous breeds compounded with unintentional cross pollination and crossbreeding genetic mixing has reduced gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds resulting in loss of genetic diversity genetic pollution great genetic scandal sharma bulletin 28 since indigenous breeds are often well adapted to local extremes in climate and have immunity to local pathogens this can be a significant genetic erosion of gene pool for future breeding therefore commercial plant geneticists strive to breed widely adapted cultivars to counteract this tendency troyer a forrest breeding widely adapted cultivars examples from maize encyclopedia of plant and crop science 27 february 2004 in different taxa in animals familiar examples of hybrids are mule a cross between a female horse and a male donkey and hinny a cross between a female donkey and a male horse pairs of complementary types like mule and hinny are called reciprocal hybrids among many other mammal crosses are hybrid camels crosses between a bactrian camel and a first known instance of hybrid speciation in marine mammals was discovered in 2014 clymene dolphin clymene is a hybrid of two atlantic species spinner and striped dolphins cagebird breeders sometimes breed bird hybrids known as mules between species of finch such as goldfinch x canary among amphibians japanese giant salamanders and chinese giant salamanders have created hybrids that threaten survival of japanese giant salamanders because of competition for similar resources in japan among fish a group of about fifty natural hybrids between australian blacktip shark and larger common blacktip shark was found by australia s eastern coast in 2012 among insects so called killer bees were accidentally created during an attempt to breed a strain of bees that would both produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions it was done by crossing a european honey bee and an african bee and c butterflies have retained enough genetic compatibility to produce viable hybrid offspring hybrid speciation may have produced diverse heliconius butterflies but that is disputed in humans there is evidence of hybridisation between modern humans and other species of genus homo in 2010 neanderthal genome project showed that 1 4 of dna from all people living today apart from most sub saharan africans is of neanderthal heritage analyzing genomes of 600 europeans and east asians found that combining them covered 20 of neanderthal genome that is in modern human population ancient human populations lived and interbred with neanderthals and at least one other extinct homo species thus neanderthal and dna has been incorporated into human dna by introgression in 1998 a complete prehistorical skeleton found in portugal child had features of both anatomically modern humans and neanderthals some ancient human skulls with especially large nasal cavities and unusually shaped braincases represent human neanderthal hybrids a 37 000 to 42 000 year old human jawbone found in romania s oase cave contains traces of neanderthal ancestry from only four to six generations earlier all genes from neanderthals in current human population are descended from neanderthal fathers and human mothers a neanderthal skull unearthed in italy in 1957 reveals neanderthal mitochondrial dna which is passed on through only maternal lineage but skull has a chin shape similar to modern humans it is proposed that it was offspring of a neanderthal mother and a human father in plants thumb upright london plane platanus x acerifolia is a natural hybrid popular for street planting plant species hybridize more readily than animal species and resulting hybrids are fertile more often many plant species are result of hybridization combined with polyploidy which duplicates chromosomes chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced plant hybrids are generally given names that include an x not in italics such as platanus x acerifolia for london plane a natural hybrid of p orientalis oriental plane and p occidentalis american sycamore parent s names may be kept in their entirety as seen in prunus persica x prunus americana with female parent s name given first or if not known parent s names given alphabetically plant species that are genetically compatible may not hybridize in nature for various reasons including geographical isolation differences in flowering period or differences in pollinators species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that have some of characteristics of each of parent species much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops some crop plants are hybrids from different genera intergeneric hybrids such as triticale x a wheat rye hybrid most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids bread wheat triticum is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses several commercial fruits including rubus x and grapefruit citrus x are hybrids as are garden herbs such as peppermint mentha x piperita and trees such as london plane platanus x acerifolia among many natural plant hybrids is iris albicans a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division and oenothera lamarckiana a flower that was subject of important experiments by hugo de vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy sterility in a non polyploid hybrid is often a result of chromosome number if parents are of differing chromosome pair number offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes which leaves them unable to produce balanced gametes while that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless it is an attractive attribute in some fruits triploid bananas and watermelons are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also thumb upright 0 8 oase 2 skull may be a human neanderthal hybrid in mythology thumb upright minotaur of ancient greek mythology was in one version of
