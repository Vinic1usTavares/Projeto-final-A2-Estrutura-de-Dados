1944 as they completed working up flotilla was tasked to support minelaying efforts in baltic and gulf of finland in february 1944 but initially escorted convoys before laying its first minefield in mid march its primary activity remained minelaying through july including reinforcing existing minefields in gulf of finland in april reinforced by arrival of z36 in late june flotilla began bombarding soviet positions at end of july both by themselves and while escorting heavy cruisers on same mission and intermittently continued to do so almost up until end of war in september it

construction of z44 and z45 was slowed by their lack of priority and only z44 was launched before end of war work on both ships was ordered halted for at least three months on 24 july 1944 although it was rendered moot five days later when z44 was sunk while fitting out during an air raid by royal air force on bremen both ships were already being cannibalized for parts to repair destroyer by then and salvaging z44 became impractical when her stern broke off in early september her wreck was scrapped in place in 1948 1949 z45 was never finished and was broken up on slipway in 1946 sieche p 235
