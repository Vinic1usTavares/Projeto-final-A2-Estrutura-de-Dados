battle of freteval which took place on 3 july 1194 was a medieval battle part of ongoing fighting between richard lionheart and philip ii of france that lasted from 1194 to richard s death in april 1199 during battle english and norman forces ambushed french army which was defeated philip managed to flee but lost his archives which were captured by richard after battle philip decided to keep them in paris which led to creation of french national library archives nationales background thumb richard lionheart and philip augustus king richard i of england had been captured and imprisoned by leopold of austria on king s return from crusade in december 1192 for over a year terms of his release were negotiated until he was released on payment of a massive ransom in january 1194 whilst he was imprisoned richard s brother john had allied against richard with french king philip ii who had also wanted to capture english king john had granted philip much land from richard s estates in aquitaine as well as various castles this included whole of duchy lands east of river seine during richard s imprisonment philip had made attempts at physically occupying these estates with some success particularly around important channel ports of dieppe and le treport however as soon as richard returned to normandy john made his peace with him abandoning philip richard proceeded to unravel much of philip s recent gains in region beginning with raising of philip s siege of verneuil on 29 may 1194 there philip was forced into a hasty retreat and foreshadowing his losses at freteval abandoned his siege engines and other valuable materiel encounter at freteval wood king philip probably shadowed richard s army as latter moved through loire valley in an attempt at constraining english army s ability to manoeuvre however richard doubled back on french in which pursuit english king s horse was killed it remains uncertain whether despite fact that contemporaries described encounter as a battle two forces ever made contact it is possible that rear portion of french force engaged with that of english however as part of a war in which skirmishing was usual form of encounter freteval was no different and it has been said it does not deserve label of a battle in what was most likely an ambush by english philip appears to have abandoned his baggage train in a wood as richard approached and escaped to a saint hilaire chapel on whitsun eve philip s sudden departure wrote historian john gillingham was last straw for his troops already demoralized by threat to their supplies richard proceeded to harry retreating french soldiers before entering verneuil in triumph engagement at freteval has been described as a minor disaster for philip although probably more in political terms than military one of reasons kings of period were so often adverse to pitched battles was fact that they travelled as an itinerant government and nomadic treasury which were too valuable to lose on battlefield and since kings of this period often travelled as peripatetic courts philip s baggage train contained not just personal effects such as household furniture but necessary paraphernalia for government and tax collecting among french king s luggage captured by english were his personal seal and important archival documents such as financial records charters payment inventories and rent and toll receipts also captured was a great quantity of treasure whose value was immense said one french chronicler philip beat a hasty retreat across river and in doing so bridge collapsed under weight of retreating army this apparently resulted in french king getting soaked through which one writer has described as a condition which delighted richard english king may have come within minutes of capturing philip but being overly enthusiastic in his attempt to capture philip rode a great distance past chapel where philip was actually hiding allowing him to escape aftermath archives it has been claimed gave richard names and details of all of philip s spies and agents in duchy of as well as angevin deserters to french and at least one contemporary chronicler it has been said dwelt lovingly on french king s humiliation whilst possibly in retaliation philip sacked town of evreux which was a possession of philip s erstwhile ally john as well as local churches french chroniclers however and perhaps less surprisingly tended to gloss over philip s rout at freteval one covered it in a single sentence this was not unusual small skirmishes like freteval were often recorded by chroniclers whose side won and ignored by those who lost richard although he was never to return to england dispatched captured french archives to london where they were deposited in tower as a result of this battle philip became first french king not to take his archives on campaign with him as had been customary but to create tresor des chartes in paris for permanent deposit in a newly created new chancery this has been described as a first step in maintaining documentary record of monarchial government references category richard i of england freteval
