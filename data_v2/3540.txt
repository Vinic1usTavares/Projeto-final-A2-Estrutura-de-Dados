also features a reappearance by celeste kane lisa thornhill a recurring character during first season second season dvd includes an alternate ending to this episode which was released around airing of episode as a promotional tool alternate ending starts same way as regular ending with veronica discovering that meg is pregnant but instead of episode ending there meg s mom comes into room while veronica hides in bathroom when mom leaves meg is dead with a pillow over her face indicating smothering however veronica takes pillow off before a nurse comes in thomas commented that alternate ending was never going to be actual conclusion to episode he said we never seriously considered having that be ending there were various other endings that we did have but they were so subtly different it was like when does veronica enter room idea to promote alternate ending was a joint venture from upn promotions department and executive producer joel silver after thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending he decided to make it very different from episode s actual conclusion but once we could have a very different alternate ending we thought let s make it rock beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don t have to play it out in next episode reception ratings in its original broadcast my mother fiend received 2 82 million viewers marking an increase from
