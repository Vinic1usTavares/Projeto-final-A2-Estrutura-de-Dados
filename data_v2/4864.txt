goito class was a group of four torpedo cruisers built for italian regia marina royal navy in 1880s members of class were and they were among first torpedo cruisers built for italian fleet and were built to improve on previous vessel experimental ships four goito class vessels varied in their dimensions machinery and armament though all were comparable in terms of capabilities having a top speed of and carrying an armament of four or five torpedo tubes all four ships spent majority of their time in service with main italian fleet alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status in 1897 goito was converted into a minelayer and montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel monzambano and confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901 goito laid defensive minefields after italy entered world war i in 1915 but otherwise did not see action during war two surviving vessels remained in italian fleet until 1920 when they too were broken up for scrap design first three members of goito class was designed by engineering general inspector benedetto brin while was designed by engineering director giacinto pullino brin had previously designed several classes of very large ironclad battleships including and es but by 1880s he had begun to embrace ideas of jeune ecole which emphasized small fast torpedo armed vessels that could damage or destroy much larger battleships at a fraction of cost sondhaus p 149 four goitos were similar to preceding cruiser first torpedo cruiser brin designed as these were among initial designs prepared by italian navy they were experimental brin and pullino used different hull shapes for all four vessels and fitted them with a variety of propulsion systems and armament gardiner pp 346 347 general characteristics and machinery thumb left monzambano shortly after entering service as a result of their experimental nature ships of goito class varied slightly in size they all were long at waterline and long overall but their beam varied from and their draft ranged from ships were built with steel hulls they displaced normally and at full load they had a crew of between 105 and 121 first three ships had similar propulsion systems that consisted of three steam engines each driving a single screw propeller and had double expansion engines while had more advanced triple expansion engines confienza instead used a two shaft configuration for her double expansion engines steam for engines was supplied by coal fired locomotive boilers goito and montebello had six boilers while monzambano and confienza had four boilers for goito and monzambano were trunked into two funnels montebello had three and confienza only had one exact figures for first three ships performance have not survived but they could steam at a speed of about from confienza with only two screws had a top speed of from in 1894 goito had her center engine and screw removed and her original boilers replaced with oil fired models with these changes her engines were capable of producing from ships had a cruising radius of at a speed of they were originally fitted with a fore and aft sailing rig to supplement steam engines though they were later removed gardiner p 347 armament and armor thumb confienza note 4 7 in gun on her bow primary armament for goito class was five torpedo tubes though montebello only had four tubes ships also carried a variety of light guns goito was equipped with five 40 caliber cal guns two 20 cal guns and three 37 mm revolving hotchkiss guns all mounted singly montebello had six 57 mm guns and two 37 mm guns and monzambano carried only six 57 mm guns confienza was only vessel to carry a medium caliber gun a single 32 cal gun mounted on her bow she also carried six 57 mm guns and two 37 mm guns ships were protected with an armored deck that was thick ships name builder laid down launched completed regio cantiere di castellammare di stabia castellammare di stabia september 1885

service history thumb montebello early in her career all four goito class cruisers served with main italian fleet for majority of their careers this time was spent either laid up in reserve component of fleet or activated for yearly training maneuvers these frequently gamed a french attack on italy as in case of 1888 maneuvers for which only goito had been completed in time to participate that simulated a french attack on la spezia brassey 1889 p 453 or 1893 maneuvers which tested a french attack on naples clarke thursfield pp 202 203 in 1898 monzambano and montebello participated in a rare deployment for members of class when they were assigned to levant squadron that was tasked with patrolling eastern mediterranean sea naval notes italy p 855 throughout this period ships of class would either be distributed among divisions of fleet as with case of annual training maneuvers or stationed together while in reserve status in 1895 for example four goitos were assigned to 2nd maritime department along with tripoli and eight torpedo cruisers naval and military notes italy p 90 in 1897 goito was withdrawn from front line service and converted in a minelayer with a capacity for 60 naval mines in place of her torpedo tubes montebello remained on active duty until 1898 when she was converted into a training ship for engine room personnel and was re boilered with coal and oil fired equipment from several manufacturers in 1903 confienza and monzambano were last members of class to leave active service being stricken from naval register on same day 26 august 1901 and sold for scrapping goito continued to take part in fleet maneuvers as late as 1907 in her minelayer configuration brassey 1908 p 77 and both she and remained in regia marinas inventory during italo turkish war of 1911 p 11 and world war i neither ship saw action in either conflict though goito laid defensive minefields in adriatic sea after italy entered world war i in 1915 o hara dickson worth p 201 montebello was eventually stricken on 26 january 1920 and goito followed her to breakers yard on 15 march notes references
