decline and fall of pedro ii of brazil occurred over course of 1880s with underlying factors accumulating and coming increasingly into focus after 1881 this period paradoxically coincided with a time of unparalleled economic and social stability and progress for brazil during which nation had achieved a prominent place as an emerging power within international arena roots of collapse of monarchy can be traced as far back as 1850 upon death of pedro ii s youngest male child from that point onward emperor himself ceased to believe in monarchy as a viable form of government for brazil s future as his remaining heir was a daughter although constitutionally permitted a female ruler was considered unacceptable by both pedro ii and ruling circles this issue was deferred for decades during which country became more powerful and prosperous so long as emperor enjoyed good health matter of succession could be ignored from 1881 on pedro ii s health began failing he gradually withdrew from public affairs as time passed weary of being tied to a throne which he doubted would survive his death he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative nor did his daughter and heir isabel exhibit a desire to assume crown both however were overwhelmingly beloved by brazilian people who still supported monarchy indifference towards imperial system by emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch coup that overthrew empire pedro ii may be considered a rare instance of a head of state who despite being considered a highly successful ruler to end was ultimately subjected to overthrow and exile decline during 1880s brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly including first organized push for women s rights country had greatly changed in five decades since pedro ii s accession to throne liberalism adopted by successive government cabinets favored private initiatives and resulted in decades of economic prosperity it had an economy that was rapidly developing in 1880s brazil s international trade reached a total value of rs 79 000 000 000 see brazilian currency between 1834 and 1839 this continued to increase every year until it reached rs 472 000 000 000 between 1886 and 1887 an annual growth rate of 3 88 since 1839 brazilian economic growth especially after 1850 compared well with that of united states and european nations national revenue which amounted to rs 11 795 000 000 in 1831 rose to rs 160 840 000 000 in 1889 by 1858 it was eighth largest in world to give an idea of economic potential of country during empire if it had been able to sustain level of productivity achieved in 1780 and managed to increase exports at a pace equal to that verified in second half of 19th century its per capita income in 1950 would be comparable to average per capita income of western european nations thumb left 400px alt painting of a group of standing and seated

stage for both brazil and himself development on an immense scale occurred during this period which anticipated similar initiatives in european countries in 1850 there were 50 factories valued at more than rs 7 000 000 000 at end of imperial period in 1889 brazil had 636 factories representing an annual rate of increase of 6 74 from 1850 valued at approximately rs 401 630 600 000 annual growth rate of 10 94 since 1850 countryside echoed with clang of iron track being laid as railroads were constructed at most furious pace of nineteenth century indeed building in was second greatest in absolute terms in brazil s entire history only eight countries in entire world laid more track in decade than brazil first railroad line with only 15 kilometers was opened on 30 april 1854 at a time when many european countries had no rail service by 1868 there were 718 kilometers of railroad lines and by end of empire in 1889 this had grown to 9 200 kilometers with another 9 000 kilometers under construction making it country with largest rail network in latin america factories also sprang throughout empire in 1880s at an rate and its cities were beginning to receive benefits of gas electrical sanitation telegraph and tram companies brazil was entering modern world it was fifth country in world to install modern sewers in cities third to have sewage treatment and one of pioneers in installing telephone lines beyond these it was first south american nation to adopt public electric illumination in 1883 and second in americas behind united states to establish a telegraph line connecting it directly to europe in 1874 first telegraph line appeared in 1852 in rio de janeiro by 1889 there were 18 925 kilometers of telegraph lines connecting country s capital to distant brazilian provinces such as para and even linking to other south american countries such as argentina and uruguay brazilian empire was admired internationally for its democratic system and for its respect for freedom of speech in politics there were solid and competitive parties an active parliament a free press open debate argentine president bartolome mitre called country a crowned democracy and venezuelan president rojas paul after learning of emperor s fall said it has ended only republic that existed in south america empire of brazil brazil of last year of pedro ii s reign was a prosperous and internationally respected nation which held unchallenged leadership in latin america its navy was fifth or sixth most powerful in world in 1889 with most powerful battleships in western hemisphere emperor was beloved by brazilian people and was regarded with respect almost veneration in north america and europe due to his democratic liberal and progressive ideals and actions remarks made by a former u s consul at rio de janeiro who met pedro ii in late 1882 tells much of general view that foreigners had of brazil and its emperor by end of 1880s british prime minister william ewart gladstone said that pedro ii was a model to sovereigns of world and held him as being a great and good sovereign brazilian writer machado de assis would later remember him as a humble honest well learned and patriotic man who knew how to make of a throne a chair for his simplicity without diminishing its greatness and respect when he became emperor in 1831 brazil was on verge of fragmentation fifty eight years later country had been at peace for more than four decades slavery had been extinguished representative system was consolidated and leadership of military was in civilian hands something not seen in spanish american countries indeed for longevity of his government and transformations which occurred during its course no other head of state has marked more deeply history of nation even though brazil was richer and more powerful than ever though it enjoyed an excellent international reputation and though pedro ii himself was still extremely popular among his subjects brazilian monarchy itself was dying a tired emperor thumb 240px alt white bearded emperor with his right hand tucked into his formal coat stands next to right of seated empress who wears

pedro ii to countess of barral reveal a man grown world weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook in them he frequently expresses his loneliness and his desire to escape into her company emperor entertained a fantasy of leaving everything behind and realizing his cherished ambition of taking up a life in europe as he expressed it and i were i to enjoy my total independence where would i be guess this strong desire to retire to a less circumscribed life abroad was a constant presence throughout 1880s despite dichotomy between reverie and reality he remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing tasks demanded of imperial office albeit often without enthusiasm pedro ii was also undergoing physical decline which only served to exacerbate his mental state in younger days he was admired for his ability to work long hours and rapidly bounce back from setbacks but lack of exercise and very poor eating habits also took their toll by 1880s he had to rely on pince nez spectacles for reading due to deterioration of his eyesight and on dentures for eating as sugar had caused his teeth to decay a tendency to doze off unexpectedly began to be exhibited including falling asleep in middle of important meetings and during public engagements cause was what is known today as type 2 diabetes non insulin dependent with which emperor was diagnosed sometime around 1882 throughout following years monarch was afflicted with several sudden illnesses ranging from stomach pains to fevers in 1884 he received a laceration on his left leg which became infected and complicated by his diabetes took longer than expected to completely heal he also began suffering from urinary problems due to damage done by diabetes to his kidneys tired of emperorship and beset by frequent ailments pedro ii increasingly withdrew from government business often behaving more like a bystander he was observed walking around dressed in tailcoat and carrying an umbrella in streets sometimes surrounded by cheerful children sampling fruits in local market and tasting students food in kitchens on visits to schools he tried to live as an ordinary person successfully mixing with people in streets he abolished several rituals related to monarchy such as hand kissing in 1872 and guarda dos archers s guard in 1877 palace guard clad in multicolored uniforms and armed with halberds city palace where government met was practically abandoned as also was imperial residence at palace of sao cristovao now devoid of courtiers an austrian diplomat summarized well situation in late 1882 pomp ritual and luxury were discarded these caused pedro ii to be viewed as a great citizen in popular imagination but at same time his image as a monarch as a living symbol and authority figure diminished as a german journalist remarked in 1883 it is a rare thing in emperor s situation he has no personal fortune and his civil list already by itself insufficient is almost all expended on charity in a way that he cannot afford any pomp in court nor do anything to give any gleam to his residences it undoubtedly does great honor to man but contributes little to necessary prestige of emperor but society in which emperor lived put great store in ceremonials and customs and emperor had discarded much of symbolism and aura with which imperial system was imbued monarchy s fate heirless after their experience of perils and obstacles of government political figures who had arisen during 1830s became wary of taking on a greater role in ruling nation they looked to emperor as providing a fundamental and useful source of authority essential both for governing and for national survival pedro ii s natural ability and proficiency as a ruler encouraged greater deference as time passed political establishment perceived him as key to successful working of political system someone whose reputation and authority protected him from all discussion these elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until by 1880s they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of regency and early years of pedro ii s reign when external and internal dangers threatened nation s existence they had only known a stable administration and prosperity in sharp contrast those of previous era young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to nation pedro ii s role in achieving an era of national unity stability and good government now went unremembered and by ruling elites by his very success pedro ii had made himself redundant as emperor thumb left 250px alt looking down on assembled legislators on floor of hall with observers crowding an arcaded balcony brazilian senate 1888 neither emperor nor ruling circles believed that there was a viable successor to brazilian throne lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for nation also diminished long term prospects for continuation of brazilian monarchy emperor loved his daughter isabel and respected her strong character however he considered idea of a female successor as antithetical to role required of brazil s ruler destiny had spoken in loss of his two male heirs and lack after their death of any more sons that view was also shared by political establishment who continued to harbor reservations when it came to any thought of accepting a female ruler isabel s children were also discounted as heirs pedro ii had not raised them as possible successors to throne but rather in hopes that they would become worthy citizens consensus was that a suitable successor had to be a man that is a male of braganza line emperor s great grandmother maria i of portugal had been a queen regnant however she had been married to her uncle pedro iii of portugal who was a braganza this meant that her offspring would continue to belong to house of braganza emperor pedro ii was last of direct male line in brazil descended from dom afonso i first king of portugal and founder in 1139 of dynasty which headed brazilian empire there were two other male albeit living abroad pedro ii s half brother rodrigo delfim pereira and his cousin miguel duke of braganza both were barred from line of succession however former because he was an illegitimate son and latter because he was a foreigner and not a descendant of first brazilian emperor pedro i none of these issues bothered isabel who did not imagine herself taking on position of monarch her public roles gave no indication of preparations for assuming a greater part in government she seemed content in supporting her father s position and made no effort to assemble her own faction of supporters within political establishment her views and beliefs held no attraction for disaffected politicians so no independent movement formed to adopt her as champion she was content with life of an aristocratic lady devoting herself to family religion charitable works theater opera painting and music her husband count of eu was equally disliked he was shy humble and eschewed displays of pomp and luxury since his marriage to isabel in 1864 his behavior was described as exemplary but count s private virtues did not become a part of his public image to those outside his immediate circle he came to be characterized as a greedy foreign interloper baseless rumors of questionable business dealings also circulated such as one which portrayed him as a rio de janeiro slum lord prospect of count becoming consort detracted from prospect of isabel becoming empress couple offered to brazilians no alternative center of loyalty or competing vision of monarchy a weary emperor who no longer cared for throne an heir who had no desire to assume crown discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of imperial role in national affairs all seemed to presage monarchy s impending doom nevertheless pedro ii was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing after more than five decades on throne he had become complacent in a belief that devotion and support of his subjects was immutable because of these factors and lack of an energetic response on part of pedro ii it has been argued that prime responsibility for monarchy s overthrow rested with emperor himself republicanism republicanism either support for a presidential or parliamentary republic as an enduring political movement appeared in brazil during december 1870 in rio de janeiro with publishing of a manifesto signed by 57 people and with creation of republican club it represented an insignificant minority of scholars there was no repudiation of or desire for eliminating slavery in manifesto in 1873 republican party of sao paulo was created and it affirmed that slavery would have to be resolved by monarchist conservative and liberal parties reason for this was because many of republicans from sao paulo were themselves slave owning farmers objective of most republicans was to wait until death of pedro ii and by a plebiscite or other peaceful means prevent princess isabel from ascending throne republicanism did not envisage any social readjustment such as improving quality of life for former slaves and they were not revolutionaries in deep meaning of word republican movement had a slow and irregular evolution concentrated in provinces south of bahia more precisely in provinces of sao paulo rio de janeiro minas gerais and rio grande do sul thumb 210px alt an old magazine cover illustration showing an elderly gentleman with a large white beard sleeping in his chair with newspapers scattered about caricature penciled by angelo agostini to revista illustrated magazine mocking lack of interest from pedro ii in politics by end of his reign it was an extremely small group with a precarious organization in provinces and no cohesion or connection among themselves only republican faction to achieve political clout was republican party of sao paulo which managed to elect two deputies to chamber of deputies in 1884 though none were elected to empire s last legislature in 1889 in 1880s it attracted sympathy in lesser numbers than slavery abolitionism and at a slower pace its numbers only increased after 1888 adding new adherents consisting of farmers who had been slave owners and who perceived themselves victims of an unjust abolition of slavery that had not included any type of indemnity to them even so in 1889 avowed republicans were probably a small minority as republican ideals in reality had never managed to seduce people its dissemination was restricted to intellectual and military fields as republicans themselves recognized party did not have size organization and popular support enough to overthrow monarchy republicanism did not manage at any moment of its development to spur national soul it never had stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from throne even with radical propaganda and little interference from authorities republican party in existence from beginning of 1870s was a small one it praised republics such as united states france and argentina while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as united kingdom and scandinavian countries in 1889 its members were spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals they were far from having power to develop a propaganda that could shake foundations of throne in political process of second empire reign of pedro ii republican party had such a dull and secondary role that it might even have been forgotten it was unable to influence rationales advocating regime s dissolution it was crisis between military and government of very diverse origin and evolution from republicanism which was to prove main factor in fall of monarchy pedro ii showed no interest in republican manifesto of 1870 marquis of sao vicente then president of council of ministers suggested to emperor that republicans be forbidden to enter into public service a practice then common in monarchies pedro ii answered mr sao vicente allow nation to govern itself and decide whatever monarchy or republic they want president reprimanded monarch your majesty does not have a right to think in that way monarchy is a constitutional doctrine which your majesty swore to maintain it is not incarnate in person of your majesty but emperor did not care and simply answered well if brazilians do not want me as their emperor i shall become a teacher instead emperor not only always refused to forbid republicans from becoming public servants but also hired republican military officer benjamin constant as a professor of mathematics to his grandsons he allowed open republican activities including newspapers assemblies meetings and political parties and exempted republican deputies elected to chamber of deputies from swearing allegiance to crown freedom of press one of foundations of regime kept allowing fierce criticisms and vile caricatures opposing regime and its public personalities pedro ii was intransigent in his defense of unrestricted freedom of speech which had existed in brazil since independence in 1822 he was accused of being excessively tolerant towards republicans but he did not pay attention to several warnings stating that his behavior undermined political foundation of monarchy in 1889 pedro ii said to jose antonio saraiva that he would not mind if brazil became a republic emperor s indifference towards fate of regime was also one of main factors in fall of monarchy military deterioration a serious problem began to become evident during 1880s this was a weakening of discipline within brazil s military older generation of officers were loyal to monarchy believed military should be under civilian control and had a great aversion to militaristic against which they had earlier fought but these elders were no longer in control and many had since died including duke of caxias count of porto alegre marquis of erval and others it was accepted that military officers could participate in politics while staying on active duty however most did so as members of conservative party and liberal party this meant that their political careers were apt to come into conflict with their duty as officers to act in subordination to civilian government which could be in hands of their political opponents earlier involvement in politics by members of military had not threatened stability of brazil s institutions due to pervasive loyalty to monarchy and constitution conflict of interest in mixing military and political spheres became more obvious and threatening as support for constitutional establishment eroded among some elements within military although neither emperor or government seem to have grasped extent and implications of increasing involvement of members of military as political dissidents until this point brazilians both civilians and military shared a sense of pride in nation s political stability and for having avoided caudillos coups military dictatorships and rebellions that characterized neighboring countries their perception of superiority of brazilian political system was attributed to an established tradition of civilian control over military and ministers who held war and navy portfolios in cabinet were with rare exceptions civilians thumb 320px left alt white bearded emperor stands among a group wearing formal and military attire under a pavilion pedro ii holding a cup and dressed with a campaign uniform of marshal of army next to his son in law gaston d orleans count of eu watching a demonstration of a newly acquired cannon to brazilian army 1886 at this point deterioration of discipline among corps had become evident 1882 saw first signs of insubordination among army corps when a group of officers assassinated a journalist in broad daylight he had published an article which they considered an offence to their honor however participants were not subjected to punishment for this act records from 1884 show that out of a peacetime army of 13 500 men more than 7 526 had been jailed for insubordination military were badly paid inadequately equipped ill instructed and thinly spread across vast empire often in small garrisons of 20 10 5 and even 2 men most of non officer corps consisted of men recruited from poor hinterland in northeast and later from former slaves these were volunteers seeking some means of subsistence as there was no conscription they were completely unprepared for military life had little education or concept of civic responsibility and government a poor brazilian from northeast viewed his military commanders in same light as he viewed henchmen of political bosses at home an ex slave would see his harsh superior officer as differing little from his former owner and they had no means of understanding that they were being used to effect a coup that their orders put them in rebellion against emperor or that their actions would lead to a dictatorship average recruit blindly followed orders and hoped to avoid punishment by his superiors for any mistake in 1886 a colonel renowned for lack of discipline published newspaper articles criticizing minister of war an act of insubordination forbidden by law instead of being punished colonel was supported by his commander field marshal nowadays divisional general deodoro da fonseca minister as well as conservative cabinet headed by joao mauricio wanderley decided not to penalize colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention however cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views in consequence of this policy subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors thus undermining both military and political authority including that of cabinet itself at beginning of 1888 a drunken officer was arrested by police for causing disturbance in street several officers including deodoro were outraged by arrest and insisted that chief of police be dismissed wanderley who was still heading cabinet refused to bow to this demand but princess isabel acting regent on behalf of her father who was in europe instead opted to dismiss entire cabinet and support so called undisciplined military faction her motive was to use this incident as a pretext to replace wanderley who was openly against abolition of slavery an issue before parliament at time although she gained a new cabinet composed of politicians who supported end of slavery isabel s decision held unintended and dire consequences for monarchy instead of placating an unruly military faction it only opened way for more audacious demands and more widespread insubordination while exposing weakness of civilian power several officers began to openly conspire against government expecting that in a republic they would no longer be exposed to harassment which they believed they were suffering under monarchy one of them floriano peixoto advocated adoption of a military dictatorship another important influence which appeared during 1880s was dissemination of positivism among army s lower and medium officer ranks as well as among some civilians brazilian positivists believed that a republic was superior to monarchy however they also saw representative democracy and freedom of speech as threats they also opposed religions especially catholicism though excepting positivism itself they advocated establishment of a dictatorship with a dictator for life who would name his own successor along with a strong centralized government and incorporation of proletariat into society through end of bourgeois privileges positivism shared many features with later bolshevism marxism and leninism however and remarkably positivists wanted pedro ii to assume first dictatorship and hoped to use him to smooth transition from monarchy towards their new republic one of most influential positivists in brazil was lieutenant colonel benjamim constant a professor in military academy although admired to point of veneration by young cadets he was completely unknown to public constant and other positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology gradually consigned to background of academy s curriculum were military exercises and military studies of antoine henri jomini and colmar freiherr von der goltz replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from auguste comte and pierre lafitte cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators even so positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and constant who had also taught emperor s grandsons met with pedro ii and tried to convince him join their cause unsurprisingly given pedro ii s character this proposal was steadfastly refused and constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d etat as a result a coalition between undisciplined army faction headed by deodoro and positivist faction headed by constant was formed and directly led to 15 november 1889 republican coup according to one of seditious leaders only around 20 of brazilian army participated in or actively supported monarchy s fall third trip to europe and end of slavery in brazil emperor s health had considerably worsened by 1887 and fever attacks had become common his personal doctors suggested a trip to europe for medical treatment when embarking he was greeted by a crowd which cried out long live his majesty emperor of brazil he left on 30 june 1887 along with his wife and his grandson pedro augusto once more his daughter isabel became regent in his place he remained for a short time in portugal and traveled on to paris where he stayed in grand hotel as usual there he received louis pasteur ambroise

germany and leopold ii of belgium he also visited tomb of his daughter leopoldina in coburg he returned to paris on 8 october 1887 and met his sisters and francisca from there he traveled to italy where he was invited by king of italy to a dinner along with victoria of united kingdom and natalija obrenovic queen of serbia in florence he unveiled painting independence or death by brazilian painter pedro americo in presence of british queen serbian queen and charles i king of wurttemberg in milan he met with cesare cantu there his health worsened on 3 may 1888 and he passed two weeks between life and death even being anointed doctor charcot came from paris to assist and administered caffeine by injection resulting in an improvement in emperor s health on 22 may he received news that slavery had been abolished in brazil by a law sanctioned by his daughter lying in bed with a weak voice and tears in his eyes he said great people great people pedro ii returned to brazil and disembarked in rio de janeiro on 22 august 1888 whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before from capital from provinces from everywhere arrived proofs of affection and veneration emotion from those who saw him disembark frail thin with bent body weak legs was one most profound cadets from military academy climbed sugarloaf mountain and placed a gigantic banner on which was written hail such popular enthusiasm directed toward emperor was not matched even by celebrations of his majority in 1840 in christie affair of 1864 upon his departure to rio grande do sul in 1865 or even after victory in paraguayan war in 1870 to judge from general manifestations of affection that emperor and empress had received on occasion of their arrival from europe in this winter of 1888 no political institution seemed to be so strong as monarchy in brazil even former slaves displayed loyalty towards monarchy and vehemently opposed republicans whom they called monarchy seemed to be at height of its popularity pedro ii had reached pinnacle of his prestige among brazilians fall last year 1889 seemed to have begun well for both monarchy and for brazil during a three month tour of northeast and north enthusiastic reception given count of eu demonstrated that monarchism remained powerful there in late july emperor traveled to minas gerais demonstrating both that he was still actively engaged and depth of support for monarch in province along with successful appearances made by eu and isabel in sao paulo parana santa catarina and rio grande do sul provinces from november 1884 to march 1885 there was every indication of broad backing for monarchy among brazilian population nation enjoyed great international prestige during final years of empire predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by abolition of slavery failed to materialize and 1888 coffee harvest was successful both of which boosted princess isabel s popularity jose do a leading abolitionist journalist an inveterate republican notable for his disrespect for imperial family not only renounced his former views but also took a leading role in organizing a black guard this was an association of former slaves dedicated to monarchy s defense and which also harassed republican meetings thumb left 220px alt looking down upon an assembly in a large vaulted cathedral with a figure sitting on a large canopied throne to left of an altar acclamation of princess isabel as regent in 1887 one of rare solemn events during last years of empire for almost a decade pedro ii had been sabotaging monarchy and his daughter s prospects of succession cabinet responsible for enacting law abolishing slavery suffered a vote of no confidence on 3 may 1889 and was forced to resign pedro ii called jose antonio saraiva to form a new cabinet saraiva a highly pragmatic politician cared neither for monarchy nor republic so long as he held power he frankly warned emperor that isabel had little chance of reigning as empress and that government itself should take an active role in facilitating a peaceful transition to a republic emperor accepted this proposal without bothering to inform his daughter and heiress pedro ii s behavior in this meeting revealed how little commitment he had to monarchy he gave little consideration to his daughter s opinion or that of brazilian people who overwhelmingly supported imperial system reason unknown to but a very few was that pedro ii was very sympathetic towards idea of a republican system through action and inaction consciously and unconsciously he had been sabotaging both monarchy and prospects of his daughter s future reign for nearly a decade a quite astonished historian heitor lyra remarked was he not head of brazilian monarchy it would be said that he had been allied with republic s advertisers saraiva however changed his mind and declined office pedro ii instead appointed afonso celso de assis viscount of ouro preto in his place unlike saraiva ouro preto was a staunch monarchist who was determined to save regime at any cost his program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining an item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address military indiscipline and urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over corps this would prove to be a fatal mistake among reforms proposed were expanding of voting rights by abolishing income requisite end of lifelong senate tenures and most important of all increased decentralization which would turn country into a full federation by allowing election of town mayors and provincial presidents governors end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political economic and social power in country republican faction also attracted others disaffected by liberation of slaves which they regarded as confiscation of their personal property traditionalist to core long backbone of monarchism they viewed regent s action as grossest betrayal of their long loyalty what attracted planters to republicanism beside its opposition to monarchy was movement s promise of indemnification for lost slaves republicanism for this group was less a creed than a weapon to avert a republican backlash ouro preto exploited ready credit available to brazil as a result of its prosperity he made available massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors to curry favor with influential political figures who had become disaffected he also indirectly began to address problem of recalcitrant military by revitalizing moribund national guard by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper as count of a noted politician remarked i call your attention especially to reorganization of national guard in order to possess this force with which in past times government suppressed military revolts if we had had national guard reorganized and other ignorant military men would have been quiet pedro ii also asked salvador mendonca who was leaving to u s to represent brazil at first international conference of american states to carefully study u s supreme court with goal of creating a similar tribunal in brazil and transferring his constitutional prerogatives to it this would have made monarch a mere figurehead it is not known if he intended to constrain his daughter s powers as empress and make her thus more palatable to politicians or whether he had something else in mind reforms proposed by government alarmed republican and seditious factions in military corps republicans saw that ouro preto s plans would undercut support for their own aims and were emboldened to further action reorganization of national guard was begun by cabinet in august 1889 and creation of a rival militia caused dissidents among officer corps to consider desperate steps for both groups republicans and military it had become a case of now or never although there was no desire in brazil among majority of population to change form of government republicans began pressuring rebellious faction to overthrow monarchy on 9 november 1889 a large number of officers gathered in military club and decided to stage a coup d etat aimed at overthrow of monarchy two days later in house of rui barbosa a plan to execute coup was drawn up by officers who included benjamin constant and marshal deodoro da fonseca plus two civilians quintino and aristides lobo it was only significant meeting in which civilian republicans participated as deodoro wished to exclude them from what he considered to be a strictly military matter deodoro still hesitated i wanted to follow emperor s coffin who is old and whom i deeply respect but he eventually yielded to pressure he benjamin constant wants it thus let us make republic benjamin and i will take care of military action mr quintino and his friends will organize everything else republican coup at 11 p m on 14 november deodoro took command of 600 men majority of whom either had no idea of what was occurring or believed that they were organizing a defence against national guard or black guard a few republicans yelled hail to republic but deodoro ordered them to be silent thumb 220px alt

adjutant general commander of army field marshal floriano peixoto guaranteed his men s loyalty to ouro preto but he was secretly in alliance with rebels floriano and minister of war rufino viscount of a cousin of deodoro ignored repeated orders from ouro preto to attack rebels who were approaching headquarters he tried to convince them recalling acts of bravery by brazilian military in paraguayan war but floriano replied to him that in front of us there were enemies and here we are all brazilians which finally brought him to a realization of how far mutiny had spread among officer corps ostensibly loyal troops opened headquarters gates to deodoro who cried out long live his majesty emperor he met with ouro preto and undertook to personally present emperor with a list of names of those to be included in a new cabinet to disillusionment of civilian and military republicans deodoro did not proclaim a republic and it seemed that he would only topple cabinet he was unsure whether he wanted to act against pedro ii and rebels themselves did not believe coup would succeed few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion and according to republican

of 45th anniversary of his sister maria ii s death monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to rio de janeiro his wife expressed concern but he told her on what ma am when i arrive
