gerard kitchen o neill february 6 1927 april 27 1992 was an american physicist and space activist as a faculty member of princeton university he invented a device called particle storage ring for high energy physics experiments later he invented a magnetic launcher called mass driver in 1970s he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space including a space habitat design known as o neill cylinder he founded space studies institute an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization o neill began researching high energy particle physics at princeton in 1954 after he received his doctorate from cornell university two years later he published his theory for a particle storage ring this invention allowed particle accelerators at much higher energies than had previously been possible in 1965 at stanford university he performed first colliding beam physics experiment while teaching physics at princeton o neill became interested in possibility that humans could survive and live in outer space he researched and proposed a futuristic idea for human settlement in space o neill cylinder in colonization of space his first paper on subject he held a conference on space manufacturing at princeton in 1975 many who became post apollo era space activists attended o neill built his first mass driver prototype with professor henry kolm in 1976 he considered mass drivers critical for extracting mineral resources of moon and asteroids his award winning book high frontier human colonies in space inspired a generation of space exploration advocates he died of leukemia in 1992 birth education and family life o neill was born in brooklyn new york on february 6 1927 to edward gerard o neill a lawyer and dorothy lewis o neill nee kitchen gerard k o neill notable scientists from 1900 to present gerard k itchen o neill contemporary authors online he had no siblings his family moved to speculator new york when his father temporarily retired for health reasons for high school o neill attended newburgh free academy in newburgh new york while he was a student there he edited school newspaper and took a job as a news broadcaster at a local radio station he graduated in 1944 during world war ii and enlisted in united states navy on his 17th birthday navy trained him as a radar technician which sparked his interest in science after he was honorably discharged in 1946 o neill studied physics and mathematics at swarthmore college as a child he had discussed possibilities of humans in space with his parents and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations however he did not see space science as an option for a career path in physics choosing instead to pursue high energy physics he graduated with phi beta kappa honors in 1950 o neill performed his graduate studies at cornell university with help of an atomic energy commission fellowship and was awarded a ph d in physics in 1954 o neill married sylvia turlington also a swarthmore graduate in june 1950 sylvia turlington wed at her home new york times they had a son roger and two daughters janet and eleanor before their marriage ended in divorce in 1966 one of o neill s favorite activities was flying he held instrument certifications in both powered and sailplane flight and held fai diamond badge a gliding award o neill high frontier 1977 back matter during his first cross country glider flight in april 1973 he was assisted on ground by renate tasha steffen he had met tasha who was 21 years younger than him previously through ymca international club they were married day after his flight they had a son edward o neill town topics princeton local newspaper high energy physics research after graduating from cornell o neill accepted a position as an instructor at princeton university there he started his research into high energy particle physics in 1956 his second year of teaching he published a two page article that theorized that particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored for a few seconds in a storage ring stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam this would increase energy of particle collision over previous method which directed beam at a fixed target his ideas were not immediately accepted by physics community o neill became an assistant professor at princeton in 1956 and was promoted to associate professor in 1959 he visited stanford university in 1957 to meet with professor wolfgang k h panofsky this resulted in a collaboration between princeton and stanford to build colliding beam experiment cbx with a us 800 000 grant from office of naval research construction on first particle storage rings began in 1958 at stanford high energy physics laboratory he figured out how to capture particles and by pumping air out to produce a vacuum store them long enough to experiment on them gerard k o neill notable scientists from 1900 to present cbx stored its first beam on march 28 1962 o neill became a full professor of physics in 1965 thumb two mile long stanford linear accelerator tunnel in collaboration with burton richter o neill performed first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965 in this experiment particle beams from stanford linear accelerator were collected in his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 mev at time this was highest energy involved in a particle collision results proved that charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 across o neill considered his device to be capable of only seconds of storage but by creating an even stronger vacuum others were able to increase this to hours in 1979 he with physicist david c cheng wrote graduate level textbook elementary particle physics an introduction he retired from teaching in 1985 but remained associated with princeton as professor emeritus until his death space colonization origin of idea 1969 thumb nasa envisioned an ambitious scientific exploration of moon o neill saw great potential in united states space program especially apollo missions he applied to astronaut corps after nasa opened it up to civilian scientists in 1966 later when asked why he wanted to go on moon missions he said to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic he was put through nasa s rigorous mental and physical examinations during this time he met brian o leary also a scientist astronaut candidate who became his good friend o neill high frontier 1977 p 243 o leary was selected for astronaut group 6 but o neill was not astronaut biographies former astronauts o neill became interested in idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at princeton university his students were growing cynical about benefits of science to humanity because of controversy surrounding vietnam war o neill high frontier 1977 p 233 to give them something relevant to study he began using examples from apollo program as applications of elementary physics o neill posed question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students is surface of a planet really right place for an expanding technological civilization his students research convinced him that answer was no thumb left bernal sphere an inside out planet o neill was inspired by papers written by his students he began to work out details of a program to build self supporting space habitats in free space among details was how to provide inhabitants of a space colony with an earth like environment his students had designed giant pressurized structures spun up to approximate earth gravity by centrifugal force with population of colony living on inner surface of a sphere or cylinder these structures resembled inside out planets he found that pairing counter rotating cylinders would eliminate need to spin them using rockets this configuration has since been known as o neill cylinder first paper 1970 1974 looking for an outlet for his ideas o neill wrote a paper titled colonization of space and for four years attempted to have it published he submitted it to several journals and magazines including scientific american and science only to have it rejected by reviewers during this time o neill gave lectures on space colonization at hampshire college princeton and other schools many students and staff attending lectures became enthusiastic about possibility of living in space another outlet for o neill to explore his ideas was with his children on walks in forest they speculated about life in a space colony his paper finally appeared in september 1974 issue of physics today in it he argued that building space colonies would solve several important problems thumb right diagram of lagrange points in earth moon system he explored possibilities of flying gliders inside a space colony finding that enormous volume could support atmospheric thermals o neill 1974 he calculated that humanity could expand on this man made frontier to 20 000 times its population o neill 1974 initial colonies would be built at earth moon and lagrange points o neill 1974 and are stable points in solar system where a spacecraft can maintain its position without expending energy paper was well received but many who would begin work on project had already been introduced to his ideas before it was even published paper received a few critical responses some questioned practicality of lifting tens of thousands of people into orbit and his estimates for production output of initial colonies o neill high frontier 1977 p 253 while he was waiting for his paper to be published o neill organized a small two day conference in may 1974 at princeton to discuss possibility of colonizing outer space conference titled first conference on space colonization was funded by stewart brand s point foundation and princeton university o neill high frontier 1977 p 249 among those who attended were eric drexler at time a freshman at mit scientist astronaut joe allen from astronaut group 6 freeman dyson and science reporter walter sullivan representatives from nasa also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on planned space shuttle o neill thought of attendees as a band of daring radicals sullivan s article on conference was published on front page of new york times on may 13 1974 as media coverage grew o neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space o neill high frontier 1977 pp 250 252 to stay in touch with them o neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress o neill high frontier 1977 p 252 a few months later he heard peter glaser speak about solar power satellites at nasa s goddard space flight center o neill realized that by building these satellites his space colonies could quickly recover cost of their construction o neill high frontier 1977 p 255 according to o neill profound difference between this and everything else done in space is potential of generating large amounts of new wealth nasa studies 1975 1977 o neill held a much larger conference following may titled princeton university conference on space manufacturing o neill high frontier 1977 p 256 at this conference more than two dozen speakers presented papers including keith and carolyn henson from tucson arizona space manufacturing facilities 1977 after conference carolyn henson arranged a meeting between o neill and arizona congressman morris udall udall wrote a letter of support which he asked hensons to publicize for o neill s work hensons included his letter in first issue of l 5 society newsletter sent to everyone on o neill s mailing list and those who had signed up at conference thumb left o neill testifying before senate subcommittee on january 19 1976 in june 1975 o neill led a ten week study of permanent space habitats at nasa ames during study he was called away to testify on july 23 to house subcommittee on space science and applications o neill high frontier 1977 p 282 on january 19 1976 he also appeared before senate subcommittee on aerospace technology and national needs in a presentation titled solar power from satellites he laid out his case for an apollo style program for building power plants in space o neill high frontier 1977 p 264 he returned to ames in june 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing ssi history in these studies nasa developed detailed plans to establish bases on moon where space suited workers would mine mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites o neill summer study notes 1977 private funding 1977 1978 although nasa was supporting his work with grants of up to 500 000 per year o neill became frustrated by bureaucracy and politics inherent in government funded research he thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies in 1977 o neill and his wife tasha founded space studies institute a non profit organization at princeton university gerard k o neill notable scientists from 1900 to present ssi received initial funding of almost 100 000 from private donors and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement ssi history thumb right kolm left and o neill center with mass driver one of ssi s first grants funded development of mass driver a device first proposed by o neill in 1974 about ssi mass drivers are based on coilgun design adapted to accelerate a non magnetic object one application o neill proposed for mass drivers was to throw baseball sized chunks of ore mined from surface of moon into space once in space ore could be used as raw material for building space colonies and solar power satellites he took a sabbatical from princeton to work on mass drivers at mit there he served as hunsaker visiting professor of aerospace during 1976 77 academic year at mit he henry h kolm and a group of student volunteers built their first mass driver prototype eight foot 2 5 m long prototype could apply 33 g 320 m s2 of acceleration to an object inserted into it with financial assistance from ssi later prototypes improved this to 1 800 g 18 000 m s2 enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet 160 m long could launch material off surface of moon opposition 1977 1985 in 1977 o neill saw peak of interest in space colonization along with publication of his first book high frontier he and his wife were flying between meetings interviews and hearings on october 9 cbs program 60 minutes ran a segment about space colonies later they aired responses from viewers which included one from senator william proxmire chairman of senate subcommittee responsible for nasa s budget his response was it s best argument yet for chopping nasa s funding to bone i say not a penny for this nutty fantasy he successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from budget in 1978 paul wrote for l 5 newsletter no one expects congress to commit us to o neill s concept of large scale space habitats people in nasa are almost paranoid about public relations aspects of idea when it became clear that a government funded colonization effort was politically impossible popular support for o neill s ideas started to evaporate other pressures on o neill s colonization plan were high cost of access to earth orbit and declining cost of energy building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during 1979 oil crisis when prices dropped in early 1980s funding for space solar power research dried up his plan had also been based on nasa s estimates for flight rate and launch cost of space shuttle numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic his 1977 book quoted a space shuttle launch cost of 10 million but in 1981 subsidized price given to commercial customers started at 38 million o neill high frontier 1977 p 134 a 1985 accounting of full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as 180 million per flight in 1982 dollars and later estimates as space shuttle program neared its end in 2011 were much higher yet o neill was appointed by united states president ronald reagan to national commission on space in 1985 commission led by former nasa administrator thomas paine proposed that government commit to opening inner solar system for human settlement within 50 years their report was released in may 1986 four months after space shuttle challenger broke up on ascent writing career thumb right o neill cylinders as illustrated in high frontier o neill s popular science book high frontier human colonies in space 1977 combined fictional accounts of space settlers with an explanation of his plan to build space colonies its publication established him as spokesman for space colonization movement it won phi beta kappa award in science that year and prompted swarthmore college to grant him an honorary doctorate phi beta kappa award in science winners high frontier has been translated into five languages and remained in print as of 2008 his 1981 book 2081 a hopeful view of human future was an exercise in futurology o neill narrated it as a visitor to earth from a space colony beyond pluto book explored effects of technologies he called drivers of change on coming century some technologies he described were space colonies solar power satellites anti aging drugs hydrogen propelled cars climate control and underground magnetic trains he left social structure of 1980s intact assuming that humanity would remain unchanged even as it expanded into solar system reviews of 2081 were mixed new york times reviewer john noble wilford found book imagination stirring but charles nicol thought technologies described were unacceptably far fetched in his book technology edge published in 1983 o neill wrote about economic competition with japan he argued that united states had to develop six industries to compete robotics genetic engineering magnetic flight family aircraft and space science he also thought that industrial development was suffering from short sighted executives self interested unions high taxes and poor education of americans according to reviewer henry weil o neill s detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated book from others on subject entrepreneurial efforts thumb design for satellite position determination system o neill founded geostar corporation to develop a satellite position determination system for which he was granted a patent in 1982 gerard k o neill notable scientists from 1900 to present system primarily intended to track aircraft was called radio determination satellite service rdss in april 1983 geostar applied to fcc for a license to broadcast from three satellites which would cover entire united states geostar launched 2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986 its transmitter package permanently failed two months later so geostar began tests of rdss by transmitting from other satellites with his health failing o neill became less involved with company at same time it started to run into trouble geostar corporation records 1983 1991 in february 1991 geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to motorola for iridium satellite constellation project satellite news 1991 although system was eventually replaced by gps o neill made significant advances in field of position determination o neill founded o neill communications in princeton in 1986 he introduced his local area wireless networking or lawn system at pc expo in new york in 1989 lawn system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred feet at a cost of about 500 per node o neill communications went out of business in 1993 lawn technology was sold to omnispread communications as of 2008 omnispread continued to sell a variant of o neill s lawn system keystone press release 2006 p 4 on november 18 1991 o neill filed a patent application for a system he called company he wanted to form vse international for velocity silence and efficiency however concept itself he called magnetic flight vehicles instead of running on a pair of tracks would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube permanent magnets in track with variable magnets on vehicle and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels he estimated trains could reach speeds of up to 2 500 mph 4 000 km h about five times faster than a jet airliner if air was evacuated from tunnels to obtain such speeds vehicle would accelerate for first half of trip and then decelerate for second half of trip acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one half of force of gravity o neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted death and legacy

magplane technology in 1990s to develop magnetic transportation technology that o neill had written about in 2007 magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in florida system ran at a speed of 40 mph 65 km h far slower than high speed trains o neill envisioned mti principals all three of founders of space frontier foundation an organization dedicated to opening space frontier to human settlement were supporters of o neill s ideas and had worked with him in various capacities at space studies institute one of them rick tumlinson describes three men as models for space advocacy wernher von braun gerard k o neill and carl sagan von braun pushed for projects that ordinary people can be proud of but not participate in sagan wanted to explore universe
