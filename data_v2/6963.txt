speaking cultures are barley fainites crosses kings and exe s in united kingdom pegs and nibs in new zealand and variants of barley in australia in united states terms based on time out have from 1950s onwards largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe s since late 1980s time out has been recorded in other english speaking cultures besides us examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on rules of game traditionally these terms are specific to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as pax in uk used primarily by children attending private schools to be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of children playing together most extensive study of use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists iona and peter opie in uk in their 1959 book lore and language of schoolchildren which mapped use of truce terms across england wales and scotland opies considered it most important word in a s vocabulary and one for which there was no adult equivalent there has been little recent research in uk but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms including some of those prevalent in late 1950s are still in general use studies conducted since 1970s in english speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in australia new zealand south africa and united states with a number of terms deriving from older terms used in uk but many not use of a truce term is usually accompanied by a gesture such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or raising of thumbs in us a t shape made with both hands representing time out has become prevalent and this gesture is also appearing in other countries use truce terms are recorded as having been used in following circumstances being out of breath having a stitch a shoelace being undone fear of clothes being damaged needing to go to lavatory checking time wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing it does not mean to surrender although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering truce terms are only used within a specific age group have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by age of 10 or 11 years however research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as 18th century vocabulary of children s games including truce terms is described by peter in dialects of england as being particularly rich in regional variation insofar as they are not based on official or television culture they are an example of subculture of young children which is transmitted by word of mouth united kingdom opie study opies conducted a study of use of truce terms throughout england scotland and wales in 1950s and published their results in a book called lore and language of schoolchildren they found truce terms varied according to geographical location with exception of pax in some places more than one term was current and often four or five were known although usually only one term predominated schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in surrounding countryside opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations most widely used were barley fainites kings crosses keys skinch cree and scribs barley was recorded by opies as prevailing term in east scotland and borders lake district north west england west midlands and in wales apart from south east of wales where cree prevailed there were many variations such as barley bay barley bees barlow or barrels use of as a truce term appears in 14th century poem sir and grene knight and tobias smollett s reprisal it is recorded in lexicographer john jamieson s 1808 etymological dictionary of scottish language as a term specifically used by children to demand truce a probable variation also appears in 1568 manuscript kirk of grene sometimes attributed to james i

predominated in london and throughout southern england apart from scribs and screams of east hampshire and extended north as far as olney in buckinghamshire variations included vainlights and notes and queries reported in 1870 that fains was in common use by london schoolboys faints appeared in an 1889 dictionary of slang and in 1891 according to philologist j r r tolkien term derives from medieval term fein i descended in turn from old french se feindre meaning to make excuses hang back or back out of battle he also proposes that this use of term throws light on line 529 of clerk s tale by chaucer that lordes mowe nat been lords orders cannot be treated with a fain i in other words declined another translation of anglo norman word feindre is pretend feign turn a blind eye to which is what more powerful child does whilst granting respite spoken english south of danelaw became from at least 11th century onwards characterised by a pronunciation known as southern voicing such as for frog or zummer for summer vainites or vains variants of fainites or fains are surviving examples of this on borders of danelaw to north of london other truce terms prevail within danelaw kings was recorded by opies as common in eastern england english dialect dictionary recorded much same in nineteenth century earliest recorded instance opies found was in sternberg s 1851 dialect of northamptonshire queens is recorded as used in kings area sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart game kings truce is found in thomas dekker s honest whore part one ii i which appeared in 1604 term is used in play to halt a quarrel crosses cruces creases and cree were found in a broad band across england from crosses in lincolnshire cruce or cruces from oxford through to gloucester creases in berkshire and cree in south wales and both sides of bristol channel there are some areas of or screws in essex and suffolk opies saw creases as a transitional word exes used around ipswich and norwich was thought to be a variant of crosses bars and sometimes were common in devon in an otherwise predominantly fainites area bar was used other side of bristol channel in swansea skinch or predominated in northumberland and durham another term first recorded in a nineteenth century dialect dictionary keys was found by opies to be prevailing term in western scotland and in a strip running through north west england in an otherwise predominantly barley area scribs or squibs an area from hampshire to west sussex and surrey other hampshire variants were screens screams creams and cribs finns was used in guernsey pax latin for peace was a group dialect word rather than a regional one as it was predominantly used in private schools and school stories many individual cities towns and rural districts had their own words not used elsewhere such as bees blobs denny locks peas peril nix truce snakes and twigs certainly term with crossed fingers of one hand was used in parts of east london in 1950s whereas vainlights was a truce term of same period in parts of surrey post opie studies a study undertaken in lincolnshire in 1974 confirmed opies findings however a later study undertaken in croydon surrey in 1988 found use of truce terms much less uniform croydon is firmly in fainites area on opies map but in 1988 fainites was only third most commonly used term most common terms were pax 30 jecs 25 fainites 20 and cross keys 2 jecs is a term not recorded by opies at all and there was some evidence that it derived from word injection fainites was known more than it was used and was reported by one teacher to be totally lacking in street credibility pax was no longer a group word as reported by opies other terms reported included pips force field and quits authors concluded that either opies had grossly oversimplified picture or things had radically changed in 30 years some seven to eight generations of primary school children they also noted that although some schools reported a marked preference for a particular term all schools reported at least some children using different terms concise scots language dictionary published in 1999 records use of keys as a truce term in fife south west and west central scotland australia according to researchers from national australian dictionary centre there is evidence that barley scotland and west of england barlies aberdeen and a few english towns bar swansea and bars devon are used in australia in australia terms are used regionally with victorians using barley new south welshmen using bar or bars and people of western australia using barlies new zealand a study undertaken between 1999 and 2001 in new zealand by lexicographers laurie and winifred bauer on traditional forms of play included truce terms terms they described in their study were regional and most common were pegs widespread twigs taranaki gates auckland tags nelson marlborough and nibs otago southland in wellington schools dominant term was fans recorded in new zealand before 1920 which authors state derives from fains or fain it as described by opies itself dating back to chaucerian times most widespread term was pegs derived from pax apparently unrecorded before world war ii this appears to have first changed to probably from being shouted out at length and then further mutated by virtue of broad new zealand accents to pegs bauers thought most likely hypothesis for use of this rather upper class term from uk was that it derived from books and stories about uk public schools similarly they thought nibs derived from nix possibly via originally from south africa though unknown to opies save for a very small area of nicks possibly from nicklas nix is also uk public school slang though not as a truce term and were recorded as having been described by a south african boy as prevalent in south africa and were thought by a south african linguist to have derived from an afrikaans term many of common truce terms recorded by bauers such as bags poison gates tags flicks are not listed by opies although they speculated that both bags and tags may derive from pax united states in a study undertaken by historians mary and herbert knapp in 1970s informants remembering terms from 1930s reported kings x and kings use of kings x before 1930s is well recorded 1985 edition of dictionary of american regional english records historical use of kings ex kings sax kings cruse kings excuse and kings chiefly west of mississippi river gulf states and ohio valley earliest recorded use cited in dictionary is of kings cruse in 1778 during an adult fight scholarly speculation in late nineteenth century postulated that kings x derived from kings truce rendered as kings cruse and then kings excuse becoming kings x as a shortened form dictionary of american regional english cites opies as a source for derivation of terms and states that exes probably refers to use of crossed fingers an important part of demand for a truce rather than deriving from excuse as originally thought however knapps state that although opies do not record kings x as such in uk they do record kings crosses exes cruse and truce they conclude that kings x derived from users of kings and exes settling in same areas of us terms were then combined and shortened kings cruse once popular in us might be accounted for in a similar manner barley has been recorded as a truce term in ohio wisconsin and virginia knapps study in monroe county indiana found time out and times to be by far most prevalent terms in 1970s variations included i ve got times and time very few children reported more traditional kings queens or i ve got kings x authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of us and in american schools abroad to be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of children playing together time out clearly derives from use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into language with popularization of organized or timed sports and with advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television historically earliest reports for use of time out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936 however only a small number of respondents reported anything other than time out and its derivatives in use during 1960s few alternatives included pax safe base or home base and freeze with one small area of fins mount vernon knapps reported that time out had since 1950s supplanted kings ex as most popular truce term use of times rather than time out and i ve got times rather than i call time appears to have been influenced by older forms such as kings and i ve got kings x there was also one report of times x similarly derivatives of time out are often accompanied by traditional crossed fingers france in france children use word pouce as equivalent of english pax and american time out literal translation of pouce is thumb or big toe lu is or was a common truce term in chateauroux central france in fifties and sixties gestures right thumb in scotland and france children hold up one or both thumbs opies found that in england and wales children usually held up crossed fingers sometimes crossing fingers of both hands was required and occasionally feet as well opies found one area headington where sitting cross legged was required at lydney children could raise their right hand palm forward whilst in bradford on avon hand was held up with three fingers extended in some parts of scotland custom was to put up one s thumbs sometimes licking them first this also occurred in a few places in lancashire anecdotally raising of a thumb may also accompany use of pouce in france 1988 croydon study found a variety of gestures in common use these were crossed fingers of one hand 44 crossed fingers of both hands 26 thumbs through fingers 6 boys only and arms crossed across chest 2 other gestures reported in ones and twos included miming an injection into arm licking thumb making a t shape with hands three fingers held up and vulcan sign from star trek virtually all schools reported use of crossed fingers holding up of one hand with middle and index fingers crossed was usual gesture found in new zealand in 1999 2001 t shape was also used when saying time out time out gesture is made with two hands one hand held horizontally palm down other hand vertically with fingertips touching bottom of horizontal hand in us although more modern time out has largely supplanted traditional
