transylvania leading to a battle between dr garth and countess in an attempt by him to save janet ostensibly based on a short story titled dracula s guest by bram stoker film bears little or no resemblance to original source material david o selznick initially purchased rights to story for metro goldwyn mayer selznick likely knowing he could not legally make film because of universal s copyright on original film sold rights to universal after first assigning picture to james whale universal production head carl laemmle jr finally put hillyer in director s chair while not as successful as original upon its release film was generally well reviewed in intervening decades criticism has been deeply divided contemporary critics and scholars have noted film s strong lesbian overtones which universal acknowledged from start of production and exploited in some early advertising universal completed their initial dracula trilogy in 1943 with son of dracula plot dracula s daughter begins a few moments after dracula ends count dracula has just been destroyed by professor van helsing edward van sloan van helsing is arrested by two whitby policemen sergeant wilkes e e clive and constable albert billy bevan von helsing is sent by whitby police to scotland yard where he explains to sir basil humphrey gilbert emery that he indeed did destroy count dracula but because he had already been dead for over 500 years it cannot be considered murder instead of hiring a lawyer he enlists aid of a psychiatrist dr jeffrey garth otto kruger who was once one of his star students sergeant wilkes leaves whitby gaol to meet an officer from scotland yard at train station meanwhile dracula s daughter countess marya zaleska gloria holden enters gaol and mesmerizes albert

victims with her exotic jeweled ring after a chance meeting with dr garth at a society party countess asks him to help her overcome influence she feels from beyond grave doctor advises her to defeat

to paint he sees a pretty young woman lili nan grey and follows her onto a bridge woman pauses at railing looking despondent sandor promises her food warmth and money she hesitates but sandor explains that he seeks her for his mistress lili returns with sandor countess zaleska initially resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her lili survives attack and is examined by dr garth through hypnosis

walton as dr uncredited production thumb edward van sloan as von helsing universal originally did not hold rights to dracula s guest a chapter excised from bram stoker s original novel and purported source material for film metro goldwyn mayer executive david o selznick negotiated a contract in 1933 with stoker s widow florence to buy rights to chapter for an advance of 500 against a purchase price of 5 000 mgm s lawyers and executives were worried about use of word dracula in film s title fearing that universal would take legal action although selznick s contract with stoker explicitly listed dracula s daughter as a possible alternative title project was code named tarantula in correspondence selznick hired john l balderston who had previously worked on 1931 dracula and frankenstein to write screenplay balderston s screenplay involved tying up loose ends from original film in it von helsing returns to transylvania to destroy three vampire brides seen in dracula but overlooks a fourth tomb concealing dracula s daughter she follows him back to london and operates under name countess she attacks a young aristocrat and von helsing and aristocrat s fiancee track her back to transylvania and destroy her script included scenes that implied that dracula s daughter enjoyed torturing her male victims and that while under her control men liked it too also included were shots of countess s chambers being stocked with whips and straps which she would never use on screen but whose uses audience could imagine regardless of any objections that production code administration pca would have raised to many aspects of scenario balderston s script could never have been filmed because selznick s contract with stoker expressly barred him from using any bram stoker characters that did not appear in dracula s guest selznick re sold rights to dracula s guest to universal in september pp 196 98 for 12 500 which included rights to balderston s scenario curtis p 260 horror film scholar david j skal theorizes that this was selznick s actual motivation in buying rights in first place to profit from universal s desire for a sequel by tying up only obvious source material skal p 196 director universal studio head carl laemmle jr nicknamed junior wanted james whale fresh from his great success with bride of frankenstein to direct dracula s daughter whale was idle waiting for irene dunne to finish work on magnificent obsession so she could begin work on whale s show boat wary of directing two horror films in a row whale instead convinced laemmle to buy rights to a mystery novel called hangover murders laemmle agreed only after extracting a promise from whale that he would direct dracula s daughter next curtis pp 254 55 whale completed work on film titled remember last night for release on september 14 1935 curtis p 258 magnificent obsession completed filming on october 29 with dunne freed up whale went to work on show boat laemmle replaced him with a edward sutherland who was best known for his work on comedies sutherland had as little interest in dracula s daughter as whale and soon left studio curtis pp 260 61 and hillyer came on to direct universal script earliest scenario for universal film was written by r c sherriff it began with three scenes set in 14th century and centered on dracula legend it then switched to present day focusing on two engaged couples who visit transylvania men explore ruins of dracula s castle one is later found insane and other goes missing professor von helsing is summoned and he tracks missing man to london where he is in thrall to dracula s daughter countess sic when she attempts to flee with her thrall to orient by ship von helsing and three others book passage on same ship during a violent storm von helsing destroys dracula s daughter and with her hold over men broken scenario closes with a double wedding this version was submitted on august 28 1935 to british board of film censors which rejected it saying in part dracula s daughter would require half a dozen languages to adequately express its beastliness on september 10 sherriff met with bbfc representatives and submitted a revised scenario two days later this scenario was passed but because its details were not recorded by bbfc it is unknown how much it differed from original or how much if any of that scenario was retained in final script robertson pp 65 66 universal also submitted sheriff s first draft to pca on september 5 1935 and encountered stronger resistance from pca enforcer joseph breen than it had from british breen reported back that script contains countless offensive stuff which makes picture utterly impossible for approval under production code breen quoted in skal p 198 a second draft was submitted on october 21 but it too was rejected with many of breen s objections centering on 14th century scenes in which dracula himself appeared it is unclear whether this submission was same submission that bbfc had previously passed a third sheriff draft was submitted three days later and sherriff s fourth and final draft on november 10 all remained unacceptable and whale biographer james curtis suggests that whale who had no interest in project and feared that his commitment to it might cost him control over filming of show boat encouraged sherriff to submit ever more wildly unacceptable versions in hopes of getting himself off film on january 14 1936 producer e m asher advised breen that sherriff script was not going to be used and that a new script would be put together from scratch screenwriting duties were assigned to garrett fort skal pp 198 99 casting thumb right gloria holden thumb right dracula s daughter was gloria holden s first starring role and reportedly she was extremely displeased at having been assigned it like many actors holden looked down on horror films she had also seen bela lugosi struggle over years since dracula was made to free himself from typecasting and feared that role would lead to same fate for her critic mark clark believes that ironically it may have been holden s disgust for role that led to quality of her performance her disdain for part translates into a kind of self loathing that perfectly suits her troubled character clark p 184 initially lugosi and jane wyatt were set to star in film universal also announced that boris karloff and colin clive who had starred together in frankenstein and bride of frankenstein would appear rhodes p 219 and that cesar romero would play dr garth mank p 365 according to hollywood reporter universal had sought herbert marshall for role of sandor before casting pichel none of them appeared except after a fashion lugosi in form of a wax bust molded in his image for use in dracula s coffin some sources report that lugosi was paid as much as 4 000 for his abortive involvement but only confirmed record of any financial arrangement is a letter in which lugosi consents to use of his likeness at no cost to create wax bust shooting thumb right theatrical poster shooting on dracula s daughter began on february 4 1936 rushed into production before fort had completed script mank p 356 because of a deadline clause in universal s option of property from selznick skal p 199 script was not finalized until shooting had been underway for three weeks film was completed on march 10 mank p 358 despite studio orders that film be shot on a seven day per week schedule filming ran seven days over its schedule and 50 000 over budget with final cost of film tallied at 278 380 senn p 361 dracula s daughter was last in first cycle of universal horror films that reached back into 1920s publicly universal said it was because a british ban on horror films would cut too deeply into revenue such films could generate johnson p 7 in truth cycle was suspended because just before filming on dracula s daughter had wrapped laemmle family had lost control of universal because of cost overruns on a number of pictures junior laemmle was forced to borrow 1 000 000 on november 1 1935 money came from j cheever head of standard capital corporation and from charles r rogers when loan was called in march of following year universal was unable to repay it standard assumed control of studio on march 4 and rogers replaced junior as head of production rogers did not like horror films and he shut down production on them following release of dracula s daughter to focus on fare like deanna durbin musicals johnson p 129 universal would not return to horror genre for three years when it released son of frankenstein in 1939 other production aspects makeup artist jack pierce and special effects supervisor john p fulton worked together closely especially on holden s make up design they combined special lighting with a greyish green make up for holden s final scenes creating a pallor that contrasted with more normally flesh toned make ups of others in scene new york times vampires monsters horrors march 1 1936 quoted in white pp 147 48 heinz roemheld composed p 357 and albert s d agostino redressed charles d hall s set of dracula s castle and created new sets including a london bridge moor where dracula s body is burned and countess zaleska s apartment bansak et al p 113 reception and influence new york times gave dracula s daughter a solid albeit somewhat tongue in cheek review upon its release citing film s blood curdling events and noting that gloria holden is a remarkably convincing bat woman in concluding that film is both quite terrifying and a cute little horror picture variety also praised production and holden s performance in particular clark p 188 despite critical approval dracula s daughter did not have same box office success as original later reviews of dracula s daughter are sharply split entertainment weekly reviewing film following its video release called it one of most satisfying vampire pictures ever made describing director hillyer s visuals as lush evocative and suffused with just right gothic chiaroscuro and noting that gloria holden as reluctant vampire protagonist absolutely drips patrician eroticism ew concludes that this film is better than lugosi s original dracula ryan cracknell of apollo movie guide while echoing praise for holden s performance nonetheless found that film doesn t hold up so well today citing what he sees as slow pacing and long bouts of over top dialogue cracknell compares film to reading a textbook not most exciting thing in world but it does provide insights into and perspectives on foundation of early horror movies and how many similarities carry over into movies half a century and more later michael w phillips jr concurs calling film a marked improvement on original film but still a bit of a snooze relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright phillips again praises holden s performance and also pichel s portrayal of sandor but finds rest of cast weak horror author anne rice has named dracula s daughter as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction hoppenstand et al p 14 she named a bar in her novel queen of damned dracula s daughter in honor of film author ramsey campbell under pseudonym carl wrote a novelization of film also entitled dracula s daughter that was published in 1977 melton p 791 a juvenile fiction version written by carl r green william r sanford and howard schroeder was published in 1985 some observers have suggested that film served as an inspiration for sunset blvd noting similarities between outlines of each film keesey p 82 michael s 1994 film nadja has been described as an unofficial remake of dracula s daughter abbott p 145 full story of making of movie plus script and pressbook are featured in book scripts from crypt dracula s daughter bearmanor 2017 by gary d rhodes tom weaver et al lesbian implications right thumb save women of london from dracula s daughter countess zaleska seduces lili thumb right nan gray lesbian vampire has been a trend in literature dating back to joseph sheridan le fanu s 1872 novella carmilla dracula s daughter marked first time that trend was incorporated into a film tudor p 31 lesbian implications of dracula s daughter were obvious from start and were of great concern to production code administration pca head breen took special notice of scene between countess and her model lili writing this will need very careful handling to avoid any questionable flavor breen quoted in worland p 126 day before scene was to be shot universal s harry zehner asked breen to read a draft of scene in response breen wrote present suggestion that lili poses in nude will be changed she will be posing her neck and shoulders and there will be no suggestion that she undresses and there will be no exposure of her person it was also stated that present incomplete sequence will be followed by a scene in which lili is taken to a hospital and there it will be definitely established that she has been attacked by a vampire whole sequence will be treated in such a way as to avoid any suggestion of perverse sexual desire on part of marya or of an attempted sexual attack by her upon lili gay film historian vito russo noted in his book celluloid closet that universal highlighted countess zaleska s attraction to women in some of its original advertising for film using tag line save women of london from dracula s daughter he further cited countess zaleska as an example of presentation of essence of homosexuality as a predatory weakness russo p 48 some reviewers of day picked up on and condemned lesbian content including new york world telegram which noted countess s tendency to wander around giving eye to sweet young girls quoted in russo p 48 other reviews missed it entirely including aforementioned new york times which advised be sure to bring kiddies entertainment weekly describes encounter between countess and lili as so hot it s impossible to imagine how it ever got past 30s censors whereas time out london finds only a subtle suggestion of lesbianism horror scholar skal notes that scene has come to be seen as a classic lesbian sequence although of a decidedly negative stripe skal p 200 scene between countess zaleska and lili was included in 1995 documentary film adaptation of russo s book another lesbian tinged scene which has received less critical attention comes when countess is holding janet captive described as longest kiss never filmed countess zaleska hovers lovingly over janet hovers and hovers slowly descending to kiss recumbent janet hanson pp 198 99 until interrupted by arrival of dr garth bright lights film journal after noting that gloria holden in title role almost singlehandedly redefined 20s movie vamp as an impressive euro butch dyke bloodsucker draws an implicit comparison between countess zaleska s seeking to cure her vampirism through psychiatry and former position of mainstream psychiatry of homosexuality as a mental illness a view still held by a minority in profession zaleska s cruising streets of london is seen as parallel to cruising for sex although that tends to be a gay male activity and as suggesting society s image of lesbian as soulless predator but conclusion is that holden s striking face and haunting luminous eyes are intoxicating essence of transgressive lesbian power see also vampire films references citations bibliography bansak edmund g and robert wise 2003 fearing dark val lewton career mcfarland brunas michael john brunas tom weaver
