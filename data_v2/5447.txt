minogue s eighth studio album fever and it was released on 8 september 2001 by parlophone in australia while in united kingdom and other european countries it was released on 17 september can t get you out of my head was jointly written composed and produced by cathy dennis and rob davis dennis and davis had been brought together by british artist manager simon fuller who wanted duo to come up with a song for british pop group s club 7 song was recorded using cubase music software which davis ran on his mac computer davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop on which dennis herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in united states began singing line i just can t get you out of my head in key of d minor after three and a half hours demo was recorded and vocals were laid afterwards dennis called their recording setup for song most primitive set up you could imagine different producers work in different ways but it s good to be reminded you don t have to be reliant on equipment a song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you she also regarded their production as a very natural and fluid process saying we know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces but this was easiest process chemicals were all happy and working together but after fuller heard demo he felt it was wrong for s club 7 and rejected it english singer songwriter sophie ellis bextor also turned down offer to record it davis then met with minogue s a r executive jamie nelson after hearing demo cassette of song nelson booked it for minogue to record later that year nelson was impressed by vibe of song and felt it would please although davis was initially under impression that recording deal would be called off later minogue became enthusiastic to record song after hearing 20 seconds of demo whole song including minogue s vocals were recorded at davis s home studio in surrey music excluding guitar part was programmed using korg triton workstation via midi dennis later remarked even though kylie wasn t first artist to be offered song i don t believe it was meant to go to anyone other than kylie and i don t believe anyone else would have done incredible job she did with it with video looking super hot composition can t get you out of my head is a midtempo dance pop song combining synth pop and neo disco which has a tempo of 126 beats per minute according to sheet music published at musicnotes com by emi music publishing minogue s vocal range spans from c4 to d5 minogue chants a la la la hook in song which is often heralded as its most appealing part bbc radio 2 noted that composition of song is deceptively simple but its veins run with whole history of electronic music they described song s bassline as pulsing and recognised influences of english rock band new order and german electronic music band kraftwerk song does not follow common verse chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous misplaced sections dennis reasoned that these sections somehow work together as she and davis didn t try to force any structure after event seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into something bigger than any of us likewise davis commented it breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes la s that is what confused my publisher fuller when he first heard it through lyrics of song its singer expresses an obsession with an anonymous figure dorian lynskey from guardian termed song a mystery as minogue never reveals identity of her object of infatuation critic suggested that person minogue is referring to is either a partner an evasive one night stand or someone who doesn t know she exists writing for same newspaper everett true identified a darker element in simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in minogue s restrained vocals further true emphasised that while minogue s 1987 single i should be so lucky had presented an optimistic romantic future can t get you out of my head focuses on an unhealthy and potentially destructive obsession he also noted that in former song minogue played wide eyed ingenue with alacrity but in latter song she is aware of harmful nature of her infatuation calling it a desire that is wholly dependent on her own self control in late 2012 can t get you out of my head was re recorded by minogue for inclusion in her orchestral compilation album abbey road sessions on album minogue reworked 16 of her past songs with an orchestra which according to nick levine from bbc music re imagine them without disco glitz and vocal effects abbey road sessions version of can t get you out of my head features a more dramatic fully fleshed out musical arrangement and follows a pizzicato playing technique in which strings of a string instrument are continuously plucked critical reception thumbnail upright left minogue performing can t get you out of

funky certainly something that couldn t miss anywhere dominique leone from pitchfork media praised commercial prospect of song saying that it exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first jim farber from entertainment weekly said that song fully lives up to its title with every sound a hook and compared it to works of andrea true michael hubbard from musicomh labelled song one of 2001 s best singles saying that it predictably beat off lesser competition in 2012 guardian critic everett true defined can t get you out of my head as one of those rare moments in pop sleek and chic and stylish and danceable but with a darker element hidden in plain sight billboards jason lipshutz felt that metallic production wouldn t carry quite as much of its impact if minogue had attempted to outshine it wisely her voice operates alongside it finding renewed power in its drive concluding that almost 15 years after its release it still sounds fresh forward thinking and alive abbey road sessions version of song received generally positive reviews tim sendra from allmusic felt that most interesting reboot in album took place on can t get you out of my head saying that insistent strings push song along with a tightly coiled electricity that is impossible to resist he also picked song as a highlight on album sal cinquemani from slant magazine chose song as one of standouts on album saying that its arrangement compensate for lack of synthetic dance beats and vocal effects tania from aria charts described track as a powerful violin ballad with accompaniment of a large orchestra throughout remainder simon price from independent said that while original version of can t get you out of my head would be impossible to improve on reworked version turns it into a pizzicato thriller score jude rogers from quietus however felt that song does not respond well to this orchestral treatment louis from lgbt oriented website newnownext called it a pulsing march through most hypnotic beat of past 20 years kylie s american breakthrough still holds up as a cool streamlined dance floor magnet he ranked track on second position of his list of singer s 48 greatest songs in honor of her 48th birthday john russell from lgbt magazine queerty

figure and her proportionally large mouth attracted comments from various critics with british red top newspaper news of world speculating that singer could possibly be an alien later while discussing video shadforth and music critic paul morley took this bizarre suggestion into consideration to comment on minogue as a creative experimental artist shadforth blocked some shots of initial driving scene based upon similar shots of shirley manson piloting an airplane in her award winning dogfight clip for garbage s special video was released on 11 august 2001 it begins with minogue with dark brown hair driving a de tomaso mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge while singing la la la hook of song next scene consists of a number of dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in

routine on top of a building during night this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim various scenes in video show minogue s face unusually close to lens of camera thus it subtly distorts yet remains glamorous shadforth felt shot gave a sort of sense of intimacy and as you say a sort of strangeness again drawing upon suggestion of minogue being an alien similarly morley

my head with that of american singer beyonce s 2003 single baby boy railton and weston concluded that while both videos focus on two singers performing seductive dance routines minogue is presented in
