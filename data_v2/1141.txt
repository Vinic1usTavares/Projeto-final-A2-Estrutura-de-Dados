major part women were a major part of workforce with many unmarried women acting as farm servants and married women playing a part in all major agricultural tasks particularly during harvest widows

expansion of parish school system some women were taught reading domestic tasks but often not writing in noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from seventeenth century religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of established kirk women had very little legal status at beginning of period unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions from mid sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches seventy five per cent of an estimated 6 000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1 500 were executed as a result some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control
