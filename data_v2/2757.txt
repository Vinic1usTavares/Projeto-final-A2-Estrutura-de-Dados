a statement written in french a language washington did not read admitting that jumonville was assassinated this document and others were used by french and canadiens to level accusations that

ohio river in what is now western pennsylvania o meara pp 10 12 authorities in new france became more aggressive in their efforts to expel british traders and colonists from this area and in 1753 began construction of a series of fortifications in area o meara pp 15 19 french action drew attention of not just british but also indian tribes of area despite good franco indian relations british traders had become highly successful in convincing indians to trade with them in preference to canadiens and planned large scale advance was not well received by all o meara p 27 in particular tanacharison a mingo chief also known as half king became decidedly anti french as a consequence in a meeting with paul marin de la commander of french and canadien construction force latter reportedly lost his temper and shouted at indian chief i tell you down river i will go if river is blocked up i have forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me i despise all stupid things you have said he then threw down some wampum that tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture o meara p 28 marin died not long after and command of operations was turned over to jacques de saint pierre o meara pp 4 30 virginia royal governor robert dinwiddie sent militia major george washington to ohio country a territory that was claimed by several of british colonies

addressed to his commanding officer in canada and that he had no intention of leaving o meara pp 3 5 33 washington returned to williamsburg and informed governor dinwiddie that french refused to leave anderson p 45 dinwiddie commissioned washington a lieutenant colonel and ordered him to begin raising a militia regiment to hold forks of ohio a site washington had identified as a fine location for a fortress anderson pp 43 45 governor also issued a captain s commission to ohio company employee william trent with instructions to raise a small force and immediately begin construction of fort dinwiddie issued these instructions on his own authority without even asking for funding from virginia house of burgesses until after fact trent s company arrived on site in february 1754 and began construction of a storehouse and stockade with assistance of tanacharison and anderson p meara p 49 that same month a force of 800 canadien militia and french troupes de la marine departed montreal for ohio river valley under command of canadien claude pierre de contrecoeur who took over command from saint pierre eccles p 163 when contrecoeur learned of trent s activity he led a force of about 500 men troupes de la marine militia and indians to drive them off rumors reaching trent s men put its size at 1 000 on april 16 contrecoeur s force arrived at forks next day trent s force of 36 men led by ensign edward ward in trent s absence agreed to leave site o meara pp 50 51 french then began construction of fort they called fort duquesne anderson p 49 prelude in march 1754 governor dinwiddie ordered washington back to frontier with instructions to act on defensive but in case any attempts are made to obstruct works or interrupt our settlements by any persons whatsoever you are to restrain all such offenders in case of resistance to make prisoners of or kill destroy them anderson p 51 historian fred anderson describes dinwiddie s instructions which were issued without knowledge or direction of british government in london as an invitation to start a war washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along way by time he left for frontier on april 2 he had recruited fewer than 160 men anderson p 50 thumb upright portrait of george washington by charles willson peale 1772 along their march through forests of frontier washington was joined by more men at winchester lengel p 32 at this point he learned from captain trent of french advance trent also brought a message from tanacharison who promised warriors to assist british to keep tanacharison s support washington decided not to turn back choosing instead to advance he reached a place known as great meadows now in fayette county pennsylvania about south of forks began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions lengel p 33 contrecoeur operated under orders that forbade attacks by his force unless they were provoked on may 23 he sent joseph coulon de villiers de jumonville with 35 soldiers principally canadien recruits but also including french recruits and officers to see if washington had entered french territory and with a summons to order washington s troops out this summons was similar in nature to one washington had delivered to them four months earlier lengel p 34 on may 27 washington was informed by christopher gist a settler who had accompanied him on 1753 expedition that a canadien party numbering about 50 was in area in response washington sent 75 men with gist to find them lengel p 35 that evening washington received a message from tanacharison informing him that he had found canadien camp and that two of them should meet despite fact that he had just sent another group in pursuit of canadiens washington went with a detachment of 40 men to meet with tanacharison mingo leader had with him 12 warriors two of whom were boys after discussing matter two leaders agreed to make an attack on canadiens attackers took up positions behind rocks around canadien camp counting not more than 40 canadiens battle exactly what happened next has been a subject of controversy and debate few primary accounts of affair agree on a number of facts and disagree on others they agree that battle lasted about 15 minutes that jumonville was killed and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner anderson pp 53 58 according to canadian records most of dead were canadiens and caron from quebec city charles bois from pointe claire jerome from la prairie l enfant from montreal paris from mille isles languedoc and martin from and from trois rivieres nos racines l histoire des quebecois editions commemorative livre washington s accounts of battle exist in several versions they are consistent with each other but details are compressed according to historian fred anderson with intent to obscure post battle atrocities he wrote in his diary we were advanced pretty near to them when they discovered us whereupon i ordered my company to fire s company received whole fire of french during greatest part of action which only lasted a quarter of an hour before enemy was routed we killed mr de jumonville commander also nine others we wounded one and made twenty one prisoners anderson p 53 thumb 300px battle site in 2007 contrecoeur prepared an official report of action that was based on two sources most of it came from a canadien named monceau who escaped action but apparently did not witness jumonville s slaying contrecoeur s second source was an indian from tanacharison s camp who reported that mr de jumonville was killed by a musket shot in head whilst they were reading summons same indian claimed that indians then rushed in to prevent british from slaughtering frenchmen a third account was made by a private named john shaw who was in washington s regiment but not present at affair his account based on detailed accounts from others who were present was made in a sworn statement on august 21 details on tanacharison s role in affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on june 27 jennings p 69 in his account french were surrounded while some still slept alerted by a noise one of frenchmen shaw s narrative is substantially correct on a number of other details including size and composition of both forces shaw also claimed to have seen and counted dead numbering 13 or 14 anderson p 56 historian anderson documents a fourth account by a deserter from british indian camp named denis kaninguen anderson speculates that he was one of tanacharison s followers anderson p 57 his report to french commanders echoed that of shaw notwithstanding discharge of musket fire that washington had made upon him he washington intended to read summons and had withdrawn himself to his people whom he had previously ordered to fire upon french t hat tanacharison a savage came up to wounded jumonville and had said tu n es pas encore mort mon pere thou art not yet dead my father and struck several hatchet blows with which he killed him anderson notes that kaninguen apparently understood what tanacharison said and understood it to be a ritual slaying anderson p 58 kaninguen reported that 30 men were taken prisoner and 10 to 12 had been killed virginians suffered only one killed and two or three wounded fowler p 42 aftermath washington wrote a letter to his brother after battle in which he said i can with truth assure you i heard bullets whistle and believe me there was something charming in sound lengel p 39 following battle washington returned to great meadows and pushed onward construction of a fort which was called fort necessity dead were left on field or buried in shallow graves where they were later found by french lengel p 42 on june 28 1754 a combined force of 600 french canadien and indian soldiers under command of jumonville s brother louis coulon de villiers left fort duquesne lengel p 41 on july 3 they captured fort necessity in battle of great meadows forcing washington to negotiate a withdrawal under arms anderson pp 63 64 capitulation document washington signed which was written in french a language washington did not know how to read and which may have been poorly translated for him included language claiming that jumonville and his men were assassinated lengel p 44 escalation when news of two battles reached england in august government of duke of newcastle after several months of negotiations sent an army expedition following year to dislodge french fowler p 52 major general edward braddock was chosen to lead expedition lengel p 52 he was defeated at battle of monongahela and french remained in control of fort duquesne until 1758 when an expedition under general john forbes finally succeeded in taking fort fowler pp 159 163 thumb upright 1 5 a 1912 map showing route of braddock expedition word of british military plans leaked to france well before braddock s departure for north america and king louis xv dispatched a much larger body of troops to canada in 1755 fowler p 64 although they arrived too late to participate in braddock s defeat french troop presence led to a string of french victories in following years in a second british act of aggression admiral edward boscawen fired on french ship alcide in a naval action on june 8 1755 capturing her and two troop ships carrying some of those troops fowler pp 74 75 military matters escalated on both north american soil and at sea until france and britain declared war on each other in spring 1756 marking formal start of seven years war fowler p 98 propaganda and analysis because of inconsistent nature of record of action contemporary and historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one account over another francis parkman for example accepted washington s account and was highly dismissive of accounts by monceau and indian parkman p 154 french authorities assembled a dossier of documents to counter british accounts of affair entitled memoire contenant le precis des avec leurs pieces justificatives pour servir de reponse aux observations par les d angleterre dans les cours de l europe a copy was intercepted in 1756 translated and published as a memorial containing a summary view of facts with their authorities in answer to observations sent by english ministry to courts of europe dwight p 84 it used washington s capitulation statement and other documents including extracts of washington s journal taken at fort necessity to suggest that washington had actually ordered assassination of jumonville dwight p 85 but not all frenchmen agreed with story chevalier de levis called it a pretended assassination parkman p 156 french story contrasted with that of british account based on washington s report british suggested that jumonville rather than being engaged on a diplomatic mission was spying on them jumonville s orders included specific instructions to notify contrecoeur if summons was read so that additional forces might be sent if needed anderson p 59 historian fred anderson theorizes about reasons for tanacharison s action in killing and provides a possible explanation for why one of tanacharison s men reports event as a british killing of a frenchman tanacharison had lost influence over some of local tribes specifically delawares and may have thought that conflict between british and french would bring them back under his influence as allies of british anderson pp 56 57 according to parkman after indians scalped french they sent a scalp to delawares in essence offering them opportunity to take up hatchet with british and against french parkman p 155 legacy a portion of battlefield along with great meadows where fort necessity was
