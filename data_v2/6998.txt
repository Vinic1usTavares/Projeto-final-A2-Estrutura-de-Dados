megachile campanulae known as bellflower resin bee is a species of bee in family megachilidae described in 1903 these solitary bees are endemic to eastern north america studies in 2013 placed them among first insect species to use synthetic materials for making nests they are considered mason bees which is a common descriptor of bees in several families including megachilidae within genus megachile frequently also referred to as leafcutter bees m campanulae is a member of subgenus chelostomoides which do not construct nests from cut leaves but rather from plant resins and other materials females lay eggs in nests constructed with individual cell compartments for each egg once hatched eggs progress through larval stages and subsequently will overwinter as pupae bees are susceptible to parasitism from several other bee species which act as brood parasites they are medium sized bees and female adults are typically larger than males they are important pollinators of numerous native plant species throughout their range taxonomy and naming megachile campanulae was originally described in 1903 under name campanulae by charles robertson an american entomologist from illinois megachile translates from greek mega megas large kheil lip in latin campanulae translates as small bell m campanulae has been documented to frequent flowers in genus campanula several species of which are commonly referred to as subspecies include m campanulae campanulae and m campanulae wilmingtoni genus megachile is a cosmopolitan group of solitary bees often called leafcutter bees and resin bees it is one of largest genera of bees with 1520 species in 56 subgenera worldwide life cycle and behavior as a member of subgenus chelostomoides m campanulae are mason bees this means that they use plant resins mud and pebbles for nest construction typically females build small nests in pre existing holes in trees fences or plant stems they will also nest in artificial nest traps or bee blocks they build nests as a long single column of cells along a tube deepest cells are constructed first at which point female lays a single egg sequentially in each cell cells are partitioned and sealed using some combination of construction materials described above pollen sometimes mixed with nectar provisioned in cell will nourish larvae when hatched bees are polylectic meaning larvae are fed from a variety of pollen sources subsequently after a few stages of molting larvae spin cocoons and pupate they will overwinter as pupae after several months bees will emerge in adult form males typically emerge in advance of females they will die shortly after mating female bees survive for another few weeks during which time they build new nests and gather provisions adult bees are active from april to september throughout most of range in florida that have been collected as early as february and as late as november flight times are typically may october in cooler climates of their range thumb left resin bee larva and a plug from a resin bee nest solitary bees such as m campanulae do not form colonies while social insects ants yellow jackets honeybees work in colonies leafcutter and resin bees work independently building nests similar to honeybees female bees perform nearly all essential tasks of brood rearing m campanulae does not produce honey but does perform other important beneficial tasks pollinating crops and wild plants although they can produce a mild sting less intense than that from a honeybee they are considered nonaggressive bees in family megachilidae carry pollen on underside of their abdomen unlike honeybees they do not have pollen baskets on their hind legs most bees in genus are small to medium in size although m pluto at 38 mm is regarded as largest bee in world many bees in genus are referred to as leafcutters however mandibles of m campanulae lack cutting edges it belongs to subgenus chelostomoides which use mud or resins to build synthetic nest materials in wild m campanulae seal off their cells within nest with natural resins found in plants and trees in 2013 however researchers reported that bees had used synthetics including caulk to seal cells compositional analysis of these materials revealed calcium titanium and iron they resembled polyurethane based sealants typically used in building construction it is not uncommon for insects to live inside found objects made of plastic however these findings are first known of insects actually building nests with plastic with help from citizen scientists in toronto over 200 nest boxes were placed throughout city scanning electron microscopy x ray microanalysis and infrared microscopy were employed in identification of polymeric specimens researchers suggest bees behavior may be an example of adaptive behavior since some of bees were free of parasites these novel and possibly more robust methods of nest building may offer additional protection incorporation of plastic into walls and sealants of cell nests appeared to provide some protection against brood parasite invasion however use of these more readily available synthetic materials in an urban setting may be incidental in fact exposure of brood to polyurethane and polyethylene based plastics could be detrimental as canadian team noted since diffusion of moisture could be inhibited some of brood specimens were heavily affected by mold growth additionally synthetic materials in nest might hinder bees ability to move and breath toxin exposures and other effects of urbanization are well documented contributors towards pollinator decline in general distribution and habitat range of m campanulae covers a broad expanse of eastern north american continent they are native to southern ontario range extends from this southeastern canadian province through new england states to florida range extends west as far as minnesota nebraska and texas a few reports of sightings further west are noted including presence in colorado and montana morphology and identification thumb hymenoptera morphology m campanulae are medium sized bees anatomically they have a head a middle section called a mesosoma and a posterior section called a metasoma mesosoma is formed by fusion of first abdominal segment or propodeum with thorax they have both compound eyes and simple eyes ocelli similar to many other insects mandibles in these resin gathering bees are characteristically lacking cutting edges found in closely related leafcutters males are smaller than females body segments are covered in various aspects with fine short hair called pubescence hairs are of varying length texture and color on different aspects of male and female bees morphologically m campanulae most resemble megachile

campanulae megachile campanulae can be parasitized by a number of brood parasites including obscurus a wasp kleptoparasitic bee stelis louisae has been found in nests members of genus are also known parasites of megachile kleptoparasitic bees characteristically deposit their eggs in nests of other bees as this behavior is similar to that of cuckoo birds such bees are referred to as cuckoo bees these host parasite relationships are complex and relationships between m campanulae and other parasitic species may not be well described mold growth was shown to be problematic in toronto study particularly when synthetic materials were incorporated in nest construction is known to affect related species m rotundata human interaction left 140px thumb bee boxes provide nesting locations for m campanulae and other bees more focus is being directed on interactions between humans and native pollinators such as m campanulae these relationships are complex involving issues of habitat loss pesticides and toxin exposures climate change and other effects on environment species m campunulae pollinates of a wide array of flowers and crops significance of contributions from native pollinators is gaining increased attention in wake of declines in managed bee populations such declines have received substantial press especially in relation to colony collapse disorder in 2013 oregon congressman earl blumenauer introduced h r save america s pollinators act in addition an international pollinator initiative has been developed by food and agriculture of united nations working group a similar project north american pollinator protection campaign might more directly address issues specific to m on a smaller scale human behaviors adversely affecting populations of bees such as m campanulae can be mediated in other ways many native bee species can be managed with minimal equipment m campanulae will nest in simple bee boxes these are constructed in simplest form by drilling holes in a block of wood wood is attached to a post or wall ideally in an area receiving adequate sun holes of different diameter will be suited better for different bee species since native pollinators forage in an area within about of nest they can increase productivity of a small garden sparse literature has been devoted to effects of pesticides on m campunulae specifically however in general pesticide exposure is detrimental to native bee populations bees can be harmed by numerous classes of pesticides including insecticides fungicides herbicides rodenticides coumarins pollination
