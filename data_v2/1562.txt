korais and influential personality within greek community of vienna states this fact as well as that periodical had too few subscribers he therefore called on all readers to canvass for new

consisted of 16 pages written by korais and directed against his ideological adversary conservative scholar doukas on other hand gazis returned janssen p 4 in following years however periodical was subsidized by princes of moldavia and michael mackridge p 124 apart from difficulties faced 1816 was a turning point as two scholars and adherents of korais theoklitos farmakidis and konstantinos kokkinakis were placed in charge consequently hermes o logios actually became an outlet for korais and continued to appear without interruption until greek war of independence demaras p 199 outbreak of greek war of independence 1821 in 1821 year that war of independence broke out nine issues appeared between january and may there is a special appendix to issue of april 1 1821 containing a greek

logios is regarded as most important greek periodical of era of modern greek enlightenment also known as it appeared regularly over a period of ten and a half years and was longest running periodical prior to outbreak of revolution all volumes cover a total of 5131 pages with texts on various subjects written by 918 contributors janssen p 5 arts and sciences its primary goal was to inform greek speaking public within ottoman empire and in diaspora moreover in favouring views of adamantios korais it reflected style of other european periodicals of that era it reviewed developments in arts and sciences and was an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements to attention of ottoman ruled greeks additionally it reproduced catalogues of european scientific books and exhorted greek scholars to translate and publish them like those of louis jacques thenard journal also published comments on astronomical observations experiments and various articles on natural philosophy which alternated with articles on history and philosophy pappas karas p 7 greek scholars used as sources german or french educational books on physics or translated and published texts on natural philosophy with large circulations in europe like works of antoine rene just hauy and jerome lalande possible revolutionary background although hermes o logios was most important publication for transmission of progressive ideas to greek people which should ultimately lead to emancipation and independence there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution at least on surface there was austrian censure to be reckoned with as reactionary minister klemens von metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on activities of local greek community lack of items on politics polity law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution several editors were also members of patriotic organization filiki etaireia and staunch supporters of struggle for independence but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in subjects treated inside periodical even in last years on eve of greek war of independence in fields of philology sciences philanthropy etc nothing out of ordinary was published janssen p 11 on other hand there is no doubt that contributors of hermes o logios dreamed of liberation of greek nation and of an independent state janssen p 12 positions in greek language question in respect to greek language question it becomes obvious that from very beginning hermes o logios adhered to korais views korais claimed that appropriate language for greek nation should be a vernacular demotic language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincture of archaism on other hand some of korais opponents both conservatives and published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views references sources external links issues of hermes o logios
