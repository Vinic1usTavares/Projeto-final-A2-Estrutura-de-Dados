laconian war of 195 bc was fought between greek city state of sparta and a coalition composed of rome achaean league pergamum rhodes and macedon during second macedonian war 200 196 bc macedon had given sparta control over argos an important city on aegean coast of peloponnese sparta s continued occupation of argos at end of war was used as a pretext for rome and its allies to declare war anti spartan coalition laid siege to argos captured spartan naval base at gythium and soon invested and besieged sparta itself eventually negotiations led to peace on rome s terms under which argos and coastal towns of laconia were separated from sparta and spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to rome over next eight years argos joined achaean league and laconian towns were placed under achaean protection as a result of war sparta lost its position as a major power in greece subsequent spartan attempts to recover losses failed and nabis last sovereign ruler was eventually murdered soon after sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival achaean league ending several centuries of fierce political independence background after death of spartan regent in 207 bc in battle against achaean league nabis overthrew reigning king pelops with backing of a mercenary army and placed himself on throne claiming descent from eurypontid king demaratus by then traditional constitution of lycurgus had already lost its meaning and sparta was dominated by a group of its former mercenaries polybius described nabis force as a crowd of murderers burglars and highwaymen polybius 13 6 in 205 bc nabis signed a peace treaty with rome but in 201 bc he attacked territory of messene at that time an ally of both parties which sparta had ruled until mid 4th century bc spartans captured messene but were soon forced to abandon it when army of megalopolis arrived under command of philopoemen later they were decisively defeated at tegea and nabis was forced to check his expansionist ambitions for time polybius 16 13 305px right thumb greece and aegean on eve of second macedonian war during second macedonian war nabis had another possibility for expansion philip

nabis reforms in return for his assistance in war rome accepted nabis possession of polis of argos while nabis was already king of sparta he made his wife apia ruler of her hometown argos afterwards apia and nabis staged a financial coup by confiscating large amounts of property from wealthy families of these cities and torturing those who resisted them much of confiscated land was redistributed to liberated helots loyal to nabis cartledge and spawforth hellenistic and roman sparta a tale of two cities 74 after increasing his territory and wealth by aforementioned method nabis started to turn port of gythium into a major naval arsenal and fortified city of sparta his cretan allies were already allowed to have naval bases on spartan territory and from these they ventured on acts of piracy his naval buildup offered a chance even for very poor to participate as rowers in profitable employment however extension of naval capacities at gythium greatly displeased abutting states of aegean sea and roman republic nabis rule was largely based on his social reforms and rebuilding of sparta s armed forces military of lacedaemonia sparta had traditionally been based on levies of full citizens and perioeci one of free non citizen groups of lacedaemonia supported by lightly armed helots from several thousands in times of greco persian wars numbers of full citizen spartans had declined to a few hundred in times of cleomenes iii there were possibly several reasons for decline of numbers one of which was that every spartan who wasn t able to pay his share in common meal for men in doric societies lost his full citizenship although this didn t exclude his offspring from partaking in agoge traditional spartan education and training regime as a result fielding of a respectable hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult cleomenes increased number of full citizens again and made spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of macedonian style warfare in classical world p 73 macedonian infantry on equipment of macedonian phalangites however many of these restored citizens were killed in battle of sellasia and nabis politics drove remainder of them into exile in consequence heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers this led to a serious decline in sparta s military power and aim of nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well equipped phalangites operating in a close and deep formation with a longer spear than hoplites nabis liberation of enslaved helots was one of most outstanding deeds in spartan history with this action nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of old spartan social system and chief reason for objection to spartan expansion by surrounding poleis city states guarding against helot revolt had been until this time central concern of spartan foreign policy and need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad nabis action abolished this concern with a single stroke his freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of exiled spartan demos all former full citizens and widows of rich elite whose husbands had been killed at his orders green alexander to actium historical evolution of hellenistic age 302 preparations achaean league was upset that one of its members had remained under spartan occupation and persuaded romans to revisit their decision to leave sparta s territorial gains intact romans agreed with achaeans as they did not want a strong and re organized sparta causing trouble after romans left greece in 195 bc titus quinctius flamininus roman commander in greece called a council of greek states at corinth to discuss whether or not to declare war on nabis among states whose delegates participated were aetolian league macedon rome pergamum rhodes thessaly and achaean league all states represented favored war except for aetolian league and thessaly both of which wanted romans to leave greece immediately cartledge and spawforth hellenistic and roman sparta a tale of two cities 75 these two states offered to deal with nabis themselves but they met opposition from achaean league which objected to any possible growth in aetolian league s power livy 34 24 modern historian erich gruen has suggested that romans may have used war as an excuse to station a few legions in greece in order to prevent spartans and aetolian league from joining seleucid king antiochus iii if he invaded greece gruen hellenistic world and coming of rome 450 flamininus first sent an envoy to sparta demanding that nabis either surrender argos to achaean league or face war with rome and her greek allies nabis refused to comply with flamininus ultimatum so 40 000 roman soldiers and their greek allies advanced towards peloponnese entering peloponnese flamininus joined his force with that of achaean commander aristaenos who had 10 000 infantry and 1 000 cavalry in together they advanced towards argos livy 34 25 nabis had appointed his brother in law argive pythagoras as commander of his garrison of 15 000 men in argos as romans and achaean league were advancing towards city a young argive named damocles attempted to stir up a revolution against spartan garrison with a few followers he stood in city s agora and shouted to his fellow argives exhorting them to rise in revolt however no mass uprising materialized and damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by spartan garrison a few survivors from damocles group escaped from city and went to flamininus camp they suggested to flamininus that if he moved his camp closer to city gates argives would revolt against spartans roman commander sent his light infantry and cavalry to find a position for new camp upon spotting small group of roman soldiers a group of spartan troops sallied forth from gates and skirmished with romans about 300 paces from city walls romans forced spartans to retreat back into city flamininus moved his camp to position where skirmish had occurred for a day he waited for spartans to attack him but when no attack came he called a war council to discuss whether or not to press siege all greek leaders except aristaenos thought that they should attack city as capturing it was their primary objective in going to war aristaenos on other hand argued that they should instead strike directly at sparta and laconia flamininus agreed with aristaenos and army marched to tegea in arcadia next day flamininus advanced to caryae where he waited for allied auxiliaries to reinforce him these forces soon arrived and joined romans they consisted of a contingent of spartan exiles led by legitimate king of sparta who had been overthrown by first tyrant of sparta lycurgus twenty years earlier and 1 500 macedonians with 400 thessalian cavalry sent by philip news also reached allies that several fleets had arrived off laconian shore a roman fleet under lucius quinctius with forty ships a rhodian fleet with eighteen ships led by hoping that defeat of nabis would stop pirates that plagued their ships and a pergamene

augment 1 000 they had already sent to sparta s aid nabis fearing that roman approach might encourage his subjects to revolt decided to terrorize them by ordering execution of eighty prominent citizens flamininus left his base and descended upon sellasia while romans were making camp nabis auxiliaries attacked them sudden surprise attack briefly threw allies into a state of confusion but spartans retreated back to city when main body of legionary cohorts arrived as romans marched past sparta on their way to mount menelaus nabis mercenaries attacked allies rear appius claudius

garrison commanders sent word to roman legate that he was willing to surrender city this plan fell through when gorgopas other commander learned of it and slew dexagoridas with his own hands gorgopas

from argos and to hand over to romans any deserters and prisoners livy 34 33 flamininus called another war council most of council felt that they should capture sparta and unseat nabis livy 34 39 flamininus replied to nabis by proposing his own terms under which sparta and rome would conclude a six month truce if nabis would surrender argos with all his garrisons from give coastal laconian

outside city began investing city livy 34 38 flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to city but to instead try and storm it spartans initially held out against allies but their resistance was hampered by fact that romans large shields made missile attacks futile romans launched an assault on sparta and took walls but their advance was initially impeded by narrowness of roads in city s outskirts however streets grew wider as they advanced into city s center and spartans were forced further and further back nabis seeing his defenses collapsing tried to flee but pythagoras rallied soldiers and ordered them to set fire to buildings closest to walls burning debris was thrown on coalition s soldiers entering city causing many casualties observing this flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base when attack was renewed later spartans managed to hold off roman assaults for three days before nabis seeing that situation was hopeless decided to send pythagoras with an offer of surrender at first flaminius refused to see him but when pythagoras came to roman camp a second time flamininus accepted surrender with conditions of treaty being same as flamininus had previously proposed treaty was later ratified by senate argives revolted when they heard that sparta was under siege under argive they attacked garrison commanded by timocrates of timocrates

sparta was a landlocked and effectively powerless state romans wanted an independent sparta to act as a counterweight against growing achaean league nabis allegiance was secured by fact that he had to surrender five hostages amongst them his son romans did not restore exiles wishing to avoid internal strife in sparta they did however allow any woman who was married to an ex helot but whose husband
