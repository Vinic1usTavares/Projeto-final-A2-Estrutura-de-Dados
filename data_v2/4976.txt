leng considers that circles was composed on an organ however as most of harrison s indian inspired melodies since 1966 had been among them within you without you blue jay way and parts of his wonderwall music soundtrack album leng pp 32 34 50 236 leng writes of fugue like keyboard parts on song and bass figures that partly recall works of johann sebastian bach leng pp 232 236 song s lyrical theme is reincarnation in keeping with harrison s immersion in hindu philosophy allison pp 44 45 79 80 this preoccupation had led beatles to maharishi s jones beatle george and where he s at

version of circles include a singularly expressive common tone modulation over a semitone descent from chord of c minor to b minor everett p 349 harrison changed key for official recording where song is played in key of f major in this final form structure comprises two verses and a chorus or bridge as harrison terms it on his handwritten manuscript a repeat of this combination with an instrumental passage over second section of verse and two further verses followed by an extended instrumental passage harrison p 461 leng views chromatic melodic web of circles as appropriate for conveying repetition and entrapment of reincarnation as soul passes through one human life to another he says that melody yearn s for resolution in e minor revolving in dissonance like a lost soul awaiting its place in reincarnation checkout line author ian inglis writes that musically and lyrically circles displays a direct connection with unspoken psychedelia of harrison s beatles tracks blue jay way and long long long inglis p 83 allison describes lyrics as a clear statement of reincarnation as well as most blatant example of harrison s desire to pass on to a higher and better world at death and so escape cycle of rebirth in material world allison pp 82 139 choruses include lines from lao tse he who knows does not speak he who speaks does not know elsewhere in circles harrison contemplates changing nature of friendship as over course of lifetimes in inglis s description our enemies become our companions affections turn into hatred on released recording harrison concludes with a statement on how to break circle of repetition allison pp 82 83 when loss and gain and up and down becomes same then we stop going in circles harrison p 460 allison interprets this conclusion and harrison s worldview generally as espousing need to recognise illusory nature of material world saying all multiplicity and diversity are in truth manifestations of one hidden and divine reality opposites are not opposites to understand that up is down and that gain is loss is to be on one s way to escaping from material world allison p 83 beatles demo circles was one of five harrison

251 1071 acknowledging close friendship between two near neighbours leng cites lord s presence on track as indicative of a preference for locally sourced contributors and trusted pals when harrison made gone troppo leng pp 229 30 236 as another factor in album s creation harrison felt increasingly removed from contemporary musical trends and more involved with his film company handmade leng pp

633 critical reception discussing reception to gone troppo in their book eight arms to hold you chip madinger and mark easter identify circles as only track reflecting weightier matters on what was otherwise harrison s frothiest collection of songs to date and they conclude sadly a decent album was lost in shuffle of rapidly changing marketplace of early 80 s madinger easter pp 462 63 in his contemporary review for musician magazine roy trakin wrote that following lennon s murder two years before harrison s tortured honesty undermined album s attempt to heal those psychic wounds with calm

4 february 2017 in his book unreleased beatles richie unterberger describes song as a pretty neat if droning reflection of harrison s more somber spiritual sensibilities he views 1968 demo as a version that exerts by far greater fascination compared with harrison s later recording unterberger p 198 author john winn dismisses circles as a depressing number that makes blue jay way sound like a little richard freakout while ian macdonald describes it as a typically perceptive if deeply gloomy song about karma harrison biographer elliot huntley dismisses 1982 version as harrison s worst ever composition adding a heavy spiritual dirge somehow redolent of blue jay way but different inasmuch as it s nowhere near as good you can almost hear song writing barrel being scraped by contrast simon leng admires circles as one of its composer s most complex pieces and he pairs song with beware of darkness as a study in harrison s unique harmonic sense leng p 236 in light of its release as final track on gone troppo leng adds circles was so personal and eccentric that it seemed to close book on george s recording career it felt like he was making music only for himself leng p 237 personnel
