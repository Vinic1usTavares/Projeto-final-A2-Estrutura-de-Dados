afanasieff with whom she had previously worked on emotions 1991 and a few urban dance tracks during course of album s development carey wanted to broaden her audience choosing a more pop r b oriented sound during this time frame she experimented with different musical instruments leading album s sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts two unused tracks from album sessions were released as b sides do you think of me and everything fades away in order to successfully take album in a new direction carey and afanasieff sought out new and innovative producers as well as some from carey s previous releases kenneth babyface edmonds first began working with carey on music box where he helped produce some of album s softer and more melodious tracks as well as being part of songwriting process additional writers and producers were robert clivilles and david cole a pair also known as c c music factory and daryl simmons while album featured a range of music producers bulk of songwriting was done by carey and her writing partner walter afanasieff in future projects they would continue writing material for carey s albums until her 1999 release rainbow where he is absent from writing credits four singles were released from album first three dreamlover hero and without you became worldwide chart topping singles latter becoming carey s highest charting international single of her career without you became carey s first number one single in most european markets and reached top three in united states to promote music box carey embarked on short but successful music box tour which traveled to select cities in north america carey was nominated for best female pop vocal performance for dreamlover at 1994 grammy awards and received same nomination for hero at 1995 grammy awards after its release music box received generally mixed reviews from music critics album faced criticism regarding carey s more mellow and lazy tone in comparison to her previous work commercially album reached number one in australia austria belgium denmark finland france germany ireland netherlands portugal scotland switzerland united kingdom and united states recording industry association of america riaa certified it diamond for shipments of ten million copies across united states music box remains carey s highest seller with 28 million copies sold worldwide and is one of best selling albums of all time background and development in 1988 carey was discovered by tommy mottola ceo of columbia records and was promptly signed to label carey s self titled debut studio album released following year focused on re recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside classmate ben margulies aside from seven songs taken from carey s demo tape four other tracks were written and produced by former and an array of famed record producers album was complimented by critics who called it a mature debut full of various genre influences ranging from pop r b and soul album became a commercial success selling fifteen million units globally while making a strong impact on pop music carey became interested in altering her sound and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort emotions 1991 following success of her debut columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure enabling her to change her genre infusions melodies and production with carey in captain s chair having more control than she had on any other album she took album in a new direction alongside afanasieff for carey s third studio effort she enrolled help of a range of songwriters as well as record producers aside from afanasieff kenneth babyface edmonds a man who would collaborate with carey often in near future also took part in project babyface who helped produce much of album also co wrote a track with carey titled never forget you a song that was released as a b side to without you exclusively in united states album which consisted mostly of slower ballads with exception of dreamlover now that i know and i ve been thinking about you contained collaborations with some carry on producers and writers from emotions of these were clivilles cole of c c music factory who co wrote track now that i know a danceable pop ballad which used similar formulas and synthesizers from tracks on emotions another writer producer that worked on album was david hall who with carey wrote u s single dreamlover during album s recording carey worked with several different musicians and producers aside from walter afanasieff only hold over from her debut on album s first track dreamlover carey worked with dave hall throughout song s entire production in order to help with some of song s arrangements mottola enrolled help of walter afanasieff who took on completed track and transformed it into a more commercial hit music and lyrics emotions contains influences from mostly 1950s 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel as well as her continued work of r b and soul album while praised by some as more mature and raw failed to reach critical or commercial heights of her debut effort while selling far less and failed to introduce carey into a different market following these events columbia decided to try to market carey in a similar fashion to her debut only having her produce a more commercial and radio friendly album their plans were to tone down carey s vocals and soften album s production leaving a more contemporary pop r b record agreeing to change carey and afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort music box one of noticeable differences from music box and carey s previous albums is its sound album was described by afanasieff as a softer and more pop oriented album filling songs with air and allowing far more space in overall sound another noticeable change is in album s production when mariah carey was released critics took notice of its overly produced and studio perfect quality where in comparison emotions maintains a raw live sound music box however falls in between two a decision made by carey during album s production she would layer each track with live backing vocals so not to sound too overly produced but still kept inclusion of musical synthesizers according to marc shapiro music box reflects signs of carey s vocal maturity as well as representing an album she was truly proud of album s first single dreamlover was described as a slight piece of pop fluff representing a more commercial side to carey than more ambitious vision of love critics believed song s chart performance was due to its summer release as people were still looking for a not too heavy and more diverse sound song s composition was described as mid tempo and mildly dance able with carey s voice being called perpetually happy like a little girl voice songs hero album s second single was one of carey s most inspirational ballads at time song is described as a lush ballad with carey making use of her impressive lower alto register as one of more emotional tracks on album hero builds emotion verse through verse where lyrics and melody finally broke through anytime you need a friend is another pop ballad in which carey would let her voice roam free a feature critics felt lacked on album song featured rough and low vocals as well as some glimpses of carey s upper registers as with most of songs on music box lyrics boast a positive message and it is only song on album to feature traces of gospel inspired vocals throughout chorus album s title track music box is another ballad carey wrote with afanasieff song is described as one of carey s more difficult compositions due to its softness song requires a great deal of legato to keep tunes softness and sweetness without resorting to volume carey s vocals on track are defined as soft and controlled managing to maintain delicate balance in a manner that seems effortless floating easily over keyboard and shimmer of guitar lyrically due to song s message of commitment and promise and tinkling music box line played on synthesizer track gives sensation of a wedding vow recital never forget you is a slow song further connecting it to song s message of lamenting loss of love in a very tender way song contains keyboard notes that hover over verses and allow carey to indulge in her backing vocals it was described by nickson as a stand out track one that could have easily become a hit single with an appeal that would have easily transcended generational barriers promotion thumb right

fright carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support music box however after continued success of album and persuasion from tommy mottola carey

reception music box received mixed reviews from critics many of whom found performances uninvolved and devoid of substantial songwriting in rolling stone stephen holden said lyrics were made up entirely of pop and soul cliches on an album so precisely calculated to be a blockbuster that its impact is ultimately a little unnerving christopher john farley from time called it perfunctory and almost passionless in spite of highlights in anytime you need a friend and title track in entertainment weekly david browne found carey s performance low on energy and her voice no longer soaring above backup chorus instead he wrote in entertainment weekly she drips over them like syrup instead of overpowering them she lets melodies speak for themselves dennis hunt was particularly critical in los angeles times writing that carey s pop soul songs still lacked emotion even though she had toned down her vocal showboating he accused music box of being geared toward an adult contemporary audience that likes its soul whitewashed and in small doses village voice critic robert christgau labeled it a dud indicating a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought in a retrospective review for allmusic ron wynn deemed music box partly successful and believed it was smart of carey to explore her vocal approach differently but she ended up sounding detached on several selections with exception hero and dreamlover other songs lacked her usual personality and intensity according to wynn q was more impressed by record writing that this 1993 celebration of all conquering power of love was her defining moment accolades publication accolade rank complex best r b albums of 90s commercial performance music box entered us billboard 200 at number two with 174 000 copies sold in its
