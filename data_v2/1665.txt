tutored among others by isaac newton active for most of his life in intellectual pursuits he was elected a fellow of royal society in 1705 6 he occupied no posts of importance until financial considerations and political connections brought him governorships of new york and new jersey his tenure in new jersey was without major controversies although he set a precedent there for accepting what were effectively bribes in exchange for his assent to legislation in new york he sought unsuccessfully to end fur trade between albany and montreal in order to implement a colonial policy preferring direct trade with native americans in central north america his new york rule was marked by an increase in political divisions between land owners with whom burnet sided and merchants after death of king george i king george ii appointed burnet governor of new hampshire and massachusetts although his new hampshire tenure was inconsequential he engaged in a nasty dispute with massachusetts assembly over issue of his salary holding legislative body in session for six months and relocating it away from boston dispute held up other colonial business and was ongoing in september 1729 when burnet died his death was apparently caused by illness contracted after his carriage overturned and dumped him in water early life william burnet was born in hague a leading city of dutch republic in march 1687 8 in julian calendar then in use in england and its colonies year began on 25 march to avoid confusion with dates in gregorian calendar then in use in other parts of europe dates between january and march were often written with both years dates in this article are in julian calendar unless otherwise noted he was first child of mary scott burnet and gilbert burnet leading theologian in dutch court of william prince of orange who was burnet s godfather and his wife mary mary scott burnet was heiress of a scottish family which had settled in netherlands and acquired great wealth her marriage to gilbert however was generally agreed not to be for money but a genuine love match on both sides there were six younger children of whom four survived infancy later in 1688 william led an army across english channel in glorious revolution and william iii and mary ii ascended to english throne as burnet s father gave coronation sermon was later elevated to bishop of salisbury and was an ongoing influence in english court during king william s reign he fell out of favour when queen anne took throne in 1702 burnet s mother died of smallpox in 1698 in accordance with her dying request his father two years later remarried her close friend elizabeth blake who proved a kindly stepmother to william and his siblings all of them were devoted to gilbert best of fathers on gilbert s death in 1715 william inherited one third of estate which given his mother s wealth must have been considerable burnet was an excellent but undisciplined scholar he entered oxford at age of 13 but was dismissed for disciplinary reasons his later education came from private tutoring including isaac newton as a tutor and he was ultimately admitted to bar in 1712 he married mary daughter of george stanhope dean of canterbury they had one child a boy before she died in 1717 intellectual pursuits burnet s rarefied education brought him a lifelong interest in scientific and mathematical pursuits he was proposed for membership in royal society by isaac newton in 1705 and was enrolled as a fellow in february 1705 6 stearns p 224 he was acquainted with mathematician gottfried leibniz cohen and smith p 442 and was a regular correspondent on a wide array of scientific subjects with philadelphia merchant and politician james logan hayes p 20 he reported to royal society observations of grindelwald glacier in switzerland speake p 15 and on an unusual instance of hungarian conjoined twins he saw while resident in hague in 1708 et al p 120 observations he made of eclipses of moons of jupiter while he was governor of new york were used to more precisely determine new york city s longitude royal society transactions p 142 during his tenure in new york he was relatively starved for intellectual discourse he briefly met a young benjamin franklin and encouraged him in his intellectual pursuits kammen p 273 like his teacher isaac newton burnet also wrote on religious subjects in 1724 he anonymously published an essay on scripture prophecy wherein it is endeavoured to explain three periods contain d in xii chapter of prophet daniel with some arguments to make it probable that first of periods did expire in year 1715 in this work he put forward a millennialist argument that jesus christ would return to earth in 1790 based on his numerological interpretation of book of daniel taylor p 330 governor of new york and new jersey thumb right upright robert livingston advised burnet in new york burnet s connections to court procured for him an appointment as comptroller of customs in great britain he also invested heavily in south sea company whose collapse in 1720 led him to consider more lucrative positions in north american colonies correspondence with a longtime friend robert hunter who returned to england in 1719 provided an opportunity hunter was then governor of new york and new jersey and he had returned to england for a variety of personal reasons intending to divest himself of those posts hunter and burnet were both well connected to whig government then in power so an exchange of their offices was readily approved leonard pp 175 176 new jersey burnet s tenure as new jersey governor was marked by disputes over issuance of bills of credit and granting of a permanent salary bills of credit in addition to providing funding for province s expenses also circulated as local currency issuance of large quantities of such bills had an inflationary tendency to devalue them relative to pound sterling burnet was under instructions to disallow their issuance except under certain conditions purvis pp 154 155 when provincial assembly in 1721 approved a bill that called for issuance of ps40 000 in bills secured by property mortgages burnet dissolved assembly purvis p 155 however he approved similar legislation in 1723 in exchange for legislature s approval of a five year salary plan fleming p 29 when assembly began appropriating funds from bills in unapproved ways a few years later burnet was again convinced to sign in exchange for a grant of ps500 for incidental expenses fleming p 30 this method by which assembly essentially bribed governor for his agreement in violation of instructions became somewhat normal practice in new jersey with later governors purvis pp 156 157 new york in new york burnet sided with large landowners of province based on their advice he refused to call elections for provincial assembly keeping an assembly dominated by court party members for five years lustig p 34 his relationship with new york assembly only deteriorated after several special elections resulted in addition of enough country party members to elect a hostile speaker lustig p 37 although he sought to broaden province s tax base to include larger real estate holdings powerful property owners who dominated assembly and court party were successful in deflecting these efforts into taxes on merchant interests leder p 266 one tax levied on tonnage of ships docking in new york led to a rise in smuggling between new jersey and new york bonomi pp 94 95 eight months after his arrival in new york in may 1721 burnet married again his bride was anna maria van horne daughter of abraham and mary van horne and a relative by marriage of robert livingston a powerful new york landowner and one of burnet s chief advisors leonard p p p 253 they had four children she and last child died not long after its birth in 1727 leonard p 181 indian trading policy one of more important aspects of burnet s tenure in new york was his attempts to strengthen colony s position on frontier and its relations with iroquois who then controlled most of what is now upstate new york since iroquois had achieved peace with new france in 1701 a vibrant trade had begun between new york merchants in albany and french merchants in montreal english goods were sold to french traders who bartered those goods for furs with native american tribes in central north america british colonial administrators sought to alter this method of trade instructing burnet to direct trade through iroquois lands instead of through montreal bringing an end to albany montreal trade leder p 251 thumb left fort oswego as it would have appeared in 1727 not long after his arrival in new york burnet had assembly pass a law banning albany montreal trade leder p 254 this action earned him opposition from merchant interests that traded directly with new france including huguenot stephen delancey and other albany merchants two vocal merchants adolph and pieter schuyler sat on governor s council and were removed by burnet in 1721 bonomi p 90 law was fairly easily circumvented merchants routed trade goods through nearby mohawks who then carried goods to and from montreal a law stiffening enforcement of trade ban was passed in 1722 leder p 267 these policies caused protest not only in new york but also in london where british merchants argued that they were having a negative impact on trade volume to europe leder p 280 in 1723 burnet was informed that french had begun construction of fort niagara at western end of lake ontario this action presented a clear threat to british attempts to more directly access and control fur trade leder p 276 he consequently ordered construction of fort oswego at mouth of oswego river this decision not only upset albany traders who would lose their monopoly on fur trade but also upset french because it gave british direct access to lake ontario and iroquois who had wanted a fort sited at lake oneida instead burnet tried to placate iroquois by stationing militia forces in oneida area but they also resented this intrusion burnet s attempts to implement trade policy were ultimately unsuccessful in 1725 merchant interests stephen delancey among them succeeded in gaining seats in assembly through special elections and burnet s decision to question citizenship of huguenot delancey and thus his right to a seat in assembly angered many moderates in that body bonomi p 37 in following years assembly was noticeably more hostile to his rule trade ban was repealed in 1726 and replaced by a system of taxation designed to prefer western trade over albany montreal trade leder p 290 by time of his departure in 1727 it was clear that this policy was also not working and in some cases was having negative effects all laws respecting indian trade that passed during his administration were repealed in 1729 only long term effects were establishment of british military presence at oswego and breaking of albany s monopoly on trade kammen pp 195 196 burnet also left new york more divided between merchants and landowners than when he arrived bonomi p 95 replacement in 1727 king george i died an event that required renewal of royal commissions george ii decided to give new york and new jersey governorships to colonel john montgomerie who had served him as a groom of bedchamber lustig p 39 burnet was instead given appointment as governor of massachusetts and new hampshire barry p 122 after it became known in new york that burnet would be replaced assembly at instigation of stephen delancey as a parting shot formally protested burnet s actions as a chancery court judge declaring that his judgments would be null and void montgomerie arrived in new york on 15 april 1728 carrying burnet s commissions burnet left new york in july for boston american quarterly register p 293 governor of massachusetts and new hampshire burnet was only briefly in new hampshire during his short tenure where unlike massachusetts he was readily granted a salary for three years or duration of his administration belknap pp 75 76 at time of his appointment to massachusetts seat province had been governed for a number of years by lieutenant governor william dummer acting for governor samuel shute burnet made a attempt to force massachusetts assembly to grant him a permanent salary since institution of royal charter in 1692 assembly had steadfastly resisted this choosing instead to make periodic grants to governor local politicians found this an effective mechanism for influencing governor to approve their policies since governor would never know when next grant would be made or how large it would be salary matter was one of many that had vexed governor shute during his time in province barry pp 104 122 dummer a wealthy massachusetts native had been more conciliatory only insisting that control of provincial militia remain in his hands barry p 119 burnet chose to take an extremely hard line on subject of salary he refused to conduct any other business or to dissolve legislature until salary was decided legislature in turn refused to enact a salary bill although it offered generous one time grants that burnet refused on principle barry p 124 he further raised tensions by implicitly suggesting that assembly s failure to act on salary might jeopardize colonial charter barry p 125 in order to make life as difficult as possible for legislators burnet relocated assembly from boston first to salem and then cambridge increasing costs of legislators and forcing many of them from comforts of their boston area properties in november 1728 assembly voted to send agents to london to argue their side of issue with board of trade its attempts to appropriate funds for agents were denied by governor s council and agents ended up being paid from funds raised by subscription barry pp 125 126 in may 1729 board of trade ruled siding with governor burnet but assembly still refused to yield attempts to conduct business on other matters invariably became caught up in salary dispute and thus stalled barry p 126 dispute was still ongoing when burnet en route from cambridge to boston on 31 august was thrown into water when his carriage accidentally overturned he fell ill and died on 7 september 1729 he was interred in king s chapel burying ground in boston p 164 lieutenant governor dummer again acted as governor until burnet s replacement jonathan belcher one of agents who had been sent to london was selected and returned to province barry p 118 he took a similar position as burnet refusing annual grants until he was replaced as lieutenant and acting governor by william tailer who acquiesced to annual grants spencer p 87 jonathan belcher who became governor later in 1730 was at first instructed as burnet was on matter of salary but during his tenure boards of trade finally abandoned instruction and allowed him to receive annual grants doyle pp 95 96 see also list of colonial governors of new jersey list of colonial governors of new york list of colonial governors of
