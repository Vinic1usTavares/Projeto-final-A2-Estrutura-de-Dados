lap times it was first dry qualifying session of season and track temperature cooled gradually as it progressed rosberg set fastest times in second and third sessions to clinch his first pole position of season fifth of his career and his second in bahrain with a time of 1 minute and 33 185 seconds he was joined on grid s front row by hamilton who recorded a lap time almost three tenths of a second slower he locked his brakes going into first turn on his final timed lap flat spotting his tyres and abandoning his attempt as a consequence ricciardo qualified in third but took a ten place grid penalty for an unsafe pit stop release at season s previous round in malaysia as a result bottas inherited position and perez took fourth raikkonen felt uncomfortable with his ferrari and medium compound tyre issues restricted him to fifth button in his 250th grand prix start took sixth while an oversteer left massa in seventh magnussen and alonso were eighth and ninth respectively vettel rounded out top ten qualifiers due to a lack of track running following his final practice session spin and a downshifting issue hulkenberg was fastest driver not advancing into final session his best lap of one minute and 35 116 seconds was 1 2 seconds off rosberg s pace in second session hulkenberg went wide at turn eleven exit kerb which cost him time kvyat s fastest time was achieved in track s first sector which qualified him 12th after ricciardo s penalty was applied kvyat was separated by teammate jean eric vergne who made an engine adjustment after feeling he was low on power gutierrez took 15th ahead of two lotus cars of romain grosjean and maldonado who both struggled for pace adrian sutil failed to advance beyond first session due to slower cars causing him to abort his final timed lap however he incurred a five place grid penalty after he was deemed by stewards to have forced grosjean wide between turns 13 and 14 and two penalty points on his super licence and started from back of field kobayashi and jules bianchi started from 18th and 19th kobayashi did one timed lap on soft compound tyres before entering pit lane and rejoined track with three minutes remaining

teammate nico rosberg for lead race began at 18 00 arabia standard time utc 03 00 weather conditions at start were dry and hot with air temperature between and a track temperature ranging from cooler temperatures reduced advantage of medium compound tyres over soft compound to less than two seconds observed during daylight conditions approximately 38 140 people attended event when race started hamilton accelerated faster than teammate rosberg off line moving ahead of him by using space between pit wall heading into first corner hamilton oversteered after leaving turn three and moved to outside of track rosberg attempted to retake lead by going around outside at fourth turn but hamilton defended position alonso overtook teammate raikkonen around inside at first turn and then made contact with magnussen alonso continued with minor bodywork damage vergne was squeezed by maldonado at turn eight entry and attempted to pass him maldonado drove defensively and both made contact vergne had a punctured right rear tyre along with rear wing and floor damage and drove to pit lane for repairs massa made best start of field moving from seventh to third by end of first lap while vergne lost eight positions over same distance because of maldonado collision at end of first lap hamilton led rosberg by one second followed by massa perez bottas button alonso hulkenberg raikkonen and vettel having been unsuccessful in his attempts to retake lead rosberg started to conserve fuel to prepare for an attack later in race both he and hamilton pulled away from rest of field hulkenberg passed alonso by braking later than him at first turn on lap four to move into seventh williams cars were harder on their tyres than surrounding cars and third placed massa came under pressure from perez while button closed gap to bottas ricciardo went to outside of magnussen on ninth lap and overtook him for eleventh driving into turn one ricciardo went off onto corner s run off area onto exit kerbs and defended his position from kvyat who went to inside of him going into turn four button battled bottas around inside heading towards first turn on following lap two drivers drove alongside each other through following corner until button moved in front of bottas thumb jules bianchi punctured his tyre in a collision with adrian sutil ricciardo caught up to magnussen while hulkenberg overtook bottas for seventh position shortly afterwards ricciardo moved to outside of magnuseen on backstraight and passed him after mclaren slid while defending eleventh place on lap eleven perez attacked massa going into fourth turn and overtook him for third place on next lap through turns five and six massa attempted to reclaim position driving into turn seven hairpin but locked his tyres and temporarily bowed out of battle both williams cars as well as both ferrari drivers had to change from a two stop to a three stop strategy as a result of high tyre wear magnussen also converted to a three stop strategy due to high tyre wear but teammate button was able to conserve his tyres well enough to continue with doing just two stops sutil and bianchi twice impacted each other at first turn with second collision causing sutil to stop at corner with a puncture and debris was littered on track bianchi s right rear tyre was punctured and he went to pit lane for a replacement wheel but his car s floor was damaged causing a loss in downforce which meant he had difficulty driving his car for remainder of race vettel s drs stopped working and he was quickly caught by teammate ricciardo by 15th lap ricciardo told his team by radio that two cars were losing time and red bull ordered vettel to cede sixth place to ricciardo which he did immediately hulkenberg made a pit stop on same lap and overtook raikkonen and kvyat on his out lap shortly afterwards having saved more fuel rosberg had more horsepower available for an attack after using drs down pit straight he managed to briefly get past hamilton by out braking on inside into turn one however rosberg s late braking forced him slightly wide and hamilton switched to inside to immediately retake position from rosberg on following lap rosberg attempted same move into first turn again and this time managed to stay ahead through turn however hamilton managed to come back at his teammate to claim inside for turn two with two coming perilously close to contact as hamilton cut across to retake first from rosberg this overtake was critical because as lead mercedes car it meant that hamilton was called into pit lane first diving into pit lane at end of lap to be fitted with soft compound tyre while rosberg would make a pit stop on lap 21 and take on harder medium tyre ricciardo and button made pit stops on lap 20 while bianchi was issued with a drive through penalty because he was judged to have caused incident between himself and sutil button caught raikkonen and used drs to overtake him heading into first corner sutil retired his sauber after several slow laps on track allowed him to gain more track experience vettel moved in front of raikkonen by going around inside without using drs system between fourth and fifth turns while massa defended third position from teammate bottas at first turn three laps later massa came under pressure from hulkenberg who attacked massa by going around inside heading towards fourth turn and moved out of his slipstream but massa defended place perez took advantage to attack before entering turn five and moved in front of hulkenberg ricciardo locked his tyres going into turn one and narrowly avoided impacting raikkonen but caught him on backstraight bottas quickly caught battle between raikkonen and ricciardo he passed ricciardo around outside at turn one on 30th lap and swerved left off onto a run off area to avoid striking raikkonen ricciardo retook position left thumb sergio perez secured his first podium finish since 2012 italian grand prix hamilton created a gap on faster tyre over next phase of race and by lap 32 he was 8 5 seconds ahead of rosberg ricciardo was able to pass raikkonen and bottas attempted to move in front of raikkonen going into downhill turn eight and passed him on backstraight bottas closed up to ricciardo while massa passed raikkonen on backstraight for ninth perez made a pit stop on lap 35 and rejoined behind alonso before immediately passing alonso ricciardo lost seventh position when massa passed him ericsson pulled over to side of track to retire with an oil leak which followed a loss of engine power on 37th lap ricciardo overtook raikkonen around outside on following lap and moved in front of magnuseen shortly afterwards hamilton was around 10 seconds ahead of rosberg with 17 laps remaining however with soft compound tyre estimated to be as much as a second a lap faster than medium compound rosberg still had a very good chance of catching up to his teammate in remaining laps as they were scheduled to be put on opposite tyres for final stint hamilton on medium tyres and rosberg on soft compound option after rejoining track following a pit stop on lap 41 maldonado was unable to react to gutierrez steering right into first corner and hit his right rear corner gutierrez rolled over twice in air before landing upright on track ensuing debris resulted in deployment of safety car gutierrez remained in his car for some time before climbing out to be transported to local hospital for examination magnussen retired with clutch problems on 42nd lap both mercedes drivers made pit stops during safety car period but its deployment meant hamilton s lead of over 10 seconds over rosberg was reduced to nothing with no gap between them hamilton would be at a big disadvantage on medium tyres that were estimated to be around a second a lap slower as two mercedes cars scrapped for lead as safety car circulated team s technical director paddy lowe spoke to both mercedes drivers on radio to remind them that both cars needed to finish race with ten laps to go safety car drove into pit lane and racing resumed hamilton defended from rosberg heading into turn one but rosberg got better line through corner and through turns two and three and he attempted to overtake again on outside of turn four hamilton defended again holding his teammate out wide and managed to maintain lead thumb upright lewis hamilton held off a long race challenge from teammate nico rosberg to win race perez fended off a challenge from teammate hulkenberg for third button fell to seventh after being passed by vettel on backstraight and ricciardo around outside while maldonado was issued with a ten second stop and go penalty for causing incident between himself and gutierrez on lap 49 which he took immediately with their drivers fighting hard for lead and with fuel no longer being a concern due to safety car period mercedes cars were being driven flat out and extent of their superiority was revealed for first time within three laps two mercedes had created a six second gap over perez rosberg recorded race s fastest lap on 49th lap completing a circuit of one minute and 37 020 seconds ricciardo passed teammate vettel for fifth going on lap 50 into first turn vettel attacked going up hill heading towards turn four but ricciardo defended position on lap 52 rosberg again attempted a late braking move into turn one but hamilton managed to stay ahead by waiting for rosberg to run wide from his late braking manoeuvre and turned in to switch to inside and maintain his lead rosberg continued his assault by attempting move again on following lap and again hamilton drove defensively heading towards turn four and managed to hold on to lead hulkenberg made a mistake allowing ricciardo to take advantage and passed him at turn eleven exit to move into fourth place on lap 53 massa battled vettel for sixth driving into first corner and overtook him at fourth turn but vettel retook position button slowed with a clutch problem and drove into his garage to become race s final retirement on 56th lap with two mercedes drivers having repeatedly duelled for position over closing laps rosberg had taken best from his tyres by start of final lap hamilton maintained his advantage over rest of lap to win race rosberg finished second and perez narrowly held off a closing ricciardo over event s final few laps to clinch third it was perez s first podium since 2012 italian grand prix and force india s first since 2009 belgian grand prix hulkenberg finished fifth ahead of vettel and massa in sixth and seventh bottas alonso and raikkonen rounded out top ten points scoring finishers kvyat grosjean chilton maldonado and kobayashi filled next five positions while bianchi one lap down was last of classified finishers there were two lead changes in race two drivers reached front of field hamilton s total of 54 laps led was most of any competitor it was hamilton s second consecutive victory of season his first in bahrain and 24th of his career equalling number of victories achieved by five time world champion juan manuel fangio post race at podium interviews conducted by singer brian johnson hamilton said he was really really proud to have secured his first victory at track and was grateful for his team for working hard to achieve result he praised rosberg for his race performance and described battle between two drivers as very fair rosberg stated that he strongly disliked finishing behind hamilton and it was something he did not particularly enjoy but felt event was most exciting race i ve ever done in my whole career perez said his third place result was very special to him as it was his third race with force india team he said it had been easier for him until deployment of safety car and revealed he would not have been able to fend off ricciardo for another lap in later press conference hamilton said it was difficult to defend against rosberg with medium compound tyres and that he had not driven as hard against him since they competed against each other early in their careers rosberg stated he was pushing hard and revealed his strategy was planned by mercedes and would undertake a similar move in future perez felt his podium position was important to him having never achieved feat while driving for mclaren in 2013 finishing race in third gave him a great feeling left thumb upright pastor maldonado pictured in 2015 was penalised five grid places for chinese grand prix following contact with esteban gutierrez gutierrez said he was surprised at force of maldonado s impact which forced his retirement arguing that he was in front of driver and could do to nothing to prevent crash from occurring maldonado claimed he was unable to avoid contact with gutierrez but stated he would watch incident again as he believed gutierrez missed his braking point and was off racing line going into first turn maldonado incurred with a five place grid penalty for next round of season in china and three penalty points on his super licence two drivers spoke to each other about crash and maldonado told him that he did not expect to steer into gutierrez but maintained that he did not cause incident sutil felt bianchi was driving aggressively having forced him wide at race s start and was unable to prevent crash from occurring bianchi said he was really disappointed describing it as another tough race for me third one in a row he argued that he was in front of sutil driving into first corner but had enjoyed battling with driver earlier in race media reactions to race were positive with david tremayne of independent writing thank lord that so many of formula 1 s detractors were present in bahrain where 900th grand prix since world championship was inaugurated turned out to be a that was easily best held so far under new regulations with amount of battling across field it was not taxi driving as ferrari president luca di montezemolo earlier claimed would be outcome of formula one s adoption of greener technology writing for sunday telegraph daniel johnson stated day s racing was some of finest seen in years and discussion over how formula one s new rules had stifled competition leaving little more than a series of fuel economy run was premature kevin eason of times wrote it took team mates of raw courage and epic skill to drag formula one from round of squalid infighting that polluted cool night air of bahrain yesterday guardian s motor racing correspondent paul weaver spoke of an absolute thriller from lights to flag with more overtaking moves than you could shake your drs at and fireworks that exploded into night sky were a worthy celebration of best race for years race ensured rosberg remained leader of drivers championship but his advantage over hamilton had been reduced from 18 to 11 points hulkenberg s fifth place finish promoted him from sixth to third on 28 points while alonso and button s results fell one position from third and fourth places respectively mercedes increased their advantage at top of constructors championship to 67 points force india s strong result elevated
