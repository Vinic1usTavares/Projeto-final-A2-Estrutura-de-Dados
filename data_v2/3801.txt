in 6th and 7th centuries porphyrogenitus stressed that serbs had always been under imperial rule his account on first christianization of serbs can be dated to 632 638 this might have been porphyrogenitus construction or may have really taken place encompassing a limited group of chiefs and then very poorly received by wider layers of tribe according to dai baptized serbia known erroneously in historiography as raska included inhabited cities of and salines while small land chorion of bosna part of serbia had cities of and other serb inhabited lands or principalities that were mentioned included countries of zahumlje and land of duklja which was held by byzantine empire though it was presumably settled with serbs as well these were all situated by adriatic and shared

magistrate or governor governorship was hereditary and zupan reported to serbian prince whom they were obliged to aid in war according to v serbs at first lived withdrawn in gorges in their old tribal organization while byzantine rule was nominally recognized domestic rulers veliki ruled serbia by right of inheritance land was divided between ruler s brothers with oldest brother having certain domestic rule over collective according to a theory by historian b radojkovic 1958 serbia was a divided principality and viseslav could have been a chief military leader veliki vojvoda who with his company seized absolute control of ruling power and turned himself into a hereditary ruler as veliki zupan in this way first serbian state was thus established after 150 years of permanent living in new homeland and existence of military democracy b radojkovic s work was however discredited by s left thumb supposed borders of western balkan polities in early 9th century although viseslav is only mentioned by name dai mentions that serbs served byzantine emperor and that they were at this time at peace with bulgars their neighbours with whom they shared a common frontier bulgars under planned to colonize bulgaria with slavs from neighbouring as earlier bulgar expansion had caused massive slav migrations and depopulation of bulgaria when in 762 more than 200 000 people fled to byzantine territory and were relocated to asia minor bulgars were defeated in 774 after emperor constantine v r 741 775 learned of their planned raid bulgars had by 773 cut off communication route vardar valley

789 810 over dalmatia although nothing is known from contemporary sources about slavs in hinterland when general byzantine frankish conflict ended in 812 with pax franks held dalmatian coast while byzantines held dalmatian cities aftermath and legacy viseslav was succeeded by his son radoslav followed by his grandson and one of these two most likely ruled during revolt of ljudevit of lower pannonia against franks 819 822 according to einhard s royal frankish annals ljudevit fled from his seat at sisak to serbs in 822 with einhard mentioning serbs who control greater part of dalmatia ad

slavic tradition with christianization in 9th century christian names appear four named succeeding serbian rulers are not mentioned in chronicle of priest of duklja a source dating to c 1300 10 and considered unreliable by historians with regard to early middle ages instead cpd mentions several historically unconfirmed or legendary rulers and although it maintains patrilineal succession tradition historian 1834 1903 believed that cpd s christian author was unwilling to name these rulers due to their being pagans who also perhaps had a reputation for defeating killing and dispersing
