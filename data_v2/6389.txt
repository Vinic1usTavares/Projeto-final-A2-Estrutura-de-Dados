shroff priyanka chopra as herself production ventilator was directed by rajesh mapuskar and produced by priyanka chopra under her production company purple pebble pictures chopra s mother madhu chopra also served as producer on film and looked after its production it was distributed by zee studios mapuskar had idea for film when a family member was hospitalised and put on a medical ventilator according to director word ventilator became a part of his daily life and he began to follow stories of people undergoing medical treatment in an interview with scroll in mapuskar recalled how relatives of people who were under medical treatment made efforts to treat life with humour in face of death that s how story was born in my mind and i began to write it after completing script he approached several filmmakers who thought it was a great script but were sceptical of producing it he revealed that these people tried to discourage him from making it in marathi since his debut film ferrari ki 2013 was in hindi they thought going from hindi to marathi would be a downgrade however he was confident film would be a marathi production he said it makes economic sense to make film in marathi where better scripts are accepted and projects are wrapped up in record time at same time priyanka chopra set up purple pebble pictures and was looking for content driven regional cinema scripts after reading script chopra was impressed and immediately agreed to produce film under her production company she said it s one single moment that defines best of film it is funny ironical and a deeply moving tale that will leave you laughing and crying i am very lucky to have such a talented collection of actors coming together for my debut marathi production rajesh mapuskar believed that having chopra as producer helped to create a larger market for film when director approached ashutosh gowariker with script he assumed mapuskar wanted him to produce film however despite liking script he declined after learning that he wanted gowariker to act gowariker who had last acted in a film 18 years earlier was shocked at idea of returning to acting he was also busy with his own directorial venture after six months rajesh mapuskar approached him again gowariker insisted on an audition so he could be rejected he finally agreed after getting a phone call from chopra who insisted he do film
