daphne alt a photograph of sculpture apollo and daphne depicting one woman and one man phantom blood was written and drawn by hirohiko araki prior to working on series he created a manga that resembled works of hisashi eguchi an artist known for his art of female characters araki s editor ryosuke angrily told araki to never draw something as derivative again which led him to take another direction with his art and creation of phantom blood due to popularity of arnold schwarzenegger and sylvester stallone at time araki designed characters with muscular body types character posing which araki considers is distinctive about his art was influenced by a trip to italy just before serialization of phantom blood where he went to galleria borghese in rome and saw gian lorenzo bernini s sculpture apollo and daphne seeing it in person from different angles had a large influence on him he described it as overwhelmingly beautiful and intense and unlike sculptures in japanese museums and figure posing of most manga artists structure and themes phantom blood was created using a ki sho ten ketsu structure introduction ki development sho twist ten and resolution ketsu along with rule of rising and falling in which hero must grow over time in relation to their starting point in beginning of story and not stagnate or regress araki did however note that due to weekly format of series jonathan s initial regression when dio turns jonathan s happy life into hardships meant that jonathan s growth remained in negative for a few weeks after series premiere leading to a negative feeling that jonathan always loses araki implemented a similar growth curve for dio although with him rising towards evil despite following rule of ever progressing hero araki decided to bend rule and have jonathan die to save his wife and child he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a shonen manga but said that since he wanted to pass down joestar family s lineage he needed jonathan to die and for his blood and spirit to be passed to joseph protagonist of battle tendency second part in series while calling it a gamble he called this passing of torch a positive that enables extreme negative of killing first protagonist themes of phantom blood were described by araki as being alive and an affirmation that humanity is wonderful he explained latter as a description for humanity s ability to grow and overcome hardships through one s strength and spirit this is a recurring theme that has been used in all following parts of jojo s bizarre adventure portrayed through people succeeding in fights through their own actions without relying on machines or gods this theme along with passing of torch was influenced by araki s grandfather s death near start of serialization and his thoughts about how people leave parts of themselves behind for next generation when they die wanting readers to know that stone mask and its powers would be what would drive plot araki started manga with a prologue involving mask focusing on communicating mood rather than standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of protagonist concept of hamon was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show invisible he came up with idea of a character punching a frog which was left unharmed while rock underneath cracked open thus showing supernatural power of character s abilities it was also influenced by his love for karate manga with supernatural moves used within them creation of characters thumb upright 75 salvador dali influenced design of zeppeli alt a grayscale 1939 photograph of painter salvador dali as part of creation of each character araki wrote down a fictional history for character to prevent inconsistencies while not all information he writes in these is used directly in manga it helps him determine how character should act and react in different situations jonathan and dio protagonist and antagonist were created with duality of light and shadow in mind with intention to have them contrast against each other dio was depicted as an embodiment of evil and jonathan as fundamentally virtuous and just araki also made use of black and white in his art to further contrast two jonathan was designed to be a symbol for story and setting something araki would continue doing with later protagonists in series because araki wanted series to move on with new characters in joestar family jonathan was specifically written as first joestar that would function as a symbol of purity and dignity and not as a unique character this limited what jonathan could do in retrospect araki considered him passive and a bit boring from start of planning of manga araki intended to depict dio as a cool character who descends into villainy thinking that it could be difficult to create an evil antagonist that readers would empathize with araki wrote dio as coming from a poor family with a father with no redeeming qualities whatsoever giving dio motivation to acquire power and get revenge on world even if it led him to do immoral and illegal things araki also noted that a character who acts without regard for morals and laws can give readers a feeling of catharsis due to exhibiting same ugly feelings people hold but cannot show making dio more easily relatable than a character who only does good dio s name was taken directly from italian word for god and was chosen to sound good together with name jojo main supporting character of phantom blood zeppeli was created as a silly teacher in style of martial art masters from jackie chan s films and karate kid with a charm in contrast between how they appear and who they are inside araki designed him with a mustache drawing inspiration from appearances of painter salvador dali and kun character this was considered a gamble as mustachioed characters in shonen magazines were considered to appear old and untrustworthy potentially turning readers off his name comes from rock band led zeppelin and was chosen to balance out large amount of names in series beginning with j character speedwagon was given his name for same reason release phantom blood was originally serialized in shueisha s weekly shonen jump under title jojo s bizarre adventure part 1 jonathan joestar his youth it ran from january 1

depiction of animal cruelty and bad or non existent female roles in story anime news network rebecca silverman appreciated realism in how dio appears perfectly mannered to george while also being sadistically cruel and how series uses a mix between aztec mythology and vampire lore but thought that story could be too cruel for some readers citing animal cruelty as an example she liked how story escalates in intensity and weirdness but criticized it for telling more often than showing and using exclamation marks too much several reviewers criticized artwork in phantom blood for characters

hard to read comicsalliance disliked how art felt derivative of fist of north star at manga news thought that anatomy and posing while fitting tone of story were unlikely and badly drawn luster
