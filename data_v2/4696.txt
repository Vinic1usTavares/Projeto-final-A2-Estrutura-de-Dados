ps7 5 million he became manager bruce rioch s first signing at arsenal and broke club s transfer fee record set at ps2 5 million bergkamp s arrival at club was significant not only because he was an

total football a playing style and philosophy which relied on versatility this was primarily to maximise footballer s potential players tried out every outfield position before finding one that suited them best every age group at ajax played in same style and formation as first team 3 4 3 to allow individuals to slot in without effort when moving up pyramid bergkamp played in every position apart from goalie and believed he benefited from experience of playing as a defender as it helped him know how they think and how to beat them when he made his debut as a substitute against roda jc bergkamp was positioned on right wing where he remained for three years during his time at inter milan bergkamp was switched to position of a main striker but failed to cooperate with his offensive partner ruben sosa whom he later called selfish furthermore due to his introverted character he was accused of lacking consistency and leadership skills by italian press and struggled to replicate his previous form during his time with inter when bergkamp joined arsenal in 1995 he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with wright and in later seasons anelka and henry playing in his preferred position as a creative second striker arrival of overmars in 1997 98 season enhanced bergkamp s play as he was getting more of ball between august and october 1997 he scored seven goals in seven league matches a similar rapport developed between him and ljungberg during 2001 02 season although he was known for his composure and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker where he essentially functioned in number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep lying forward due to his ball skills and creative ability which enabled him to drop deep between lines and link up play a quick elegant intelligent and technically gifted player his excellent first touch quick feet dribbling ability and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations while his attacking movement physique balance and close control allowed him to hold up ball and create space for teammates his vision and passing range with both feet despite being naturally right footed subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on running strikers bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals rather than scoring them himself throughout his playing career bergkamp was accused of diving and was referred to as a cheat and dirty player for retaliating against players who had previously challenged him something his former manager wenger denied in an interview with times in 2004 he said that while he was at inter he realised importance of being mentally tough in order to survive a lot of people there try to hurt you not just physically but mentally as well and coming from easygoing culture in holland i had to adopt a tougher approach there it was a case of two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration coaching career upon retiring bergkamp insisted he would not move into coaching he turned down an offer to scout for arsenal and instead concentrated on travelling and spending time with his family however in april 2008 he began a fast
