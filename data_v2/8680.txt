albany pine bush referred to locally as pine bush is one of largest of 20 inland pine barrens in world it is centrally located in new york s capital district within albany and schenectady counties between cities of albany and schenectady albany pine bush was formed thousands of years ago following drainage of glacial lake albany albany pine bush is sole remaining undeveloped portion of a pine barrens that once covered over and is one of best remaining examples of an inland pine barrens ecosystem in world by 2008 it included all parcels of albany pine bush preserve a state nature preserve spanning properties that connect these protected parcels and some of surrounding areas that abut preserve woodlawn preserve and surrounding areas in schenectady county are western sections of pine bush separated geographically by other properties from albany pine bush preserve in albany county historically regarded as a barren desolate and dangerous to cross pine bush has come to be seen as a historical cultural and environmental asset to capital district and hudson valley regions of new york it is home to karner blue butterfly an endangered species first identified by author vladimir nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from pine bush in 2014 albany pine bush was designated as a national natural landmark by national park service history european colonization around 10 000 years ago native americans moved into pine bush area when europeans arrived in early 17th century two groups lived in immediate area mohawk nation of iroquois to west along mohawk river and mahican to east along hudson river dutch traded with both native groups from their outpost at fort orange present day albany which was established in 1624 for natives pine bush was an important source of firewood and animal pelts to trade with dutch by 1640 natives were having trouble finding enough animals in pine bush to supply growing european demand mohawk referred to settlement at fort orange as meaning beyond pine plains referring to large area of pine bush between hudson and mohawk rivers dutch granted a patent in 1661 under name of schenectady to a settlement on a bend in mohawk river to west of pine bush and about 20 miles from fort orange to settlers at fort orange settlement on mohawk river started by arent van curler was beyond pine plains and therefore name schenectady in various spelling connotations became associated with village at that site in 1664 dutch surrendered their entire colony of new netherland including albany and schenectady to english thumb map of king s highway from albany lower right through pine bush to schenectady upper left in 1767 what became known as king s highway were a series of footpaths which mohawk had long used to get from west in valley through pine bush to trade with other tribes at confluence of hudson and mohawk rivers this area was later site of dutch fort orange after founding of schenectady name was used for what became a major route between two settlements but until mid 18th century it was not improved beyond a footpath during war from 1699 to 1707 albany residents collected firewood from pine bush for large army that was camped at fort frederick in 1710 germans immigrated from palatine to albany area to pay off cost of their passage some were sent to work camps in pine bush to harvest pines for pitch and rosin for construction of english naval vessels some of these immigrants named helderberg escarpment and settled schoharie county others largely from work camps in dutchess county along hudson river settled further west in valley in 1723 past little falls on patent most of latter during french and indian wars british military improved road significantly for use by its forces after war it was used by numerous settlers moving west into mohawk valley during late 18th century taverns and occasional homesteader began to dot pine bush along king s highway while development began to encroach on pine bush at albany and schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow highway and pine bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous even after end of war starting in 1765 militiamen took turns escorting travelers through area to protect them from outlaws bandits smugglers and other dangers during american revolutionary war bush was home to loyalists of british crown among taverns established in 1760s catering to pine bush travelers was truax tavern owned by isaac truax a descendant of french huguenots and a tory sympathizer he said that he was not a tory but a man for king rumors circulated of several murders robberies being carried out at tavern travel became easier in 1793 following revolution when a stage coach began carrying passengers between two cities and through pine bush for three cents per mile 19th century 19th century saw great improvements in modes of transportation for traveling through pine bush with better roads and soon thereafter railroads beginning in 1799 great western turnpike today s us route 20 and albany schenectady turnpike new york route 5 were built through pine bush western turnpike connected albany west across state to american midwest while albany schenectady turnpike replaced king s highway to schenectady mohawk and hudson railroad was chartered in 1826 in order to reduce travel time between schenectady and albany via erie canal it was first railroad in state of new york and fourth in united states on july 2 1830 dewitt clinton pulled first passenger train in united states traveling over route through heart of pine bush over time turnpikes and railroad opened up parts of pine bush to settlement farming and land speculation one of earliest residents was who owned a large farm and manor in what is now hamlet of just outside albany in town of colonie he claimed that sandy soil of pine bush was best land for fruits in world further west part of pine bush was carved up in 1858 into 860 plots as part of what is now known as great land swindle and sold to buyers outside region when they came to inspect their land they thought barrens were useless for agriculture they tried to recoup their money by selling land to other unsuspecting outsiders as in colonial period pine bush continued to be tapped for its natural resources with water becoming a target for development patroon creek roughly where three feeder streams joined in heart of pine bush along albany s northern border was dammed in 1850 to form rensselaer lake waterworks in 1871 northwestern portion of albany west of magazine street consisting of mostly undeveloped pine bush was annexed to neighboring town of guilderland after town of watervliet refused it portions of this territory were ceded to albany in 1910 established its current border a telling perspective of how it was viewed at time is contained in enabling law chapter 375 of laws of new york 1910 which described pine bush as being a territory lying to west of present boundary line of city and which is in large part waste and unoccupied land ownership of which is uncertain this law authorized albany to lay out newly annexed territory into lots and acquire land for a park system to connect rensselaer lake waterworks property to old city border 20th century as part of great migration of african americans out of rural south to industrial cities in early 20th century reverend louis w parson and his wife migrated in 1927 from mississippi to albany where he founded first church of god in christ in four trips to mississippi parson encouraged friends and family to move to albany and join church which many did during 1930s and 1940s reverend felt that mores of albany s south end where they originally settled was not conducive to religious life he started a community in pine bush along rapp road purchasing two undeveloped properties in 1930 and 1933 it is a rare example of a chain migration community surviving from great migration this narrow entity is today designated as rapp road community historic district listed on both state and national register of historic places accompanying 18 photos undated in 1912 city of albany commissioned a study by notable architect arnold w brunner and landscape architect charles downing lay for beautification of city it was published as studies for albany brunner and lay proposed using rensselaer lake waterworks property as core of a new natural park preferably leaving much of grounds in their natural state i n fact less done to it better city never acquired more land for a park here and portions of original waterworks property were sold off piecemeal and developed over following century in 1950s new york state thruway interstate 90 was built through pine bush disrupting habitat and ecology further development took place in 1950s and 60s with construction of w averell harriman state office building campus and suny albany uptown campus in 21st century remaining pine bush represents only about 10 of undeveloped land that existed prior to 1950 in 1960s longtime mayor erastus corning 2nd pushed forward washington avenue extension a four lane divided highway extending washington avenue westward from fuller road through pine bush to new karner road ny route 155 this opened heart of pine bush and western section of city to development and has been described as a knife through heart of pine bush soon afterward neil hellman a race horse magnate and major developer in city proposed a huge city within a city on that would have apartments stores an office park one or two schools and fire and police stations mayor corning estimated between 10 000 and 15 000 persons would live there environmentalists and neighborhood groups fought and ultimately defeated this proposal mayor corning gave archaeologist don rittner a 500 donation in 1972 to excavate truax tavern along king s highway rittner disproved prevailing historical beliefs concerning sophistication and structure of tavern he discovered several skeletons under tavern s floor which may confirm rumors of murders having taken place at tavern as a result of this project rittner was appointed as albany s first municipal archaeologist possibly first of such a position in nation while mayor corning supported largest purchases of pine bush land as a city preserve he also approved placing albany landfill in pine bush construction of washington avenue extension and authorizing much of development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor these all had adverse environmental effects on bush in 1967 a portion of albany s waterworks pine bush property in town of colonie along central avenue was sold to developers who built northway mall two years later city moved its dump to pine bush dunes a single family housing development in middle of pine bush off washington avenue extension was built in mid 1970s in response to these developments concerned citizens worried about future of habitat formed save pine bush in 1978 organization filed lawsuits for next several decades to stop further developments in barrens activist group opposed construction of mall in town of guilderland first proposed in 1978 it was finished in 1984 then expanded to doubled to 1 5 million square feet in 1994 becoming third largest mall in new york widespread regional opposition rose against plans in late 1990s to more than double mall more than 2 million additional square feet of retail space plus a 12 story hotel and activities such as bowling ice skating miniature golf and soccer project was finally dropped in 1999 in 1985 a bill to establish a state controlled preserve to protect pine bush lands never made it out of committee bill was proposed following year by assemblyman robert connor d new city among local politicians who opposed bill was albany mayor thomas whalen iii who sparred with assemblyman connors in a series of letters connors stated if mayor allows final destruction of pine bush city of albany will be an ancient archaeological ruin before pine barren is replaced assemblyman arnold r colonie whose district included portions of proposed preserve opposed on grounds that bill was creating another state agency like adirondack park agency that would wrest control from local communities over their development legislature established albany pine bush preserve commission in 1988 its members consist of representatives of new york state department of environmental conservation new york state office of parks recreation and historic preservation nature conservancy towns of colonie and guilderland and city of albany albany county and four private citizens appointed by governor in 2001 state employees federal credit union sefcu bank branch on new karner road was taken under eminent domain by state to be adapted for use as albany pine bush discovery center located since 1969 in pine bush albany landfill has been expanded several times latest by in 2010 landfill is expected to have seven years of operating life remaining fees paid by other jurisdictions and businesses enable landfill to generate 4 5 million annually to albany budget city residents are provided with free trash collection city committed to spending 18 million to restore pine bush habitat in exchange for gaining approval of 2010 expansion in 1969 when albany opened its landfill city of schenectady set aside its only patch of pine bush as woodlawn preserve designating as a forever wild preserve since then numerous developers have approached city with proposals for development in 2009 schenectady county acted to protect as parkland in neighboring town of niskayuna this is part of woodlawn pine barrens wetlands complex which borders woodlawn preserve county deeded this property to town this action complemented larger plans to connect complex to larger pine bush preserve in albany county albany pine bush discovery center albany pine bush discovery center is a nature center in albany new york with exhibits and activities about albany pine bush preserve s natural history geologic and cultural significance center offers public programs such as teaching programs for school groups guided hikes lectures and after school programs all of which are led by pine bush staff additionally pine bush discovery center staff lead events like invasive species removal programs to allow community members to participating in maintaining pine bush pine bush discovery center also encourages citizen science by running programs such as ant collection where participants can collect and identify ants providing data for pine bush staff to monitor their conservation efforts it occupies a former sefcu credit union bank branch on new karner road geography pine bush is within hudson valley section of appalachian valley and ridge province in state of new york and occupies parts of city of albany and towns of colonie and guilderland within albany county as well as parts of schenectady county to west pine bush includes not only pine barrens but also grasslands of prairie grasses northern and southern successional forests and numerous ravines with some wetlands pine bush ranges in elevation from to above sea level geology thumb soil at albany pine bush exhibiting a thick o horizon above sandy topsoils underlying albany pine bush is a bedrock consisting of shale and siltstone laid down 450 million years ago during middle ordovician bedrock is covered by deposits which make up sandy topsoils of barrens as glaciers of wisconsin glaciation began to recede from hudson valley area a glacial lake known today as lake albany extended across mid and upper hudson valley and a large delta formed west of albany where predecessor of mohawk river flowed into lake along shoreline of lake lacustrine sands were deposited between present day cities of hudson and glens falls this became hudson valley sandplain relieved from weight of glacier land began to rebound and lake receded by draining into hudson river deposits of sand in delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes plants later colonized land and stabilized dunes pine bush originally occupied or 60 000 acres at which point it was largest inland pine barrens in north america ecology flora thumb a typical pine bush landscape alt an area of plants and shrubs growing to well below eye
