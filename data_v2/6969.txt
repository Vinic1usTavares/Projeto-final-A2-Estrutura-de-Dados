hedonic hunger or hedonic hyperphagia is drive to eat to obtain pleasure in absence of an energy deficit particular foods may have a high hedonic rating or individuals may have increased susceptibility to environmental food cues weight loss programs may aim to control or to compensate for hedonic hunger therapeutic interventions may influence hedonic eating behavior background although hunger may arise from energy or nutrient deficits as would be expected in set point theories of hunger and eating hunger may arise more commonly from anticipated pleasure of eating consistent with positive incentive perspective distinguished overeating responses to these stimuli as homeostatic hyperphagia and hedonic hyperphagia respectively accordingly hunger and eating are subject to feedback control from homeostatic hedonic and cognitive processes although these mechanisms interplay and overlap to some extent they can nonetheless be individually separated thus positive incentive perspective suggests that eating is similar to sexual behavior humans engage in sexual behavior not because of an internal deficit but because they have evolved in a way that makes them crave it high calorie foods have had intrinsic reward value throughout evolution presence of desirable or hedonic food or mere anticipation of it makes one hungry psychological effects of hedonic hunger may be appetitive equivalent of driven activities such as recreational drug use and compulsive gambling susceptibility to food cues can lead to overeating in a society of readily available calorie dense inexpensive foods such hedonistic eating overrides body s ability to regulate consumption with satiety a related phenomenon specific appetite also known as specific hunger is conceptually related to but distinct from hedonic hunger specific appetite is a drive to eat foods with specific flavors or other characteristics in usage specific appetite has put greater emphasis on an individual who learns a particular appetite behavior rather than an evolutionarily innate hedonic appetite preference food variability a hedonic rating of foods reflects those individuals are more likely to eat even though they aren t hungry for example functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri scanning suggests that fed rats show a high preference for a mixture of fat and carbohydrate in form of potato chips compared to their standard chow or single macronutrient foods when binge eating occurs without presence of energy deprivation researchers think it is due to frequent exposure to palatable food another study evaluated how hedonic ratings of individual foods aggregate into food components of particular types of meals and related preferences to overall dietary intake interpersonal variability individuals may have increased hedonic hunger susceptibility to environmental food cues genetic variability may influence hedonic hyperphagia variation in hedonic hunger levels from person to person may be key in determining success in weight loss tactics and a person s ability to cope with tempting foods that are readily available to assess this a power of food scale pfs has been developed that quantifies a person s appetitive anticipation not consumption binge eaters obese individuals and those with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa scored higher than restrictive type and normal weight college students a decrease in pfs score leads to better success in weight loss food reinforcement reinforcing value of food refers to how hard someone is willing to work to obtain food food reinforcement is influenced by several factors including food palatability food deprivation and food variety it is also motivated by concerns about fullness expected and hunger that might be experienced in intervening period between meals expected satiety effector mechanisms of food reinforcement depend on dopaminergic activity in brain treatment conceptually weight loss programs might target control of hedonic hunger specific research to determine what diet techniques would be most beneficial for those with an increased hedonic hunger would help people modify their immediate availability of food or its palatability for example whole grain popcorn may be a better choice than potato chips due to a lower calorie load and an increased sense of satiety adding dietary fiber to foods and beverages increases satiety and reduces energy intake at next meal low energy density foods with high power may be useful tools for weight management satiety has been found to be greater with yogurt beverages than fruit juice and was equal with low energy density yogurt with and high energy density yogurt people with high pfs scores may do better with meal replacement products medications may affect hedonic eating behavior glucagon like peptide 1 agonists such as and which are used for diabetes may help suppress food reward behavior inhibition of dopamine transport within brain increases dopamine concentrations which can reduce energy intake despite theoretical underpinnings opiate antagonists as single agents have generally not shown substantial clinical benefit however preliminary data has suggested synergistic effects with concurrent targeted therapy of opiate receptors and either dopamine or receptors bariatric surgery of various types may influence hedonic hunger particularly if accompanied by counseling interventions that reduce automatic hedonic impulses these surgeries may work in part by modifying production of gastrointestinal hormones particularly by increasing glucagon like peptide 1 and peptide yy reduction of ghrelin has been inconsistent physiological mechanisms hedonic hunger show a positive correlation between plasma of 2 glycerol 2 ag and ghrelin during hedonic but not eating and consumption of food for pleasure is characterized by increased peripheral levels of both peptides and this two endogenous rewarding chemical signals influences food intake and ultimately body mass see also eating disorder ghrelin glucagon like peptide 1 agonist melanin concentrating hormone peptide yy specific appetite references category
