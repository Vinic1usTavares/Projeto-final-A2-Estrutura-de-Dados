which has a circumference of only once called paris of east for its exciting social life and tropical forests island was devastated by invading army of japanese and also by an earthquake which had struck island in 1941 and it now appears more like a jungle clad lost city history earliest known effort to establish a penal colony was by archibald blair who found remoteness of island as ideal for such a colony but his initiative failed to go beyond 1796 as malaria prevented it first war of indian independence in 1857 rekindled interest of british administration in india to establish a penal colony in andaman islands for political prisoners first group of 200 prisoners were transported under control of dr james pattison walker from calcutta deportees included many prominent leaders of movement an islamic reform movement and subsequent revolution prisoners landed at andaman islands on 10 march 1858 walker soon put convicts on arduous task of clearing dense forest of ross island building their own shelters and other buildings and laying roads prisoners were chained and collared around neck with identity tags and were in a poor state of health in beginning there were no basic amenities during rainy season they had to live in tents in november 1858 temporary barrack type huts with walls made of mats and with leaking thatched roofs provided accommodation for about 1 000 prisoners at one stage of 8 000 prisoners who had been transported to islands under penal project 3 500 had died due to sickness sir robert napier who came to port blair to investigate found conditions beyond comprehension as there was no food clothing and shelter provided to convicts however ross island was comparatively a better place than in earlier initial years as colonel rc tytler and his wife harriet had improved facilities for community tytler had been posted as superintendent of convict settlement also known as british gulag from april 1862 to february 1864 he tried to improve conditions at camp where death rate of prisoners was 700 per year at that time doctors at camp reported that only 45 prisoners out of 10 000 were considered medically fit according to reports in 1870s intense rain malaria pneumonia and dysentery caused many deaths during this time authorities also embarked on testing of pharmaceutical drugs like quinine cinchona alkaloid by forcibly feeding it to 10 000 prisoners which resulted in severe side effects such as nausea diarrhea and depression as result prisoners started injuring each other so that authorities would hang them instead a new system of flogging and a reduced diet was introduced and they were made to sleep in a kind of trellis work cage prisoners also faced hardships from indigenous tribes some of whom were cannibals who tortured and killed them while working in field and also attacked colony in 1891 there were 12 197 convicts who had been exported from british india some of convicts who were freed were engaged in agriculture and those who were forced to do service were given monetary compensation of us 25 per month however even then escape from penal colony was impossible and any escapee who tried was killed at beginning of world war i in 1914 dr robert of germany had noted that 15 000 political prisoners at penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage following capture of island by a german ship by bombardment was risky he suggested that after due care and adequate security had been put in place convicts of penal colony could be shifted to mainland in small boats from time of its establishment in 1858 till it was disbanded on 7 october 1945 penal colony was administered by 24 chief commissioners this deserted fortress is now a tourist attraction notable events four days after their first landing on island one of convicts narain who had been convicted for sedition tried to escape but was caught and shot dead another prisoner singh who was a deserter committed suicide by hanging when 81 out of 288 inmates tried to escape they were savagely attacked by aboriginal people of andamans which made them turn back to prison camp seeking medical help however all of them were summarily put to death by hanging in one single day jp grant president in council in calcutta complained to higher authorities but walker was not reprimanded instead he put convicts at penal colony into an iron collar to prevent them from escape finally on 3 october 1859 he was removed from penal settlement as he had suggested branding convicts on their forearms with information of crime and sentence that they had been given on 23 april 1858 out of 91 escapees one person who was saved by andamanese people was tiwari a political prisoner he was absorbed into aboriginal culture married two of their girls and learned their language however when andamanese were on verge of mounting a massive attack on penal colony on 16 may 1859 he ran away and secretly conveyed this information to superintendent aboriginals attacked camp with bows and arrows but were completely routed by superior weapons of british this battle came to be known as battle of aberdeen
