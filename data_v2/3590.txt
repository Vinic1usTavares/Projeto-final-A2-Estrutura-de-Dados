coropuna is a dormant stratovolcano in southern peruvian andes that lies within central volcanic zone it has several summits highest of which reaches an altitude of above sea level volcano is from city of arequipa and is mostly made of ignimbrites and lava flows on a basement formed by earlier ignimbrites and lava flows some of which may have been formed by coropuna itself coropuna has been active for at least five million years with bulk of current cone having formed during quaternary coropuna has had two or three holocene eruptions 2 100 200 and either 1 100 100 or 700 200years ago which generated lava flows plus an additional eruption which may have taken place some 6 000 years ago current activity occurs exclusively in form of hot springs coropuna is covered by a thick ice cap largest in tropics with a number of outlet glaciers during last glacial maximum it expanded to a size of over ice cap is in retreat with some variation in retreat rates 2018 estimates imply that ice cap will persist until about 2120 retreat of coropuna glaciers threatens water supply of tens of thousands of people and interaction between volcanic activity and glacial effects has generated mudflows that could be a hazard to surrounding populations if mountain were to erupt again because of this peruvian geological agency ingemmet monitors coropuna and has published a hazard map for volcano there is no vegetation at higher altitudes but below elevation there are various vegetation belts which include trees peat bogs grasses and also agricultural areas and pastures people have lived on coropuna for millennia mountain was regarded as sacred by inca and a number of archaeological sites have been discovered there including inca sites of maucallacta and acchaymarca mountain was considered to be one of most important inca religious sites in their realm human sacrifices were offered to it and mountain is worshipped to this day volcano also appears in legends name in quechua word means plateau and is a common component of toponyms such as at coro coro bolivia but its etymological meaning is unclear name may mean puna of gold golden mountain cold snowy or cut off at top name is also spelled as there is also another volcano in andahua volcanic field which shares same name but it is completely separate geography and geomorphology coropuna lies in andes of peru on border between castilla and provinces of arequipa department towns around volcano belong to chuquibamba pampacolca and viraco districts volcano can be reached on paved roads that come to town of andahua either from arequipa or through from pan american highway roads also pass along northern and western sides of volcano regional coropuna is part of mountain range which contains almost a hundred glaciers and is only from pacific ocean more generally coropuna is part of andes longest mountain chain in world which reaches from tierra del fuego in south to venezuela and runs along coast of pacific ocean city of arequipa is located southeast from volcano a number of villages surround volcano from northwest clockwise around mountains these are arma maucallacta purhua purhua amayani patilla viques cabra grande pampacolca santa maria toma de and huayllaura there are no habitations above elevation agriculture and animal husbandry are most important economic activities in region but mining of precious metals takes place with copper and gold being prospected volcano is part of central volcanic zone one of four volcanic belts of andes among volcanoes of this zone are 44 many of highest in several volcanoes with glaciers important volcanoes in southern peru are from northwest to southeast sara sara solimana coropuna ampato hualca hualca sabancaya chachani misti ubinas huaynaputina tutupaca yucamane and casiri aside from stratovolcanoes large calderas of neogene age are located close to coropuna sixteen volcanoes in peru are considered to be active or potentially active including huaynaputina which in 1600 had a major eruption with a volcanic explosivity index of 6 which claimed over 1 500 victims and caused devastation in southern peru local general outline thumb right alt an elongated snow covered ridge rises from a dark landscape with valleys coropuna seen from south in 1988 seen from above coropuna has a pear shaped outline and is a long ridge with an eastwest trend that features four separate domes forming summits and broad saddles between domes in addition there is a dome north of eastwest trend a high subsidiary peak named cerro cuncaicha lies east of coropuna and is a stratovolcano coropuna covers a surface area of and its domes rise about above surrounding plateau volcano is formed from alternating layers of ignimbrite and lava and consists of coalesced stratovolcanoes and seven separate coulees ice cover makes it difficult to discern its structure but about six separate peaks have been counted as well as six not readily recognizable summit craters additional lava domes form a southeastward trending line on southwestern side of volcano and dikes crop out close to lake pallarcocha it has further been suggested that coropuna overlies margin of a buried caldera coropuna is capped with snow and ice its flanks consist of glaciated terrain old lava flows with gentle slopes and blocky lava crop out from underneath ice regions of hydrothermally altered rocks lava flows pyroclastic flows and areas covered by volcanic ash occur all around mountain glacial activity has eroded these volcanic rocks carving valleys into them or removing them altogether this process created u shaped valleys such as buenavista cospanja and on southern flank and mapa mayo rio blanco and ullulo on northern slopes there are several collapse scarps on mountain especially around its central sector a sector collapse took place on southwestern flank and formed a landslide deposit as well as a horseshoe shaped valley that was later filled by glaciers also on southern side mud water flow deposits have been found in capiza river valley and appear to relate to coropuna at least eight such debris flows have been identified and some lahars have reached colca river valley lahars are dangerous phenomena owing to their high speed and density causing large scale destruction and fatalities lakes and rivers thumb right alt a barren rock strewn terrain with two ice covered mountains in background to left lies a blue lake and to right a scarp coropuna seen from lake lake pallarcocha is situated on southwestern flank on formerly glaciated terrain and additional lakes lie on flanks of coropuna including laguna pucaylla on its northeastern side a number of streams and rivers originate on mountain clockwise around coropuna these include quebrada rio amayani on northern side quebrada chinchina quebrada quebrada with lake laguna caracara quebrada buena vista quebrada rio on southern flank rio de huayllaura on southwestern flank quebrada del quebrada sigue chico and quebrada sepulturayoc on western flank rio blanco and rio amayani eventually form rio arma while rio capiza discharges water from coropuna to colca river during dry season most of these rivers do not carry substantial discharge volcano is situated on a drainage divide to west rio arma is a tributary of river while to east colca river is part of majes river watershed an endorheic area that receives meltwater from volcano also exists northeast from coropuna on pampa pucaylla where lake of same name is also located surrounding terrain coropuna rises above surrounding terrain from a base elevation of and about on southern side where rio has incised underlying basement almost to foot of volcano forming sharp amphitheatre like valleys in general many deep valleys cut into flanks of volcano and give mountain an impressive topographic relief region is characterized by high plateaus separated by deep canyons including some of world s deepest gorges that reach depths of apart from river erosion giant landslides have affected altiplano below coropuna such as chuquibamba landslide which took place over last 120 000years in form of multiple collapse events within a fault controlled basin geomorphologically coropuna lies at edge of altiplano high plateau on western cordillera mountain range in central andes this mountain chain is split into two western and eastern by altiplano basin and firura volcano lie north of coropuna while solimana volcano is northwest from coropuna sara sara is another volcano in area a large lava dome lies northwest of coropuna while cerro pumaranra a eroded volcano is to northeast several lakes are situated on eastern side of volcano west southwest from coropuna lies high while andahua valley of volcanoes is northeast east of coropuna elevation and size thumb right alt a gentle ice covered ridge with hump like summits coropuna este coropuna is largest and highest volcano in peru highest mountain in cordillera ampato and peru s third highest mountain most commonly cited maximum height for volcano is which refers to northwestern dome of mountain also known as coropuna casulla other estimates on coropuna s maximum height are which would make it 22nd highest mountain in andes on western summit or varying snow elevations might also lead to varying height estimates estimates on height of coropuna have changed over time in 19th century it was one of candidates for highest mountain in peru with mountains in cordillera blanca making up other candidates with mapa del peru map of peru of antonio raimondi giving an estimated height of in 1910 it was believed that volcano was over high and thus highest mountain in south america ahead of although a north american expedition during preceding year had determined that coropuna was not highest mountain in peru as it only found an elevation of and huascaran is higher than this coropuna has several summits up to ten according to one count which exceed elevation plus a northern summit some have names such as high northern high western high central in western sector of volcano in central and in eastern sector ice cap thumb right ice cap seen from space in 2010 alt a roughly pear shaped ice area from which valleys emanate lies within a multicolored landscape as seen from a satellite image coropuna features an ice cap consisting of three ice domes and many glaciers and is largest ice cap of tropics as of 2014 it was wide and long it is larger than ice cap at quelccaya farther northeast which was considered to be largest but has since shrunk to a size less than coropuna s a subsidiary peak named cerro cuncaicha east of coropuna has a small ice cap as well in general peruvian glaciers form bulk of world s tropical glaciers perennial snow fields are present on coropuna sometimes making it hard to measure true extent of glaciation or glacier retreat on average ice cap of coropuna is about thick with maximum thicknesses exceeding in ice cap had a volume of about snow water equivalents ice cores have been taken from coropuna ice cap and from a summit crater one of these ice cores covers a timespan beginning from 20 000years ago penitentes reaching heights of and occur on glaciers while debris cover is rare ice cap also features ice falls and dangerous lakes mudflows lahars originated from ice cap and left deposits at bottom of valleys glaciers and periglacial phenomena a number of glaciers flow down from ice cap their number variously estimated to be between 23 17 and 15 some glaciers have been named on southwestern flank two glaciers are known as 1 and 2 three 1 through 3 and six 1 through 6 eighteen separate accumulation areas have been found as well there are no substantive valley glaciers presently on coropuna and some glaciers especially in eastern side emanate from cirques ongoing downward movement of ice on coropuna produces glaciers descend to elevations of about on southern flank and to about on northern flank this is higher than freezing level owing to dry climate freezing level at coropuna lies at about elevation in 1955 ice limits were located at elevations of on southern and at on northern flank moraines are mostly found on coropuna s northern and southern side and reach lengths of with longer moraines on northern flank in general moraines on coropuna are steep and have prominent crests as they are little eroded grey coloured fresh moraines up to from ice cap may reflect position of glaciers before onset of glacier retreat which has left small mounds that often contain ice between these moraines and ice cap and small discontinuous moraines apart from normal glaciers 78 rock glaciers have been counted on coropuna but only 11 of them are considered to be active permafrost has also been reported on coropuna gelifluction patterned grounds solifluction and other periglacial landforms are noticeable at over elevation recent area and retreat alt while individual trend series of extent of coropuna s ice cap often heavily diverge from each other a strong declining tendency is noticeable thumb 500x500px extent of ice cap over years from various sources measuring surface area of coropuna s ice cap is difficult as seasonal snow can be mistaken for ice and different studies come to various conclusions about retreat rate due to use of different time periods and methodological practices however all studies conclude that net retreat trend is obvious and that ice cap is diminishing retreat rates shortly before 2009 reached in only between 1980 and 2014 ice cap shrank at a rate of with a 2015 estimate amounting to and a brief slowdown observed during late 1990s and early 2000s total shrinkage has been estimated to amount to between 1962 and 2000 and by between 1955 and 2007 coropuna ice cap retreat follows pattern recorded elsewhere in peru such as in cordillera blanca cordillera and mountains ampato quelccaya and sabancaya all of this retreat is attributed to global warming and tends to increase during el nino years owing to a drier climate glaciers lose mass through both sublimation and melting this meltwater rarely forms streams though some do exist quebrada ullulo on northern side is largest such meltwater stream glacial history before first human settlement of area ice cap on coropuna was much larger than today with its surface exceeding and its glaciers descending to much lower elevations additionally glaciers also expanded from mountains pumaranra pucaylla and cuncaicha to east of coropuna and covered pampa pucaylla northeast from coropuna and descended valley and other valleys to east glacial valleys radiate from coropuna and landforms are associated with moraines regional climate oscillations are recorded in ice masses of coropuna glacial history of volcano has been reconstructed with tephrochronology using dated tephra layers such as those from 1600 huaynaputina eruptions radiocarbon dating and surface exposure dating using helium 3 three separate moraine generations and about five separate glacial stages have been recorded on volcano glacial advances on coropuna appear to be synchronous to advances of ice sheets in northern hemisphere glaciers developed on other mountains in region as well last glacial maximum during last glacial maximum lgm 25 00020 000years ago valley glaciers on coropuna were considerably longer than today and occupied glacial valleys up to deep and long glaciers formed tall moraines with as much as relief in length in width at crest and a cover of boulders and gravel they include both lateral moraines and terminal moraines where outlet glaciers ended on northern flank moraine systems have been observed in santiago ullulo quenua ranra cuncaicha and valleys while southeastern flank was covered by glaciers in viques cospanja buena vista este buena vista oeste and valleys rock bars occur in some glacial valleys on southern and southwestern side of volcano there are large cirques around cerro cuncaicha lgm ice cap had an area of at least with glaciers descending to elevation down to north and west probably due to airflow mediated variations in sublimation longest glacier reached a length of in quebrada ullulo growth of ice cap has been explained by a temperature drop of about assuming constant precipitation and a decrease in elevation of equilibrium line altitude retreat of these glaciers commenced between 12 000 and 11 000years ago other glacial periods ice has been present on coropuna for at least 80 000years and at least two pre lgm advances spread beyond area that was covered with ice during lgm with an expansion occurring in particular in eastern sector of volcano moraines older than marine isotope stage 2 are widespread those close to village of viraco may date back 40 00045 000years and thus be part of an earlier glaciation and old dates of 47 00031 000 and 61 000years ago in huayllaura and sigue chico valleys could reflect even larger glacier expansions during marine isotope stage 3 or 4 glaciers retreated after end of last glacial maximum 20 000years ago and then re expanded during lateglacial a group of moraines formed between position of lgm moraines and position of recent moraines with one lateglacial advance dated to either 13 000 or 13 900years ago full glacial conditions lasted until 10 0009 000years ago minor advances took place about 13 0009 000 yearsago and again some 6 000 yearsago late glacial advances coincide with similar glacier expansions worldwide and some of them may correlate with younger dryas cold period or antarctic cold reversal during little ice age glaciers on coropuna did not expand much although some rock glaciers might have formed during that time glaciers descended to elevation importance as a source of water glaciers in peru are important sources of water for local communities and for hydropower generation especially during dry season their shrinkage is thus of concern in cordillera blanca it has been estimated that about 30percent of dry season runoff comes from glaciers meltwater from glaciers on coropuna sustains baseflow of rivers during dry periods coropuna is an important source of water for valleys of surrounding areas and for desert like piedmont with an estimated 38 000 people depending directly or indirectly on water originating from it this water supply is threatened by retreat of glaciers and would require costly mitigation measures to compensate for its reduction peruvian government is making preparations for coropuna ceasing to be a contributor to local water supply by 2025 however a 2018 study and reevaluation of past data has concluded that icecap should persist until about 2120 and recommends that greater in situ monitoring of coropuna s glaciers is needed to aid future planning and mitigation geology regional setting thumb tectonic plates in south america alt south america is mostly part of one plate but there is a plate boundary west of its coast off coast of peru nazca plate subducts beneath south america plate at a rate of this subduction process along with subduction of antarctic plate also underneath south america plate is responsible for volcanism in andes and uplift of mountain chain andes in area of coropuna are still uplifting in cordillera occidental western cordillera uplift commenced about 50million years ago in eocene paused until 25 ago in oligocene and increased substantially after about 10million years ago in miocene coropuna is part of volcanic arc of southern peru and is considered to be a member of barroso volcanic arc there are over six hundred volcanoes in southern peru and entire cordillera occidental from southern peru to northern chile is covered with volcanic rocks although present day volcanic activity is scarce many of older volcanoes are deeply eroded by glaciation while younger volcanoes often still resemble cones volcanic activity in andes occurred during three eras first was between 195 and years ago in early jurassic and led to chocolate formation second between 78 and 50million years ago late cretaceous to early eocene generated toquepala formation and andean batholiths volcanic activity in southern peru commenced about 13million years ago in miocene first one volcanic being folded and covered by a second lava and tuff unit which in turn was followed by emplacement of large volcanoes ignimbrites and stratovolcano activity at times subdivided into a rhyolitic and an andesitic formation alternated stratigraphy coropuna is constructed atop of 14million year old ignimbrites and lava flows of neogene age individual ignimbrites crop out mainly in valleys while they are buried beneath more recent volcanic products on highlands volcanic basement includes miocene to plio pleistocene tacaza huaylillas sencca and barroso formations latter formation includes coropuna itself below these formations lie sedimentary murco and socosani formations and yura group which are sediments of jurassic cretaceous age with intruded plutons of same age finally there is a basal complex of precambrian age faults and lineaments basement is cut by faults and lineaments such as pampacolca fault on southern side of volcano and pumaranra and cerro casulla lineaments which trend and respectively one east west lineament may have influenced recent volcanism and alignment of coropuna with sara sara solimana and el misti may indicate a tectonic control on volcano in general holocene normal faults especially on southern flank of coropuna have offset lava flows and streams composition rocks erupted by coropuna are dark brown or black and porphyritic and consist of andesite dacite rhyodacite rhyolite trachy basaltic andesite trachyandesite and more recent lava flows have been of dacitic or composition phases include amphibole biotite plagioclase pyroxene and titanomagnetite aside from volcanic rocks deposits of salts sulfur and travertine produced by hot springs are found on southern flank volcanic rocks define a calc alkaline potassium rich suite which resembles that of other volcanoes in region such as tutupaca and chilean volcanoes they also contain large amounts of rubidium strontium and barium and appear to have originated through complicated processes of crystallization and interaction with earth s crust eruption history volcano began growing either over five million years ago during pliocene or during late miocene but most of its structure developed during quaternary volcanic activity has been subdivided into two stages now mostly eroded coropuna i which was characterized by explosive eruptions such as volcanic ash pyroclastic flows and pumice but also lava flows and coropuna ii above elevation which has erupted lava flows from now snow covered vents a coropuna iii sequence has also been proposed and most recent eruption products have been described as andahua group other volcanoes in peru such as chachani and sara sara have similar histories about 5 3million years ago volcano was active southwest from coropuna while pumaranra is of pliocene to quaternary age a major ignimbrite eruption took place about two million years ago at coropuna its deposits have been identified west of volcano and it led to destruction of edifice which later re formed on remains of old volcano in addition upper sencca ignimbrite lower sencca ignimbrite and chuquibamba huaylillas ignimbrite may have originated here as well latter was produced by a volcanic explosivity index 7 class super eruption between 14 3 and 13 2million years ago in middle miocene upper sencca ignimbrites form a thick apron around coropuna volcano and other regional volcanoes these ignimbrites form a compound ignimbrite which was deposited between 2 09 and 1 years ago in pleistocene coropuna appears to have formed on top of one of upper sencca ignimbrite vents volcanic activity continued into pleistocene after a hiatus several lava flows on western and central sides of coropuna have been dated yielding ages ranging from 410 000 9 000 to 62 600 4 300years ago during last glacial maximum coropuna was inactive and moraines buried its lava flows however one or two tephra layers on a moraine close to village of viraco on southern side have been dated to be about 41 000 and 30 00031 000years old these ages correspond to radiocarbon ages of 37 370 1 160 and 27 200 300years these tephras may have originated in fissure eruptions associated with three recent lava flows in postglacial times lava bombs lapilli and volcanic ash were deposited on previously glaciated terrain pumice deposits may have formed during holocene holocene no eruptions of coropuna during historical or modern times are known and volcano was formerly considered to be long extinct however young looking a a lava or block lava flows were erupted during holocene and in part overlie late glacial moraines their vents are now hidden beneath glacier ice and flows have been affected by later glacial advances these lava flows are found on and northeast side of mountain a northwesterly lava flow which is coropuna s longest lava flow occupies cerro sepulturayoc valley and runs for it has been dated to about 6 000years ago but research published in 2019 has suggested it may have erupted somewhat earlier during late glacial period a long southeasterly flow lies in cospanja valley and is either 1 100 100 or 700 200years old latter age being derived from cosmogenic isotope dating it was probably formed during a single eruption a dark young looking long northeasterly lava flow is located in quenua ranra valley its deposition was preceded by eruption of lava bombs that cover valley and by production of a lahar that advanced from its source eruption took place about 2 100 200years ago according to cosmogenic isotope dating whether a secondary lava flow in same valley occurred at same time or later is not clear as that flow has not yet been dated ages of flows indicate an eastward shift in activity and southeasterly and northeasterly flows may have been erupted within 500 years from same fissure while eruption of northwesterly flow might be a consequence of retreat of ice cap these lava flows are most recent manifestation of volcanic activity and they imply that coropuna is still active it is thus considered to be a dormant volcano rather than an extinct one there is no evidence of holocene tephras in peat bog drill cores and volcanism at coropuna since last ice age has been primarily effusive present day status thumb steam rising on coropuna este volcano is still hydrothermally active six hot springs are found on coropuna mostly on southeastern foot such as at viques and aguas calientes and on its northern flank at loma their water temperatures range between with exception of last two which are situated in glacial terrain these hot springs rise within valleys via rock fractures geochemical analyses of water from these springs published in 2015 show no major variations in composition implying a stable volcanic system whether solfataric or fumarolic activity occurs at coropuna is unclear and thick glaciation indicates that summit craters have no thermal activity some of hot springs on coropuna are used for bathing volcano had been considered a potential site for geothermal power production but research published in 1998 concluded that available energy of coropuna area was insufficient first volcano activity report published in 2018 noted ongoing seismic activity involving volcano tectonic earthquakes seismic swarms were observed at coropuna after 2001 southern peru earthquake and were possibly triggered by that earthquake observations of deformation of volcanic edifice have shown that gravitational instability and soil water absorption result in movements of part of volcano but as a whole coropuna shows no evidence of volcanic deformation hazards and monitoring peruvian instituto geologico minero y metalurgico ingemmet monitors coropuna volcano for activity it uses data such as composition of hot spring waters and shape of volcano as estimated by satellite images gps and geodesy as well as information from five seismic stations a volcanic hazard map has been published and there are regular status reports published by peruvian government about 90 000 people live in risk areas and sites most in danger are towns on steep southern valleys together with el misti sabancaya and ubinas coropuna is considered to be one of peru s most dangerous volcanoes presence of an ice cap and therefore risk of incandescent volcanic rocks melting that ice creates a hazard of lahars or mudflows such as those that in 1985 killed over 23 000 people at nevado del ruiz volcano in colombia risk to life is further increased by coropuna s steep slopes and by concentration of people in nearby valleys terrain around volcano has one of greatest topographic reliefs in world and a number of towns lie on floor of majes valley right down to pacific ocean where district capital with 20 000 inhabitants is situated although there is no evidence of past mudflows of such size lahars could reach as far as coast affecting a number of towns and infrastructure such as roads antennas and small hydropower plants according to 2007 census 11 people lived in provinces that span coropuna and lie downstream of it lava flows are also a potential danger at coropuna other hazards with lesser probabilities are directed volcanic blasts lava dome collapses fast moving massive pyroclastic flows and flows of pumice and volcanic ash lava bombs and shock waves from volcanic explosions climate precipitation coropuna lies between semi humid altiplano and arid western slope of andes its climate is semi arid with precipitation at elevation reaching other reported precipitation values range between and lower down mountain at altitudes between at annual precipitation levels increase to between semi humid but further down at altitudes around they decrease again to desert most precipitation falls as hail or snow this happens mostly during summer wet season between december and march when itcz moves south and a summer monsoon is active over south america cold water brought from antarctica along pacific ocean by humboldt current plus presence of a stable anticyclone and of a temperature inversion over pacific as well as andean rainshadow are all responsible for this dryness most precipitation is brought by easterly winds coming from amazon and atlantic ocean whereas westerly winds that dominate during dry season do not carry much moisture thus humidity generally decreases in a westward direction amount of precipitation is modulated by el nino southern oscillation during phases of el nino weather is drier snow cover smaller and glacier retreat increases over longer precipitation in region increases whenever iceberg discharge and cooling occur in north atlantic this was case during heinrich events and younger dryas when lakes formed on bolivian altiplano formed about 25 000years ago tauca about 18 00014 000 and 13 00011 000years ago cold periods in southern hemisphere such as antarctic cold reversal between 14 500 12 900years ago may have pushed polar front north and increased precipitation as well that increased precipitation may have delayed retreat of coropuna s glaciers after end of last glacial maximum coropuna experienced moist conditions during early holocene whereas late holocene beginning 5 200years ago was drier there with a pronounced dry period lasting from 5 200 to 3 000years ago warm fluctuations between about 2 200 and 900years ago plus a cold fluctuation around 970 1010 ad are also recorded temperatures temperatures decrease with altitude and at lower elevations around they average between they average and at elevation they average at altitudes above they remain below zero temperatures fluctuate more over daily timescales than over seasonal ones when measured close to glaciers southerly cold waves can sometimes reach coropuna leaving traces in ice cores in form of southern pollen during little ice age at elevation temperatures decreased to vegetation fauna and agriculture thumb yareta on coropuna alt cushion shaped plants grow in a wide rock strewn valley most of region is covered by puna grassland with exception of isolated polylepis woods to southwest of volcano plus other different vegetation types to west and southeast peat bogs are present on southern and southwestern sides of coropuna and some of these have been drilled to obtain sediment cores elsewhere agriculture is widespread around coropuna insects such as beetles and hymenopterans birds such as andean condor and mammals such as vicuna occur in region several new species of butterfly have been discovered there mountain has several distinct vegetation belts between lies steppe vegetation with ambrosia shrubs and cacti irrigation permits cultivation of garlic olive onion potato rice sugar cane and wheat pastures are also present steppe vegetation is also present between in pre puna but it is denser here and includes shrubs of family asteraceae such as ambrosia and senecio crops grown here include alfalfa but there is also some dairy farming and planting of eucalyptus and pine trees as a wood supply for local population between lies a so called supra tropical facies on soils overlying lava flows it includes shrubs and thorny vegetation in very wet and very dry areas respectively agriculture is practised here including growing of maize quinoa and vegetables on anthropogenic soils and terraced fields dominant natural plants between include herbaceous plants of families fabaceae and as well as shrubs of asteraceae between vegetation is found in marshes and peat bogs where sufficient water is available in form of relic polylepis woodlands as well as herbaceous puna vegetation which is particularly prolific during wet season these areas are used for pasture of alpacas and llamas and for fishing in wetlands and polylepis woods hamlets are found close to wetlands and forests plant genera found here include baccharis calamagrostis festuca senecio and stipa above lies so called puna brava with herbs and deep rooted plants that have all adapted to withstand permafrost conditions cushion plant yareta which is used as a fuel source is dominant plant in this belt other plants from apiaceae and asteraceae also occur vegetation including grass and yareta grows up to about elevation higher elevations are unvegetated archaeology and religious importance numerous archaeological sites lie on coropuna especially at southern and northern bases of volcano and on its western slope some of these western sites are on ice cap among these are tombs such as proposals have been made to make area of coropuna including these archaeological sites into a protected area coastal regions of peru were first occupied between 11 0009 000years bc evidence of presence of hunter gatherers near coropuna first appear in archaeological record in caves of cavalca and respectively north and south of volcano in latter cave rock paintings interpreted as being 7 0003 000years bc have been found first human activity at coropuna in cuncaicha cave north of volcano began shortly after final retreat of glaciers from mountain region around volcano was settled over last 4 000years inca times a larger number of archaeological sites go back to 2nd intermediate period and during inca era inca expanded preexisting irrigation and terrace systems which are in part still existing today including highest irrigation system in world which was possibly constructed on coropuna to allow cultivation of bitter potatoes inca sites are often found at higher elevations than sites left by preceding civilizations highest one is located at elevation and there is evidence of inca presence to elevation in addition an important branch of inca road system passes by western foot of coropuna region was densely populated close location of mountains and favorable climatic conditions facilitated its settlement as noted by spanish chroniclers such as pedro de cieza de leon coropuna played an important role in inca religion and an important temple was situated there possibly at maucallacta pedro de cieza de leon considered coropuna to be fifth most important holy site of inca empire one archaeological site on volcano may have been a stopover for religious ceremonies to its summit capacocha a form of human sacrifice were offered to mountain and reportedly in 1965 a mummy was found there maucallacta and acchaymarca among archaeological sites at coropuna is important inca site of maucallacta on southwestern flank of mountain some of structures there were built to evoke appearance of mountain a royal residence an oracle and a political unit were associated with maucallacta and oracle of coropuna would have answered rulers queries all year round maucallacta site was probably most important one at coropuna in addition western summit today known as la nina was apparently also significant another important site associated with coropuna is acchaymarca to west of mountain where about 280 inca stone structures have been found it is likely that many pilgrims came there for ceremonies honouring apus of coropuna and solimana mythology religion and legends coropuna was considered to be most important god apu of region second most important in cosmology of andes and a holy mountain it was particularly important for town of sometimes coropuna is seen as a male entity while solimana volcano is seen as a female one today st francis of assisi is sometimes localized at top of mountain by pious people and mountain is used in mortuary rites to this day mountain was also considered to be an abode of dead where deceased ended up and was a large village of departed in different mythologies coropuna is instead starting point for deceased on a journey to or place where local populations originated from a poorly recorded set of legends is associated with coropuna one story narrates how a brother tried to deceive this mountain and some others but was turned into a deer while a second tells of a conflict between coropuna and other local mountains against an inca a third story states that a troupe was transporting precious metals for coropuna and solimana when animal leading it was shot by a hunter mountains then castrated hunter climbing archaeological findings made on coropuna indicate that inca may have reached summit annie peck and hiram bingham iii each reached a summit of coropuna in 1911 annie peck raised a banner saying votes for women on summit she had ascended which was slightly lower than one reached by bingham this banner action was part of women s suffrage campaigns that were taking place at that time and meant to illustrate that women were just as capable as men of physical deeds since then other summits of mountain have been ascended as well rugged area offers mountaineering opportunities coropuna is
