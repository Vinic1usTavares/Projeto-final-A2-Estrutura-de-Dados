henry garnet july 1555 3 may 1606 sometimes henry garnett was an english jesuit priest executed for his complicity in gunpowder plot of 1605 born in heanor derbyshire he was educated in nottingham and later at winchester college before he moved to london in 1571 to work for a publisher there he professed an interest in legal studies and in 1575 he travelled to continent and joined society of jesus he was ordained in rome some time around 1582 in 1586 garnet returned to england as part of jesuit mission soon succeeding father william weston as jesuit superior following latter s capture by english authorities garnet established a secret press which lasted until late 1588 and in 1594 he interceded in wisbech stirs a dispute between secular and regular clergy he preferred a passive approach to problems catholics faced in england approving of disclosure by catholic priests of existence of 1603 bye plot and exhorting english catholics not to engage in violent rebellion in summer 1605 garnet met with robert catesby a religious zealot who unknown to him planned to kill protestant king james i existence of catesby s gunpowder plot was revealed to him by father oswald tesimond on 24 july 1605 but as information was received under seal of confessional he felt that canon law prevented him from speaking out instead without telling anyone of what catesby planned he wrote to his superiors in rome urging them to warn english catholics against use of force when plot failed garnet went into hiding but he was eventually arrested on 27 january 1606 he was taken to london and interrogated by privy council whose members included john popham edward coke and robert cecil 1st earl of salisbury imprisoned in tower of london his conversations with fellow prisoner edward oldcorne were monitored by eavesdroppers and his letters to friends such as anne vaux were intercepted his guilt announced at end of his trial on 28 march 1606 was a foregone conclusion criticised for his use of equivocation which coke called open and broad lying and forswearing and attacked for not warning authorities of what catesby planned he was sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered he was executed on 3 may 1606 early life henry garnet or garnett was born some time around july 1555 at heanor in derbyshire son of brian garnet or garnett and alice nee jay he had at least five siblings two brothers richard and john and three sisters margaret eleanor and anne all of whom became nuns at louvain henry studied at grammar school in nottingham where from 1565 his father was master following his election as a scholar on 24 august 1567 in 1568 he entered winchester college where he apparently excelled his love of music and rare and delightful voice were complemented by an ability to perform songs without preparation and he was reportedly also skilled with lute father thomas wrote that garnet was prime scholar of winchester college very skilful in music and in playing upon instruments very modest in his countenance and in all his actions so much that schoolmasters and wardens offered him very great friendship to be placed by their means in new college oxford rome thumb upright garnet s superior in rome claudio acquaviva garnet did not enter new college instead late in 1571 he left winchester for london there he worked for a legal publisher richard as a proof reader and corrector he often dined with sir john popham who as lord chief justice was to preside over trial of gunpowder plotters men whose association with garnet would eventually prove so fateful although garnet professed to popham an interest in legal studies in 1575 he sailed for portugal with giles gallop to enter society of jesus two men travelled to rome and on 11 september 1575 were accepted into church at sant andrea della valle garnet studied under theologian father robert bellarmine two of his professors christopher clavius and robert bellarmine praised his abilities he was ordained sometime around 1582 and stayed in rome as a professor of hebrew lecturing also on metaphysics and mathematics he was also an english confessor at st peter s but in may 1584 his academic career was curtailed when perhaps as a consequence of a petition from jesuit superior for england william weston father robert persons asked that he be sent to england superior general claudio acquaviva who saw garnet as his successor refused this request he thought garnet more suited to quiet life than that which awaited him in england but on 2 may 1586 he relented and allowed him to leave appointed superior for journey garnet travelled with robert southwell leaving for calais on 8 may he landed near folkestone early in july 1586 england after meeting jesuit superior for england william weston at a london inn garnet southwell and weston travelled to harlesford near marlow buckinghamshire spending just over a week at home of richard bold they engaged in prayer and masses and also took confessions they discussed their mission in england deciding to meet each year in february and august later changed to easter and autumn weston also gave two men details of catholic houses that would shelter them acquaviva had instructed that should anything happen to weston garnet was to succeed him as superior in england which he did when only days after leaving harlesford weston was captured en route to london acquaviva had also given garnet permission to print pro catholic literature and so early next year he met southwell in london to discuss establishment of a secret press which was probably located somewhere around a former augustinian hospital near spitalfields it lasted until late 1588 and was responsible for a consolatory letter to all afflicted in england author unknown and an epistle of comfort by southwell from a friend s window in ludgate hill garnet witnessed november 1588 procession to a thanksgiving service at old st paul s cathedral celebrating failed spanish invasion spain s actions gave garnet much cause for concern for when we thought that there was an end to these disasters by which we are already nearly destroyed our hope was suddenly turned to sorrow and now with redoubled effort overseers are pressing upon us people were allowed to spectate from windows only if their loyalty to queen elizabeth i was guaranteed by householder in a letter to acquaviva garnet said that many of his supporters thought that he was more concerned for queen than her calvinist ministers in light of armada s destruction he also wrote to general to ask for advice on two versions of a proposed oath to allow roman catholics to swear their allegiance to queen government s version required that catholics reject pope s authority over elizabeth whereas catholic version proposed that they recognise her authority and would wish with every effort to struggle to thwart and to fight to death all those who will in any way endanger life of her highness privy council rejected latter left thumb in 1591 garnet was almost caught at baddesley clinton garnet s first few years in england were spent meeting new priests in london including john gerard and edward oldcorne jesuits had been banished from england since 1585 and if discovered they risked being charged with high treason avoiding pursuers was therefore a recurrent problem and garnet was almost caught on several occasions as a result of an almost disastrous meeting at baddesley clinton in 1591 when he and many others were almost captured together while renewing their vows he reorganised mission into eleven smaller groups each assigned two weeks annually following southwell s capture in june 1592 and search of anne vaux and eleanor brooksby s rented house in warwickshire he wrote to acquaviva to ask for an assistant who could succeed him as superior henry walpole was thus dispatched but was captured on his arrival in december 1593 and executed in york in april 1595 garnet believed that it was his duty to observe in disguise executions of his fellow priests so as to secretly administer last rites and he may have been present at southwell s execution at tyburn in 1595 latter s death was a significant blow for garnet who later wrote of intolerable burden of loneliness he carried while in england in november 1593 garnet travelled to decrepit and decayed wisbech castle requisitioned by government in 1579 for internment of catholic priests william weston was held there castle s inhabitants were supported by catholic alms and lived a relatively comfortable existence garnet was complimentary about wisbech calling it a college of venerable confessors following year he mediated in a dispute there between secular and regular clergy latter represented by jesuits which became known as wisbech stirs argument was settled by end of year but garnet was concerned that reports of discontent at jesuit administered english college in rome and tension between some catholic english exiles in brussels might undermine his efforts to stabilise situation gunpowder plot introduction to catesby garnet spent much of 1604 on move although few details of his travels exist at easter he reportedly gave a mass at hall house of john wright in november he was with anne vaux whose family he had been introduced to in summer 1586 at white webbs near enfield renewing vows given on feast of presentation of our lady on 9 june 1605 he was to be found in a room on thames street in london with robert catesby in midst of what garnet later recalled was a seemingly casual conversation catesby asked priest about morality of killing innocents garnet replied according to catholic theology that often during war innocents were killed alongside enemy according to antonia fraser garnet may have thought that catesby s request was to do with him possibly raising a regiment in flanders garnet was not at all like catesby described by fraser as possessing mentality of crusader who does not hesitate to employ sword in cause of values which he considers are spiritual catesby was also described as exceedingly tangled in debts and barely able to subsist in contrast garnet believed that things were best settled by submission to will of god he was ebullient over king james s succession to english throne and hoped there would be no foreign interference of 1603 bye plot revealed with his blessing to privy council by two catholic priests he wrote that it was a piece of impudent folly for we know that it is by peaceful means that his holiness and other princes are prepared to help us he exhorted that pope clement viii instruct all english catholics not to engage in violent rebellion quiete et it was a message echoed by archpriest george blackwell who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing but it proved controversial early in summer 1605 garnet reported to rome that english catholics had reached a stage of desperation two met again in july at in essex garnet told catesby that he wished him to look what he did if he intended anything that he must first look to lawfulness of act itself and then he must not have so little regard of innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for commonwealth when catesby offered to tell priest more garnet declined i told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure like in others garnet also spoke with william parker 4th baron monteagle asking him if catholics were able to make their part good by arms against king but monteagle s reply was vague author alan haynes suggests that garnet may at that point have become marginalised seal of confessional garnet later claimed to have been ignorant of catesby s designs until 24 july when he was approached by father oswald tesimond an intelligent and thoughtful man tesimond wanted his superior s advice as catesby had recently told him of his plan as garnet viewed tesimond s information as having been imparted under seal of confessional he later claimed to have felt unable to warn anyone of catesby s plan according to his own account two had a third meeting around 24 july he read to catesby a letter he had received from persons urging him to speak to pope before attempting any scheme but fearful of being discovered catesby declined so garnet wrote to claiming to have prevented several outbreaks of violence and of his suspicion that there was a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against king as he had done following failed bye plot he urged pope to publicly warn against use of force attempting to hide his knowledge of plot by suggesting that warning be aimed at recusants in wales he also sent sir edmund baynham to deliver same message and when parliament was prorogued on 28 july garnet satisfied himself that danger had been averted on 24 august he was at white webbs near enfield with anne vaux her sister eleanor brooksby her nephew william brooksby and his wife dorothy a few days later group set out on a pilgrimage to st winefride s well at holywell in wales they travelled to john grant s home at norbrook then huddington court near worcester through shrewsbury and finally to wales about 30 people made journey west including everard digby and his wife and their secret chaplain edward oldcorne and nicholas owen on his return from wales garnet travelled with anne vaux to rushton hall home of recently deceased thomas tresham father to francis tresham from there they travelled to digby s home at house in buckinghamshire vaux was suspicious that so many horses were being collected at homes of her friends and family and confessed to garnet her fear that these wild heads had something in hand she asked him to speak with catesby but garnet reassured her that catesby was instead seeking a commission in flanders garnet wrote a letter of recommendation for catesby for that very purpose when in october vaux raised issue once more claiming that several women had asked her where they should retreat to once brunt was passed in beginning of parliament garnet again mentioned flanders although fraser suggests that vaux s questioning must have concerned him deeply arrest and imprisonment right upright thumb robert cecil 1st earl of salisbury was part of privy council that interrogated garnet garnet was at coughton court on 6 november when thomas bates brought news of plot s failure catesby wanted him to help raise support in wales where it was thought catholic support would be more likely but garnet was horrified in a letter to catesby and digby he urged them to abandon their wicked actions and follow pope s advice he spent weeks on run but was eventually arrested on 27 january 1606 at hindlip hall there for eight days he and fr edward oldcorne later beatified as blessed edward oldcorne secreted themselves in a small cramped space unable even to stand or stretch their legs they received sustenance from their protectors through a small drinking straw hidden within building s structure but with no commode or drainage they were eventually forced by customs of nature which must of necessity be done to emerge from hiding and were immediately captured they were taken first to holt castle in worcestershire and a few days later to london garnet was still weak from his ordeal and salisbury therefore ordered that he be given a good mount his supplies were paid for by king group was accompanied by a puritan minister who ranted at length without interruption but garnet s replies remained erudite brief and clear much to minister s disappointment on his arrival in london he was taken to gatehouse prison in westminster already home to many catholic prisoners including his nephew father thomas garnet garnet first appeared in front of privy council on 13 february 1606 present were john popham edward coke sir william waad and earls of worcester northampton nottingham and salisbury superficially they treated him with respect removing their hats and addressing him as mr garnet although they made fun of his relationship with anne vaux claiming he was her lover not her confessor during his questioning he admitted some of his movements and that he had received catesby s letter on 6 november but he denied being involved in plot whose members he did not name garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in failed scheme and believed he might be able to clear his name but councillors also asked him about doctrine of equivocation his own treatise on this topic one of heretical treasonable and damnable books found amongst francis tresham s possessions was laid on council table before him although it condemned lying garnet s treatise supported notion that when questioned for instance on presence of a priest in his house a catholic might securely in conscience answer no if he had a secret meaning reserved in his mind occasions on which a catholic might legitimately use equivocation he supposed were limited but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness especially to king s council who may not have wanted to see garnet prove his case council s view of equivocation was very different from garnet s in their eyes it was simple deceit next day garnet was moved to tower of london into what he described as a very fine chamber he was afforded claret with his meals though it took him some time to get bedding and coal for fireplace he claimed that lieutenant of tower william waad treated him well although on subject of religion his speeches became violent and impotent garnet s recent interrogation was only first of many generally his answers were carefully considered and demonstrated a passive resistance to his questioners use of rack was a distinct possibility one which he answered with threats are only for boys what information he did give up was of limited interest only his jailer a man named carey was employed by waad to gain priest s trust offering to relay letters to his nephew in gatehouse prison carey then placed garnet into a cell containing a hole through which he was able to converse with oldcorne who was in a neighbouring cell from a place which was made for this precise purpose two government eavesdroppers were therefore able to record details of conversations between two priests their communications were mostly innocent although garnet s admission that on one occasion he drank too much wine was later used against him along with other incriminating evidence recorded during their stay his communications with his nephew and anne vaux were also intercepted most of these letters found their intended recipient but not before they had first been read by waad who also kept salisbury informed although garnet told vaux that council s evidence constituted nothing but presumptions insufficient for a state trial early in march he confessed possibly as a result of torture vaux too was arrested and interrogated twice just as further questions were being asked of garnet by council and king latter interested in his opinion on theological matters despite his claims to have been horrified by catesby s plan his declaration which admitted that he had dealt very reservedly with your lordships in case of late powder action gave government proof that he had prior knowledge of plot and in their view he was therefore guilty of misprision of treason trial right upright thumb sir edward coke accused garnet of involvement in every treason since 1586 garnet s trial took place on friday 28 march 1606 he was taken to guildhall by closed coach an unusual method considering prisoners were usually walked to trial though authorities may have had some concern about support from a sympathetic crowd trial began at about 9 30 am and lasted all day in attendance were king james hidden from public view and several courtiers including lady arbella stuart and catherine howard countess of suffolk garnet was introduced with his various aliases which included whalley otherwise darcy otherwise roberts otherwise farmer otherwise philips he was accused of having conspired with catesby on 9 june 1605 to kill king his son and to alter and subvert government of kingdom and true worship of god established in england he was also accused of having conspired with several others to blow up house of lords with gunpowder he pleaded not guilty speaking for government edward coke accused him of involvement in every treason since 1586 year he returned to england according to coke provincial superior was involved in main and bye plots of 1603 he had sent edmund baynham to rome to gain papal approval for 1605 plot and while at coughton in november had prayed for success of great action coke called garnet a doctor of five ds namely of dissimulation of deposing of princes of disposing of kingdoms of daunting and deterring of subjects and of destruction his supposed inappropriate relationship with anne vaux was mentioned but his adherence to doctrine of equivocation proved extremely damaging francis tresham s deathbed letter which claimed that garnet had played no part in so called spanish treason was read aloud tresham claimed not to have seen garnet for fifteen or sixteen years before despite government evidence that two had met more recently garnet had not seen letter and did not know that it referred to events before 1602 not 1605 he was unable to explain it except by saying it may be my lord that he meant to equivocate statements regarding jesuit encouraged plots against queen elizabeth were read to court as well as some of plotters confessions garnet defended his use of equivocation with his own treatise on doctrine he had denied his conversation with oldcorne as it was a secret but said that in matters of faith equivocation could never be lawful when asked by salisbury what he would do if pope excommunicated king james he denied to answer his defence of equivocation was scorned by coke who called it open and broad lying and forswearing as for tesimond s confession planned assassination had not at that point happened and so salisbury said that garnet could easily have alerted government salisbury attacked idea that it had ever been made under seal of confessional and claimed anyway that garnet could have warned authorities after his more ordinary conversation with catesby about death of innocents priest replied by saying that at time he did not understand relevance of catesby s questions earl of northampton said in latin quod non cum what a man does not forbid when he can he orders garnet s defence that he had forbidden catesby from proceeding was futile jury took fifteen minutes to decide that garnet was guilty of treason he was sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered execution day after his trial garnet made a new statement which he hoped would clarify his dealings with tresham he also wrote to king reiterating his stance on violence against a rightful monarch when government lied and told him they had captured tesimond he wrote an apologetic letter to priest regarding nature of their conversation previous year he also wrote a final letter to anne vaux on 21 april relating his lack of fortune over previous few months after about three months spent in tower on saturday 3 may 1606 garnet was strapped to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to churchyard of st paul s he wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat and spent much of journey with his hands together and eyes closed present in churchyard were sheriff of london sir henry montague george abbot and john overal when asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons garnet replied that he had nothing to say he rejected any to abandon his faith for protestantism and said that he had committed no offence against king only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by terms of confessional and if by that action he had offended king or state he asked for forgiveness recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt but garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue point garnet highlighted date of his execution 3 may feast of cross and reaffirmed his innocence he defended anne vaux against claims that their relationship had been inappropriate he then prayed at base of ladder disrobed down to his long sewn up shirt that wind might not blow it up and mounted ladder he ignored a protestant minister who came forward replying to an objectionable member of audience that he ever meant to die a true but perfect catholic bishop overal protested that we are all catholics although garnet disagreed with this he once again said his prayers and was then thrown off ladder before executioner could cut him down alive many in crowd pulled on his legs and as a result garnet did not suffer remainder of his grim sentence there was no applause when executioner held garnet s heart aloft and said traditional words behold heart of a traitor his head was set on a pole on london bridge but crowds of onlookers fascinated by its pallid appearance eventually forced government to turn head upwards so its face was no longer visible a bloodstained straw husk saved from scene of execution and said to bear garnet s image became an object of curiosity it was smuggled out of country into possession of society of jesus before being lost during french revolution writings garnet s writings include an apology against defence of 1593 an attack against church papistry in which he scolded thomas bell for supporting occasional taking of communion in church of england this was followed by a treatise of christian renunciation 1593 which comprised a selection of quotations on what catholics should be prepared to renounce for their faith and of rosary 1593 1594 his defence of practice of equivocation was published in a treatise of equivocation c 1598 originally titled a treatise against lying and fraudulent dissimulation equivocation was condemned by most of his contemporaries as outright lying including william shakespeare who may have alluded to garnet in macbeth with following line who committed treason enough for god s sake yet could not equivocate to heaven references notes footnotes bibliography further reading for a fuller biography of garnet see external links henry garnet at catholic encyclopedia henry garnet at
