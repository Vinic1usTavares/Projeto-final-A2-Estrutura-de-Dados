actinium is a chemical element with symbol ac and atomic number 89 it was first isolated by french chemist andre louis debierne in 1899 friedrich oskar giesel later independently isolated it in 1902 and unaware that it was already known gave it name emanium actinium gave name to actinide series a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in periodic table it is also sometimes considered first of 7th period transition metals although lawrencium is less commonly given that position together with polonium radium and radon actinium was one of first non primordial radioactive elements to be isolated a soft silvery white radioactive metal actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation as with most lanthanides and many actinides actinium assumes oxidation state 3 in nearly all its chemical compounds actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as isotope 227ac which decays with a half life of 21 772 years predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles and 228ac which is beta active with a half life of 6 15 hours one tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0 2 milligrams of actinium 227 and one tonne of thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium 228 close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from ore impractical instead element is prepared in milligram amounts by neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor owing to its scarcity high price and radioactivity actinium has no significant industrial use its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy history andre louis debierne a french chemist announced discovery of a new element in 1899 he separated it from pitchblende residues left by marie and pierre curie after they had extracted radium in 1899 debierne described substance as similar to titanium and in 1900 as similar to thorium friedrich oskar giesel independently discovered actinium in 1902 as a substance being similar to lanthanum and called it emanium in 1904 after a comparison of substances half lives determined by debierne harriet brooks in 1904 and otto hahn and otto sackur in 1905 debierne s chosen name for new element was retained because it had seniority despite contradicting chemical properties he claimed for element at different times articles published in 1970s and later suggest that debierne s results published in 1904 conflict with those reported in 1899 and 1900 furthermore now known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of debierne s 1899 and 1900 results in fact chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had instead accidentally identified protactinium which would not be discovered for another fourteen years only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment this has led some authors to advocate that giesel alone should be credited with discovery a less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by adloff he suggests that hindsight criticism of early publications should be mitigated by then nascent state of radiochemistry highlighting prudence of debierne s claims in original papers he notes that nobody can contend that debierne s substance did not contain actinium debierne who is now considered by vast majority of historians as discoverer lost interest in element and left topic giesel on other hand can rightfully be credited with first preparation of pure actinium and with identification of its atomic number 89 name actinium originates from ancient greek aktis aktinos aktis aktinos meaning beam or ray its symbol ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium such as acetyl acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde properties actinium is a soft silvery white actinium in encyclopaedia britannica 15th edition 1995 p 70 radioactive metallic element its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead seitz frederick and turnbull david 1964 solid state physics advances in research and applications academic press pp 289 291 owing to its strong radioactivity actinium glows in dark with a pale blue light which originates from surrounding air ionized by emitted energetic particles actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for separation first element of actinides actinium gave group its name much as lanthanum had done for lanthanides group of elements is more diverse than lanthanides and therefore it was not until 1928 that charles janet proposed most significant change to dmitri mendeleev s periodic table since recognition of lanthanides by introducing actinides a move suggested again in 1945 by glenn t seaborg actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation as with most lanthanides and actinides actinium exists in oxidation state 3 and ac3 ions are colorless in solutions oxidation state 3 originates from rn electronic configuration of actinium with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give stable closed shell structure of noble gas radon rare oxidation state 2 is only known for actinium dihydride even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener lah2 and thus have actinium iii ac3 is largest of all known tripositive ions and its first coordination sphere contains approximately 10 9 0 5 water molecules chemical compounds only a limited number of actinium compounds are known including acf3 acbr3 acof acobr ac2s3 ac2o3 and acpo4 due to actinium s intense radioactivity except for acpo4 they are all similar to corresponding lanthanum compounds they all contain actinium in oxidation state 3 in particular lattice constants of analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent formula color symmetry space group no pearson

vacuum its crystal lattice is isotypic with oxides of most trivalent rare earth metals halides actinium trifluoride can be produced either in solution or in solid reaction former reaction is carried out at room temperature by adding hydrofluoric acid to a solution containing actinium ions in latter method actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700 degc in an all platinum setup treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900 1000 degc yields oxyfluoride acof whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800 degc

for a few minutes results in a black actinium sulfide ac2s3 it may possibly be produced by acting with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000 degc isotopes naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive isotopes from radioactive family of and a granddaughter of decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy but in 1 38 of cases it emits an alpha particle so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry thirty six radioisotopes have been identified most stable being with a half life of 21 772 years with a half life of 10 0 days and with a half life of 29 37 hours all remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives that are less than 10 hours and majority of them have half lives shorter than one minute shortest lived known isotope of actinium is half life of 69 nanoseconds which decays through alpha decay actinium also has two known meta states most significant isotopes for chemistry are 225ac 227ac and 228ac purified comes into equilibrium with its decay products after about a half of year it decays according to its 21 772 year half life emitting mostly beta 98 62 and some alpha particles 1 38 successive decay products are part of actinium series owing to low available amounts low energy of its beta particles maximum 44 8 kev and low intensity of alpha radiation is difficult to detect directly by its emission and it is therefore traced via its decay products actinium great soviet encyclopedia in russian isotopes of actinium range in atomic weight from 205 u to 236 u isotope production decay half

in uranium ores one tonne of uranium in ore contains about 0 2 milligrams of 227ac and in thorium ores which contain about 5 nanograms of 228ac per one tonne of thorium actinium isotope 227ac is a transient member of uranium actinium series decay chain which begins with parent isotope 235u or 239pu and ends with stable lead isotope isotope 228ac is a transient member of thorium series decay chain which begins with parent isotope 232th and ends with stable lead isotope 208pb another actinium isotope 225ac is transiently present in neptunium series decay chain beginning with 237np or 233u and ending with thallium 205tl and near stable bismuth 209bi even though all primordial 237np has decayed away it is continuously produced by neutron knock out reactions on natural 238u low natural concentration and close similarity of physical and chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides which are always abundant in actinium bearing ores render separation of actinium from ore impractical and complete separation was never achieved instead actinium is prepared in milligram amounts by neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor 226 88 ra 1 0 n 227 88 ra beta 42 2 ce min 227 89 ac reaction yield is about 2 of radium weight 227ac can further capture neutrons resulting in small amounts of 228ac after synthesis actinium is separated from radium and from products of decay and nuclear fusion such as thorium polonium lead and bismuth extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone benzene solution from an aqueous solution of radiation products and selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting ph to about 6 0 for actinium an alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid which can result in a separation factor of 1 000 000 for radium and actinium vs thorium in a two stage process actinium can then be separated from radium with a ratio of about 100 using a low cross linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant 225ac was first produced artificially at institute for transuranium elements itu in germany using a cyclotron and at st george hospital in sydney using a in 2000 this rare isotope has potential applications in radiation therapy and is most efficiently produced by bombarding a radium 226 target with 20 30 mev deuterium ions this reaction also yields 226ac which however decays with a half life of 29 hours and thus does not contaminate 225ac russell pamela j jackson paul and kingsley elizabeth anne 2003 prostate cancer methods and protocols humana press p 336 actinium metal has been prepared by reduction of actinium fluoride with lithium vapor in vacuum at a temperature between 1100 and 1300 degc higher temperatures resulted in evaporation of product and lower ones lead to an incomplete transformation lithium was chosen among other alkali metals because its fluoride is most volatile hammond c r elements in applications owing to its scarcity high price and radioactivity 227ac currently has no significant industrial use but 225ac is currently being studied for use in cancer treatments such as targeted alpha therapies 227ac is highly radioactive and was therefore studied for use as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators for example in spacecraft oxide of 227ac pressed with beryllium is also an efficient neutron source with activity exceeding that of standard americium beryllium and radium beryllium pairs russell alan m and lee kok loong 2005 structure property relations in nonferrous metals wiley pp 470 471 in all those

225ac in radiation therapy 225ac is applied in medicine to produce 213 in a reusable generator or can be used alone as an agent for radiation therapy in particular targeted alpha therapy tat this isotope has a half life of 10 days making it much more suitable for radiation therapy than half life 46 minutes additionally 225ac decays to nontoxic 209bi rather than stable but toxic lead which is final product in decay chains of several other candidate isotopes namely 227th 228th and not only 225ac itself but also its daughters emit alpha particles which kill cancer cells in body major difficulty with application of 225ac was that intravenous injection of simple actinium complexes resulted in their accumulation in bones and liver for a period of tens of years as a result after cancer cells were quickly killed by alpha particles from 225ac radiation from actinium and its daughters might induce new mutations to solve this problem 225ac was bound to a chelating agent such as citrate acid or diethylene acid this reduced actinium accumulation in bones but excretion from body remained slow much better results were obtained with such chelating agents as or dota coupled to trastuzumab a monoclonal antibody that interferes with neu receptor latter delivery combination was tested on mice and proved to be effective against leukemia lymphoma breast ovarian and prostate cancers medium half life of 227ac 21 77 years makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters associated processes cannot be studied with required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities of order 50 meters per year however evaluation of concentration depth profiles for different isotopes allows estimating mixing rates physics behind this method is as follows oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235u its decay product 231pa gradually precipitates to bottom so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant 231pa decays to 227ac however concentration of latter isotope does not follow 231pa depth profile but instead increases toward sea bottom this occurs because of mixing processes which raise some additional 227ac from sea bottom thus analysis of both 231pa and 227ac depth profiles allows researchers to model mixing behavior there are theoretical predictions that hydrides in this case with very high pressure are a candidate for a near room temperature superconductor as they have tc significantly higher than possibly near 250 k dmitrii v et al https arxiv org abs 1802 actinium hydrides as high temperature conventional superconductors precautions 227ac is highly radioactive and experiments with it are carried out in a specially designed laboratory equipped with a tight glove box when actinium trichloride is administered intravenously to rats about 33 of actinium is deposited into bones and 50 into liver its toxicity is comparable to but slightly lower than that of americium and plutonium for trace quantities fume hoods with good aeration suffice for gram amounts hot cells with shielding from intense gamma radiation emitted by 227ac are necessary
