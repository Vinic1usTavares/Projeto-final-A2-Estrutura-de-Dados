turn based combat of previous installments it was released worldwide in october 2008 for microsoft windows playstation 3 and xbox 360 game is set within a post apocalyptic open world environment that encompasses a scaled region consisting of ruins of washington d c and much of countryside to north and west of it referred to as capital wasteland it takes place within fallout usual setting of a world that deviated into an alternate timeline thanks to atomic age technology which eventually led to its devastation by a nuclear apocalypse in year 2077 referred to as great war caused by a major international conflict between united states and china over natural resources and last remaining supplies of untapped petroleum main story takes place in year 2277 around 36 years after events of fallout 2 of which it is not a direct sequel players take control of an inhabitant of vault 101 one of several underground shelters created before great war to protect around 1 000 humans from nuclear fallout who is forced to venture out into capital wasteland to find their father after he disappears from vault under mysterious circumstances they find themselves seeking to complete their father s work while fighting against enclave corrupt remnants of former u s government that seeks to use it for their own purposes fallout 3 was met with critical acclaim and received a number of game of year awards praising game s open ended gameplay and flexible character leveling system and is considered one of greatest video games of all time npd group estimated that fallout 3 sold over 610 000 units during its initial month of release in october 2008 performing better than bethesda s previous game elder scrolls iv oblivion which sold nearly 500 000 units in its first month game received post launch support with bethesda releasing five downloadable add ons game was met with controversy upon release in australia for use of and ability to be addicted to alcohol and drugs in india for cultural and religious sentiments over mutated cattle in game being called brahmin and in japan due to having a weapon called fat man which releases mini nuclear bombs gameplay fallout 3 is played from first person perspective unlike previous titles of series players have option to switch between this and an over shoulder third person perspective at any time after initial stages of game while many elements from previous titles are used such as special system and enemies encountered combat is played out differently while new features are included into series character creation and attributes thumb left pip boy wrist computer remains a key feature in series for character menus in fallout 3 players get to use pip boy 3000 as shown here character creation is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses different ages of player s character which also covers tutorials on movement hud combat interactions with game world and use of pip boy 3000 character s creation is done in steps with player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is and name they have next they customize their character s primary attributes via s p e c i a l system strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility and luck which is retained in fallout 3 and determines base level of skills character has which three skills their character focuses on can either be left to choices they make with a series of question or by choosing manually what they desire character creation is not finalized until player leaves vault 101 and enters capital wasteland allowing players option to modify their character s appearance primary attributes and skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices as character progresses through game experience points xp are earned from accomplishing various actions such as completing a quest killing an enemy and so forth with a new level granted upon reaching necessary amount of xp a new level grants player ability to allocate points to various skills available and thus improve upon them making them more effective for instance a higher lock picking skill allows player to be able to tackle more difficult locks on doors and containers while a higher medicine skill increases amount of health recovered with stimpaks once character achieves their second level they can be granted a perk which offers advantages of varying quality and form such as being able to carry more items finding more ammo in containers and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit many perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied often requiring a certain skill level to acquire them while a new perk can be granted for every two levels earned by character additional improvements to skill levels can be made by finding skill books which confer a permanent boost to levels while players can search for and find a series of 20 bobbleheads that confer a bonus to these and primary attributes an important statistic tracked by game is karma which is affected by decisions and actions character performs during game positive actions to karma include freeing captives and helping others while negative actions towards this include killing good characters and stealing actions vary in level of karma change they cause thus pickpocketing produces less negative karma than killing of a good character karma can have tangible effects to player beyond acting as flavor for game s events in that it can affect ending player gets alter dialogue with non player characters npcs or give off unique reactions from other characters while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific karma level however player s relationships with game s factions are distinct so any two groups or settlements may view player in contrasting ways depending on player s conduct health weapons and apparel a character s health is divided between two types hp health points and limbs while hp is general amount of health that a character and other npcs have friendly neutral or hostile and which depletes when damage is taken either from combat setting off traps falling from a height or self injury limb health is specific to each portion of body namely arms legs head and torso although non human enemies feature additional appendages and robotic enemies feature different types of appendages limbs can be damaged in same way as hp though once depleted they become crippled and induce a negative status effect such as blurred vision if head is crippled or reduced movement speed if one or both legs are crippled both hp and limbs can be recovered through use of medical medicine in form of stimpaks as well as sleeping and visiting a doctor while hp can be slowly recovered by consuming food and drinking water and or soft drinks players can also be affected by other negative health effects including radiation poisoning and withdrawal symptoms while latter occurs when player s character becomes addicted to drugs and alcohol and confers negative effects if player does not continue using them radiation poisoning occurs when character absorbs radiation either by walking through areas with background radiation and consuming food and drink that is irradiated with a small amount of radiation negative impacts of both can affect special attributes and can be treated by a doctor though radiation can be dealt with by using rad away furthermore amount of background radiation absorbed can be reduced through use of rad x drugs and special apparel both of which improve resistance to radiation all weapons and apparel found regardless of whether they are a makeshift weapon such as a lead pipe or a gun degrade over time more they are used and thus become less effective for firearms degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks when too much damage is taken items breaks and cannot be used to ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways first method is find certain vendors that repair items though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level while cost of repairs depends upon item itself second method is for players to find a second of same item that needs repairs or a comparable item and salvaging parts from it for repair though how much they can do depends on their character s own skill level in repairs in addition to finding weaponry player can create their own to craft such weapons player must use a workbench possess either necessary schematics or right perk and scavenge for items needed to make them these weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type each weapon s schematic has three copies that can be found and possessing additional copies improves condition or number of items produced at workbench while a higher repair skill will result in a better starting condition for related weapon weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations bought from vendors or received as quest rewards v a t s thumb v a t s system is a new gameplay element for fallout series as seen here real time action is stopped and player can see both damage that has been done to a target s limbs and percentage ratio for attempting to attack that limb vault tec assisted targeting system v a t s is a new element in fallout series and plays an important part in combat within fallout 3 system was introduced by bethesda s developers who described it as a hybrid between based and real time combat so much in that while using v a t s real time combat is paused and action is played out from varying camera angles in a computer graphics version of bullet time using system costs action points ap amount of which depends on weapon being used and thus limiting actions of player s combat during a turn through system player can switch between multiple targets if there is more than one around at any time and also target specific areas of them to inflict damage a player could either target head for a quick kill go for legs to slow an enemy s movements or shoot at their weapons to disarm them for some enemies they can put them into a berserker rage by hitting specific parts chance of striking a different area displayed as a percentage ratio is dependent on weapon being used and distance between character and target a character who is a higher level when using v a t s is also more likely to hit an enemy with system than a lower level character use of v a t s does confer a negative effect in that it eliminates most of first person shooter elements of game aiming is taken over by computer and player is unable to move as a means of avoiding attacks furthermore ranged weapons are capable of hitting limbs while melee weapons focus on target in whole when using v a t s companions during their travels across wasteland player can be accompanied by a single non player character npc companion who can assist in combat which companion can accompany player depends on who they have encountered that can join them it is possible to not encounter all depending on how game is played only one companion may travel with player and should they wish to take another with them first must be dismissed either voluntarily by player or as a consequence of other events or die in combat one unique companion player can have that can allow a third to join without issue is a dog named dogmeat who can be killed during game if player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation release of broken steel dlc makes it possible to replace dogmeat provided player acquires a perk that grants opportunity of getting another dog plot setting thumb desolate area of capital wasteland where fallout 3 takes place alt left fallout 3 takes place in year 2277 and within region that covers most of ruined city of washington d c northern virginia and parts of maryland mostly montgomery county game s scaled landscape includes war ravaged variants of numerous real life landmarks such as white house jefferson and lincoln memorials arlington national cemetery and washington monument with a small number of settlements dotted around capital wasteland that consist of descendants of survivors from great war including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants and another formed within hulking remains of an aircraft carrier while city can be explored much of interior zones are cut off by giant rubble over many of roads leading in meaning that access can only be achieved by using city s former underground metro tunnels loosely based on real life washington metro region has two major factions within it enclave and brotherhood of steel while enclave is similar in goal to their western brethren eastern branch of brotherhood of steel seeks to assist people of wasteland though a small group rejected this and became outcasts who seek to resume their original goal of salvaging high level technology other factions include former slaves who seek to inspire others for freedom by restoring lincoln memorial a group that feast on blood and a group who tend and care for a region of wastes where plants have become abundant story for first 19 years of their life from 2258 to 2277 player character grows up within isolated confines of vault 101 designed to never be opened as a social experiment by pre war corporation known as vault tec alongside their father james a doctor and scientist who assists in vault s clinic while growing up their father comments about their deceased mother catherine and her favorite passage from bible revelation 21 6 which speaks of waters of life upon reaching their 19th birthday chaos erupts when james suddenly leaves vault causing overseer to lock down vault and send security guards after james child escaping from vault with aid of overseer s daughter amata search for james across wasteland begins at nearby town of megaton named for undetonated atomic bomb at center of town and eventually into ruins of washington d c and galaxy news radio station whereupon james child after helping station s enthusiastic dj three dog is given moniker of lone wanderer directed by three dog towards rivet city a derelict aircraft carrier serving as a fortified human settlement lone wanderer meets with doctor madison li a scientist who worked alongside james li informs lone wanderer that their parents were not born in vault 101 but lived outside of it where they worked together upon a plan they conceived to purify all water in tidal basin and eventually entire potomac river with a giant water purifier built in jefferson memorial called project purity however constant delays and catherine s death during childbirth forced james to abandon project and seek refuge in vault 101 where he took lone wanderer to raise within a safe environment far away from dangers of wasteland learning that james seeks to revive project and continue his work by acquiring a garden of eden creation kit g e c k a powerful piece of technology issued by vault tec intended to assist in rebuilding civilization after war lone wanderer tracks him down to vault 112 and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by vault s sadistic overseer dr stanislaus braun whom james had sought out for information on a g e c k reunited with their father pair return to rivet city and recruit li and other project members to resume work at jefferson memorial as they begin testing project memorial is invaded by enclave a powerful military organization formed from remnants of united states government which continues to remain active despite demise of their brethren on west coast thirty years previously seeking to stop them from gaining control of his work james urges lone wanderer to finish his work and find a g e c k before flooding project s control room with massive amounts of radiation preventing enclave s military leader colonel augustus autumn from taking control of it and killing himself in process autumn survives however and rest of team flees from remaining enclave soldiers lone wanderer accompanied by remaining project purity members make contact with brotherhood of steel within ruins of pentagon now known as citadel with their help lone wanderer travels to vault 87 to find a g e c k which had been used as a testing site for forced evolutionary virus fev and now as a breeding ground for super mutants lone wanderer recovers g e c k from within vault with optional help of a friendly super mutant named fawkes as they make their way out wanderer is ambushed by colonel autumn and enclave and is captured with g e c k confiscated at enclave base at raven rock lone wanderer is freed from their cell by enclave leader president john henry eden who requests a private audience with them but colonel autumn defies eden s orders takes command of enclave s military and orders lone wanderer to be shot on sight despite setback wanderer meets with eden who is revealed to be a sentient zax series supercomputer that took control of enclave after president dick richardson was killed on west coast seeking to repeat richardson s plans eden reveals his intentions of using project purity to infect water with a modified strain of fev that will make it toxic to any mutated life thus killing off most life in wasteland including humans enclave who would be immune to effects because of their genetic purity as a result of their isolation would be free to take control of area forced to take a sample of new fev wanderer leaves base regardless of doing so peacefully or convincing eden to self destruct returning to citadel where news of enclave s possession of g e c k is known to brotherhood lone wanderer joins them in a desperate final assault on jefferson memorial which is spearheaded through use of a giant prewar military robot named liberty prime after reaching control room player has choice to either convince autumn to leave or kill him li informs wanderer that purifier is ready for activation but that code must be inputted manually within control room meaning whoever goes in will be subjected to lethal amounts of radiation to make matters worse purifier has been damaged and will self destruct if not activated at this point lone wanderer can either do nothing and let purifier explode destroying jefferson memorial and killing everyone inside in process sacrifice themselves and input right code that is hinted throughout game send sarah lyons into chamber and give her right code except for first choice lone wanderer has choice of introducing modified fev into purifier or not which further affects ending whatever choice a bright light all and an ending slideshow begins including any actions they took that had an influence on wasteland broken steel ending although main story ends here introduction of broken steel dlc creates a new choice with ending in that lone wanderer can send one of their radiation immune companions into chamber to input code furthermore game remains open ended from this point onwards with wanderer surviving radiation they were subjected to and recovering two weeks later to news that purifier is working well and supplying clean water to people of wasteland or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to introduction of modified fev sarah lyons does not survive if sent into chamber in broken steel ending development interplay entertainment fallout 3 was initially under development by black isle studios a studio owned by interplay entertainment under working title van buren black isle studios was developer of original fallout and fallout 2 when interplay entertainment went bankrupt and closed down black isle studios before game could be completed license to develop fallout 3 was sold for a 1 175 000 minimum guaranteed advance against royalties to bethesda softworks a studio primarily known as developer of elder scrolls series bethesda s fallout 3 however was developed from scratch using neither van buren code nor any other materials created by black isle studios in may 2007 a playable technology demo of canceled project was released to public leonard boyarsky art director of original fallout when asked about interplay entertainment s sale of rights to bethesda softworks said to be perfectly honest i was extremely disappointed that we did not get chance to make next fallout game this has nothing to do with bethesda it s just that we ve always felt that fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that interplay happened to own it it sort of felt as if our child had been sold to highest bidder and we had to just sit by and watch since i have absolutely no idea what their plans are i can t comment on whether i think they re going in right direction with it or not bethesda softworks bethesda softworks started working on fallout 3 in july 2004 but principal development did not begin until after elder scrolls iv oblivion and its related extras and plug ins were completed bethesda softworks made fallout 3 similar to previous two games focusing upon non linear gameplay story and black comedy bethesda pursued an esrb rating of m for mature by including adult themes violence and depravity characteristic of fallout series they shied away from self referential gags of game s predecessors that broke illusion that world of fallout is real fallout 3 uses a version of same gamebryo engine as oblivion and was developed by team responsible for that game liam neeson was cast as voice of player s father in february 2007 bethesda stated that game was a fairly good ways away from release but that detailed information and previews would be available later in year following a statement made by pete hines that team wanted to make game a multiple platform title game was announced by game informer to be in development for windows xbox 360 and playstation 3 according to game director todd howard original plan was to recreate washington d c entirely in game but it was reconstructed by half this was because a full implementation would require too complicated a job and an excessive long term development during a march 21 2008 official xbox magazine podcast interview todd howard revealed that game had expanded to nearly same scope as oblivion there were originally at least 12 versions of final cutscene but with further development this expanded to over 200 possible permutations in final release all of which are determined by actions taken by player bethesda softworks attended e3 2008 to showcase fallout 3 first live demo of xbox 360 version of game was shown and demonstrated by todd howard taking place in downtown washington d c demo showcased various weapons such as fat man nuclear catapult v a t s system and functions of pip boy 3000 as well as combat with several enemies demo concluded as player neared brotherhood of steel controlled pentagon and was attacked by an enclave patrol howard confirmed that in addition to thematics about slavery and cannibalism there would be presence of splatter scenes and exposition of evident mutilations on enemies with release of inspiration to include scenes with such explicit violence came from crash mode of driving simulator series burnout instead of cars that disintegrated because of damage idea of applying kinematics on bodies who suffered wounds and mutilations due to ballistic trauma or beatings emil pagliarulo a writer formerly at looking glass studios was commissioned by bethesda to write main script of fallout 3 he also worked in part to elder scrolls iv oblivions script pagliarulo took charge of writing incipit of fallout 3 then played by ron perlman and he tried to be inspired by first fallouts incipit in 1997 which he considered vitally important to describe story that fallout 3 would have to tell to succeed in making this script effective pagliarulo had to go in opposite direction to his previous work on oblivion which both for setting and characters represented an extreme fallout inverse main model to follow for pagliarulo was always first fallout which by his own admission had more peculiarity of synthesis in dialogues rather than fallout 2 which had a more complex and articulated screenplay written by chris avellone that pagliarulo defined a fantastic writer music and audio score was composed by inon zur who does not consider himself only person responsible for musical work on fallout 3 zur cited game director todd howard and sound designer mark lambert for helping him to manage in game sound implementation stating he made only 50 zur also said that he conceived soundtrack based on what player would perceive on psychological level rather than on what player would see on screen so placing listener musically ahead over environment in which he or she moves apart from a few exceptions inon zur said that soundtrack of game was mainly composed using a sampler several actors of film and video games lent their voices to fallout 3 including liam neeson as james ron perlman as game s narrator malcolm mcdowell as president john henry eden craig as butch deloria erik todd as three dog and odette as amata almodovar veteran voice actors dee bradley baker wes johnson paul eiding and stephen russell also provided voice overs for game fallout 3 soundtrack

leveling system while v a t s system was called fun enemy encounters were said to suffer from a lack of precision in real time combat and little variety in enemy types review concluded fallout 3 is a hugely ambitious game that doesn t come around very often ign editor erik brudvig praised game s minimalist sound design observing you might find yourself with nothing but sound of wind rustling through decaying trees and blowing dust across barren plains fallout 3 proves that less can be more review noted that unusual amount of realism combined with endless conversation permutations produces one of most truly interactive experiences of generation difference in looks between two console versions is small compared to leap that comes with a top of line pc in a review of game for kotaku mike fahey commented that while inon zur s score is filled with epic goodness real stars of fallout 3s music are vintage songs from 1940s tim cain fallout and fallout 2 game director praised art direction and attention to details in game but did not like way endings were not enough constructed around player s actions and decisions he was also critical of how game recycled plot elements from first two games such as super mutants and enclave saying that if his company troika games had acquired license he would have come up with a completely original story for east coast chris avellone fallout 2s main writer described game as having enough options and tools at disposal to insure was having fun no matter what challenges praising immersion in fallouts world success in carrying on legacy of previous two games and fulfilling open world component he criticized writing of some characters and some of gameplay s choices in balancing skills of player character will tuttle of gamespy commended game for its engaging storyline impeccable presentation and hundreds of hours of addictive gameplay although edge awarded game 7 out of 10 in a later anniversary issue it placed game 37th in a 100

that you might have to deal with some crashes and bugs controversy and fandom not all fans were happy with direction fallout series was taken in since its acquisition by bethesda softworks notorious for their support of series first two games fallout and fallout 2 members centered on one of oldest fallout fansites no mutants allowed have criticized departures from original games stories gameplay mechanics and setting criticisms include prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years survival of wood framed dwellings following a nuclear blast and ubiquity of super mutants at early levels in game also criticized are quality of game s writing its relative lack of verisimilitude switch to a first person action game format and level of of surrounding game world to player actions in response jim sterling of destructoid has called fan groups like no mutants allowed selfish and arrogant stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a fallout game and that if series had stayed way it was back in 1997 new titles would never have been made and brought to market luke winkie of kotaku tempers these sentiments saying that it is a matter of ownership and that in case of fallout 3 hardcore fans of original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else regional variations drug references on july 4 2008 fallout 3 was refused classification by australian classification board acb in australia thus making it illegal to distribute or purchase game in country for game to be reclassified offending content in australian version of game had to be removed by

fiction drugs in line with real world drugs a revised version of game was resubmitted to acb and reclassified as ma 15 on august 7 2008 or not suitable for people under age of 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian this new rating ensured that game could retail legally in australia according to acb board report drug content was not removed entirely from revised version of game but animation showing actual usage of drugs was removed minority view on decision stated that drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating in a later interview with uk gaming magazine edge bethesda softworks revealed that there would be only one version of fallout 3 released worldwide and that this version would have all real world drug references removed it was later
