was a 48 year old married man living in new york city and working as an editor for newsweek international zakaria had immigrated to united states from india during his university career he graduated from harvard university with a ph d in political science in 1993 after earning a b a from yale university he worked as managing editor of foreign affairs magazine before accepting editor position at newsweek labeled a liberal hawk zakaria s political views have shifted from supporting reagan s pro democracy agenda to clinton s pro market stances and to point where zakaria felt that us was unstoppable in subsequent years he watched as other countries set records for world s tallest building largest factory largest refinery and richest person meanwhile he watched us get bogged down in war in iraq in 2003 his book future of freedom illiberal democracy at home and abroad in which he examines necessary conditions for liberal democracy to survive was published while he initially supported us intervention in iraq zakaria criticized bush administration s methods of nation building and for trying to force iraq into a liberal democracy without preconditions of economic liberalisation and rule of law over next few years zakaria developed his theory on shifting global power as he contributed or wrote articles profiling emerging national powers and participating in economic forums and organizations synopsis content is divided into seven chapters first chapter introduces thesis of book that a post american world order is emerging in which united states will continue to be most powerful nation but its relative power will be diminished he believes that there have been three power shifts in last 500 years a shift of power to west during renaissance a shift of power to us making it a superpower and now a shift to several surging countries especially china and india and to non governmental organizations zakaria believes that international organizations are not adapting well to emerging challenges and that there is too much focus on problems arising from potential market failures or general crises e g terrorism at expense of focus on problems stemming from success e g development causing environmental degradation or rising demand creating high commodity prices second and third chapters examine factors that led to current power balance power shifted to west because it fostered trade with foreign peoples and developed superior labor productivity per capita power shifted to us because of its strong democracy and capitalist market zakaria argues that success of us in promoting free market capitalism and globalization has led to power being dispersed to several other countries economies have been surging for decades in part due to large new players entering global market place he compares this era s economic growth to economic surges of 1890s and 1950s which also saw new players become global powers at same time zakaria sees attitudes in us becoming insular and distrustful of foreigners fourth chapter focuses on china its strategy of small gradual reforms have allowed it to quietly modernize it has become second most powerful nation but still unlikely to match us for decades to come china s strengths include a philosophy that reflects confucian ideals of practicality ethics and rationalism its non combative foreign policy is more appealing most notably in africa over interventionist western style policy that demands reforms in other countries china s weakness though is a fear of social unrest fifth chapter focuses on india contrasted to china india has a bottom up democratic political system constantly subject to social unrest with only a few politicians losing elections its political system is characterized by strong regionalism often placing high priority on regional interests rather than national zakaria lists india s advantages independent courts that enforce contracts private property rights rule of law an established private sector and many business savvy english speaking people sixth chapter compares american rise to superpower status and its use of power he draws parallels between british empire in 1890s and starting boer war with us in 2000s and starting iraq war difference between them is that british had unsurpassed political power but lost its economic dominance whereas us in 2000s had huge economic power but faltering political influence zakaria defends us from indicators that suggest american decline but warns that internal partisan politics domestic ideological attack groups special interest power and a sensationalistic media are weakening federal government s ability to adapt to new global realities final chapter outlines how us has used its power and provides six guidelines for us to follow in post american world envisioned by zakaria zakaria s guidelines for us in post american world guideline notes 1 choose choose priorities rather than trying to have it all 2 build broad rules not narrow interests recommit to international institutions and mechanisms 3 be bismarck not britain maintain excellent relations with everyone rather

of sharp almost aphoristic amusing observations john of foreign affairs saw zakaria s characteristic elegance and insight reflected in book reviewers in policy and economic affairs identified zakaria s strengths as being breadth of evidence used to support points and his use of personal accounts to summarize research reviewer for usa today magazine wrote that zakaria analyzes problems brilliantly ability to communicate complex situations clearly in plain language made book accessible to a wide range of readers several media outlets picked up story of barack obama reading this book while campaigning for 2008 presidential election critics commented on zakaria s teleological point of view in a review published in progressive johann hari called zakaria s assertions referring to belief that there is no alternative to globalization and free market capitalism hari cited examples where policies such as what zakaria advocated led to disasters like 1999 collapse of argentinian economy and financial deregulation resulting in financial crisis of 2007 2010 which had begun just after book was published in book zakaria maintains that economic dysfunctions are caused by and can be solved through specific government policies when asked in february 2009 about financial crisis zakaria asserted that financial practices that created collapse were american practices and that it contributed to post american mentality that us does not have all of answers hari also disagreed with zakaria s view of economic histories of britain and america which in zakaria portrayal ignores extended periods of protectionism during which their industries were developed to point where they were capable of competing with other countries likewise academic and author brendan simms found that zakaria too closely co related national wealth with national power in his argument that dispersal of global prosperity will necessarily affect global balance of power economist review found a disconnection between book s arguments and its sources in that book addresses international and national especially analysis of china and india but nearly all people behind sources cited are based or spent most of their careers in new york washington corridor richard florida in globe and mail and michael vlahos in american interest commented that zakaria state centric framework distorts real base of power which for commentator florida is in cities like shanghai and hong kong rather than all of china vlahos likened zakaria to a courtier mirroring back ruling narrative to meet global elite s emotional needs regarding book s focus one reviewer criticized it by writing post american world is missing precisely what its title promises a discussion of what a world might look like that is not dominated by united states errors concerning characterization of buddhism as indian religion and buddha s birthplace as india rather than lumbini resulted in nepali politicians demanding an apology from zakaria or
