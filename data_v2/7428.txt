191st street is a station on irt broadway seventh avenue line of new york city subway located at intersection of st nicholas avenue and 191st street in washington heights section of manhattan it is served all day by 1 train it is deepest station in new york city subway system about below street level access to station s main entrance is only provided by four elevators to mezzanine a pedestrian tunnel also extends west from station to broadway connecting it with fort george neighborhood built by interborough rapid transit company irt station opened on january 14 1911 as an infill station along first subway even though line through area had opened five years earlier no station was constructed at this location because surrounding neighborhood had a lower population than other areas of manhattan before opening of pedestrian tunnel two years later area s hilly topography made it hard for area residents to access station opening of station and tunnel led to development of surrounding area including construction of apartment buildings hundreds of lots held by bennett family since 1835 were sold at an auction in 1919 these provided additional housing opportunities for middle class taking advantage of area s improved transportation access in 2018 station had 2 526 932 boardings making it 186th most used station in station system history construction station west side branch of first subway which was constructed by interborough rapid transit company irt was extended northward from 157th street to a temporary terminus on 221st street and broadway on march 12 1906 there was no station at 191st street with construction of line population in washington heights grew rapidly it was determined that a station should be built at 191st street to bridge gap between 181st street and dyckman street stations which had become overcrowded a station had not been deemed necessary as this area of manhattan was less densely populated and it was thought that there was no need to have stations as close together as they were downtown opening of station was expected to spur development in fort george area its original sponsor was david stewart he and other property owners had pushed for station s construction seeking better accessibility to their land following announcement of station s construction and before it began interest in nearby real estate having been nonexistent in previous two years increased construction of station began on july 20 1909 work on new shafts started on august 18 1909 after legal and engineering difficulties were straightened out in previous months preliminary work involved clearing of a site in a vacant lot south of 191st street on west side of st nicholas avenue for a shaft deep more than of rock was blasted and removed from shaft it was designed to accommodate four elevators and a steel emergency staircase from surface to platform level four elevator wells were in four corners of main shaft with staircase between them emergency staircase along with those at 168th street and 181st street stations whose platforms were also accessed mainly by elevators were used for first time on march 23 1914 after elevators stopped working due to a problem at dyckman power station this resulted in extreme congestion construction of station proved difficult it required sinking of a shaft and widening of tunnel bore on both sides to accommodate platforms this was accomplished without interrupting subway service station platforms were constructed by building two new tunnels alongside existing tunnel and connecting them once platforms were complete blasting for station was limited to between midnight and 5 00 a m when subway service was less frequent station platforms were designed to be to accommodate 10 car express trains originally part of old tunnel arch was to be used for station roof however discovery of a mud seam and development of cracks in roof made it necessary to build a flat roof over tracks and filling in space between arch and roof with concrete pedestrian tunnel along with construction of station a tunnel was built to connect station at 191st street and st nicholas avenue with broadway west of fairview avenue james a lynch counsel for many subway contractors recommended construction of a tunnel street to provide better access to station and convinced local property owners and city to fund it tunnel street cost 76 000 with 5 000 provided by irt and remainder levied on neighborhood property owners at their request engineers found construction of tunnel was feasible since subway platforms would be on almost same level as broadway on october 5 1909 board of improvements of washington heights approved plans for construction of a tunnel to riverside drive three entrances to tunnel were proposed at broadway fort washington avenue and riverside drive entrances to broadway and riverside drive would have been located at street level as tunnel was to be at same elevation as streets at these locations two elevators would be required for entrance to fort washington avenue which was located at a higher elevation tunnel would have been bored from both sides and was expected to be completed within 14 months since tunnel was to be located underneath private property easements had to be obtained to allow for its construction they were acquired in a proceeding under a provision of city charter not under terms of rapid transit act in june 1910 local board of directors sent a resolution calling for construction of street tunnel to new york city board of estimate nycboe at time funding had been acquired for slightly more than half length of tunnel with remainder expected to be secured by easements nycboe approved petition for improvement and agreed to hold a public hearing on december 29 1910 unlike other streets in city easements were only acquired to a height of above tunnel in january construction was expected to begin that summer contract for underground street was let on september 9 1911 and was awarded to bell ross contracting company headed by roswell d williams on september 25 company was given a year to finish work but expected to complete it in nine months in october 1911 construction of tunnel was expected to be completed on april 1 1912 construction began in january 1912 in december 1911 local board of improvements authorized plans to extend tunnel west at grade across broadway and bennett avenue and to tunnel to a point underneath fort washington avenue highest point in manhattan where elevators would take passengers to surface an extension of tunnel was expected to lead quickly to development in area as such an extension was discussed and questions were raised concerning which agency would operate elevators in june 1912 blasting on tunnel was completed with its expected opening date being september 1912 to cut down danger of accidents contractors sank a shaft halfway up hill and tunneled east to subway station and west to broadway tunnel opened on march 8 1913 at a ceremony for tunnel s opening manhattan borough president george mcaneny commissioner williams of public service commission and other officials unanimously allowed street to be named tunnel street tunnel was also intended to be used as an easy way for pedestrians to get to st nicholas avenue at top of hill pedestrians were allowed to use elevators free of charge a new ticket booth opened on may 18 1913 on december 31 1913 appellate division of new york supreme court issued a decision denying a revision to awards made for easements for tunnel s construction since it was very windy at both entrances to tunnel storm doors were later installed at either end of tunnel at its connection to subway station elevator it is below surface tunnel was built underneath a steep hill to save people a walk of a quarter to one third of a mile 0 40 to 0 54 km and a steep climb before tunnel opened riders used circuitous routes to get to either dyckman street or 181st street stations tunnel provided better access westward to hudson river in valley between 187th street and nagle avenue tunnel was built to be wide and high in center with sides and an arched roof with a radius of tunnel was built of concrete reinforced with steel and excavated through solid rock except for at street end of tunnel which was built as a roofed over cut tunnel s construction was expected to increase development in this area of manhattan as difficult terrain would no longer be a deterrent underground street remains only one of its kind in manhattan tunnel was lined with glazed tile lit for its entire length and guarded at all times it had a stationary post where a policeman was always on duty policemen were stationed at either end of tunnel tunnel s grade from steps at broadway entrance to subway platform is one percent to allow water used in cleaning that collects around walls to drain through a sewer to subway difference between two ends is approach to entrance through building at southwest corner of 191st street and st nicholas avenue was rebuilt by morgenthau realty company in conjunction with construction of a building at this location in november 1916 work on rebuilding station entrance was completed opening and early years as of june 1910 station was expected to open in coming fall on july 18 1910 several tons of rail fell through roof of tunnel onto northbound track after an of powder was set off nearly seriously injuring a dozen workers accident delayed service for two hours although not fully completed 191st street station opened to public on january 14 1911 ticket booths which were to be in vestibules at street level had not been finished and temporary booths for sale of tickets were built and put in mezzanine a special train with guests including top irt officials and henry morgenthau ran from 137th street to station by time station opened several apartment buildings had been completed though some lots still remained available for development in words of new york times prior to opening of 191st street subway station no high class residential building was to be found north of 187th street newspaper expected fort george area to become one of choicest apartment areas of city construction of station cost 381 000 and was done as a modification to contract 1 between new york city and irt for construction of first subway space for four elevators in one shaft was included in station going down to mezzanine however only two of elevators were installed remaining elevators were to be added once ridership at station justified it these elevators rise to surface on a plot given to city by henry morgenthau company elevators were lent out to one of company s buildings which was completed at end of 1916 henry morgenthau company was involved in real estate development and had profited from increasing value land around station in 1915 station s users complained to irt about elevator service noting there was often a five six and sometimes a ten minute wait for an elevator at time except during a few hours at night and in early morning there was only one elevator operator within a year after station opened walls were black and stained ironwork was covered in rust and portions of cement in walls and ceiling had crumbled away due to water damage rock bed above station consisted of clay and shale which allowed surface water to seep into station a similar problem occurred at 181st street station and it took time to fix leaks and waterproof that station drains were installed in this station and leaks were made watertight these temporary fixes were made until city s construction of pedestrian tunnel was completed on january 3 1912 irt officials hinted that if problems could not be fixed station would be eliminated problems were eventually fixed on june 10 1919 500 lots in washington heights owned by bennett family since 1835 were sold to highest bidder land sale was expected to provide additional housing opportunities for middle class construction of a new station in between 181st street and 191st street stations similar to construction of 191st street station with entrances at 186th street and 187th street was expected to relieve projected overcrowding at those two stops it would also serve development of broadway block bounded by broadway bennett avenue and 187th street that was owned by bennett family a tunnel would have connected deep station to riverside drive and fort washington avenue construction of stop was considered a practical certainty on august 13 1925 new york city board of transportation nycbot announced two additional elevators would be added to station as ridership had increased with opening of george washington high school it opened in february 1925 adding 3 500 more daily passengers to those already using station elevators at stop handled 2 001 passengers a day in 1915 increasing by 200 to 5 187 in 1925 bids for project were received on august 28 with construction expected to be completed eight months after contract was awarded on october 14 1925 107 865 contract was awarded to otis elevator company bid was only one received nycbot found that other firms did not compete in bidding as they were unable to meet requirement that elevators be equipped with floor leveling safety devices elevators opened on september 16 1926 coinciding with start of classes at george washington high school their installation required additional power supply mid 20th century in 1948 platforms on irt broadway seventh avenue line from 103rd street to 238th street were lengthened to to allow full ten car express trains to platform unlike other stations being extended on line 191st street station already platformed 10 car trains however because it was only not all doors would open at station on april 6 1948 platform extension project was completed for stations from 103rd street to dyckman street with exception of 125th street on december 28 1950 nycbot issued a report concerning feasibility of constructing bomb shelters in subway system five deep stations in washington heights including 191st street station were considered ideal for use as bomb proof shelters program was estimated to cost 104 million shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs while protecting against shock waves and air blasts as well heat and radiation from an atomic bomb to become suitable as shelters stations would require water supply facilities first aid rooms and additional bathrooms however program which required federal funding was never completed during fiscal year 1962 two of station s elevators were replaced funding for rehabilitation of other two elevators was initially provided in 1976 new york state budget but was reallocated 940 000 would have been required to improve these elevators and those at 181st street on ind eighth avenue line in 1981 metropolitan transportation authority mta listed 191st street station among 69 most deteriorated stations in subway system on may 18 1983 bids for rehabilitation of elevators at two stops were put out to tender on august 21 1989 with start of 1 weekday skip stop service 1 trains began skipping this station between 6 30 am and 7 00 pm while 9 trains served station during these times on september 4 1994 midday skip stop service was discontinued and 191st street was no longer a skip stop station new york division bulletin electric railroaders association 37 9 september 1994 skip stop service ended on may 27 2005 elevator operators in 2001 nonprofit group upper manhattan together made it a priority to improve 191st street station at time passengers had to wait on long lines to get to platforms since only one or two of elevators at station usually worked group had persuaded new york city department of transportation nycdot to paint and improve lighting in pedestrian tunnel and turned their attention to station s elevators according to an mta spokesperson three elevators were supposed to be running during rush hours one of elevators was being renovated with a second to be done later they also stated station would be completely overhauled in 2003 station and pedestrian tunnel were closed between july 1 and december 31 2003 for renovation project 15 million renovation was done by new york city transit crews in house as part of project station s elevators were upgraded new lighting ceramic wall tiles granite floor tiles and a new public information system were installed and steel and concrete supports were repaired all of deteriorating tiles and mosaics were replaced with exact reproductions made by token booth was moved to opposite wall as part of project compare two images in july 2003 to reduce costs mta announced that as part of its 2004 budget it would eliminate 22 elevator operator positions at this station and four others in washington heights leaving one full time operator per station agency had intended removing all attendants at these stops but kept one in each station after many riders protested change saved 1 2 million a year after taking effect on january 20 2004 mta employees had joined riders in worrying about an increase in crime as a result of cuts after an elevator operator at 181st street helped save a stabbed passenger in november 2007 as part of a savings cuts plan mta planned to remove all attendants saving 1 7 million a year on december 7 2007 mta announced plan was being shelved due to pushback from elected officials and area residents in october 2018 mta again proposed removing elevator operators at five stations but this decision was reversed after dissent from transport workers union elevator attendants currently serve as a way to reassure passengers as elevators are primary access to platforms passengers often wait for them with an attendant attendants at five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who have suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs elevators at this station will be closed and replaced between february 2020 and february 2021 though station will remain open via exit to broadway it is unclear whether elevator operators will keep their jobs after elevators replacement although mta is committed to retaining operators new elevators will be able to

ceiling is supported by 34 steel columns encased in concrete at approximately below street level it is deepest station in new york city subway system in 1947 victor hess who won 1936 nobel prize in physics for his discovery of cosmic rays wrote to nycbot asking if he could use station to carry out experiments on radiation emitted from rocks at a location well protected from cosmic rays ultimately hess was allowed to conduct his experiments in nearby 190th street station on ind eighth avenue line which is also far below ground despite depth of 191st street station next station north dyckman street is just above ground level this is because 191st street is at nearly highest point on island of manhattan and this station is deep in washington heights mine tunnel while dyckman street runs along a deep valley almost at sea level and its station is at tunnel portal 191st street station is actually at a higher elevation above sea level than dyckman street station is as part of mta s

exits from this station via same fare control main entrance exit at southwest corner of 191st street and st nicholas avenue is at summit of a hill and accessible only by a set of four elevators elevators to mezzanine still utilize elevator operators one of few stations in system to do so other entrance exit at 190th street and broadway west of station is located at a hillside and is accessed via a three block long passageway which passes under wadsworth terrace and avenue station is not compliant with americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada and thus cannot be used by patrons with wheelchairs because access from fare control area to platforms is only possible via stairways tunnel street passageway passageway between station s broadway entrance and station itself is not maintained by mta despite being marked as a subway entrance it is a property of new york city department of parks and recreation and is officially called tunnel street tunnel is also used as a connector between western and eastern washington heights passengers using other entrance at 191st street and st nicholas avenue need to take an elevator to access station due to that intersection s height elevators at that entrance which are outside fare control are considered a convenient way to traverse neighborhood without walking up a hill in early 1990s as city s crime rates reached an all time high station was considered very dangerous with 11 crimes having taken place there in 1990 many of them were suspected to have happened in tunnel at time tunnel was dimly lit covered with graffiti and strewn with garbage brighter lights were installed in 2000 in february 2006 state senator eric schneiderman and others proposed city turn tunnel over to mta they felt mta had more experience in maintaining tunnels noting it owned tunnels at 181st street and 190th street stations on ind eighth avenue line which were in better condition in september 2014 improvements began on tunnel which area residents had complained about tunnel which had graffiti and was frequented by cyclists riding bikes illegally was slated to get several murals and some new led lighting passageway has been painted with murals since late 2000s to beautify tunnel in 2008 a mural was painted on passageway leading up from broadway to station as part of groundswell community mural project it was called new york is a rollercoaster it was later vandalized and in may 2015 it was painted over since then passageway s artwork has consisted of five murals as part of a tunnel beautification program
