hms endeavour also known as hm bark endeavour was a british royal navy research vessel that lieutenant james cook commanded to australia and new zealand on his first voyage of discovery from 1768 to 1771 she was launched in 1764 as collier earl of pembroke with navy purchasing her in 1768 for a scientific mission to pacific ocean and to explore seas for surmised terra australis incognita or unknown southern land commissioned as his majesty s bark endeavour she departed plymouth in august 1768 rounded cape horn and reached tahiti in time to observe 1769 transit of venus across sun she then set sail into largely uncharted ocean to south stopping at islands of huahine bora bora and raiatea west of tahiti to allow cook to claim them for great britain in september 1769 she anchored off new zealand becoming first european vessel to reach islands since abel tasman s heemskerck 127 years earlier in april 1770 endeavour became first ship to reach east coast of australia with cook going ashore at what is now known as botany bay endeavour then sailed north along australian coast next stopping at now town of seventeen seventy agnes water in late may 1770 she narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on great barrier reef and cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her endeavour was beached on australian mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull resuming her voyage she limped into port in batavia in october 1770 her crew sworn to secrecy about lands that they had visited from batavia endeavour continued westward rounded cape of good hope on 13 march 1771 and reached english port of dover on 12 july having been at sea for nearly three years ship was largely forgotten after her epic pacific voyage spending next three years hauling troops and cargo to and from falkland islands she was renamed lord sandwich in 1775 after being sold into private hands and used to transport timber from baltic rehired as a british troop transport during american war of independence she was finally scuttled in a blockade of narragansett bay rhode island in 1778 wreck has not been precisely located but is thought to be one of a cluster of five

merchant collier earl of pembroke built by thomas for thomas millner launched in june 1764 from coal and whaling port of whitby in north yorkshire she was a type known locally as whitby cat she was ship rigged and sturdily built with a broad flat bow a square stern and a long box like body with a deep hold hosty and hundley 2003 p 41 a flat bottomed design made her well suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock her hull internal floors and were built from traditional white oak

records these lengths has mizzen as 16 yards 29 inches m if correct this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full shorter than standards of day sutherland rushton cooper and edson 1985 late 20th century research suggested annotation may be a transcription error with 19 yards 29 inches m being true reading which would more closely conform with both naval standards which standard and lengths of other masts marquardt 1995 pp 19 20 a more recent critical review of contemporary sources doesn t require a supposed typo in 1771 to explain this shorter measurement for mizzen whilst at same time offers supporting evidence of its cap being at taller supposed normal height sydney parkinson s sketches and paintings of cook s bark endeavour along with 1771 woolwich yard bark endeavour spar measurements national maritime museum in greenwich nmm zaz6594 national maritime museum endeavour 1771 draught zaz6594 and other contemporary sources suggest that shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in hold keelson but instead was stepped in lower deck 10 ft above this as was sometimes done this would bring its standing height at cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8 9 ft below main mast cap and approx 5 5 ft below foremast cap when comparing heights of standing mast tops excludes top and gallant masts from level of water line whereas shorter mizzen stepped in hold on keelson instead of lower deck would make standing mizzen cap 18 ft below main mast cap which is clearly not case when critically examining sydney parkinson s drawings and contemporary painting titled hms endeavour off coast of new holland by samuel atkins c 1794 at top of this page zooming this painting also reveals that position of mizzen channel is forward to inline with mast which it is when looking at angle of mizzen on original as fitted draught nmm zaz7844 national maritime museum greenwich endeavour 1768 as fitted draught zaz7844 using these mizzen angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where top of standing mast could be and combined with similar shroud angles sydney parkinson drew in his sketch of larboard quarter of endeavour support this theory of shorter standing mizzen stepped in lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in hold replica standing mizzen is built to this shorter measurement and stepped in hold

rhode island drawing attention to possible presence of former endeavour on seabed of bay this was swiftly disputed by british consul in rhode island who wrote claiming that endeavour had been bought from mather by french in 1790 and renamed liberte consul later admitted he had heard this not from admiralty but as hearsay from former owners of french ship it was later suggested liberte which sank off newport in 1793 was in fact another of cook s ships former hms resolution or another endeavour a naval schooner sold out of service in 1782 a further letter to providence journal stated that a

one of blockade vessels partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th century barge older remains were those of a wooden vessel of approximately same size and possibly a similar design and materials as lord sandwich ex endeavour confirmation that cook s former ship had indeed been in newport harbor sparked public interest in locating her wreck however further mapping showed eight other 18th century wrecks in newport harbor some with features and conditions also consistent with endeavour in 2006 rimap announced that wrecks were unlikely to be raised in 2016 rimap concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100 that wreck of endeavour was still in newport harbor probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on seafloor and planned to investigate ships and their artifacts further they were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects in september 2018 fairfax media reported that archaeologists from rhode island marine archaeology project had pinpointed final resting place of vessel possible discovery was hailed as a hugely significant moment in australian history but researchers have warned they were yet to definitively confirm whether wreck had been located endeavour relics and legacy in addition to search for remains of ship herself there was substantial australian interest in locating relics of ship s south pacific voyage in 1886 working men s progress association of cooktown sought to recover six cannons thrown overboard when endeavour grounded on great barrier reef a ps300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover guns but searches that year and next were fruitless and money went unclaimed remains of equipment left at endeavour river were discovered in around 1900 and in 1913 crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an endeavour cannon from shallow water near reef in 1937 a small part of endeavours keel was given to australian government by philanthropist charles wakefield in his capacity as president of admiral arthur phillip memorial australian prime minister joseph lyons described section of keel as intimately associated with discovery and foundation of australia searches were resumed for lost endeavour reef cannons but expeditions in 1966 1967 and 1968 were unsuccessful they were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from american academy of natural sciences using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate cannons a quantity of iron ballast and abandoned bower anchor conservation work on cannons was undertaken by australian national maritime museum after which two of cannons were displayed at its headquarters in sydney s darling harbour and eventually put on display at botany bay and national museum of australia in canberra with a replica remaining at museum a third cannon and bower anchor were displayed at james cook museum in cooktown with remaining three at national maritime museum in london academy of natural sciences in
