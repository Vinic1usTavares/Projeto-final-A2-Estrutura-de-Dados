established for students whose homes are far away each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation if there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year one of new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school building s name is based on its similarity to cross section of a strawberry viewed from above when strawberry panic was initially created three schools were arranged in a triangle with strawberry dorms in center and dormitory was not a single building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard story plot of strawberry panic revolves around lives of adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all girl schools which share a campus and dormitories schools are st miator s girls academy st spica s girls institute and st lulim s girls school there are twelve characters story revolves around four at each school story s main character is nagisa aoi a young girl entering her fourth year at st miator after being transferred from another school on first entering campus grounds she is overcome with joy by overall appearance of surrounding area but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill causing her to be lost and disoriented while walking around grounds trying to work out where she is nagisa comes across an older student named shizuma hanazono who happens to be astraea hill s etoile a very important person who acts as a representative between different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill nagisa is instantly overcome by shizuma s beauty and after shizuma kisses her on forehead nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in school s infirmary in an adjacent chair is another girl of same age tamao suzumi who informs her that they are to be roommates in dormitory in ensuing story nagisa is introduced to other students from each of three schools some she admires some she is intimidated by and some are merely friends encountered while attending st miator series encompasses relationships characters build with each other climaxing whenever two of characters start dating central focuses of strawberry panic are lesbian relationships and friendships between girls from three schools and etoile position and competition anime is more relationship heavy while manga is more competition heavy story of what happens to other half of st miator s etoile pairing is explored in latter portion of anime depending on media type depiction of relationships between girls is variously presented with more explicit fan service appealing visuals of girls in provocative situations in anime adaptation than in manga or light novels a hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout series as well as minor catholic religious undertones including a st mary statue on campus and a large catholic church in center of astraea hill main characters and schools at each of three schools there are four main characters who comprise original twelve characters created for short stories when series began only those twelve appear in subsequently adapted visual novel version other characters were introduced in manga and light novel versions to create plotlines and conflict and these additional characters are also featured in anime adaptation st miator s girls academy oldest of three schools which has a history of over 100 years is known for upholding old traditions it was founded on a monastery and is seen as school for brides reinforced by existence of extracurricular classes including tea ceremony flower arrangement and japanese dancing it is not unusual for students to be engaged before graduation school uniform is a long black dress designed in gothic lolita fashion at miator class names are associated with objects from nature such as and in strawberry dorms there is a concept called room temp system for students from miator every underclassman entering dormitories if they are chosen to serve upperclassman as room temps perform maid duties which include cleaning room of students they are assigned to serve nagisa aoi is main character of story she is a cheerful girl who finds pleasure in making new friends which she finds easy to do because of her open personality and sociable attitude first person she meets at miator is shizuma hanazono a mysterious upperclassman and etoile as story begins which gives miator significant influence nagisa at first finds that she is strangely affected when in presence of shizuma who in turn is extremely interested in nagisa in both manga and anime next girl she meets is tamao suzumi who becomes her close friend and roommate tamao is well regarded among her fellow miator students among first years she is seen as a viable etoile candidate she expresses some light and playful interest in nagisa but it is much less overt than shizuma s interest and is very downplayed in manga last main character from miator is chiyo a timid first year student who is employed as room temp for nagisa and tamao in anime she deeply admires nagisa st spica s girls institute has white colored buildings and uniforms and was built after miator school prides itself in advancing independence of women who play a role in improving society it is well known for its culture and accomplishments of its sports program compared to other two schools spica has what is known as st spica choir or saintly chorus which consists of students from spica who perform at special events and even concerts for students at astraea hill at spica class names are numbers in french such as un one deux two and trois three spica and miator compete with each other quite aggressively which often ends in dispute when students from these two schools get together hikari konohana a shy and quiet girl is main focus among main characters who attend spica next spica character is yaya a rebellious girl who is hikari s best friend and roommate in dormitory in anime she is very much enamored with hikari but hikari sees her as a friend in manga yaya is not a prominent character both she and hikari are members of st spica choir hikari meets an older girl named amane early on in story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other spica students due to often riding a white horse named star bright amane is admired by many of students from spica as well as students from other two schools although she does not enjoy attention in anime hikari admires her deeply and she and amane have mutual interest in each other final girl from spica is tsubomi a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on yaya s nerves she too is in st spica choir although hikari was her main motivation for joining in anime her interest in hikari seems to purely be one of friendship in manga she like yaya is not a prominent character tsubomi once remarked that yaya was more skilled than hikari at singing in choir st lulim s girls school originally le lim is newest of three schools and has pink colored buildings and uniforms its uniform is modeled after a traditional japanese school uniform style at lulim class names are letters from latin alphabet a b c etc students at st lulim s are traditionally free and relaxed and are rarely seen fighting students enjoy a lot of freedom in terms of activities or clubs they are allowed to form in effect there are a wide range of clubs at st lulim s ranging from dancing to cooking to anything else a group of at least three people can think up of three schools st lulim lulim is spelling used on mediaworks official strawberry panic website and on japanese covers of light novels and manga although le rim is used in media blasters translation of anime version has least emphasis on romance between characters although lulim characters are typically found together leader of their friendly group is chikaru minamoto student council president of lulim and a born leader she has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice or simply a shoulder to cry on other three girls include kizuna hyuga a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following chikaru s decisions finding fun in doing so she is very expressive in her actions and words not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new her close friend is remon natsume who is much like kizuna in personality but is not as accident prone as her of pair kizuna is more talkative remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be lastly there is kagome youngest of group who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear which she often talks to as if it were alive although she does not talk or express her emotions much she has a heightened perception of others emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain etoile system is a french word meaning star etoile system of astraea hill is employed as internal politics between schools and governs school operations little is shown as to influence teachers and sisters have on inter school politics system is designed for two etoiles to be instated at same time in order to work as a team in anime shizuma hanazono is sole etoile other etoile having died which is explained in latter part of story two etoiles are seen as figureheads for astraea hill although astraea has three schools both etoiles must come from same school they have certain specific duties such as greeting new students arriving at astraea hill participating in important school events and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of three schools among others they are given a private greenhouse in which to grow flowers for use during school events etoiles are elected after going through what is known as which consists of three competitions in light novels and manga versions higher scoring pairs from first two competitions carry on to third competition and pair that wins third competition becomes etoile couple in anime competition aspect of story is toned down still it facilitates culmination of story in finale and thus serves an important purpose once winners have been named a special ceremony marks end of election at which president of student council from school that won election presents two necklaces for winners to wear during their tenure as etoiles they are both identical except for colors of pendants one is red other is blue older student receives blue pendant and younger of two is given red pendant production thumb 200px right first short story from reader participation project featuring nagisa and shizuma as first couple since first issue of ascii media works dengeki g s magazine was published editors of magazine have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by people who read magazine strawberry panic s origin was in october 2003 issue of dengeki g s magazine where it was announced after ending of sakurako kimino s previous work sister princess that a new reader participation project would start following month in november 2003 issue first batch of characters from st miator were introduced nagisa shizuma tamao and chiyo and it was revealed how readers could participate in project initial system had three main girls of nagisa hikari and kizuna given without surnames who were sisters and at same time younger sisters of readers of magazine effectively putting reader in position of elder brother each girl entered her respective school and became main character of that school it was explained that coupling of main characters could be to an upperclassman a classmate or an underclassman but had to stay within school they attended for example nagisa who attended miator could not be coupled with another character from either spica or lulim at first playing role of elder brother reader gave advice to younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of schools thus readers had ability to influence coupling formations which would later be written by kimino as short stories serialized in dengeki g s magazine in december 2003 characters from spica hikari amane yaya and tsubomi and lulim kizuna chikaru remon and kagome were introduced and in january 2004 issue first illustrations of three schools and strawberry dorms were published drawn by chitose maki reader

on who they wanted to be coupled together number of votes for this first round were less than 2000 noting this editorial staff lifted restriction on only coupling within same school along with restriction of only allowing three main girls of nagisa hikari and kizuna to couple this resulted in a total of 66 different possibilities between twelve characters in series in this issue it was explained that four events were planned for stories that followed easter athletic carnival cultural festival and christmas bazaar etoile title was born in this issue which was initially used to crown best couple voted first by readers in each of four events to follow these events were going to be carried out by three schools in cooperation it became such that planning of schools resulted in them in a triangle position having dormitories at center reader s position as elder brother was canceled in this issue and game became a simple popularity vote for coupling due to this new system nagisa hikari and kizuna ceased to be sisters surnames were later added to clarify this after first story arc of short stories concluded it was shown that number of votes had increased sharply due to new voting mechanisms etoile voting was announced in july 2004 issue to take place every month as opposed to every two months which had been case beforehand deadline for voting was shifted to middle of

president of yuricon an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga and alc publishing a publishing house dedicated to yuri friedman described stories as candy apples without apples all sugary and gooey and sweet with not much of anything else to support it after initially having this stance for entire series including an early opinion on anime version friedman later changed her opinion slightly writing that anime turned out pretty good she went on to say there s no denying that strawberry panic wasn t brilliant but considering that it was meant to be trashy it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of trash heap jason thompson regarded strawberry panic manga as a nearly plotless cascade where everything seems rushed and it is difficult to keep track of characters and plot five subtitled dvds released by media blasters were reviewed by anime news network ann first dvd was declared rental worthy by ann citing characters as being a lot of fun and series as being a very laid back show that would work well as a relaxing watch over a weekend content however was described as getting series off to a slow start with limitations of first six episodes being lack in fan service humor and that it struggles to find any other reason to be compelling second dvd containing episodes seven through eleven was reviewed as failing to materialize much real plot and content of episodes was described as existing only to appeal to otaku who can get excited about moe content third dvd compiling episodes twelve through sixteen shows signs of an actual plot and contains a sudden explosion of fan service which are noted as noteworthy developments in review in fourth dvd containing episodes seventeen through twenty one series romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages in fifth and final dvd containing last five episodes hikari and amane relationship is described as lacking chemistry although nagisa and shizuma pairing is regarded as satisfying strawberry panic was one of premier titles in light novel and strawberry for yuri manga production lines when it was licensed for english language distribution by seven seas entertainment in an interview with seven seas entertainment founder jason deangelis he was posed question how do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in english his response was we try to choose titles that are already well known like pita ten shinigami no ballad or strawberry panic in terms of attracting a fan base though in end it s all about word of mouth if material is great it will stand out on its own and find its audience small format that we re publishing these books in is frankly stunning and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of property
