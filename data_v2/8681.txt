secure with reward being a share of gold of el dorado after nate s escape roman doubts eddy s ability to do his job further and ignores his superstitious claim that something cursed on island is killing his men leading him to dismiss eddy and his crew nate and elena find a passage leading to a large treasure vault in which they find body of drake assuming that he died on island searching for

several chests of treasure after displaying affection towards each other nathan sorry you didn t get your story elena ah that s all right there ll be other stories you still owe me one nathan i m good for it gameplay thumb left during combat player as nate left can use corners and walls as cover then use blind or aimed fire from cover against his opponents gameplay in uncharted is a combination of action adventure gameplay elements and some 3d platforming with a third person perspective platforming elements allow nate to jump swim grab and move along ledges climb and swing from ropes and perform other acrobatic actions that allow players to make their way along ruins in various areas of island that drake explores when facing enemies player can either use melee and combo attacks at close range to take out foes or can opt to use weapons melee attacks comprise a variety of single punches while combo attacks are activated through specific sequences of button presses that when timed correctly offer much greater damage most damaging of these is specific brutal combo which forces enemies to drop twice ammunition they would normally leave nate can only carry one pistol and one rifle at a time and there is a limited amount of ammunition per gun picking up a different firearm switches that weapon for new one grenades are also available at certain points and height of aiming arc is adjusted by tilting sixaxis controller up or down these third person perspective elements were compared by several reviewers to gears of war in that player can have drake take cover behind walls and use either blind fire or aimed fire to kill enemies in common with aforementioned game uncharted lacks an actual on screen health bar instead when player takes damage graphics begin to lose color while resting or taking cover for a brief period drake s health level indicated by screen color returns to normal game also includes vehicle sections where drake must protect jeep he and elena are in using a mounted turret and where drake and elena ride a jet ski along water filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels while players direct drake in driving jet ski they may also switch to elena by aiming gun in order to use her weapon either grenade launcher or beretta depending on chapter in defense or to clear barrels from their path game also features reward points which can be gained by collecting 60 hidden treasures in game that glimmer momentarily or by completing certain accomplishments such as achieving a number of kills using a specific weapon performing a number of headshots or using specific methods of killing enemies in subsequent playthroughs of game player can use these rewards points to unlock special options these include in game bonuses such as alternate costumes and unlimited ammunition but also non game extras such as making of videos and concept art there are also several references to other naughty dog games especially jak and daxter series this is done through branding on drake and fisher s wetsuits a reference to species that mixes otter and weasel found in game and strange relic found in one of earlier chapters which is actually a precursor orb from same series game is censored when playing on a japanese console to remove blood which normally appears when shooting enemies this follows trend of other censored console games in region such as dead rising and resistance fall of man development after completing jak 3 naughty dog assembled their most technically talented staff members and began development of uncharted drake s fortune under codename big it was in full production for about two years with a small team of engineers working on game for about a year beforehand naughty dog decided to create a brand new ip rather than opt to develop a playstation 3 jak and daxter game they wanted to create a franchise suitable for new hardware in order to develop such ideas as realistic human characters instead of stylized ones owing to limitations of previous hardware as well as create something fresh and interesting although termed as stylized realism inspiration was drawn from various sources in action and adventure genres pulp magazines movie serials and more contemporary titles like indiana jones and national treasure team felt sources shared themes of mystery and what if scenarios that romanticized adventure and aimed to include those in uncharted left thumb a platforming segment showing nathan attempting to scale outer walls of fortress game was first unveiled at e3 2006 from early previews of game inevitable comparisons of elements such as platforming and shooting between uncharted and well known tomb raider series were drawn earning title nickname of dude raider however developers saw their game as concentrating more on third person cover based play in contrast to tomb raiders auto aiming play and greater puzzle solving elements other influences they cited include resident evil 4 kill switch and gears of war throughout game s development staff tried to remain flexible and detached from original design concepts attention was focused on features that worked well while features that did not work were removed development team intended game s main setting island to play a big role in overall experience feeling too many games used bleak dark settings with monochromatic color schemes they wanted island to be a vibrant believable game world that immersed player and encouraged exploration in designing characters artists aimed for a style that was photorealistic creators envisaged main protagonist nathan drake as more of an everyman character than lara croft shown as clearly under stress in game s many fire fights with no special training and constantly living at edge of his abilities director amy hennig felt a heavily armored tough as nails protagonist with a large weapon was not a suitable hero and decided a tenacious and resourceful character would portray more human qualities supporting characters elena fisher and victor sullivan were included to avoid a dry and emotionless story fisher s character underwent changes during development in early trailers for game character had dark brown hair but ultimately color changed to blonde and style was altered writing of story was led by hennig with substantial help from neil druckmann and josh game went gold in middle of october 2007 a demo was then released on november 8 2007 on playstation network before its final release on november 19 in north america december 6 in australia and december 7 in europe demo was first placed on north american store and was initially region locked such that it would only play on a north american ps3 however this was later confirmed as a mistake as developers were apparently unaware that people from different regions could sign up for a north american account and download demo a region free demo was released soon after graphics and technology uncharted uses cell microprocessor to generate dozens of layered character animations to portray realistic expressions and fluid movements which allow for responsive player control playstation 3 s graphics processing unit reality synthesizer employed several functions to provide graphical details that helped immerse player into game world lighting models pixel shaders dynamic real time shadowing and advanced water simulation new hardware allowed for processes which team had never used in playstation 2 game development and required them to quickly familiarize with new techniques for example parallel processing and pixel shaders while blu ray afforded greater storage space team became concerned with running out of room several times uncharted used more and bigger textures than previous games and included several languages on disc gameplay elements requiring motion sensing such as throwing grenades and walking across beams were implemented to take advantage of sixaxis controller a new playstation 3 controller dualshock 3 was unveiled at 2007 tokyo game show and featured force feedback vibration uncharted was also on display at show with demonstrations that implemented limited support for vibration being naughty dog s first playstation 3 game project required company to familiarize themselves with new hardware and resulted in several development mistakes switch from developing for playstation 2 to playstation 3 prompted staff to implement changes to their development technology naughty dog switched to industry standard language c in order to participate in technology sharing among sony s first party developers company had previously used their own proprietary programming language goal a lisp based language in rewriting their game code they decided to create new programming tools as well this switch however delayed team s progress in developing a prototype as new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use ten months into full production team decided to recreate game s pipeline chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system in retrospect naughty dog s co president evan wells considered this greatest improvement to project additionally animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain desired character animations trophies integration game was patched on august 4 2008 in europe and north america to version 1 01 to include support for playstation 3 s trophy system there are 47 trophies in game that match medals that can already be won in game and one further trophy platinum trophy awarded when all other trophies have been collected uncharted was first naughty dog game to include platinum trophy type similar to other playstation 3 titles that receive trophy support via downloaded patches players must start a new save game to be awarded trophies regardless of how many medals they received in previous playthroughs this was enforced because developers wanted to avoid sharing of save data in order to gain trophies they did not earn patch was described as incredibly easy to implement owing to game already containing preliminary support for trophies via its medals system it was also stated that these hooks were already included due to naughty dog s belief that sony would roll out trophy system before game s launch in november 2007 despite mentioning that game was developed as a franchise and that it lent itself to episodic content it was later stated that no content available via download would be made for uncharted playstation home during closed beta of playstation home on october 11 2008 naughty dog released an uncharted themed game space for playstation home this space is sully s bar from game in this space users can play an arcade mini game called mercenary madness which during closed beta there were rewards rewards were removed with release of home open beta there are also three other rooms in this space in which during closed beta users had

on november 5 2009 almost a year after open beta release naughty dog has also released a game space for uncharted s sequel on october 23 2009 making uncharted first game series to have a game space for both games in its series reception uncharted drake s fortune received generally favorable reviews from game critics game informer complimented visuals and dialogue between characters drake and fisher calling them stunning and entertaining respectively they further added that production values appeared high citing level of detail and musical score playstation magazine echoed similar statements about visuals and compared them to that of crysis overall presentation of game received unanimous praise from critics who recognized game s high production values describing them as top notch incredible or comparing them to those found in hollywood when combined with overall style of game this led many reviewers to compare uncharted to summer blockbuster films with action and theme of game drawing comparisons to indiana jones film series and tomb raider as part of presentation game s story and atmosphere were also received well depth of characters was praised each having their own tone voice acting was also received well as cast nails its characterizations overall voice acting was described as a big star performance superb and stellar game designer tim schafer well known as creator of early lucasarts adventure games such as secret of monkey island has also lauded game saying he liked it a lot and jokingly thanked it for teaching him a new fashion tip nathan drake s half tucked shirt technical achievements in creating this presentation were also lauded graphics and visuals were a big part of this including appreciation of lush jungle environments with lighting effects greatly adding to them game s water effects were also appreciated overall many reviewers commented that at time it was one of best looking playstation 3 games available further to graphical aspects both facial animation and animation of characters such as nate s fluid animations as he performs platforming sections were noted although wilder animations of enemies reacting to being shot were over animated to perhaps a laughable degree criticism of game included some graphical issues such as texture pop in and screen tearing of more concern were gameplay issues including overall gameplay length being rather short with reviewers completing game in anywhere from six to ten hours and some disappointment with not particularly memorable vehicle sections inability to both aim weapons and drive jet ski was a well noted issue further some frustrating repetitive slogs with regards to constant stream of pirates and mercenaries and moving from one infuriating firefight to next towards end of game were cited as part of poorer elements of overall gameplay awards uncharted received several accolades from web review sites such as ign who named it their playstation 3 game of year sales game became
