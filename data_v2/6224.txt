regularly played dance dance revolution he noticed people playing game intensely and thought of treating gameplay like some blood sport trost made short films throughout high school before briefly attending film school after dropping out he used his tuition money to fund a short film also titled fp 2007 short film was based on original feature length script but only first ten pages were filmed feature film recreated several shots from short film trost said feature film was inspired by what they imagined a dance dance revolution film made by producer jerry bruckheimer would look like trost brothers asked producer brandon barrera to act in short film after seeing their work barrera suggested that brothers expand premise into a feature film filmmakers placed an advertisement in mountain enterprise mountain communities of tejon pass s newspaper encouraging community members to call if they wanted to help with locations catering donations or by serving as extras or crew members on film trost brothers named fp after frazier park california where they grew up jason trost said locals started referring to frazier park as fp after o c began airing he also said film s story copies that of rocky beat for beat and that there were near plagiarism moments all character names were based on his friends over 80 percent of dialogue was based on phrases frequently spoken by several frazier park residents much of profanity in script was taken from conversations overheard by costume designer sarah trost at parties and what trost brothers thought of on set further inspiration for dialogue came from grand theft auto san andreas and def jam fight for ny both of which jason trost played alongside dance dance revolution settings in fp were written using materials that trosts father had on his property due to minimal budget jason trost said he had seen several low budget films that try to be something they aren t and did not want to feign production value when they are defeated in a dance
