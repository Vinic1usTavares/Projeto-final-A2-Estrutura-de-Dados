eystein magnusson old norse magnusson norwegian oystein magnusson c 1088 29 august 1123 was king of norway as eystein i from 1103 to 1123 together with his brothers sigurd crusader and olaf magnusson although since olaf died before adulthood only eystein and sigurd were effective rulers of country while sigurd gained fame as warrior king although owed almost exclusively to his three year crusade to holy land eystein was in contrast portrayed in sagas as peace king who stayed home in norway and improved country as eystein never engaged in warfare considerably less information is written and known about him than about his brother sigurd despite his twenty year long reign just a few years short of sigurd eystein nonetheless gained affection of his people and was highly regarded by saga writers for his deeds eystein and sigurd s reign became longest joint rule in norwegian history although later saga literature narrates stereotypical accounts about two kings eystein is known to have improved infrastructure and raised buildings and churches particularly across coast in western norway and trondelag from bergen to fishing centre of lofoten in north eystein s activities were especially centered in bergen which became an important international trade hub for fish at time helped by his construction projects his activities in bergen included moving royal seat to a more central location in city and building a new royal palace as well as constructing churches and munkeliv abbey eystein died of illness in august 1123 and his brother sigurd thereby became sole norwegian king background eystein was born in 1088 or 1089 as first son of future king magnus barefoot born to an otherwise unknown mother who is only recorded to have been of low birth upon death of his father in 1103 during one of his campaigns in ireland eystein became king together with his two brothers olaf and sigurd all of whom had different mothers sigurd was about a year younger than eystein while olaf was more than ten years younger than him sigurd was only son who had accompanied their father magnus on his campaign in west but he returned to norway after magnus death many accounts concerning eystein in later sagas are characterized by literary motifs and have little value as sources on his life snorri sturluson icelandic author of early 13th century heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well stylistically and psychologically his stories includes a so called mannjevning literally comparison of men between eystein and sigurd in which two boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other in a similar fashion snorri also tells a story about how eystein managed to cure melancholy of a friend by agreeing to regularly clear time to talk with him about what troubled him saga of sigurd crusader and his brothers eystein and olaf chapter 18 on his physical appearance snorri wrote that eystein was handsomest man that could be seen he had blue open eyes his hair yellow and curling his stature not tall but of middle size saga of sigurd crusader and his brothers eystein and olaf chapter 17 more reliable information particularly about eystein s building projects is offered in earlier sagas such as work of theodoric monk a norwegian chronicler who wrote in late 12th century reign co rule between eystein sigurd and olaf entailed a shared kingship and kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders during early years of their reign eystein is nonetheless said to have stayed mostly in western norway and trondelag while sigurd was in viken in practice only eystein and sigurd ever ruled as kings as olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name one of earliest acts by kings was passing a retterbot a special law ordained by king which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from danish rule of sweyn and aelfgifu under cnut great in early 1030s kings became very popular because of this according to some sources main motivation for abolishing taxes was to gain support of population for sigurd s planned crusade thumb 190px left coin thought to represent co rule of eystein and sigurd and thus dated to 1115 23 in 1107 or 1108 after years of preparations sigurd sailed with a large fleet on a crusade to holy land first european king ever to do so sigurd arrived back in norway in 1111 eystein on other hand did not engage in any warfare and considerably less information is thus written about him than about sigurd although snorri notes that he had also effected much in country that was useful while king sigurd was on his journey saga of sigurd crusader and his brothers eystein and olaf chapter 15 while sigurd gained fame in posterity as warrior king although mainly because of his one time crusade krag 1995 p 175 eystein was portrayed by saga writers as peace king who stayed at home and improved country since sigurd remained king for nineteen years after his crusade with little controversy historian claus krag has considered that domestic peace probably could be attributed equally to sigurd krag 1995 p 177 in order to contrast eystein with sigurd snorri tells a story that eystein instead subdued jamtland to norwegian crown peacefully through use of gifts and diplomacy despite snorri s account historical records indicate that jamtland did not succumb to norwegian rule until much later during reign of king sverre in 1178 eystein and sigurd are however known to have claimed monopoly on trade and taxation in gunnes 1976 p 345 fish became an increasingly important commodity during eystein s reign as more cod was fished in northern norway and demand for stockfish soared in europe as most suitable port bergen became main trade hub for exporting stockfish including trade connections with grimsby in england while it also served to import much needed goods such as grain and flour to further trade eystein had fishing booths and a church built in fishing centre at vagan in lofoten in northern norway gunnes 1976 p 313 and he sailed north to lofoten and himself in 1114 bertelsen 1995 p 18 he also secured route along coast by constructing a port in agdenes on mouth of trondheimsfjord as well as smaller beacons along coast eystein s port construction in agdenes was compared by theodoric monk to that of augustus caesar at brundisium an association readily reflected by theodoric s use of latinised name form augustinus for eystein ancient history of norwegian kings chapter 32 footnote 316 otherwise pope callixtus ii calls eystein in a letter existence of a now lost port in agdenes dated to around eystein s reign has been supported by recent archaeological surveys in area snorri also says that eystein had several large dry docks built in nidaros and that he had a large ship built which in size and shape resembled great ship ormen lange once built by king olaf tryggvason saga of sigurd crusader and his brothers eystein and olaf chapter 27 eystein also improved shelters in mountain passes notably at hjerkinn in dovre to more comfortable houses with permanent supervision thumb 350px funeral procession of eystein imagined by gerhard munthe in snorri s mannjevning between eystein and sigurd eystein allegedly maintains that his own building projects in norway were more useful for country than you sigurd killing for devil in serkland eystein was particularly active in bergen and his role in development of city was probably more important than that of king olaf founder of city according to sagas gunnes 1976 p 331 he moved royal seat in city from to holmen on eastern shore of vagen in city core thereby rationalising bureaucracy at holmen he built a church of apostles probably a stave church liden 1980 p 137 and a st nicholas church 1998 p 7 as well as a royal palace which according to snorri sturluson was most imposing wooden building ever raised in norway although theodoric monk who wrote earlier already noted it was now almost collapsed from excessive age he also built a st michael s church and founded benedictine abbey munkeliv abbey at and tithe to church was introduced during reign of eystein and sigurd eystein died on 29 august 1123 not long after he was seized with an illness during a feast at in fraena more og romsdal snorri tells that his body thereafter was taken to nidaros and buried in nidaros cathedral according to snorri it was generally said that so many mourners never stood over any man s grave in norway as over king eystein s at least since death of magnus good reign of eystein and sigurd was longest joint rule in norwegian history sigurd ruled alone after eystein s death until sigurd s own death in 1130 family eystein married from a prominent noble family of their marriage was part of eystein s strategy of building alliances in eastern norway they had a daughter maria who became mother of future royal pretender olaf by her marriage to gudbrand olaf was named king in 1165 during norwegian civil war era but was subsequently defeated by magnus erlingsson and forced to flee country legacy opinions on eystein have been strongly favourable theodoric monk wrote about eystein that he was a paragon of honesty who governed himself no less than his subjects with moderation and wisdom he was a king who loved peace an assiduous manager of public affairs and above all a fosterer of christian religion ancient history of norwegian kings chapter 32 snorri sturluson later wrote that eystein was wise intelligent and acquainted with laws and history he had much knowledge of mankind was quick in counsel prudent in words and very eloquent and very generous he was very merry yet modest and was liked and beloved indeed by all people view of eystein as a peaceful and domestically active king has been supported by modern historians such as claus krag although noting that literary embellishments should be disregarded a stylized marble bust of eystein dated to before middle of 12th century was found during excavations at munkeliv abbey in 1853 and it represents oldest known preserved portrait of a norwegian king krag 1995 p 176 bust has inscription eystein rex and was originally probably part of a full figure statue built into wall liden 1980 p 150 headpiece worn on bust has been said to resemble a german imperial crown gunnes 1976 p 340 or to be of a byzantine type according to snorri sturluson eystein had somewhat large eyes which seems to correspond with bust since snorri may have seen bust in bergen himself it is unclear if his account represents an independent source on eystein s physical appearance today bust is located in collections of bergen museum to commemorate his status as founder of fishing town vagan although it had been an important centre for at least a century a huge statue of eystein by arthur was raised at in vagan in 1935 bertelsen 1995 pp 18 19 after an idea of architect harald sund at hjerkinn in dovre a church dedicated to eystein was constructed in 1969 according to a design by magnus poulsson in commemoration of eystein s
