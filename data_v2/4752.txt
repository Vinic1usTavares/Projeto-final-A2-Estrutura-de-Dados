following a nine year absence from show it was established that although tony was currently in prison he and bianca were in a relationship and that he acted as a father figure to her children whitney dean liam butcher james forde and tiffany dean maisie smith it was originally stated that tony was biological father of bianca s youngest son mixed race morgan jackson king devon higgs which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that coghill who is white had been cast in role show s producers explained that tony was not really morgan s father and that reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival although tony did not appear in show until september 2008 his arrival was anticipated from april of that year when eastenders executive producer santer commented that series was building a picture of his character and that it would be interesting to see him on screen it was reported on 2 july 2008 that tony would be arriving in serial as part of a child sexual abuse storyline involving whitney bbc news described plot as an ongoing predatory paedophile storyline noting that this was first time this subject matter had been tackled by a uk soap opera an eastenders spokesperson stated that programme makers were working in close conjunction with nspcc in order to portray subject matter accurately and sensitively commenting that show aims to raise awareness of real life issues and has in past similarly drawn attention to issues such as domestic violence rape and hiv john grounds nspcc s director of communications praised soap for raising awareness of issue sara nathan of sun reported that story had been planned since previous year and would begin with whitney worrying about tony s release from prison and effect it would have on her family storyline was first conceived when eastenders series consultant simon ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend mother in order to grow closer to child and related scenario to bianca s return to soap bbc head of drama john yorke explained that idea when presented drew a sharp intake of breath most eastenders stories that have been good and successful have been ones that caused sharp intake of breath so they re always kind of stories you look for final approval for storyline was sought from bbc head of fiction jane tranter on 2 june 2008 tranter explained that i thought it was a fantastically good idea big moments in eastenders those iconic pieces of television history tend to be things that are incredibly near knuckle and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in context of a family sitting room soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits difficult bits taboo bits but if a soap doesn t hold up that mirror then actually what is it it will have no depth development coghill was cast as tony on 20 june 2008 he deemed role most challenging he had ever played but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse of his off screen relationship with mcgarty coghill explained that it helped that she does not look or act like a young child deeming her fantastic to work with as well as very natural very instinctive and a natural actress commenting there isn t any uncomfortable feeling at all having undergone a thorough characterisation session coghill began shooting on 30 june 2008 and first appeared on screen on 12 september 2008 coghill has explained that tony began grooming whitney as soon as he met bianca ingratiating himself so as to become family s hero figure and saviour coghill elucidated lie that tony has spun to whitney is that as soon as she s 16 they ll run away together and start a new life but tony s type of paedophile who preys on younger children whitney is beginning to pass her sell by date with him he feels like he s losing his little girl but needs to keep whitney under his control and not speak out as tony began to lose interest in whitney he started grooming her 14 year old school friend lauren branning a show insider commented that tony had been getting away with abusing whitney for years but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him tony left soap on 12 december 2008 after his true nature was exposed it was announced on 7 september 2009 that he would return to eastenders to be put on trial coghill was pleased to return believing it right that tony s story arc should conclude realistically giving closure to storyline and continuing to raise awareness of issue santer commented one of unique things about eastenders is its ability to play stories over months and years chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing long term consequences of tony s abuse of whitney and i hope continue to do justice to issue of child sex abuse grounds praised tony s trial stating that it demonstrated importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice palmer felt that if one person out there who s been abused saw that legal system go out of their way to make it easier on victim whitney s evidence is given by video link it will be worth it reception bbc and television regulatory body ofcom received 70 complaints after whitney s first scenes with tony aired a bbc spokesman responded this is a difficult and challenging storyline but one which keeps with tradition of show for tackling difficult social issues such as domestic abuse and mental health in past all content on screen adheres to bbc s editorial guidelines guardian s aida edemariam said of beginning of storyline what is most disturbing watching tony and whitney s first scenes together is not sexuality of situation per se though that is uncomfortable it s subtle blackmail with which he keeps her in line as it s combined with emotional manipulation native to soaps viewer starts to feel a bit bullied too numbers of viewer complaints rose within days to over 200 new statesman journalist jeremy sare commented on public outrage and defended eastenders decision to air storyline writing sare quoted a bbc spokeswoman as saying we appreciate that for some viewers this storyline will have particular resonance and significance in running it it s certainly not our intention to cause distress or upset either to those who ve suffered from sexual abuse or their families our aim is instead to raise awareness of this very sensitive issue concluding his article with summation producers dilemma is instructive to children s charities and ministers alike on how to confront issue in a digestible manner which can stimulate an objective debate mirror s beth neil branded plot strand one of darkest and most disturbing storylines eastenders has ever attempted with critic jim shelley deeming it to be a new low for eastenders shelley wrote of whitney s abuse you ve really got to hand it to eastenders just when you thought show couldn t get any more miserable writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed a paedophile storyline thanks for that i realise now this is what family meal has been missing three nights a week gathering telly to watch a grubby thug drooling over a 15 year old girl who as luck would have it spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she s not at school and they say family entertainment s dead shelley refuted bbc s claims that storyline had educational value as totally bogus observing that at 7 30 or 8pm action has to be so coded as to be pointless deborah orr writing for independent similarly disagreed with bbc s statement that storyline was part of eastenders rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues writing that daily mail s lizzie smith deemed storyline horrifying while guardian s julie raeside has questioned is this latest sexual abuse storyline a good thing to position in a pre watershed soap opera or should eastenders storyliners stick to a less controversial brand of misery however in contrast to public and media dissent nspcc s director of communications john grounds has praised storyline for helping to raise awareness of hidden nature of sexual abuse deeming it to be vital in persuading people to take action to stop it and encouraging children to speak out episodes from storyline were submitted to royal television society programme awards 2008 for a panel to judge in category soap and continuing drama eastenders
