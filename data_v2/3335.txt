battle of raz de sein was a naval engagement of blockade of brest during french revolutionary wars between a french and royal navy ships of line on 21 april 1798 british blockade fleet under admiral lord bridport had sailed from st helens on 12 april and on morning of 21 april was crossing iroise passage when sails were spotted to east three ships were detached in pursuit led by 74 gun ship of line hms mars under captain alexander hood as british ships approached their quarry a third sail was sighted to southeast close to coastline and moving north towards brest this ship was 74 gun hercule under captain louis l heritier newly commissioned at lorient and sailing to brest to join main french fleet and british squadron immediately changed direction to intercept new target facing overwhelming odds l heritier attempted to escape through narrow raz de sein passage but found tide against him and so anchored at mouth of passage to await british attack at 21 15 mars reached hercule coming under heavy fire as hood manoeuvred into position bringing his ship crashing alongside french vessel for more than an hour ships fired directly into one another so close that their guns could not be run out but had to be fired from inside ships damage and casualties were severe on both sides latter including hood who was mortally wounded at height of engagement ultimately hercule was forced to surrender after attempts to board mars failed both ships were battered and burnt with french suffering at least 290 casualties and british 90 hercule was conveyed to britain in aftermath and later repaired and served in royal navy until 1810 both l heritier and deceased hood were highly praised for their conduct during battle which is noted as being a very rare example during this period of an action between two ships of approximately equal strength without any external influence background during french revolutionary wars royal navy had exerted dominance at sea over its continental rivals most immediately french navy with its principal fleet based at brest on breton coast of bay of biscay to contain this fleet british practiced a close blockade strategy maintaining a fleet off brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent french fleet from breaking out into atlantic ocean woodman p 100 this blockade force also limited french trade and maritime communications attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce main french fleet this made french maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters in june 1795 main french fleet had suffered a defeat at hands of blockade force at battle of groix in approaches to port of lorient clowes p 261 while at action of 13 january 1797 independently sailing 74 gun ship of line droits de l homme was driven ashore and destroyed in approaches to brest by two frigates of blockade squadron woodman p 89 on 12 april 1798 british blockade fleet under command of admiral lord bridport sailed from its winter anchorage at st helens on isle of wight for breton coast bridport mustered ten ships of line to maintain watch on brest although detachments of fleet had been cruising in region since 25 january and with notice he could call on 28 ships of line french fleet had suffered a series of setbacks in early years of war in addition to losses at groix seven ships had been lost at glorious first of june in 1795 and more were wrecked during failed croisiere du grand hiver operation of 1795 and expedition d irlande in 1796 clowes p 553 to replenish these losses french navy was building new ships at its major fleet bases and in april 1798 a ship had been commissioned at lorient hercule a 74 gun ship of 1 876 tons burthen launched in july 1797 and commanded by experienced captain louis l heritier veteran of glorious first of june and with a crew of 680 20 short of a full complement pursuit on 20 april l heritier was ordered to take hercule on her maiden voyage short journey northwest along coast to join main fleet under vice admiral de at brest where crew would be augmented to reach full complement on board were surplus naval supplies including a full set of rigging for a ship of line from destroyed ship quatorze juillet which had caught fire at lorient earlier in month l heritier s crew were inexperienced and captain did not intend to seek action remaining close to coastline during first day of journey as his ship crossed bay between point h and pointe du raz however sails were sighted to northwest these sails belonged to three ships of bridport s fleet at 11 00 on 21 april british fleet had been cruising in iroise passage when two sails were sighted approximately to east bridport ordered his three most easterly ships to detach and investigate sails 74 gun ships of line hms mars under captain alexander hood hms ramillies under captain henry inman and 38 gun frigate hms jason under captain charles stirling clowes p 336 strong winds favoured large ships of line as they pursued strange sails woodman p 101 which were identified as french until at 14 00 they were pulling abreast of them when a third sail was sighted about to southeast sailing close to shore james p 107 this new sail was much larger than others sighted earlier in day and detached squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards new arrival hercule by 17 45 l heritier was in full flight with british force strung out behind him rest of bridport s fleet far to west jason had lead with mars shortly behind although inman on ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back hood an experienced officer and a nephew of both bridport and veteran admiral lord hood pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both jason and hercule l heritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed and sought instead to escape through narrow and dangerous channel of raz de sein a rocky passage between ile de sein and pointe du raz during expedition d irlande french ship of line had been wrecked in raz de sein with 680 lives james p 6 as hercule approached channel hood put mars on starboard tack overtaking jason and bearing down on french ship james p 108 at 20 30 l heritier recognised that current was too strong for hercule to successfully navigate raz de sein and instead anchored at mouth of channel with a spring on his cable a system of attaching bow anchor that increased stability and allowed l heritier to swing his broadside to face enemy while stationary roughly southwest of pointe de raz and about from his destination at brest james p 108 battle thumb right action between hms mars and hercule on night of 21st april 1798 to memory of intrepid captn hood nicholas pocock at 20 45 with jason far behind in darkness mars hauled up and hood attempted to manoeuvre into an effective position from which to attack waiting hercule vagaries of current in raz de sein passage prevented hood from handling his ship effectively however and instead he resolved on bringing mars directly alongside and fighting broadside to broadside clowes p 337 at 21 15 mars was in range and l heritier opened fire hood replying immediately for ten minutes masts and rigging of mars came under fire with damage to bowsprit and foremast as hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against current before pulling slightly ahead of hercule at 21 25 and dropping anchor port bow anchor became entangled with starboard anchor on hercule and british ship was swung violently into french ship force of collision four of gunports on mars thus locked together both captains ordered their ships to pour fire into other so closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships could not be run out and instead had to be fired from inside ships james p 108 heat from this sustained bombardment was so intense that wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in sides of each ship during combat ragged holes torn in side of hercule were so extensive that planking between gunports was torn away leaving wide scars along ship s sides casualties were heavy on both sides 20 minutes after action began a musket ball struck hood in thigh severing his femoral artery fatally wounded and bleeding profusely hood was carried below and command passed to lieutenant william butterfield french casualties were significantly higher than british a result of much higher rate of fire achieved by hood s well trained crew aware that his ship was suffering worst of casualties l heritier ordered his men to attempt to board british ship of line but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties lighting of hercule had gone out at beginning of engagement leaving her crew confused and as a result only around 40 men answered when l heritier ordered boarding troude p 126 he was himself injured twice to head by a sabre and to thigh by a pike while leading assault quintin pp 242 243 at 10 30 after an hour of continual bombardment l heritier surrendered hercule s hull had been torn open five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of crew killed or wounded jason was approaching fast and rest of bridport s fleet was close enough to see muzzle flashes from battle aftermath thumb right death of captain alexander hood 1798 henry singleton l heritier submitted his sword to butterfield in surrender and it was presented to dying hood who accepted it before expiring at 22 50 jason arrived and stirling took charge of removing prisoners from hercule and began long process of extricating two battered ships of line from dangerous raz de sein channel losses on french ship were not accurately recorded in aftermath of action but some accounts suggested they were as high as 400 although a more realistic estimate of 290 casualties was made by surviving french officers british losses amounted to three officers and 19 men killed eight men missing believed to have drowned after falling overboard resisting l heritier s boarding attempts and another 60 wounded weather was fortunately calm as neither mars nor hercule were in a condition to survive a storm and with great care hercule was brought into plymouth on 27 april and repairs were begun with intention of restoring ship to active service condition cost of these repairs totaled ps12 500 equivalent of ps as of but hms hercule was ultimately commissioned into royal navy and served until 1810 gardiner p 101 historian robert gardiner has noted that this classic fight was unusual in being fought between two single ships of line of equal force and size without an external influence gardiner p 100 and edward pelham brenton wrote in 1823 that meeting of two ships of line is a circumstance of rare occurrence and its decision in our favour a brilliant ornament to our naval history he could only identify three other such incidents in british naval history brenton p 387 examination of relative size and strength of combatants shows that they were well matched respective broadside weights were 984 lbs on mars to 985 lbs on hercule hercules at 1 876 tons burthen measured only 34 tons more than mars pp 161 217 and hercule s understrength crew of 680 was still 46 more than on board p 109 and british crew had also been active during spithead mutiny in 1797 during which hood had been temporarily deposed as captain hood alexander oxford dictionary of national biography j k laughton and a w h pearsall subscription required retrieved 30 march 2013 both were relatively new ships hercule only 24 hours at sea while mars was of 1794 mars class built at start of french revolutionary wars lavery p 184 in summary historian william james indicates that greater experience of hood s crew and nearby presence of other british ships gave mars a slight advantage but that action of mars and hercule was one that in conduct of it throughout reflected about an equal share of credit upon both contending parties james p 110 although some british histories reported that l heritier died of his wounds in aftermath of action this was not case on his return to france following exchange l heritier faced a court martial for loss of his ship and was honorably acquitted and received a letter of praising his resistance from minister of marine rear admiral etienne eustache bruix in britain butterfield was promoted to commander woodman p 102 and hood was posthumously commended bridport writing in his official dispatch that no praise of mine can add one ray of brilliancy to distinguished valour of captain alexander hood his body was returned to england and buried near his home in butleigh somerset under a monument provided by his family
