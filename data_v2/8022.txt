united states football league and university of pittsburgh panthers football team for a single season each after its closing three rivers stadium was imploded in 2001 and pittsburgh pirates and pittsburgh steelers moved into newly built stadiums pnc park and heinz field respectively history planning and construction a proposal for a new sports stadium in pittsburgh was first made in 1948 however plans did not attract much attention until late 1950s pittsburgh pirates played their home games at forbes field which opened in 1909 and was second oldest venue in national league philadelphia s connie mack stadium was oldest having opened only two months earlier than forbes pittsburgh steelers who had moved from forbes field to pitt stadium in 1964 were large supporters of project for their part according to longtime pirates announcer bob prince pirates wanted a bigger place to play in order to draw more revenue in 1958 pirates sold forbes to university of pittsburgh for 2 million million today university wanted land for expanded graduate facilities as part of deal university leased forbes back to pirates until a replacement could be built an early design of stadium included plans to situate stadium atop a bridge across monongahela river it was to call for a 70 000 seat stadium with hotels marina and a 100 lane bowling alley plans of stadium over monongahela were eventually not pursued a design was presented in 1958 which featured an open center field design through which fans could view pittsburgh s golden triangle a site on city s northside was approved on august 10 1958 due to land availability and parking space latter of which had been a problem at forbes field same site had hosted exposition park which pirates had left in 1909 stadium was located in a hard to access portion of downtown making it hard in later years to get in before games and leave after games political debate continued over north side sports stadium and project was often behind schedule and over budget arguments were made by commissioner and former allegheny county medical examiner dr william mccelland that pirates and steelers should fund a higher percentage of 33 million project million today due to lack of support however arguments faded thumbtime 14 thumb boat pulls a water skier from confluence of monongahela allegheny and ohio rivers at point state park in pittsburgh toward three rivers stadium on northern shore of ohio river circa 1977 ground was broken on april 25 1968 and due to steelers suggestions design was changed to enclose center field construction continued though it became plagued with problems such as thieves stealing materials from building site in april 1969 construction was behind schedule and target opening of april 1970 was deemed unlikely that november arthur gratz asked city for an additional 3 million million today which was granted in january 1970 new target date was set for may 29 however because of a failure to install lights on schedule opening day was pushed back to july 16 stadium was named in february 1969 for its location at confluence of allegheny river and monongahela river which forms ohio river it would sometimes be called house that clemente built after pirates right fielder roberto clemente opening day in their first game after all star break in 1970 pirates opened stadium against cincinnati on thursday july 16 team donned new uniform designs for first time that day a similar plan was for new mini skirts for female ushers however ushers union declined uniform change for female workers a parade was held before opening ceremonies expansive parking lot both pirates and steelers team offices allegheny club vip club and press boxes and facilities were not opened until weeks later due to extended labor union work stoppages instead of allowing cars to park team instructed fans to park downtown and walk to stadium over bridges or take shuttle buses opening of three rivers marked first time pirates allowed beer to be sold in stands during a game since early 1960s during batting practice on that day a stray foul ball hit a woman named evelyn jones in eye while she was walking stadium s concourse she sued pirates and their subsidiary that managed stadium arguing that baseball rule which usually prevents spectators at baseball games from holding teams liable for foul ball injuries did not apply because she was away from seating areas and not watching what was going on on field a jury awarded jones 125 000 but it was reversed on appeal that decision was in turn reversed by pennsylvania supreme court which agreed with her argument about baseball rule and also noted that opening to concourse through which foul had passed was a purely architectural choice that was not necessary to game of baseball design and alterations thumb left a steelers game in 1996 three rivers stadium was similar in design to other stadiums built in 1960s and 1970s such as rfk stadium in washington shea stadium in new york riverfront stadium in cincinnati houston astrodome veterans stadium in philadelphia and busch memorial stadium in st louis which were designed as multi purpose
