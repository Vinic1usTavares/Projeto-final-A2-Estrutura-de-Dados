from during hour long period massa set session s fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 20 981 seconds almost four tenths of a second ahead of his teammate raikkonen two mclaren drivers were third and fourth kovalainen ahead of hamilton fernando alonso and nelson piquet jr set fifth and eighth fastest times respectively for renault they were separated by glock and kubica their teammates

lap time of day a 1 20 554 kovalainen finished with third fastest time renault drivers were again quick piquet in second and alonso fourth although team s executive director of engineering pat symonds admitted both cars were running with slightly lower fuel loads than normal improving their performance raikkonen and massa slipped to fifth and sixth respectively their best times one thousandth of a second apart they were ahead of heidfeld kubica trulli and williams driver nico rosberg vettel s car was still suffering from hydraulics problem and he completed just five laps again setting slowest time of session saturday s weather was again dry for third and final practice session with ambient temperature between and track temperature from hamilton again set fastest time a 1 20 228 quicker than his best on friday this put him immediately ahead of massa glock kovalainen and piquet heidfeld was much happier with setup of his car and set sixth fastest time but kubica suffered a mechanical problem that restricted him to 18th position vettel had a trouble free session and set eighth fastest time one position behind teammate sebastien bourdais raikkonen and rosberg completed top ten ahead

three parts in first 20 minute period cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated second qualifying period lasted 15 minutes at end of which fastest 10 cars went into final period to determine their grid positions for race cars failing to make final period were allowed to be refuelled before race but those competing in it were not and carried more fuel than they had done in earlier qualifying sessions to see them through first part of race session was held in dry weather slightly hotter than any of free practice sessions ambient temperature ranged between while track temperature ranged between hamilton set fastest time in first and final parts of session which clinched him pole position with a lap of 1 20 899 although he was pleased with handling of his mclaren he said that he had never been more comfortable in car he believed that he could have recorded a faster lap as he made a slight mistake going into turn five hamilton was joined on front row by his teammate kovalainen who recorded a lap time 0 241 seconds slower and was fuelled for an additional two laps in race massa set session s fastest time of 1 19 068 during its second part but was delayed by other cars which prevented him from heating his tyres sufficiently to achieve maximum grip possible he dropped to third overall in final part of qualifying raikkonen was on a heavier fuel load than his teammate but made a mistake on his final flying lap that restricted him to sixth place that left him behind kubica and glock on grid kubica achieved his competitive time despite handling problems which led him to describe his lap as his best so far of season while glock recorded best qualifying result of his career thus far alonso qualified in seventh position with piquet in tenth on a heavy fuel load renault teammates were split by webber and trulli as soft tyres were expected to perform better in race than super softs mclaren drivers use of one fewer set of soft tyres than their ferrari counterparts during qualifying session suggested hamilton and kovalainen might have had a tyre performance advantage in race this was because soft tyre was fastest tyre choice over course of a single lap despite theoretical performance advantage of super soft ferrari used one more set of soft tyres than mclaren before realising this was case vettel was fastest driver not to advance into final session qualifying 11th his best time of 1 20 131 was just over a second slower than massa s pace in second session his teammate bourdais set 14th fastest lap but was penalised five positions on grid for impeding heidfeld during first part of qualifying a delay which limited bmw sauber driver to 16th fastest time toro rosso drivers were split before bourdais penalty by jenson button who found his honda s revised suspension a significant improvement and david coulthard who believed hungaroring did not suit handling characteristics of his red bull rb4 chassis rosberg made it into second part of qualifying but did not complete any laps thereafter after his williams car developed a hydraulics problem kazuki nakajima williams rubens barrichello honda and force india drivers giancarlo fisichella and adrian sutil failed to advance beyond first part of qualifying and thus completed final rows of grid in first part of qualifying only section in which all drivers took part entire field was

day attendance was 84 000 as usual race was broadcast worldwide with world feed coverage being produced by fom every driver except coulthard started on soft compound tyres massa made a good start on his only remaining new set of soft tyres moving ahead of kovalainen from grid and drawing alongside hamilton into first corner hamilton held inside line for turn but massa braked later than mclaren driver and passed him around outside behind leading three in run down to first corner glock moved ahead of kubica while alonso overtook raikkonen barrichello made best start in field moving from 17th to 13th place at end of first lap while vettel made a poor start and lost four places over same distance at completion of first lap massa led from hamilton kovalainen glock kubica alonso raikkonen

benefited from problems that afflicted pace setters hamilton and felipe massa to take only win of his formula one career massa and hamilton immediately began to pull clear of kovalainen on lap 3 button overtook his teammate barrichello for 13th position but both honda drivers were stuck behind heidfeld who was carrying a heavier fuel load than them as race progressed massa began to open a small lead over hamilton who put his mclaren into a fuel saving mode attempting to jump ahead of massa later in race by making a pit stop after ferrari driver in addition high track temperature was to ferrari chassis s advantage as it was easier on its tyres than mclaren and was able to run them at an operating temperature of up to 10 degc 18 degf lower resulting in less tyre wear by lap 18 massa had a lead of 3 5 seconds over hamilton who in turn was almost 8 seconds ahead of kovalainen glock was a further 3 seconds behind second mclaren driver but was drawing ahead of kubica in fifth who was finding his bmw sauber difficult to drive in race conditions with a lack of grip and stability under braking and was holding up a group of cars behind him massa kubica and webber were first three drivers to make pit stops by coming in on lap 18 mclaren mechanics timed massa s stop to estimate amount of fuel he received and when hamilton made his own first stop on next lap they fuelled him to run for three laps longer than ferrari in second stint of race kovalainen took over lead of race for two laps before his pit stop on lap 21 returned it to massa piquet was last of leading runners to make a pit stop on lap 25 allowing him to jump ahead of kubica trulli and webber further down order vettel made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 20 and retired two laps later with an overheating engine

seconds behind massa and needed to stay within approximately 3 5 seconds of ferrari driver to gain track position after second round of pit stops massa began to pull away again easing gap open to 4 seconds by lap 32 while hamilton locked his front left wheel as he tried to keep up with ferrari flat spotting tyre in process two continued to set fastest laps as they pulled away from rest of field on lap 29 coulthard made his first pit stop dropping to 12th place as a result button barrichello bourdais rosberg nakajima fisichella and sutil also made their first pit stops at this stage of race three of these drivers experienced delays during their pit stops which dropped them down running order barrichello and bourdais suffered flash fires while rosberg s fuel hose jammed losing him time at front of field massa continued to pull away gradually from hamilton gap between two had risen to 5 seconds by end of lap 40 on following lap hamilton s front left tyre deflated approaching turn two resultant slow lap back to pit lane and stop for a replacement tyre dropped him to tenth place massa now had a 23 second lead over kovalainen and slowed his pace accordingly adjusting performance of engine to place it under less mechanical stress he made his final pit stop on lap 44 allowing kovalainen to take lead until his own stop four laps later handing massa back his lead on lap 41 heidfeld made his only pit stop dropping from 11th to 12th position in following laps other drivers made their second stops except nakajima who switched to a one stop strategy at his first visit to his pit box behind leading trio of massa kovalainen and glock raikkonen moved ahead of alonso despite running off road just before his pit stop after he exited pit lane piquet fended off trulli as they battled for position pit stop sequence allowed hamilton to move back up order to sixth place behind alonso further back bourdais suffered another flash fire on lap 45 and made another visit to pit lane one lap later to have fire extinguisher foam cleaned off his helmet visor rosberg was final scheduled driver to make a pit stop on lap 58 majority of drivers ran with soft tyres for first two stints of

glock raikkonen alonso hamilton piquet trulli kubica webber heidfeld coulthard button nakajima rosberg fisichella sutil barrichello and bourdais running in clean air without a car immediately in front of him for first time raikkonen set fastest lap of race at 1 21 195 on lap 61 as he closed nine second gap to glock at a rate of one second per lap hamilton caught alonso at a similar rate but his rear super soft tyres began to overheat and he was unable to make any further impression after closing gap to 1 5 seconds on lap 62 sutil suffered a puncture caused by a brake failure and became second retirement of race in closing laps kovalainen reduced his deficit to massa to 15 seconds but ferrari driver appeared to be in command of race however as massa started lap 68 his engine failed without warning forcing him to retire from lead with three laps remaining kovalainen was thus promoted into lead which he held to take first victory of his formula one career in a time of 1 37 27 067 at an average speed of kovalainen was 100th driver to win a formula one world championship race glock likewise claimed best result of his career and first podium finish with second position raikkonen took final place on podium despite a failure in his car s rear suspension during final few laps alonso and piquet finished on either side of hamilton who was in fifth position leading symonds to describe race as his team s best of year so far trulli finished seventh ahead of kubica who was extremely disappointed with uncompetitive performance of his car at grand prix closest to his home country of poland his teammate heidfeld finished in tenth place between two red bull drivers both of whom were also disappointed by their team s performance button nakajima rosberg and fisichella filled next places a lap behind leader while barrichello was two laps down in 16th position after delay at his first pit stop massa was classified in 17th place ahead of bourdais who was final finisher post race although kovalainen was delighted with his first formula one victory he attributed much of credit for his win to luck after race he said i feel a bit sorry for felipe and lewis they both drove great races but i know how it feels when things go wrong i ve had a few similar moments this year i tried to put pressure on felipe especially during last stint i felt something might happen if i did that you never know but i still found it hard to believe when i saw his ferrari on fire as of 2019 race remains kovalainen s only formula one win glock was pleased with second position and spoke of how he had dedicated extra training to improve his race starts he said he had focussed on not making any mistakes in closing laps as raikkonen closed instead of maintaining gap raikkonen described his race as frustrating and boring due to amount of time he spent stuck behind slower cars podium finishers were overshadowed in media by coverage of ill fortune of both weekend s pace setters hamilton and massa massa in particular was praised for his performance ferrari team principal stefano said it was best race of his career it was fantastic way he managed race journalist mark hughes described it as almost certainly his best race to date and colleague simon arron termed it as one of finest afternoons of his f1 career both drew attention to his controlled aggression at first corner of race followed by his relentless mistake free pace arron in particular noted that massa s first corner passing move was more typical of hamilton s attacking style than his own and was a defining moment in massa s championship campaign hamilton himself later expressed surprise that massa had been able to overtake him in such a manner and warned his rival that it won t happen again hughes described grand prix as a throwback race in that leaders had suffered from unreliability and winner had not been in contention on speed alone it was a situation reminiscent of earlier times in sport when cars were generally less reliable bridgestone director of motorsport hirohide hamashima said hamilton s puncture was probably caused by debris although as a result of damage tyre had sustained precise nature of failure was impossible to determine he also stated that hamilton s tyre was more vulnerable to debris damage because he had flat spotted it earlier in race massa said he had no prior indication of his engine failure problem was later traced to a connecting rod failure caused by an impurity in component material an identical problem caused raikkonen to retire from following race 2008 european grand prix as a consequence of race hamilton extended his lead in drivers championship to five points ahead of raikkonen who moved ahead of massa in standings kubica maintained fourth place kovalainen s win moved him to within three points of heidfeld in fifth in constructors championship ferrari continued to lead but mclaren jumped ahead of bmw sauber for second position behind toyota renault moved ahead of red bull despite his increased lead hamilton acknowledged that he expected ferrari drivers to be formidable opponents in season s seven remaining races after eventual conclusion of championship in hamilton s favour by one point hungarian grand prix was highlighted as one of massa s most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win title
