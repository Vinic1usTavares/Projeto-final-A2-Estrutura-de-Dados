to pet and ride him but they fail to make enough money to cover elephant s food costs for one day homer and marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in and that stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet and tell children elephant must go family is visited by a representative of a game reserve who says their acres of open land similar to african savannah would be a good habitat for elephant to live in but homer turns them down when they will not give him any money since reserve itself is a nonprofit organization however as family is pondering what to do about

for no apparent reason while being cheered on by bart reserve s representative explains to a confused marge and lisa that sometimes like humans animals are just big jerks exemplified by homer s own unprovoked aggression upon him production thumb 160px left episode was written by john swartzwelder episode was written by john swartzwelder and directed by jim reardon simpsons creator matt groening thought it was a quintessential swartzwelder episode and executive producer show runner david mirkin said it was a fantastic job by one of most prolific writers of show most important thing to mirkin while making episode was to make sure that elephant would be a bastard and behave rudely unlike other animals on show for example instead of putting people on his back stampy would put them in his mouth mirkin said elephant never quite bonds because it s a very cantankerous animal a concept that was very important to this episode stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in series for example stampy made an appearance in season nine episode miracle on evergreen terrace in one of bart s dreams and in season fourteen episode large marge where he is used by bart in a stunt to help krusty clown win back his popularity stampy appeared briefly in simpsons movie where he tries to break down giant glass dome lowered over springfield episode also introduces character cletus spuckler he is shown as one of slack jawed yokels gawking at stampy in simpson family s backyard cletus is not named in episode so staff simply referred to him as slack jawed yokel cultural references thumb by cleaning too hard bart wipes paint off grant wood s american gothic springfield tar pits are inspired by la brea tar pits located in hancock park in los angeles california museum in background of scene where homer sinks into one of tar pits resembles george c page museum of la brea discoveries when stampy runs away he passes republican national convention with people cheering and then he passes democratic national convention with people booing this is a reference to fact that an elephant is symbol of republican party homer uses mr cleanser a parody of detergent brand mr clean to clean basement as bart cleans he accidentally scrubs paint off an american gothic painting hanging on wall under paint is a message signed by painter grant wood reading if you can read this you scrubbed too hard scene in which stampy s eye is seen through a window of simpson family s house is similar to a scene with a tyrannosaurus rex in film jurassic park while cleaning house marge turns on radio and song sixteen tons by merle travis is heard scene in which homer crashes his car into a deer statue at springfield tar pits parodies lyrics to sound of music song do re mi as homer shouts d oh followed by lisa a deer and marge a female deer homer reads an old tv guide in which synopsis of an episode of gomer pyle u s m c reads gomer upsets sgt carter a possible synopsis for every episode of that series he also imagines episode with a thought of both carter and pyle standing next to each other carter yells pyle and pyle responds shazam as stampy wreaks havoc throughout springfield patty and selma are sucked up by a tornado and fly through air in rocking chairs similar to a scene in 1939 film wizard of oz reception in its original broadcast bart gets an elephant

better updated unofficial simpsons guide warren martyn and adrian wood wrote another favourite it s hard to explain special appeal of this episode perhaps it s because homer is so exceptionally dumb or perhaps because it contains d oh a deer a female deer gag this gag was also praised by bbc news s mark milne who said it just cracks me up every time brilliant dvd movie guide s colin jacobson thought fifth season included plenty of programs with potentially cheesy concepts such as deep space homer and bart gets an elephant however he thought episode managed to easily overcome its possible flaws to turn into a very fine program homer s line marge i agree with you in theory in theory communism works in theory was jacobson s favorite of episode patrick bromley of dvd verdict gave episode
