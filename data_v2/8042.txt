professing obedience to archbishop which if true would have freed st calais from interference in his diocese barlow english church p 39 after his appointment st calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of secular clergy with monks and consulted king and lanfranc archbishop of canterbury before going to rome to receive permission from pope gregory vii knowles monastic order p 169 these

and odo had never been close and despite fact that st calais was educated at bayeux there is no evidence that odo helped st calais career some historians including w m aird have suggested that st calais felt division of conqueror s realm between two sons was unwise it has been suggested that st calais joined rebellion to reunite normans and english under one ruler st calais was only bishop who did not actively aid king rebelling magnates included roger de montgomery earl of shrewsbury robert de mowbray earl of northumbria and odo s brother robert count of mortain rebellion had failed by end

william rufus p 85 before which king seized his lands at trial st calais held that as a bishop he could not be tried in a secular court and refused to answer accusations lanfranc presented king s case declaring that confiscated lands had been held as fiefs and thus st calais could be tried as a vassal not as a bishop st calais objected and continued to refuse to answer allegations after numerous conferences and discussions court held that st calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court st calais then asked for an appeal to rome which was rejected by king and judges those judging case held that because st calais never answered formal accusation and because he appealed to rome his fief or lands was forfeit lyon constitutional and legal history p william rufus pp 82 89 although st calais claimed to be defending rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to rome his fellow bishops believed otherwise lending support to their belief is fact that st calais never pursued his appeal to rome and that later in 1095 he took side of king against anselm of canterbury when anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to rome during course of trial lanfranc is said to have stated that court was trying you not in your capacity as bishop but in regard to your fief and in this way we judged bishop of bayeux in regard to his fief before present king s father and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl quoted in richardson and sayles governance p 285 unlike later case of thomas becket st calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops most of bishops and barons that judged case seem to have felt that appeal to rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that st calais knew was true richardson and sayles governance pp 285 286 final judgement was only reached after king lost his temper and exclaimed believe me bishop you re not going back to durham and your men aren t going to stay at durham and you re

robert count of meulan who negotiated with anselm abbot of bec in 1093 over conditions under which anselm would allow himself to be elected archbishop of canterbury barlow william rufus p 306 st calais managed king s case against anselm at rockingham in 1095 when anselm wished to go to receive his pallium from pope urban ii powell and wallis house of lords p 52 at that time st calais opposed

recognition of urban as pope st calais was king s chief negotiator cantor church kingship and lay investiture p 92 clerical reformers eadmer among them who supported anselm in these quarrels later tried to claim that st calais had supported king out of a desire to succeed anselm as archbishop if anselm was deposed but it is unlikely that st calais seriously believed that anselm would be deposed

1093 alt two square front towers of a cathedral rising above some trees behind paired towers is another taller square tower durham s location in north left it insecure as malcolm canmore king of scots raided and invaded north of england on a number of occasions malcolm claimed northumbria in which durham was located as part of his kingdom st calais managed to befriend malcolm and secured his support for patron saint of durham saint cuthbert malcolm and his wife helped lay foundation stone of new cathedral dedicated to cuthbert green aristocracy p 111 respect for saint did not mean that malcolm refrained entirely from raiding north he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding northumbria both english king and st calais did all in their power to support malcolm s sons who had been educated in england in their attempts to secure scottish throne later in 1095 an english noble robert de mowbray who was earl of northumbria challenged bishop s authority in north when mowbray rebelled again in 1095 st calais helped king put down rebellion and mowbray was captured barlow william rufus pp 354 355 death of malcolm and capture of mowbray did much to make north more secure in st calais time as bishop a long running dispute began between monks of cathedral chapter and successive bishops this arose because st calais did not make a formal division of diocesan revenues between bishop s household and monks of chapter nor had he allowed free elections of prior he may have promised these things to monks before his death but nothing was in writing thus when a non monk was selected to replace st calais monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them including forging of charters ascribed to st calais that supported their case these forged charters date from second half of 12th century bates forged charters anglo norman durham pp 111 124 st calais also ordered destruction of old cathedral that had been built by to make way for construction of a new larger cathedral current romanesque style durham cathedral cantor church kingship and lay investiture p 36 construction of new cathedral began on 29 july 1093 when st calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating site first stones were laid shortly afterwards on 11 august 1093 aird absent friend anglo norman durham p 283 however st calais exile after his trial as well as his employment in royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric and this probably is cause of medieval chronicler symeon of durham s comparatively neutral treatment of st calais in his works aird absent friend anglo norman durham pp 286 287 there is no evidence of st calais performing any of normal episcopal functions including consecrating priests or churches probably dating from st calais time is confraternity relationship between monks of durham and monks of monastery of saint calais in maine cult of saint calais appears to have been confined to region around monastery which saint had founded st calais appears to have been a devotee of cult and most likely date for creation of confraternity link between two houses is during st calais time as bishop aird absent friend
