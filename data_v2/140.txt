from critics brian lowry of variety said despite a pedigree that includes arrested development creator mitch hurwitz and many of that program s stars sit down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre genevieve koski of a v club graded episode b saying i m staying optimistic that characters are going to get fleshed out in upcoming episodes because this is obviously going to be a character based ensemble comedy jonah krakow of ign was more positive about episode noting familiar aspects of arrested development such as deft wordplay biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor he concluded saying as long as talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter this should continue to be a very entertaining show kona gallagher of tv squad watched episode twice and said that it definitely grows on you she concluded saying in all i think first time you watch sit down shut up it s really easy to blow it off as another animated show that s trying too hard however it s actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes references external links category sit down shut up 2009 tv series episodes sit down shut up
