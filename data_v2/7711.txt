tropical storm chris was fourth tropical storm of 2006 atlantic hurricane season forming on july 31 in atlantic ocean east of leeward islands from a tropical wave chris moved generally to west northwest skirting northern fringes of caribbean islands chris was a relatively short lived storm reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65 mph 100 km h on august 2 while positioned north of st martin storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on august 5 near eastern cuba overall impact was minimal amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path no deaths were reported meteorological history a tropical wave moved westward off coast of africa on july 27 initially vigorous convection persisted throughout wave axis though dry air greatly diminished convection on july 28 wind field remained well defined as it continued westward and deep convection increased two days later along northern end of wave axis dvorak classifications began on july 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of convection on july 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west indicating a small low pressure area formed convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to northwest and system developed into tropical depression three on august 1 while located about 235 miles 375 km east southeast of barbuda forecasters initially predicted wind shear from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days however depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear and system intensified into tropical storm chris six hours after developing convection gradually consolidated over system and by late on 1st chris reached winds of 60 mph 95 km h while passing 50 miles 80 km north of northern leeward islands structure of chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical and an upper level eye feature developed early on august 2 outflow improved in all quadrants as well and storm reached a peak intensity of 65 mph 100 km h shortly thereafter while located 120 miles 195 km east of st thomas despite initial predictions of chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west northwestward upper level shear dissipated well defined inner core of storm and chris started to weaken early on august 3 strong wind shear over chris detached deep convection from low level circulation while a building ridge to its north turned storm towards west into an area of drier air by mid day on 3rd circulation was devoid of any convection within 85 miles 135 km while deeper convection spread across puerto rico and hispaniola late on august 3 deep convection developed over center of circulation again though persistent vertical shear weakened chris to a tropical depression on august 4 due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear forecasters indicated possibility of moderate strengthening in gulf of mexico to a 60 mph 95 km h storm however convection remained minimal and chris degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure late on august 4 late on august 5 convection increased in remnants of storm and forecasters indicated potential for slow development over gulf of mexico due to marginally favorable conditions redevelopment never occurred and remnant circulation dissipated near havana cuba on august 6 preparations thumb right chris as seen from international space station on august 2 when national hurricane center issued its first advisory on tropical depression three governments of antigua and barbuda anguilla saint kitts and nevis and british virgin islands issued a tropical storm warning for their respective territories when

necessities would be adequate such as hospital usage shelters and sand bags on august 1 officials in puerto rico issued a tropical storm warning for island next day approximately 600 tourists evacuated islands of vieques and culebra on august 2 government of bahamas issued a hurricane watch for turks and caicos islands acklins and crooked islands ragged island inagua and mayaguana in response to threat officials urged citizens to stock up on hurricane supplies while boat owners in cay secured their boats in preparation for storm in response to storm s projected path into gulf of mexico prices for crude oil rose on new york mercantile exchange at branch offices in london natural gas prices rose considerably in new york mercantile exchange electronic trading on august 2 anticipation of a threat to supply by a potential hurricane chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in price move in new orleans officials including mayor ray prepared for a possible evacuation of city if chris entered gulf of mexico as a hurricane evacuation plan included moving all residents out of city as a worst case scenario intended to avoid a re occurrence of hurricane katrina around one year prior florida emergency management requested ten mobile recovery centers and placed hospitals in florida keys on standby for evacuation officials in mississippi identified need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall both louisiana and texas emergency operation centers monitored progress of storm though did not execute any preparation action impact thumb right rainfall totals from tropical storm chris in puerto rico and dominican republic despite its initial threat chris caused little impact in lesser antilles overall damage from chris was minimal storm dropped light rainfall in puerto rico peaking at 3 09 inches 78 mm in fajardo rainfall from storm caused fajardo river to overflow its banks which temporarily closed a highway in northeastern portion of island rainfall reached up to 2 inches 50 mm across portions of hispaniola turks and caicos bahamas and eastern cuba and reached 4 inches 100 mm in some mountainous areas in santo domingo in dominican republic heavy rainfall caused severe flooding las americas reported 5 01 inches 127 mm of rainfall from chris direccion general de aeronautica

capital city and also resulted in landslides flooding also covered rice fields in northeastern portion of country national office of meteorology issued flood warnings for residents in low lying areas
