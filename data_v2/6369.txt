quartzsite construction began same year and was completed in 1929 new mcphaul suspension bridge not only carried county road over river but replaced older more destruction prone antelope hill highway bridge upstream antelope hill bridge was constantly destroyed by gila river flooding and had to be reconstructed every time a major flood occurred this made county road and mcphaul bridge primary north to south crossing of gila river in yuma county by 1935 county road from dome to quartzsite was still unpaved road between dome and araby had more historical significance once being a section of gila trail and later cooke s wagon road this was a route extensively used by native americans spanish missionaries united states army personnel during mexican american war and prospectors heading to
