mount erciyes also known as argaeus is a volcano in turkey it is a large stratovolcano that is surrounded by many monogenetic vents and lava domes and one maar bulk of volcano is formed by lava flows of andesitic and dacitic composition at some time in past part of summit collapsed towards east volcano began to form in miocene at first a volcano farther east named formed from lava flows then again to east large explosive eruptions formed a caldera during pleistocene mount erciyes proper grew inside caldera together with a group of lava domes lateral eruptions of erciyes may have generated ash layers in black sea and mediterranean during early holocene last eruptions occurred during early holocene and may have deposited ash as far away as palestine occurrence of historical volcanism is uncertain future eruptions of erciyes may endanger cities in north of mountain in turkey volcano was glaciated during pleistocene and one regular glacier still exists today but is receding etymology erciyes was historically known as argaeus or a name either derived from king of macedon argaeus i or meaning bright or white mons argaeus on moon was named after this old name for erciyes older spelling of name was before it became erciyes in 1940s 1960s out of vowel harmony geology and geomorphology erciyes lies in kayseri province of turkey city of kayseri lies north of erciyes volcano other towns in region are talas and hacilar also north of erciyes but closer to volcano and respectively and develi located south of volcano access to summit area is difficult climbers in antiquity reported that both black sea and mediterranean could be seen from summit regional erciyes dagi and hasan dagi are both large stratovolcanoes that lie in central anatolia on turkish microplate this microplate is part of collision zone between eurasian plate african plate and arabian plate that forms belt this convergence commenced in miocene and formed anatolian block with two oceans that existed between these three plates in eocene disappearing through subduction during late miocene neo tethys ocean disappeared and africa and eurasia collided later red sea and gulf of suez separated arabian plate from african plate causing former to collide with eurasia and forming bitlis zagros belt anatolian block was pushed westward between north anatolian and east anatolian faults and it is still moving today in central anatolia volcanism commenced in miocene after an effusive phase and eruption of large ignimbrite sheets volcanoes developed including stratovolcanoes such as erciyes dagi and hasan dagi on one hand and monogenetic volcanoes and maars on other hand tectonic environment has been compared with basin and range province central anatolian volcanic province of which erciyes is a part covers a surface area of cappadocian volcanic plateau comprises ignimbrites that are up to thick youngest k ar dates obtained on these centres are 60 000 20 000 years ago for monogenetic centres and 20 000 10 000 for hasan volcanic activity in system has been fission track dated at 15 500 2 500 years ago major faults such as north anatolian fault which were generated by convergence are also active some of these faults form edges of erciyes pull apart basin a tectonic depression up to deep that is split by this volcano into and basins both of which nevertheless are part of same system these margin faults have been source of earthquakes during historical times resulting in damage to cities in region and ongoing extension of this crustal domain is probable reason for volcanism at erciyes local thumb 3d image of erciyes erciyes dagi is a large stratovolcano reaching a height of or making it highest mountain and most voluminous volcano of central anatolia it rises about above basin and above floor of erciyes pull apart basin thumb summit area volcano is large it covers a surface area of or it developed over a broad shield and dacitic domes and flows form bulk of volcano s exposed units including summit area where several lava flows have been identified lava flows of erciyes extend both from summit and from lateral vents a debris avalanche extending east northeast from erciyes was formed by collapse of summit creating a wide horseshoe shaped scar that forms upper segment of valley debris avalanche deposit reaches a distance of from summit and has a hummocky appearance volcano overall has an eroded appearance two major valleys extend to summit northwesterly aksu valley and easterly valley minor valleys of lie north south and southwest of summit aksu valley contains sizable moraines left by pleistocene glaciation that are up to high and wide a glacial outwash plain formed at valley foot and was partly buried by lavas andesite and basaltic andesites are exposed on western southern and eastern sides of volcano on eastern side they form centre with a height of this centre is mostly formed by lava flows on western side andesitic lava flows reach basin huge middle pleistocene aliboran lava flow descended western slopes and blocked valley forming aliboran lake in basin lake was fed by glacial meltwater from erciyes and later overflowed lava flow at several sites most important of which is this overflow was not continuous phases of lower lake levels caused it to dry up today basin contains wetlands that are protected under ramsar convention and are a major nesting site for migratory birds endogenous domes extend from erciyes and 184 210 or 64 individual centres dot its flanks domes have diameters of and formed along radial dykes a number of such domes and centres formed on rim of wide caldera in which erciyes sits and which formed during valibaba tepe eruption this caldera may originally have had a volume of clockwise from north these volcanic centres are and about half of these centres are at distances of about from erciyes and most of them can be found on northern slopes of these centres wide and deep lies northwest of erciyes it formed within quaternary andesite lava flows its formation was probably favoured by a shallow aquifer and was accompanied by strong phreatomagmatic explosions formation of this maar was accompanied by release of tephra which reached a distance of additional basaltic vents are and from more recent volcanic phases and lava domes lie on southern and northern slope of erciyes respectively both domes are formed of rhyodacite and accompanied by pyroclastic deposits covers a surface area of and reaches a height of blocky dome flowed down slopes southwards over on north northwestern flank stratigraphically belongs to same unit as this dome flowed for a distance of about volcano lies in a tectonic depression it is cut by fault which together with fault border this basin other faults converge on volcano or pass through its outer slopes aeromagnetic investigation of region has evidenced existence of a magnetic anomaly associated with erciyes which is probably caused by volcanism petrology erciyes dagi has erupted basalt basaltic andesite andesite dacite rhyodacite and rhyolite rocks are chiefly andesite with smaller amounts of dacite dacites appear to dominate in summit region however volcano is dominated by calc alkaline rocks one basalt with tholeiitic to intermediary affinity was erupted 1 7million years ago volcanic activity at first was tholeiitic and later became calc alkaline monogenetic volcanoes in region also erupted basalt but this basalt is clearly different from erciyes basalt minerals contained in erciyes rocks include clinopyroxene ilmenite orthopyroxene plagioclase and titanomagnetite samples taken from summit also contain amphibole apatite biotite feldspar quartz and zircon mineral was first described from samples obtained on mount erciyes and its chemical formula is dacites taken from summit display a noticeable variability in their composition and texture with their temperatures at formation varying between andesites and dacites may have formed from basaltic magma by fractional crystallization involving amphibole based on elemental composition data further crustal materials were included into magma tholeiitic and calc alkaline magmas have different elemental compositions and probably formed from separate sources tholeiitic magmas may have formed from partial melting of mantle while calc alkaline magmas formed from crustal assimilation in these magmas overall magma originated in asthenospheric mantle lithospheric components may have contributed however volcanism appears to be associated with crustal extension at erciyes mantle metasomatism from a subducting slab on other hand may or may not have played a major role and slab itself did not reach down below central anatolia meaning that subduction probably is not responsible for central anatolian volcanism climate and biology climate of region is influenced by topography with taurus and kackar mountains blocking entry of moisture into anatolia summers are dry and hot and winters wet and cold in kayseri summer temperatures are about and winter temperature about precipitation at kayseri falls mostly in autumn winter and spring and amounts to per year in develi south of erciyes maximum temperatures are about and minimum temperatures estimated temperatures at altitude are about and precipitation per year four vegetation belts surround mountain a boreal belt a subalpine an alpine and a belt boreal belt extends between while subalpine belt goes from elevation and alpine from species found in vegetation belts are different from these found in equivalent areas of western european mountains flora of erciyes is diverse a number of endemic plant species have been identified including astragalus argaeus astragalus argaea dianthus crinitus argaeus festuca festuca argaea argaea and vicia canescens argaea plant silene was discovered on erciyes and named after it geographer strabo claimed that in antiquity volcano was forested a number of endemic and relic animal species can also be found at erciyes as well as a rich lichen flora grazing settlements and tourism have altered natural vegetation of mountain glaciation thumb erciyes covered with snow volcano was glaciated during pleistocene during which about three stages of glaciation occurred cirques horns and moraines from these glaciations can be found on volcano with each of five valleys that extend from summit hosting glaciers in aksu valley these extended down to an altitude of snowline was lower during last glacial maximum probably due to a wetter climate chlorine 36 dating has yielded ages corresponding to last glacial maximum and late glacial for principal moraines in aksu valley a late holocene glacial advance extended down to dating of these moraines has yielded ages of 1 200 300 years ago in valley lowermost moraines are found at an altitude of with late holocene advance forming moraines at an altitude of maximum extent of glaciers on erciyes occurred 21 300 900 years ago when glaciers reached lengths of glacier retreat occurred 20 700 2 200 20 400 1 800 years ago in two catchments smaller advances and retreats occurred 14 600 1 200 and 9 300 1 500 years ago glaciers expanded last 3 800 400 years ago later glacial advances mostly correspond to these estimated for other mediterranean glaciers meltwater from these glaciers nourished a now gone lake in basin during antiquity summit was always covered with snow glacial ice is still found on northwestern slope of erciyes in aksu valley at altitudes of it has a volume of about at a minimum a report from 1905 says that glacier was long in 2009 glacier was long and it is actively retreating assuming that pace of retreat does not change it will be gone by 2070 this is westernmost glacier in turkey today other glaciers are found in kackar mountains at black sea mount in southeastern turkey and on ararat valley hosts a rock glacier with a surface area of eruptive history a number of potassium argon dates have been obtained for erciyes dagi ranging from 2 59 0 1 million years ago to 80 000 10 000 years ago some stratigraphic units from erciyes have been dated early volcanic activity occurred at same time as initial formation of erciyes basin oldest volcanic activity at erciyes is known as which forms eastern slope of erciyes this complex erupted pyroxene andesite long lava flows from cone and dense rock equivalent of fall deposits and scoria from one date obtained on is 4 39 0 28 million years ago overall was active between 4 4 and 2 9 million years ago caldera forming activity occurred in several eruption phases accompanied by pumice flows and ash fall a first phase of activity formed plinian deposits that reach thicknesses of as far as from volcano covering at least of surface at least fifteen individual layers have been found a second phase of activity formed pumice flows east northeast of covering to a thickness of eastern cappadocia features famous cappadocian ignimbrites one of these ignimbrites valibaba tepe ignimbrite also known as was linked to erciyes volcano and is last cappadocian ignimbrite this eruption 2 8million years ago has a total volume of and was preceded by a smaller plinian eruption that covered a surface of with pumice falls valibaba tepe ignimbrite extends east of erciyes volcano it originated there and filled in previous topography its total volume has been estimated at and it contains a large proportion of changes in magma composition from first phase of caldera forming activity to valibaba tepe pumice may reflect emptying of a magma chamber with vertical composition gradient valibaba tepe ignimbrite was considered part of famous cappadocian ignimbrites but is distinct from them insofar as other ones with possible exception of ignimbrites of hasan dagi are not associated with stratovolcanoes erciyes volcano proper started developing 900 000 years ago it was formed during two phases starting with a basaltic andesite lava flow on southern slope 1 7million years ago it was followed by andesitic lava flows on western flank and then by many of dacitic lava domes another phase of basaltic andesite activity followed reaching lengths of effusive activity ended with small lava flows of varying composition next phase of activity was explosive with eruptions at summit of erciyes generating block and ash flows pumice flows and lava domes that formed blocks of in diameter deposits of this activity are found north and south of summit of erciyes and reach thicknesses of is not precisely dated but probably formed less than 100 000 years ago last dacitic eruption occurred 80 000 10 000 years ago at although later research has discovered later lavic eruptions activity in summit region probably ended before holocene and belong to youngest stages of volcanic activity at erciyes and formed on rim of former caldera radiocarbon and chlorine 36 dating of deposits has yielded ages of 10 2009 700 years before present for while potassium argon dating yielded ages of 140 000 20 000 30 000 years ago at first for all three radiocarbon dates of 9 594 and 9 596 years before present have been obtained for and respectively before extrusion of a plinian fall deposit with base surges and pumice flows covered a surface of at a minimum this was followed by a phreatomagmatic phase that deposited material up to thick followed by another plinian phase eruption was strongest of three lava dome forming eruptions and formed an eruption column high but it left smallest crater of three this eruption at first formed a tuff ring within which lava dome was emplaced lava flows extend to lengths of dome and flow have a total volume of was extruded later on northern flank another explosive phase this time dominated by long pumice flows that contain charcoal followed and generated lava dome a thick ash layer found in a drilling core off coast of israel was dated at 8 365 65 years ago in uncalibrated radiocarbon years it appears to be linked to one of these three eruptions on basis of its composition most likely eruption over away from drilling core a tephra layer named 1 found in in lebanon and dated at 8 600 850 years before present is probably equivalent to this ash layer likewise a thin tephra layer in cave of red sea mountains south of erciyes has been linked to eruption as was a layer in former lake at tayma in saudi arabia away from erciyes other tephras identified in levantine sea and erupted between 10 000 and 8 000 years ago may also come from erciyes eruptions that formed all these layers probably had profound effects on affected mediterranean cultures another tephra layer found in black sea appears to come from either or eruptions tephra from these eruptions thus was probably spread northeastward in contrast to eruption which spread tephra southeastward and thus is not found in black sea last event was collapse of eastern flank of this collapse was probably triggered by an earthquake considering that no evidence for a concomitant eruption exists considering ages of oldest moraines contained within collapse scar it probably happened more than 25 000 years ago this collapse generated a debris avalanche long which dammed a lake and presently forms a hummocky deposit volume of rock removed by collapse is about andesites of less than 1 000 years of age have been identified occurrence of volcanic activity in historical times is not clear strabo 63 bc 21 ad and claudius 370 410 ad report volcanic activity and roman coins found in cappadocia show mountain smoking but these reports may instead refer to swamp gas release in basin and strabo s reports appear to refer to fires in swamps if volcanic activity occurred during historical times it probably occurred on a parasitic vent as principal cone is heavily eroded threats and human interaction erciyes dagi volcano has manifested explosive eruptions preceding formation of lava domes such eruptions may endanger cities of kayseri hacilar and talas melting of remnant ice on volcano may generate dangerous lahars in 1985 an eruption of nevado del ruiz volcano in colombia claimed 20 000 fatalities after such a mudflow even without an eruption strong rainfall could form mudflows on densely populated steep slopes of volcano about five hotels exist at mountain which is a major winter sports site in 2010 324 221 tourists visited mountain and kayseri most of them domestic tourists a ski centre erciyes ski resort exists on erciyes resort lies at an
