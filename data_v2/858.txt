modernization of commonwealth army proved to be a good tactician and his innovations in use of artillery and fortifications based on western ideas greatly contributed to eventual polish lithuanian success he had replaced old arquebusiers with musketeers and standardized commonwealth artillery introducing 3 to 6 pounder regimental guns both to great effect commonwealth s cavalry including winged hussars significantly restricted russian mobility forcing them to stay in their trenches in a series of fierce engagements commonwealth forces gradually overran russian field fortifications and siege
