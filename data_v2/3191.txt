1962 atlantic hurricane season was least active since 1939 with only five named storms although season officially began on june 15 first storm did not form until august 26 hurricane alma brushed outer banks before becoming extratropical southeast of new england destroying hundreds of boats and producing beneficial rainfall in late august tropical storm becky developed unusually far east in atlantic ocean becoming easternmost storm on record to recurve to northeast celia followed in september forming east of lesser antilles and executing a loop near bermuda before dissipating hurricane daisy was costliest of season leaving about 1 1 million in damage in new england 1962 usd storm dropped highest rainfall total on record in maine and its precipitation caused 22 traffic fatalities final hurricane ella was also strongest remaining offshore of eastern united states but causing two deaths in addition to five named storms there were three non developing tropical depressions first struck texas in august causing street flooding and killing three second of three formed off west coast of florida and flooded widespread areas after 1 in 100 year rainfall floods affected 5 000 houses and caused millions in damage third of three non developing storms moved across caribbean before striking nicaragua in october season officially ended on november 15 season activity hurricane season officially began on june 15 1962 national hurricane center began operations with no new equipment and warning agency instead opted to improve with existing equipment agency had access to a system of radars that extended from brownsville texas to eastport maine which was set up in 1961 although satellite imagery technology was available system was not fully active to provide daily images of atlantic hurricanes season officially ended on november 15 during season three hurricanes developed from five named storms this was below average of 10 storms per season and represented fewest tropical storms since 1939 four of five storms developed from intertropical convergence zone decreased activity is partially due to westerlies extending further south than usual as well as a persistent ridge in addition temperatures in eastern united states were cooler than usual activity through september 10 was quietest in 30 years only region of united states threatened by hurricanes was new england although no stations recorded hurricane force winds in country this was first such occurrence during 20th century that no tropical storms or hurricanes hit country overall damage was lowest in several years systems tropical storm one first storm of season originated from a cold front that stalled over western atlantic ocean on june 28 a frontal low developed a day later off coast of south carolina low moved northward and northward gradually acquiring tropical characteristics atlantic hurricane reanalysis committee assessed that system transitioned into a tropical storm by late on june 30 while moving over outer banks of north carolina storm at time was co located with an upper level low suggesting characteristics of a subtropical cyclone based on reports from ships and land stations maximum sustained winds were estimated at 65 mph 100 km h on july 1 an approaching cold front steered storm away from coast storm gradually weakened and transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone late on july 2 turning to north storm moved across newfoundland and curved to west and southwest striking new brunswick and nova scotia storm turned back to northeast remaining offshore nova scotia until it was absorbed by an approaching extratropical storm on july 6 https www noaa gov hrd hurdat metadata 1961 1965 pdf while in its formative stages storm dropped torrential rainfall in coastal portions of north carolina causing locally heavy crop damage cedar island reported of rainfall in an 18 hour period at time it was second highest single day rainfall total hurricane alma a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression along southeast florida coast on august 26 it moved northward along coast located beneath an anticyclone that aided in its intensification depression began a motion to northeast on august 27 and that day it strengthened into tropical storm alma about east of florida georgia border this marked latest development of first storm since 1941 alma steadily intensified as it paralleled coastline of carolinas becoming a hurricane on august 28 a few miles off coast of cape hatteras despite its proximity storm produced peak wind gusts of only in nags head wind gusts downed a power pole in hatteras which caused an hour long power outage for one third of town there storm tide was above normal which resulted in some erosion highest rainfall total from alma in united states was a report of in cape hatteras damage in state amounted to 35 000 after passing outer banks alma continued to intensify further reaching peak winds of about 85 mi 135 km south of nantucket despite its intensity hurricane never developed a well defined eye alma quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it made its closest approach to new england due to cooler water temperatures in rhode island and massachusetts along coast storm produced northerly winds of and one house was damaged by a fallen tree tides reached above normal which resulted in minor coastal flooding however alma produced strong waves that destroyed over 100 boats damage from storm was estimated at less than 1 million though its rains were beneficial to drought stricken areas of new england precipitation extended northward through maine and storm damage was reported as far north as portsmouth new hampshire slick roads resulted in several traffic accidents although there were no deaths after moving by region alma turned to southeast due to a high pressure system to its north it became extratropical on august 30 tropical depression three on august 26 a tropical depression formed in western gulf of mexico about 280 mi 450 km northeast of tampico tamaulipas it moved slowly to north northwest around a ridge without intensifying beyond winds of 30 mph 45 km h system encountered wind shear throughout its duration which displaced convection from center to its northeast depression struck just west of texas louisiana border on august 29 before dissipating on august 30 rainfall in texas was minimal estimated around however heavy amounts of precipitation fell across louisiana peaking at near hackberry rainfall extended northeastward through arkansas and missouri on august 29 as depression moved ashore heavy rainfall caused street flooding in cameron louisiana two tornadoes were reported in town one of which produced winds of 80 mph 130 km h storms damaged 115 houses or trailers of which one was destroyed there were 30 people injured of whom 18 required hospital attention and there were three deaths tropical storm becky a tropical disturbance emerged from africa in late august and developed into a weak tropical depression on august 27 for about 30 hours system affected cape verde islands with rainfall during which it moved slowly to west and west northwest late on august 28 it was estimated that depression intensified into a tropical storm next day satellite imagery observed a well developed tropical cyclone in far eastern atlantic ocean in addition a ship reported winds of force 9 on beaufort scale suggesting winds of 50 mph 85 km h on that basis weather bureau initiated advisories on tropical storm becky despite agency only issuing advisories for storms west of 35deg w around that time storm moved over an area of anomalously warm water temperatures which allowed for its intensification on august 30 becky turned to north and northeast due to an approaching trough becoming easternmost cyclone since 1886 that a storm began a motion to north a hurricane hunters flight on august 31 indicated that becky became extratropical about 70 mi 110 km south of santa maria island in azores storm s remnants continued to northeast dissipating on september 1 about 320 mi 520 km west of spain tropical storm celia a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on september 12 about 1000 mi 1600 km east of lesser antilles however satellite imagery indicated that it could have become a tropical cyclone a day earlier late on september 12 a ship reported winds of which provided basis for san juan weather bureau to initiate advisories on tropical storm celia storm quickly attained peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h and on september 13 a hurricane watch was issued for northern leeward islands however celia passed beneath a mid to upper level trough and quickly weakened by late on september 14 a hurricane hunters flight indicated that storm s structure no longer resembled that of a tropical cyclone next day celia weakened to a tropical depression and weather bureau discontinued tropical cyclone advisories it turned to north and later to east passing well southeast of bermuda on september 18 celia began executing a loop to north during which it re intensified into a tropical storm as reported by ships it attained winds of 45 mph 75 km h on september 19 but again weakened to a tropical depression next day celia became extratropical on september 21 without having affected land tropical depression six an upper level low spawned a tropical depression off west coast of florida on september 20 depression moved very slowly to north northwest which produced heavy rainfall from naples to tampa florida highest total was in sarasota although precipitation of over extended into georgia and extreme southern south carolina a developing cyclone off carolinas caused dissipation of depression on september 23 rains in sarasota were highest since 1945 and some locations experienced 1 in 100 year rainfall totals rains resulted in of floodwaters across western florida and both manatee river and creek experienced record crests flooding entered over 5 000 houses which forced evacuation of more than 100 families floods also caused schools to close in three counties in addition floodwaters affected thousands of acres of farmlands in six counties and some did not dry out for several weeks wind gusts reached in eastern florida and more than 20 000 people were left without power there was one death in state related to storm and damage was estimated at 2 78 million hurricane daisy on september 29 reconnaissance aircraft indicated formation of a tropical depression to east of lesser antilles for several days it moved to west northwest passing just north of islands without intensifying further this was due to its presence beneath an upper level trough although system began intensifying as trough dissipated on october 2 after turning to northwest between two high pressure areas depression strengthened into tropical storm daisy developing an anticyclone aloft storm continued to gradually intensify reaching hurricane strength on october 3 two days later daisy turned to north northeast and attained peak winds of 110 mph 175 km h while passing west of bermuda hurricane weakened slightly although it re intensified to its peak strength late on october 6 cool air imparted weakening as daisy turned northwestward and on october 8 hurricane slowed as it turned eastward striking yarmouth nova scotia with winds of 75 mph 120 km h it became extratropical later that day and daisy dissipated on october 9 south of newfoundland in new england hurricane daisy s outer rainbands combined with an approaching nor easter to drop torrential rainfall over region for 65 hours producing upwards of in portions of massachusetts highest total from daisy alone was at portland international jetport in maine this was state s highest tropical cyclone rainfall total between 1950 and 2011 across region rains caused widespread flood damage in maine wind gusts reaching destroyed hundreds of small boats along with high waves from storm in new england daisy left five injuries one direct death and about 1 1 million in damage slick roads however resulted in 22 traffic fatalities in nova scotia winds gusted to 85 mph 137 km h which destroyed three boats and left two towns without power service rough seas killed six people in province hurricane ella in middle of october an area of disturbed weather persisted across turks and caicos islands associated with an upper level low on october 14 a tropical depression developed and moved northward a day after forming it intensified into tropical storm ella as it began a track to northwest located east of a weakening upper level trough on october 17 ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing an approaching trough turned hurricane to east northeast on october 19 and later that day ella attained its peak intensity of 110 mph 175 km h that made it strongest hurricane of season it gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to northeast and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of 100 mi 160 km ella became extratropical on october 22 over northern atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front shortly thereafter its remnants moved over newfoundland before dissipating on october 23 ella is historically notable for its role in cuban missile crisis storm greatly complicated naval operations relating to quarantine blockade of cuba and badly damaged several soviet nuclear armed submarines en route to island contributing to escalation of b 59 incident early in its duration hurricane ella briefly threatened to strike north carolina coastline although it remained offshore hurricane produced significant beach erosion along coast there were two associated deaths from a missing motor boat that left charleston south carolina crew of two was declared deceased after a coast guard navy and air force search failed to locate their bodies there was no damage in canada from its remnants hurricane ten other systems thumb right satellite picture of caribbean tropical depression over central america from october 4 1962 at on september 27 a tropical depression developed east of lesser antilles it moved through islands without intensifying beyond winds of 30 mph 40 km h depression later crossed entirety of caribbean sea on october 3 it struck northeastern nicaragua before becoming a remnant low pressure area following day over guatemala storm names following names were used for named storms tropical storms and
