only about 60 men before skirmish was virtually wiped out and pulaski was forced to retreat to safety of city s guns wilson 2005 p 108 although some historians credit this action with prevost s decision to withdraw back toward savannah next day despite ongoing negotiations of a possible surrender of charleston that decision is more likely based on news prevost received that lincoln s larger force was returning to charleston to face him and that prevost s troops had gone further than he had originally intended one early historian criticized pulaski s actions during that engagement as ill
