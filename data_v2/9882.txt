al khalid literally eternal tank is a main battle tank jointly developed by pakistan and china during 1990s based on chinese type 90 iim tank original prototype was developed by china north industries corporation norinco under name mbt 2000 and norinco also offered tank for export around 310 al khalid mbts had been produced by 2014 bangladesh army ordered 44 mbt 2000s from china in 2011 norinco made mbt 2000 is also used by royal moroccan army it was trialled by peruvian army for possible acquisition but was not purchased due to financial problems operated by a crew of three and armed with a 125 mm smooth bore tank gun that is reloaded automatically tank uses a fire control system and night fighting equipment al khalid is named after 7th century muslim commander khalid bin al walid 592 642 ad current production variant of al khalid uses a diesel engine and transmission supplied by kmdb design bureau of ukraine first production models entered service with pakistan army in 2001 country placed an order with ukraine to further upgrade tanks with a new engine development in 1970s leaders of china s people s liberation army were concerned about soviet threat and requested an improved main battle tank mbt to replace old and obsolete type 59 tank thus in 1980 norinco was formed and inner mongolia first machine group corporation was tasked with developing a series of new tanks a joint development deal was signed with pakistan in january 1990 initial chinese built prototypes were tested in pakistan in august 1991 pakistan completed its manufacturing plant at taxila in 1992 pakistan spent more than usd 20 million over next eight years on co development of a model suitable for its needs and on creating a capability to manufacture it locally director general of heavy industries taxila hit lt gen hamid javaid and major general muhammad asad supervised project design team modified tank to accept a foreign built engine several different prototypes were evaluated in light of high ambient temperatures and fine sand or dust that would be encountered in operational areas such as deserts of southern pakistan development of high performance cooling and air filtering systems was emphasized during planning stage of project implementation of a hydro gas suspension system was considered but after technical evaluation it was found to be impractical due to various limitations such as problems with reliability and maintainability installation of renk 304 transmission was also considered but discarded an early version was armed with a chinese gun and fire control system and had a german designed mtu 396 diesel engine which was built under licence in china another version was equipped with a more advanced western digital fire control system and powered by a perkins condor diesel engine as in british challenger and sesm esm500 automatic transmission as in french leclerc this version was considered too expensive and under performed in extreme heat of southern pakistan finally a version was tested with compact ukrainian 6td 2 1 200 hp diesel engine this configuration was chosen by pakistan for production version of tank and came to be known as al khalid ukraine also sold t tanks to pakistan which were powered by a similar engine final tank design resulting from a decade of co operative development was designated type 90 iim chinese company norinco showed new type 90 iim during march 2001 abu dhabi defense expo under export name mbt 2000 version powered by ukrainian engine intended for domestic production in pakistan was named al khalid during development period heavy industries taxila gained experience after building type 85 under chinese licence and prepared to begin production of al khalid tank in 1999 a pilot batch of fifteen tanks was inducted into 31st cavalry regiment of pakistan s armoured corps on 20 july 2001 pakistan signed a contract with ukraine s malyshev factory in may 2002 for delivery of 315 kmdb 6td 2 diesel engines over three years an additional batch of al khalid tanks was delivered on 23 september 2004 pakistan planned to build a total of 600 al khalid tanks for its armed forces in april 2002 it was reported that malaysia was considering purchasing al khalid after evaluation by malaysian military personnel but malaysia eventually backed out without stating any reasons saudi arabian army began conducting trials of al khalid s desert performance in april 2006 after expressing interest in purchasing a batch of tanks 2 years earlier no order for tank was placed despite symbolic naming of tank after khalid ibn al walid in may 2008 lt gen sarath of sri lanka army held talks with his pakistan army counterparts regarding sale of military equipment weapons and ammunition supply of 22 al khalid mbts to sri lanka army was reportedly finalised during these talks in a deal worth over us 100 million no deliveries of al khalids to sri lanka from pakistan has been reported as of 2015 peru leased five vt 1a from china for trials in 2009 peruvian government had expressed interest in purchasing 80 120 units to complement fleet of soviet t 55 tanks in service with peruvian army peru decided to buy mbt 2000 tanks deal was blocked as china did not obtain permission to re sell some ukrainian components engine transmission and varta active protection system in december 2017 hit officials told pakistan senate that budgetary constraints had reduced output of tank to 18 per year on average unveiling al khalid was revealed on 17 july 1991 by then prime minister of pakistan mian muhammad nawaz sharif along with then pakistani chief of army staff mirza aslam beg in a ceremony held at heavy rebuild factory taxila in his speech prime minister said that completion of project was a big step towards self reliance army chief said that for first time in history not only had technology been transferred to pakistan but design was also made by pakistani engineers themselves design armament al khalid is designed with a 125 mm bore 48 calibre long smoothbore auto and chrome plated gun barrel which is manufactured from highly stiff remelting steel gun is then put under stringent quality control process to ensure standard barrel life of 1 100 rounds barrels that cannot pass this test are rejected this gun provides very high internal chamber pressures for apfsds heat fs and guided missiles gun can also fire following types of conventional ammunition apfsds heat fs and he fs gun is a modified variant of both 98 and kba 3 series of 125 mm smooth bore gun for al khalid mbt which provided compatibility with ukrainian such as kombat gun retains qualities of both chinese and ukrainians mated with indigenous design for better and accurate firepower on stationary and moving targets alike gun launched laser guided anti tank guided missiles can also be launched al khalid also fires a pakistani depleted uranium round 125 mm du round which gives an armour penetration of 570 mm rha at 2 km it is equipped with a muzzle reference system and dual axis stabilisation system elevation and azimuth control is achieved by electro hydraulic power drives automatic ammunition handling system for main gun has a 24 round ready to fire magazine and can load and fire at a rate of eight rounds per minute tank is also equipped with a 7 62 mm coaxial machine gun a 12 7 mm externally mounted air defence machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within tank and smoke grenade launchers gunner is provided with a dual magnification day sight and commander with a panoramic sight for all around independent surveillance both sights are dual axis image stabilised and have independent laser range finders tank has hunter killer capability giving commander ability to acquire new targets independently while gunner is engaging another target automatic target tracking system is designed to work when tank and target are both moving night vision for gunner and commander is achieved through a dual magnification thermal imaging sight both sights are integrated with fire control system production al khalid tank has a fire control system of western origin in mbt 2000 chinese norinco fire control system takes inputs from ten sensors ballistic computation time is less than one second manufacturer claims routine first round hits on standard square targets at ranges over 2 000 metres effective range 200 to 7 000 metres sensor laser ranging from 200 to 9 990 metres french auto tracking interfaced with gunner station firing four types of munitions gunner s thermal imaging sight commander s image intensification night vision sight gyro stabilised and ups power supply system prototypes were demonstrated with various fire control systems of chinese and western origin but production model al khalid mbts use a western fire control system fcs and gun control system gcs tank is equipped with integrated battlefield management system ibms named rebar a digital communications system developed domestically by hit and care centre for advanced research in engineering it comprises a flat screen display mounted inside tank which communicates with those of other vehicles including command posts such as hit sakb it uses a data link to facilitate secure communication of battlefield information between units including tank video footage and information from unmanned aerial vehicles a project to manufacture first pakistani tank gun barrel was started by pakistan s strategic plans division spd in 2000 in april 2011 it was reported that first pakistani produced tank gun barrel was ready to be delivered to hit for installation on al khalid and al previously hit imported 125 mm gun barrel blanks from france for two tanks which would then be machined in pakistan by hit first pakistani gun barrel blank was produced at heavy mechanical complex hmc in a joint project involving hit people s steel mills limited psml and other defence related organisations specialist grade steel was produced at psml and resulting steel block was passed on to hmc hmc then pressed block to a length of 5 metres and square cross section before forging it into a 125 mm smoothbore barrel barrel was then heat treated several times in facilities such as a large vertical furnace process took 2 3 months and was watched by experts from other defence related organisations barrel was to be capable of firing at 4 rounds per minute as well as being compatible with autoloader and its 24 round magazine according to a hit official a joint team proved to pakistan army that strict standards would be met before army approved production of a first batch of 50 gun barrels by hmc pakistani gun barrels would likely be installed on upgraded versions of al khalid which are under development by hit a rs200 million pkr contract has been finalised by hit for first 50 barrel batch which is slightly lower than barrels imported from france after production of first batch of local tank gun barrels in 2011 heavy machinery complex is planning to explore manufacture of artillery guns mobility production model al khalid is powered by a 6td 2 liquid cooled diesel engine designed by kharkiv morozov design bureau kmdb of ukraine 6td 2 is a supercharged 6 cylinder engine delivering 2 stroke design with pistons arranged horizontally in an opposed piston configuration makes engine very compact and therefore more suitable for being fitted into relatively small vehicles such as al khalid mbt 6td 2 engine drives a french designed hydro mechanical
