thumb some of eruptive structures formed during volcanic activity counterclockwise a plinian eruption column hawaiian pahoehoe flows and a lava arc from a strombolian eruption several types of volcanic eruptions during which lava tephra ash lapilli volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks and assorted gases are expelled from a volcanic vent or fissure have been distinguished by volcanologists these are often named after famous volcanoes where that type of behavior has been observed some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption during a period of activity while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series there are three different types of eruptions most well observed are magmatic eruptions which involve decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption driven by compression of gas within magma direct opposite of process powering magmatic activity third eruptive type is phreatic eruption which is driven by superheating of steam via contact with magma these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release instead causing granulation of existing rock within these wide defining eruptive types are several subtypes weakest are hawaiian and submarine then strombolian followed by vulcanian and surtseyan stronger eruptive types are pelean eruptions followed by plinian eruptions strongest eruptions are called ultra plinian subglacial and phreatic eruptions are defined by their eruptive mechanism and vary in strength an important measure of eruptive strength is volcanic explosivity index vei an order of magnitude scale ranging from 0 to 8 that often correlates to eruptive types eruption mechanisms thumb diagram showing scale of vei correlation with total ejecta volume volcanic eruptions arise through three main mechanisms gas release under decompression causing magmatic eruptions thermal contraction from chilling on contact with water causing phreatomagmatic eruptions ejection of entrained particles during steam eruptions causing phreatic eruptions there are two types of eruptions in terms of activity explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions explosive eruptions are characterized by gas driven explosions that propels magma and tephra effusive eruptions meanwhile are characterized by outpouring of lava without significant explosive eruption volcanic eruptions vary widely in strength on one extreme there are effusive hawaiian eruptions which are characterized by lava fountains and fluid lava flows which are typically not very dangerous on other extreme plinian eruptions are large violent and highly dangerous explosive events volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style and frequently display many different types both passive and explosive even in span of a single eruptive cycle volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak either some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions notably many hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones and some of strongest surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in chamber before climbing upward a process estimated to take several thousands of years but columbia university volcanologists found that eruption of costa rica s irazu volcano in 1963 was likely

explosivity index volcanic explosivity index commonly shortened to vei is a scale from 0 to 8 for measuring strength of eruptions it is used by smithsonian institution s global volcanism program in assessing impact of historic and prehistoric lava flows it operates in a way similar to richter scale for earthquakes in that each interval in value represents a tenfold increasing in magnitude it is

eruptions are calmest types of volcanic events characterized by effusive eruption of very fluid basalt type lavas with low gaseous content volume of ejected material from hawaiian eruptions is less than half of that found in other eruptive types steady production of small amounts of lava builds up large broad form of a shield volcano eruptions are not centralized at main summit as with other volcanic types and often occur at vents around summit and from fissure vents radiating out of center hawaiian eruptions often begin as a line of vent eruptions along a fissure vent a so called curtain of fire these die down as lava begins to concentrate at a few of vents central vent eruptions meanwhile often take form of large lava fountains both continuous and sporadic which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more particles from lava fountains usually cool in air before hitting ground resulting in accumulation of cindery scoria fragments however when air is especially thick with clasts they cannot cool off fast enough due to surrounding heat and hit ground still hot accumulation of which forms spatter cones if eruptive rates are high enough they may even form splatter fed lava flows hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long lived pu u o o a volcanic cone on kilauea erupted continuously for over 35 years another hawaiian volcanic feature is formation of active lava lakes self maintaining pools of raw lava with a thin crust of semi cooled rock thumb left 150px ropey pahoehoe lava from kilauea hawaii flows from hawaiian eruptions are basaltic and can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics pahoehoe lava is a relatively smooth lava flow that can be or ropey they can move as one sheet by advancement of toes or as a snaking lava column a a lava flows are denser and more viscous than pahoehoe and tend to move slower flows can measure thick a a flows are so thick that outside layers cools into a rubble like mass insulating still hot interior and preventing it from cooling a a lava moves in a peculiar way front of flow due to pressure from behind until it breaks off after which general mass behind it moves forward pahoehoe lava can sometimes become a a lava due to increasing viscosity or increasing rate of shear but a a lava never turns into pahoehoe flow hawaiian eruptions are responsible for several unique volcanological objects small volcanic particles are carried and formed by wind chilling quickly into teardrop shaped glassy fragments known as pele s tears after pele hawaiian volcano deity during especially high winds these chunks may even take form of long drawn out strands known as pele s hair sometimes basalt into lowest density rock type on earth although hawaiian eruptions are named after volcanoes of hawaii they are not necessarily restricted to them largest lava fountain ever recorded formed on island of izu oshima on mount mihara in 1986 a gusher that was more than twice as high as mountain itself which stands at volcanoes known to have hawaiian activity include pu u o o a parasitic cinder cone located on kilauea on island of hawaii which erupted continuously from 1983 to 2018 eruptions began with a long fissure based curtain of fire on 3 january 1983 these gave way to centralized eruptions on site of kilauea s east rift eventually building up cone for a list of all of volcanoes of

type of volcanic eruption named after volcano stromboli which has been erupting continuously for centuries strombolian eruptions are driven by bursting of gas bubbles within magma these gas bubbles within magma accumulate and coalesce into large bubbles called gas slugs these grow large enough to rise through lava column upon reaching surface difference in air pressure causes bubble to burst with a loud pop throwing magma in air in a way similar to a soap bubble because of high gas pressures associated with lavas continued activity is generally in form of episodic explosive eruptions accompanied by distinctive loud blasts during eruptions these blasts occur as often as every few minutes term strombolian has been used indiscriminately to describe a wide variety of volcanic eruptions varying from small volcanic blasts to large eruptive columns in reality true strombolian eruptions are characterized by short lived and explosive eruptions of lavas with intermediate viscosity often ejected high into air columns can measure hundreds of meters in height lavas formed by strombolian eruptions are a form of relatively viscous basaltic lava and its end product is mostly scoria relative passivity of strombolian eruptions and its non damaging nature to its source vent allow strombolian eruptions to continue unabated for thousands of years and also makes it one of least dangerous eruptive types thumb 150px left an example of lava arcs formed during strombolian activity this image is of stromboli itself strombolian eruptions eject volcanic bombs and lapilli fragments that travel in parabolic paths before landing around their source vent steady accumulation of small fragments builds cinder cones composed completely of basaltic pyroclasts this form of accumulation tends to result in well ordered rings of tephra strombolian eruptions are similar to hawaiian eruptions but there are differences strombolian eruptions are noisier produce no sustained eruptive columns do not produce some volcanic products associated with hawaiian volcanism specifically pele s tears and pele s hair and produce fewer molten lava flows although eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets volcanoes known to have strombolian activity include mexico which erupted from a fissure in a cornfield in 1943 two years into its life pyroclastic activity began to wane and outpouring of lava from its base became its primary mode of activity eruptions ceased in 1952 and final height was this was first time that scientists are able to observe complete life cycle of a volcano mount etna italy which has displayed strombolian activity in recent eruptions for example in 1981 1999 2002 2003 and 2009 mount erebus in antarctica southernmost active volcano in world having

volcanic eruption named after volcano vulcano it was named so following giuseppe mercalli s observations of its 1888 1890 eruptions in vulcanian eruptions intermediate viscous magma within volcano make it difficult for vesiculate gases to escape similar to strombolian eruptions this leads to buildup of high gas pressure eventually popping cap holding magma down and resulting in an explosive eruption however unlike strombolian eruptions ejected lava fragments are not aerodynamic this is due to higher viscosity of vulcanian magma and greater incorporation of crystalline material broken off from former cap they are also more explosive than their strombolian counterparts with eruptive columns often reaching between high lastly vulcanian deposits are andesitic to dacitic rather than basaltic initial vulcanian activity is characterized by a series of short lived explosions lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks these eruptions wear down lava dome holding magma down and it disintegrates leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions thus an early sign of future vulcanian activity is lava dome growth and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down volcano s slope thumb left tavurvur in papua new guinea erupting deposits near source vent consist of large volcanic blocks and bombs with so called bread crust bombs being especially common these deeply cracked volcanic chunks form when exterior of ejected lava cools quickly into a glassy or fine grained shell but inside continues to cool and vesiculate center of fragment expands cracking exterior however bulk of vulcanian deposits are fine grained ash ash is only moderately dispersed and its abundance indicates a high degree of fragmentation result of high gas contents within magma in some cases these have been found to be result of interaction with meteoric water suggesting that vulcanian eruptions are partially

mount pelee in martinique site of a massive pelean eruption in 1902 that is one of worst natural disasters in history in pelean eruptions a large amount of gas dust ash and lava fragments are blown out volcano s central crater driven by collapse of rhyolite dacite and andesite lava dome collapses that often create large eruptive columns an early sign of a coming eruption is growth of a so called pelean or lava spine a bulge in volcano s summit preempting its total collapse material collapses upon itself forming a fast moving pyroclastic flow known as a block and ash flow that moves down side of mountain at tremendous speeds often over per hour these massive landslides make pelean eruptions one of most dangerous in world capable of tearing through populated areas and causing massive loss of life 1902 eruption of mount pelee caused tremendous destruction killing more than 30 000 people and completely destroying town of st pierre worst volcanic event in 20th century pelean eruptions are characterized most prominently by incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive mechanics of a pelean eruption are very similar to that of a vulcanian eruption except that in pelean eruptions volcano s structure is able to withstand more pressure hence eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones volcanoes known to have pelean activity include mount pelee martinique 1902 eruption of mount pelee completely devastated island destroying town of st pierre and leaving only 3 survivors eruption was directly preceded by lava dome growth mayon volcano philippines most active volcano it has been site of many different types of eruptions pelean included approximately 40 ravines radiate from summit and provide pathways for frequent pyroclastic flows and mudslides to lowlands below mayon s most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths 1951 pelean eruption of mount prior to this eruption peak had not even been recognized as a volcano over 3

buried roman towns of pompeii and herculaneum and specifically for its chronicler pliny younger process powering plinian eruptions starts in magma chamber where dissolved volatile gases are stored in magma gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through magma conduit these bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size about 75 of total volume of magma conduit they explode narrow confines of conduit force gases and associated magma up forming an eruptive column eruption velocity is controlled by gas contents of column and low strength surface rocks commonly crack under pressure of eruption forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes gases even faster these massive eruptive columns are distinctive feature of a plinian eruption and reach up into atmosphere densest part of plume directly above volcano is driven internally by gas expansion as it reaches higher into air plume expands and becomes less dense convection and thermal expansion of volcanic ash drive it even further up into stratosphere at top of plume powerful prevailing winds drive plume in a direction away from volcano thumb left 21 april 1990 eruptive column from redoubt volcano as viewed to west from kenai peninsula these highly explosive eruptions are associated with volatile rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes eruptions can last anywhere from hours to days with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes although they are associated with felsic magma plinian eruptions can just as well occur at basaltic volcanoes given that magma chamber differentiates and has a structure rich in silicon dioxide plinian eruptions are similar to both vulcanian and strombolian eruptions except that rather than creating discrete explosive events plinian eruptions form sustained eruptive columns they are also similar to hawaiian lava fountains in that both eruptive types produce sustained eruption columns maintained by growth of bubbles that move up at about same speed as magma surrounding them regions affected by plinian eruptions are subjected to heavy pumice airfall affecting an area in size material in ash plume eventually finds its way back to ground covering landscape in a thick layer of many cubic kilometers of ash thumb lahar flows from 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz which totally destroyed town of armero in colombia however most dangerous eruptive feature are pyroclastic flows generated by material collapse which move down side of mountain at extreme speeds of up to per hour and with ability to extend reach of eruption hundreds of kilometers ejection of hot material from volcano s summit melts snowbanks and ice deposits on volcano which mixes with tephra to form lahars fast moving mudslides with consistency of wet concrete that move at speed of a river rapid major plinian eruptive events include ad 79 eruption of mount vesuvius buried roman towns of pompeii and herculaneum under a layer of ash and tephra it is model plinian eruption mount vesuvius has erupted several times since then its last eruption was in 1944 and caused problems for allied armies as they advanced through italy it was contemporary report by pliny younger that led scientists to refer to vesuvian eruptions as plinian 1980 eruption of mount st helens in washington which ripped apart volcano s summit was a plinian eruption of volcanic explosivity index vei 5 strongest types of eruptions with a vei of 8 are so called ultra plinian eruptions such as one at lake toba 74 thousand years ago which put out 2800 times material erupted by mount st helens in 1980 in iceland an example of basaltic plinian volcanism being its 1947 48 eruption past 800 years have been a pattern of violent initial eruptions of pumice followed by prolonged extrusion of basaltic lava from lower part of volcano pinatubo in philippines on 15 june 1991 which produced of dacitic magma a high eruption column and released 17 megatons of sulfur dioxide thumb center 800px phreatomagmatic eruptions phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions that arise from interactions between water and magma they are driven from thermal contraction as opposed to magmatic eruptions which are driven by thermal expansion of magma when it comes in contact with water this temperature difference between two causes violent water lava interactions that make up eruption products of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than products of magmatic eruptions because of differences in eruptive mechanisms there is debate about exact nature of phreatomagmatic eruptions and some scientists believe that fuel coolant reactions may be more critical to explosive nature than thermal contraction fuel coolant reactions may fragment volcanic material by propagating stress waves widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction driven eruptions surtseyan thumb diagram of a surtseyan eruption key 1 water vapor cloud 2 compressed ash 3 crater 4 water 5 layers of lava and ash 6 stratum 7 magma conduit 8 magma chamber 9 dike click for larger version a surtseyan eruption or hydrovolcanic is a type of volcanic eruption caused by shallow water interactions between water and lava named so after its most famous example eruption and formation of island of surtsey off coast of iceland in 1963 surtseyan eruptions are wet equivalent of ground based strombolian eruptions but because of where they are taking place they are much more explosive this is because as water is heated by lava it flashes in steam and expands violently fragmenting magma it is in contact with into fine grained ash surtseyan eruptions are hallmark of shallow water volcanic oceanic islands however they are not specifically confined to them surtseyan eruptions can happen on land as well and are caused by rising magma that comes into contact with an aquifer water bearing rock formation at shallow levels under volcano products of surtseyan eruptions are generally oxidized palagonite basalts though andesitic eruptions do occur albeit rarely and like strombolian eruptions surtseyan eruptions are generally continuous or otherwise rhythmic a distinct defining feature of a surtseyan eruption is formation of a pyroclastic surge or base surge a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with eruption column base surges are caused by gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column one that is denser overall than a regular volcanic column densest part of cloud is nearest to vent resulting in a wedge shape associated with these laterally moving rings are dune shaped depositions of rock left behind by lateral movement these are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags rock that was flung out by explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to ground accumulations of wet spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli are another common surge indicator over time surtseyan eruptions tend to form maars broad low relief volcanic craters dug into ground and tuff rings circular structures built of rapidly quenched lava these structures are associated with a single vent eruption however if eruptions arise along fracture zones a rift zone may be dug out these eruptions tend to be more violent then ones forming a tuff ring or maars an example being 1886 eruption of mount tarawera littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature generated by explosive deposition of basaltic tephra although they are not truly volcanic vents they form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava superheats and explodes in a steam explosion breaking rock apart and depositing it on volcano s flank consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate cone volcanoes known to have surtseyan activity include surtsey iceland volcano built itself up from depth and emerged above atlantic ocean off coast of iceland in 1963 initial were highly explosive but as volcano grew out rising lava started to interact less with water and more with air until finally surtseyan activity waned and became more strombolian in character maars in alaska 1977 and in azores 1957 both examples of above water surtseyan activity mount tarawera in new zealand erupted along a rift zone in 1886 killing 150 people a seamount in mediterranean sea breached sea level in july 1831 and was source of a dispute over sovereignty between italy france and great britain volcano did not build tuff cones strongly enough to withstand erosion and disappeared back below waves soon after it appeared underwater volcano hunga tonga in tonga breached sea level in 2009 both of its vents exhibited surtseyan activity for much of time it was also site of an earlier eruption in may 1988 submarine thumb diagram of a submarine eruption key 1 water vapor cloud 2 water 3 stratum 4 lava flow 5 magma conduit 6 magma chamber 7 dike 8 pillow lava click to enlarge submarine eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption that occurs underwater an estimated 75 of total volcanic eruptive volume is generated by submarine eruptions near mid ocean ridges alone however because of problems associated with detecting deep sea volcanics they remained virtually unknown until advances in 1990s made it possible to observe them submarine eruptions may produce seamounts which may break surface to form volcanic islands and island chains submarine volcanism is driven by various processes volcanoes near plate boundaries and mid ocean ridges are built by decompression melting of mantle rock that rises on an upwelling portion of a convection cell to crustal surface eruptions associated with subducting zones meanwhile are driven by subducting plates that add volatiles to rising plate lowering its melting point each process generates different rock mid ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic whereas subduction flows are mostly calc alkaline and more explosive and viscous spreading rates along mid ocean ridges vary widely from per year at mid atlantic ridge to up to along east pacific rise higher spreading rates are a probable cause for higher levels of volcanism technology for studying seamount eruptions did not exist until advancements in hydrophone technology made it possible to listen to acoustic waves known as t waves released by submarine earthquakes associated with submarine volcanic eruptions reason for this is that land based seismometers cannot detect sea based earthquakes below a magnitude of 4 but acoustic waves travel well in water and over long periods of time a system in north pacific maintained by united states navy and originally intended for detection of submarines has detected an event on average every 2 to 3 years most common underwater flow is pillow lava a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape less common are glassy marginal sheet flows indicative of larger scale flows volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks are common in shallow water environments as plate movement starts to carry volcanoes away from their eruptive source eruption rates start to die down and water erosion grinds volcano down final stages of eruption cap seamount in alkalic flows there are about 100 000 deepwater volcanoes in world although most are beyond active stage of their life some exemplary seamounts are loihi seamount bowie seamount davidson seamount and axial seamount subglacial thumb a diagram of a subglacial eruption key 1 water vapor cloud 2 crater lake 3 ice 4 layers of lava and ash 5 stratum 6 pillow lava 7 magma conduit 8 magma chamber 9 dike click for larger version subglacial eruptions are a type of volcanic eruption characterized by interactions between lava and ice often under a glacier nature of glaciovolcanism dictates that it occurs at areas of high latitude and high altitude it has been suggested that subglacial volcanoes that are not actively erupting often dump heat into ice covering them producing meltwater this meltwater mix means that subglacial eruptions often generate dangerous jokulhlaups floods and lahars study of glaciovolcanism is still a relatively new field early accounts described unusual flat topped steep sided volcanoes called tuyas in iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice first english language paper on subject was published in 1947 by william henry mathews describing tuya butte field in northwest british columbia canada eruptive process that builds these structures originally inferred in paper begins with volcanic growth below glacier at first eruptions resemble those that occur in deep sea forming piles of pillow lava at base of volcanic structure some of lava shatters when it comes in contact with cold ice forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite after a while ice finally melts into a lake and more explosive eruptions of surtseyan activity begins building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite eventually lake boils off from continued volcanism and lava flows become more effusive and thicken as lava cools much more slowly often forming columnar jointing well preserved tuyas show all of these stages for example in iceland products of volcano ice interactions stand as various structures whose shape is dependent on complex eruptive and environmental interactions glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution making it an important climatic marker since they are embedded in ice as glacial ice retreats worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabilize resulting in mass landslides evidence of volcanic glacial interactions are evident in iceland and parts of british columbia and it is even possible that they play a role in deglaciation thumb left a tuya in iceland products have been identified in iceland canadian province of british columbia u s states of hawaii and alaska cascade range of western north america south america and even on planet mars volcanoes known to have subglacial activity include mauna kea in tropical hawaii there is evidence of past subglacial eruptive activity on volcano in form of a subglacial deposit on its summit eruptions originated about 10 000 years ago during last ice age when summit of mauna kea was covered in ice in 2008 british antarctic survey reported a volcanic eruption under antarctica ice sheet 2 200 years ago it is believed to be that this was biggest eruption in antarctica in last 10 000 years volcanic ash deposits from volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey buried under later snowfalls in hudson mountains close to pine island glacier iceland well known for both glaciers and volcanoes is often a site of subglacial eruptions an example an eruption under vatnajokull ice cap in 1996 which occurred under an estimated of ice as part of search for life on mars scientists have suggested that there may be subglacial volcanoes on red planet several potential sites of such volcanism have been reviewed and compared extensively with similar features in iceland phreatic eruptions thumb diagram of a phreatic eruption key 1 water vapor cloud 2 magma conduit 3 layers of lava and ash 4 stratum 5 water table 6 explosion 7 magma chamber phreatic eruptions or steam blast eruptions are a type of eruption driven by expansion of steam when cold ground or surface water come into contact with hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes fracturing surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam water ash volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre existing solid rock from volcanic conduit no new magma is erupted because they are driven by cracking of rock strata under pressure phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption if rock face is strong enough to withstand explosive force outright eruptions may not occur although cracks in rock will probably develop and weaken it furthering future eruptions often a precursor of future volcanic activity phreatic eruptions are generally weak although there have been exceptions some phreatic events may be triggered by earthquake activity another volcanic precursor and they may also travel along dike lines phreatic eruptions form base surges lahars avalanches and volcanic block rain they may also release deadly toxic gas able to suffocate anyone in range of eruption volcanoes known to exhibit phreatic activity include mount st helens which exhibited phreatic activity just prior to its catastrophic 1980
