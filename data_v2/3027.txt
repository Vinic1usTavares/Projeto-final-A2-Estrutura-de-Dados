emden was a light cruiser built for german reichsmarine in early 1920s she was only ship of her class and was first large warship built in germany after end of world war i she was built at reichsmarinewerft in wilhelmshaven her keel was laid down in december 1921 and her completed hull was launched in january 1925 emden was commissioned into fleet in october 1925 her design was heavily informed by restrictions of treaty of versailles and dictates of allied disarmament commission displacement was capped at though like all german warships built in period emden exceeded size limitations she was armed with a main battery of surplus guns left over from world war i mounted in single gun turrets as mandated by allied powers she had a top speed of emden spent majority of her career as a training ship in inter war period she conducted several world cruises to train naval cadets frequently visiting east asia americas and indian ocean region in 1937 and 1938 she briefly participated in non intervention patrols during spanish civil war at outbreak of war she laid minefields off german coast and was damaged by a british bomber that crashed into her she participated in invasion of norway in april 1940 as part of force that captured norwegian capital at oslo ship thereafter resumed training duties in baltic sea these lasted with minor interruptions until september 1941 when she was assigned to baltic fleet and tasked with supporting german operations during invasion of soviet union training duties resumed in 1942 and lasted until late 1944 when she took part in minelaying operations in skagerrak damaged in a grounding accident in december 1944 she went to konigsberg for repairs in january 1945 she participated in evacuation of east prussia to escape advancing soviet army while undergoing repairs in kiel emden was repeatedly damaged by british bombers and later run aground outside harbor to prevent her from sinking in final days of war she was blown up to prevent her capture wreck was ultimately broken up in place by 1950 design thumb left basis of emdens design according to article 181 of treaty of versailles treaty that ended world war i german navy was permitted only six light cruisers article 190 limited new cruiser designs to and prohibited new construction until vessel to be replaced was at least twenty years old treaty of versailles part v section ii naval clauses articles 181 and 190 since six cruisers that german retained had been launched between 1899 and 1902 oldest ships and could be replaced immediately design work on first new light cruiser ordered as ersatz niobe began in 1921 navy hoped to finish ship as quickly as possible and to keep costs to a minimum and so requested permission from naval inter allied commission of control to use steam turbines boilers and conning towers from scrapped vessels to complete ersatz niobe niacc rejected request navy also hoped to use an armament of four twin gun turrets for new ship niacc rejected twin turret design but allowed use of guns from existing stocks of spare barrels nominally within 6 000 ton limit of versailles treaty emden in fact exceeded restriction by almost fully loaded in 1923 after work on emden had already begun germans proposed using definition for standard displacement adopted in washington naval treaty of 1922 which was significantly less than full load displacement allied powers approved of change and thus emden which had a standard displacement of just under 6 000 ton limit was retroactively made legal ship was based on blueprints from late war cruiser primarily due to personnel shortages in design staff and closure of navy s ship testing institute and blueprints for karlsruhe were still available completed to a dated design she proved to be something of a disappointment in service primarily owing to her weak broadside of just six 15 cm guns nevertheless ship incorporated major advances over earlier designs including large scale use of welding in her construction and a significantly more efficient propulsion system that gave her a cruising radius fifty percent larger than that of older ships which proved to be quite useful on extended training cruises of 1920s and 1930s general characteristics emden was long at waterline and long overall she had a beam of and a designed draft of at standard load draft was and at combat load draft increased to her designed displacement was with standard and combat displacements her hull was constructed with longitudinal steel frames and incorporated seventeen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 56 percent of length of keel she had a waterline armored belt that was thick her armored deck was thick and her conning tower had thick sides ship had a standard crew of nineteen officers and 464 enlisted men while serving on cadet training cruises her crew numbered twenty nine officers and 445 enlisted with 162 cadets after 1940 her standard crew was increased to twenty six officers and 556 enlisted and after being reduced to a training ship her crew numbered thirty officers and 653 enlisted men emden carried six boats german navy regarded ship as a good sea boat with slight lee helm and gentle motion in a swell cruiser was maneuverable but was slow going into a turn steering was controlled by a single large rudder she lost speed only slightly in a head sea but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns she had a metacentric height of machinery thumb a replacement engine built for emden displayed at sinsheim auto technik museum 2011 picture emden was powered by two sets of brown boveri co geared steam turbines they drove a pair of three bladed screws that were in diameter steam was provided by four coal fired marine type water tube boilers and six oil fired marine water tube boilers divided into four boiler rooms engines were rated at and a top speed of on speed trials her engines reached and a maximum of ship was designed to carry of coal though additional space could accommodate up to oil capacity was as designed and up to in additional fuel bunkers this gave ship a cruising radius of at at her range fell to electrical power was supplied by two systems of three generators each with a total combined output of at 220 volts armament ship s main battery was to have been eight 15 cm sk l 55 guns in twin turrets but allied disarmament authority refused to permit this armament instead she was equipped with existing stocks of 15 cm sk l 45 guns in single turrets guns were c 16 models they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of they could elevate to 40 degrees and had a maximum range of eight guns were supplied with a total of 960 rounds of ammunition emden was also equipped with two 8 8 cm sk l 45 anti aircraft guns and a third was later added these guns had between 900 and 1 200 rounds of ammunition in total as designed she was to have carried eight deck mounted torpedo tubes in dual launchers but only four tubes were fitted as built in 1934 these were replaced with more powerful tubes ship carried twelve torpedoes in 1938 ship s anti aircraft battery was strengthened she received two and later four 3 7 cm sk c 30 guns and up to eighteen 2 cm flak guns capacity to carry 120 mines was also added in 1942 two of four torpedo launchers were removed and she was rearmed with a new model of 15 cm gun this gun was kc 36 model and was designed for use on destroyers it fired a slightly smaller shell at a higher muzzle velocity gun could elevate to 47 degrees for a maximum range of by 1945 ship s anti aircraft battery consisted of nine 3 7 cm guns and six 2 cm guns service history construction 1931 thumb emden in port in 1928 emden was laid down at reichsmarinewerft shipyard in wilhelmshaven on 8 december 1921 political instability and germany s financial weakness in early 1920s delayed construction of ship and she was launched on 7 january 1925
