cases where he was said to have a rigorous and unrelenting sense of retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded and a sympathy verging on emotional for victims of crime garran however offered a different view saying that those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was kindest of men and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation in 1891 garran was admitted to new south wales bar where he commenced practice as a barrister primarily working in equity federation movement thumb upright 1 portrait of andrew garran robert s father in 1896 garran like his father was strongly involved in australian federation movement movement which sought to unite british colonies in australia and in early proposals new zealand into one federated

regularly attended and sat in public gallery to see history in making under my very eyes garran would later recall with approval that 1891 convention was first with courage to face lion in path issue of customs duties and tariffs which had previously divided states such as victoria who were in favour of protectionism and states such as new south wales who were in favour of free trade in garran s view a clause proposed at convention which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically predecessor to final section 92 of constitution of australia expressed

years in 1897 garran published coming commonwealth an influential book on history of federation movement and debate over 1891 draft of constitution of australia book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government which he had planned to give at university of sydney but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students nevertheless book was both unique and popular as one of few books on topic at time with first edition quickly selling out soon after its publication premier of new south wales george reid who had been elected as a new south wales delegate to 1897 1898 constitutional convention invited garran to be his secretary at convention reid appointed him secretary of drafting committee at barton s request he was also a member of

and garran often working late into night preparing drafts for convention to consider and debate next morning on evening before convention s last day barton had gone to bed exhausted in small hours garran and charles gavan duffy finishing final schedule of amendments at breakfast time convention concluded successfully approving a final draft which would ultimately aside from a small amendment

st michael and st george cmg in recognition of services in connection with federation of australian colonies and establishment of commonwealth of australia and was appointed secretary and permanent head of attorney general s department by first attorney general of australia alfred deakin garran was first and for a time only public servant employed by government of australia garran later said of this time that i was not only head of department but tail i was my own clerk and messenger my first duty was to write out with my own hand commonwealth gazette no 1 proclaiming establishment of commonwealth and appointment of ministers of state and to send myself down with it to government printer in this role garran was responsible for organising first federal election in march 1901 and for organising transfer of various government departments from states to federal government including department of defence postal and telegraphic services now part of department of communications information technology and arts and department of trade and customs now part of department of foreign affairs and trade as parliamentary drafter garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation garran and his fellow staff aimed for a simple style of legislative drafting a goal enabled by fact that there was no pre existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based in garran s opinion approach which was put into practice many years before similarly principled plain english movement became popular in government in 1970s was intended to set an example of clear straightforward language free from technical jargon subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style and that it was not until early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re emerged however garran himself admitted that his drafting could be overly simplistic citing first customs and excise legislation customs act 1901 and excise act 1901 developed with minister for trade and customs charles kingston as an example of style taken to excess style was also once parodied by foundation high court justice richard o connor as follows every man shall wear a coat b vest c trousers penalty ps100 in 1902 garran married hilda robson together they would have four sons richard born 1903 john 1905 andrew 1906 and isham peter 1910 at this time family lived in melbourne and boys all attended melbourne grammar school and later studied at university of melbourne attending trinity college there attorney general s department also managed litigation on behalf of government initially department contracted private law firms to actually conduct litigation but in 1903 office of commonwealth crown solicitor was established with charles powers first to hold job other crown solicitors that garran worked with included gordon castle with whom he had also worked as a drafter and william garran worked with several attorneys general as permanent head of department garran regarded first attorney general alfred deakin as an excellent thinker and a natural lawyer and on occasion spoke of deakin as balfour of australian politics he was also very much impressed with fifth attorney general isaac isaacs who was an extremely diligent worker and two time attorney general littleton groom who was probably one of most useful ministers commonwealth has had in 1912 garran was considered as a possible appointee to high court following expansion of bench from five seats to seven and death of richard o connor billy hughes attorney general in fisher government at time later said garran would have been appointed but for fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose we cannot spare him solicitor general thumb right 300px australian delegation to paris peace conference 1919 garran is in front row seated second from left also pictured are billy hughes front centre and sir joseph cook seated second from right in 1916 garran was made first solicitor general of australia office was then known as commonwealth solicitor general by billy hughes who had since become prime minister creation of office and garran s appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as permanent head of attorney general s department in which garran gave legal advice to several successive governments but it also represented a formal delegation of many of powers and functions formerly exercised by attorney general garran developed a strong relationship with hughes giving him legal advice on world war i conscription plebiscites and on range of regulations which were made under war precautions act 1914 war precautions regulations had a broad scope and were generally supported by high court which adopted a much more flexible approach to reach of commonwealth s defence power during wartime a substantial amount of garran s work during war involved preparing and carrying out regulations many of them were directed at maximising economic aspect of war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to australian troops others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of enemy central powers living in australia on one occasion when hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a german man band had played das lied der deutschen hughes asked garran by way what is this tune to which garran replied that it was haydn s melody to gott franz den kaiser and as it was used as tune to several hymns it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in sydney last sunday hughes then said good heavens i have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times partnership between garran and hughes is regarded by some as unusual given that garran was tall gentlemanly wise and scholarly and patient with his staff whereas hughes was short of stature and renowned for bursts of temper nevertheless partnership was a successful one with hughes recognising importance of garran s constitutional expertise remarking once about world war i period that best way to govern australia was to have sir robert garran at my elbow with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper and war precautions act likewise garran respected hughes strong leadership style which had been important in guiding country through war although in describing nationalist party s loss in 1922 federal election garran later said that hughes also overestimated his own hold on parliament although his hold on people was probably undiminished garran accompanied hughes and joseph cook then minister for navy to 1917 and 1918 meetings of imperial war cabinet in london united kingdom and was also part of british empire delegation to 1919 paris peace conference in paris france there he was on several of treaty drafting committees and contributed to many provisions notably portions of league of nations covenant relating to league of nations mandates though focusing mainly on league of nations matters garran and john latham head of australian naval intelligence had status of technical advisers to hughes and cook and so could attend main conference and any of associated councils observing proceedings garran admired moral and physical courage of french premier georges clemenceau whom he regarded as determined to protect france from germany but in a measured and temperate way in garran s words clemenceau always withstood excessive demands of french chauvinists of french army and of foch himself garran viewed some similarities between british prime minister david lloyd george and united states president woodrow wilson where others saw only differences since lloyd george also had a strong vein of idealism in his character and wilson could be pragmatic when situation called for it such as in discussions relating to american interests garran also met other political and military leaders at conference including t e lawrence an oxford youth of 29 he looks 18 who was modest and without any affectation in a company of two or three he could talk very interestingly but at a larger gathering he was apt to be dumb thumb left garran family house in canberra 22 mugga way red hill following war garran worked with professor harrison moore of university of melbourne and south australian judge professor jethro brown on a report about proposed constitutional amendments which ultimately became referendum questions put forward in 1919 referendum garran had been made a knight bachelor in 1917 and was appointed as a knight commander of order of st michael and st george kcmg in 1920 garran attended two imperial conferences accompanying prime minister stanley bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining prime minister james scullin and attorney general frank brennan chair of drafting committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics such as merchant shipping he also attended eleventh league of nations conference that year with them in geneva switzerland at royal commission on constitution in 1927 garran was invited to give evidence by prime minister bruce where he discussed history and origins of constitution and evolution of institutions established under it through 1920s and early 1930s garran prepared annual summaries of legislative developments in australia highlighting important individual pieces of legislation for journal of comparative legislation and international law now known as international and comparative law quarterly published by oxford university press for example and towards end of his time as solicitor general garran s work included preparation of debt conversion agreement between government of australia and governments of states which involved federal government taking over and managing debts of individual states following 1928 referendum in 1930 he was asked by scullin government to provide an opinion on whether norman lindsay s novel was indecent and obscene within terms of section 52 c of customs act 1901 he concluded that it was and department of trade and customs subsequently banned book from being imported into australia first book by an australian author to suffer such a ban it has been suggested that frank forde acting minister for trade and customs had already decided to ban book and sought garran s advice primarily as a buffer against political criticism in 1927 garran had moved from his home in melbourne victoria to newly established capital canberra one of first public officials to do so many government departments and their public servants did not move to canberra until after world war ii he also worked within government to facilitate housing in canberra for officials moving from other cities and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in city in 1928 he was inaugural president of canberra rotary club in 1929 he formed canberra university association in order to promote formation of a university in canberra and in 1930 organised establishment of canberra university college essentially a campus of university of melbourne which taught undergraduate courses chairing its council for its first twenty three years throughout 1920s and 1930s garran consistently advocated establishment of what he prophetically called a national university at canberra which would be primarily for specialist research and postgraduate study in areas particularly relating to australia such as foreign relations with asia and pacific region this vision was evidently influential on establishment of australian national university anu in 1946 only research only university in country although in 1960 it amalgamated with canberra university college to offer undergraduate courses

sydney 25 april 1944 garran s personality like his prose was devoid of pedantry and pomposity and though dignified was laced with a quizzical turn of humour his death marked end of a generation of public men for whom cultural and political were natural extensions of each other and who had skills and talents to make such connections effortlessly at his death garran was one of last remaining of people involved with creation of constitution of australia former prime minister john howard in describing garran said i wonder though if we sometimes underestimate changes excitements disruptions and adjustments previous generations have experienced sir robert garran knew promise and reality of federation he was part of establishment of a public service which in many ways is clearly recognisable today garran s friend charles daley a long time civic administrator of australian capital territory emphasised garran s contribution to early development of city of canberra particularly its cultural life remarking at a celebratory dinner for garran in 1954 that there has hardly been a cultural movement in this city with which sir robert has not been identified in loyal and inspiring support as his constant aim has been that canberra should be not only a great political centre but also a shrine to foster those things that stimulate and enrich our national life his name will ever be inscribed in annals not only of canberra but of commonwealth as et nomen daley quotes lucan s epic poem phrase may be translated as among people his name is honoured and distinguished however garran is perhaps best remembered as an expert on constitutional law more so than for his other contributions to public service on his experience of federation and constitution garran was always enthusiastic i m often asked has federation turned out as you expected well yes and no by and large sort of thing we expected has happened but with differences we knew constitution was not perfect it had to be a compromise with all faults of a compromise but in spite of unforeseen sic strains and stresses constitution has worked on whole much as we thought it would i think it now needs revision to meet needs of a changed world but no one could wish work undone who tries to imagine what in these stormy days would have been plight of six disunited australian colonies memorials canberra suburb of garran
