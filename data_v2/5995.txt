sachsen class of armored frigates was a class of four ships built by imperial german navy in late 1870s to early 1880s ships and were designed to operate as part of an integrated coastal defense network ships were intended to sortie from fortified bases to break up an enemy blockade or landing attempt armed with six guns they were also intended to fight hostile ironclads on relatively equal terms following their commissionings in 1878 1883 four ships served with fleet on numerous training exercises and cruises in 1880s and 1890s they also participated in several cruises escorting kaiser wilhelm ii on state visits to great britain and to various cities in baltic sea in late 1880s and early 1890s in late 1890s four ships were extensively rebuilt their secondary batteries were modernized and they received upgraded propulsion systems they were removed from active duty between 1902 and 1910 and relegated to secondary duties sachsen and bayern became target ships while wurttemberg became a torpedo training ship three ships were broken up for scrap in 1919 1920 baden was used as a boom defense hulk from 1910 to 1920 when she became a target ship she survived until 1938 when she was sold for scrapping design following franco prussian war of 1870 1871 general albrecht von stosch became chief of imperial admiralty he immediately set about drafting a new fleet plan based on previous program that had been approved in 1867 stosch saw role of navy as primarily defensive a fleet of ironclad warships would be kept in german waters to defend coast against type of blockade danish navy had imposed during second schleswig war and french navy had put into place during franco prussian conflict stosch s fleet plan finalized in 1873 called for a total of eight ocean going ironclads and six smaller armored corvettes quota for sea going vessels was met by while only one armored corvette had been laid down by that point stosch had instructed design staff to begin work on next corvette already in 1872 and work on what became sachsen class continued into 1874 they were to be first vessels built under imperial government ships were intended to operate in baltic sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal defense system proposed by stosch he designated ships sortie corvettes denoting their intended use in event of war with a superior naval power and imposition of a naval blockade sachsen class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack blockaders they also had task of breaking up landing attempts german railway network linked bases so ground forces could be transferred to sites of enemy landings stosch envisioned using smaller of armored gunboats to support them though these proved to be disappointments in service their roles imposed several design limitations on vessels vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas which required a shallow draft in order for them to be able to enter any port on baltic seaboard they also required a heavy armament in order for them to be able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms because stosch envisioned only local deployments for vessels they had limited coal stowage as they could easily replenish their supply they nevertheless introduced two developments to german fleet they were first capital ships built with a two propeller arrangement and first without a sailing rig general characteristics and machinery thumb left illustration of sachsen class ships ships of sachsen class were long overall they had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft at designed displacement vessels displaced when vessels were fully loaded they displaced between and their hulls were built with transverse bulkheads and double longitudinal iron frames iron plating covered teak backing ships had sixteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60 percent of length of hull german navy regarded ships as poor sea boats with severe rolling and a tendency to take on water ships had a very small turning radius however and were quick to answer commands from helm their standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men and while serving as a division flagship this could be augmented by an additional seven officers and thirty four sailors after their reconstruction in 1890s ships crews were significantly increased to 33 officers and 344 enlisted men and later to 35 officers and 401 enlisted men ships carried a number of smaller boats including one picket boat one launch one pinnace two cutters one yawl and one dinghy four ships were powered by two 3 cylinder single expansion steam engines ships engines drove a pair of four bladed screws that were in diameter engines were supplied with steam by eight coal fired trunk boilers eight boilers were trunked into four funnels arranged in a square amidships this arrangement led to ships being nicknamed cement factories three generators provided 69 kilowatts of electrical power at 65 volts ships designed speed was at all four ships exceeded this speed on trials by between one half to one knot ships were designed to store of coal though they could be modified to carry up to ships could steam for at a cruising speed of at maximum speed ships ranges were reduced to four sachsen class ships were first large armored warships built for german navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion armament and armor thumb 100px diagram showing layering of ships armor sachsen class ships were armed with six l 22 guns mounted in two armored barbettes one forward and one amidships two guns were placed in forward barbette and four were mounted in amidships position these guns were supplied with 480 rounds of ammunition they could depress to 7deg and elevate to 16 5deg this enabled a maximum range of barbette arrangement would have provided a total of four guns firing forward during a ramming attack but blast damage from ships own guns proved to be too serious to permit this in practice ships were also equipped with six l 24 guns and eight hotchkiss revolver cannons ships armor was made of wrought iron and backed with teak armored belt was composed of four alternating layers of wrought iron and teak outer iron layer was thick amidships backed with of teak inner iron layer was thick and was backed with of teak it was capped with thick bulkheads on either end of belt thickness of deck armor ranged from forward conning tower had thick sides though after their modernization this was increased to thick sides and a roof was added a rear conning tower was also added with only splinter protection thick sides and a thick roof barbettes for main battery guns had 254 mm of wrought iron backed with 250 mm of teak modifications after 1886 three torpedo tubes were installed on each ship one tube was placed in a swivel mount in stern and two were placed in bow submerged tubes were supplied with a total of 12 torpedoes later a pair of torpedo tubes were mounted in ships hulls above water on broadside ships were more heavily rebuilt in late 1890s their engines were replaced and boilers were ducted into a single large funnel these improvements increased speeds of ships to battery of 8 7 mm guns was replaced with an equal number of sk l 30 guns and four guns each ship also had their old wrought iron armor and teak backing replaced with new krupp armor that significantly increased their ability to withstand shell hits construction thumb left launching of bayern first ship of class was laid down at ag vulcan shipyard in stettin in 1875 under construction number 74 ship was launched on 21 july 1877 and commissioned into fleet on 20 october 1878 ag vulcan also built which was laid down in 1876 under construction number 78 she was launched on 9 november 1878 and commissioned for service on 9 may 1881 was actually first ship to be laid down work on her keel began in 1874 at imperial dockyard in kiel under construction number 3 she was not launched until 13 may 1878 nearly one year after her sister sachsen she was commissioned on 4 august 1881 rendering her third ship of class to enter service was fourth and final ship of class she was laid down at imperial dockyard in kiel in 1876 she was launched on 28 july 1880 and commissioned into fleet on 24 september 1881 ships built by ag vulcan sachsen and wurttemberg were completed in three and five years respectively two vessels built by imperial dockyard bayern and baden required eight and seven years work respectively one of primary causes for great disparity in build times was experience of shipbuilders ag vulcan was an established commercial ship builder while imperial dockyards were recently founded and still lacked experience in large warship construction service history thumb upright 1 3 german fleet at anchor in 1896 four sachsen class ironclads are at right though sachsen entered service in 1878 she only participated in one annual fleet exercise in 1880 before all four ships were assigned to 1884 maneuvers this was due to poor performance of sachsen in 1880 maneuvers and negative reputation of class among problems associated with sachsen class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms which greatly reduced accuracy of their guns ships were also poorly armored compared to their contemporaries in addition they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability four ships served rotations with fleet for next two years though in 1886 all four were demobilized as reserve division in baltic aside from sachsens half sister german navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until late 1880s when first of s were laid down poor performance of sortie corvettes coupled with rise of jeune ecole led leo von caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats ships were reactivated for a number of ceremonial duties in late 1880s including for dedication of kaiser wilhelm canal in june 1887 and a tour of baltic by recently crowned kaiser wilhelm ii in 1888 in 1890s all four ships returned to active service with fleet serving in i division until middle of decade when new s began entering service four sachsens were then displaced to ii division in late 1890s all four of ships were extensively reconstructed their secondary armament was modernized and their propulsion systems were rebuilt with new machinery which increased their speed four ships remained with fleet until shortly after turn of century sachsen was removed from duty in 1902 and used as a target ship from 1911 to 1919 bayern was stricken from naval register in february 1910 and similarly used as a target vessel until 1919 wurttemberg was converted into a torpedo training ship in 1906 equipped with seven torpedo tubes in a variety of different mountings she served in this capacity until 1919 when she was used briefly as an escort for f boats all three ships were broken up for scrap between 1919 and 1920 baden survived longest serving as a boom defense hulk after 1910 and a target ship after 1920 she remained in german navy s inventory until 1938 when she was sold for scrapping notes references
