friedrich wilhelm university to study law wessel family influenced by politics of father avidly supported monarchist german national people s party dnvp and when he was 15 wessel joined dnvp s youth group bismarck youth from which he resigned in 1925 at time dnvp was most influential right wing party wessel soon began to frequent low life bars and hang out in flophouses and also founded his own youth group purpose of which was to raise our boys to be real german men he also joined wiking liga viking league a paramilitary group founded by hermann ehrhardt stated goal of which was to effect revival of germany on a national and ethnic basis through spiritual education of its members near end of 1923 wessel himself described viking league of having ultimate aim of establishment of a national dictatorship he soon became a local leader engaging in street battles with youth members of their adversarial groups such as social democratic party spd and communist party kpd later wessel joined groups with a more sinister reputation including black reichswehr and olympia german association for physical training a powerful paramilitary group which was successor of disbanded reinhard regiment nazi party member joining sa thumb right upright 1 6 wessel in his sturmfuhrer uniform leading an sa unit at a nazi party rally in nuremberg 1929 viking league and olympia association were banned in prussia in may 1926 when it was discovered they were planning a putsch against government wessel realizing league would not achieve its self defined mission and was moving in direction of tolerating parliamentary political system resigned from it on 23 november 1926 at age 19 two weeks later on 7 december he joined paramilitary sturmabteilung storm detachment or sa of adolf hitler s national socialist german workers party nsdap or nazi party he later commented that over two thirds of his colleagues from viking league had already joined sa and nazi party part of attraction of nsdap to wessel was joseph goebbels party s newly appointed gauleiter regional leader of berlin about whom he would later say there was nothing goebbels couldn t handle party comrades clung to him with great devotion sa would have let itself be cut to pieces for him goebbels he was like hitler himself goebbels he was our goebbels writing in his diaries he kept two one for his political life and one for other matters wessel described differences between groups he had been a part of and appeal of being involved in nazi party bismarck league that was pleasure and enjoyment viking league was adventure atmosphere of putsch playing at soldiers albeit against a background that was not without its dangers but nsdap was a political awakening movement s centrifugal force was tremendous one meeting followed hard on heels of last one street demonstrations recruiting drives in press propaganda trips into provinces creating an atmosphere of activism and high political tension that could only help movement it was goebbels who had created this atmosphere which prompted right wing youth to leave organizations they felt had let them down for excitement of nazi party s highly visible activism for a few years wessel lived a double life as a middle class university law student and as a member of primarily working class sa but in some ways two worlds were converging in ideology at university wessel joined a dueling society dedicated to steeling and testing physical and moral fitness through personal combat while with sa which was always interested in a good street fight he was immersed in antisemitic attitudes typical of extreme right wing paramilitary culture of time his study of jurisprudence at school was seen through filter of his belief that application of law was primarily an instrument of power and his personal beliefs already geared toward anti jewish attitudes were heavily influenced by novel from double eagle to red flag by russian cossack general pyotr nikolayevich krasnov published in germany in 1922 antisemitic krasnov accepted as fact protocols of elders of zion a hoax that purported to show plans of international jewry to control world according to wessel s sister krasnov s book was tremendously influential with her brother activities in august 1927 wessel traveled in a group of fifty sa men to nazi party rally in nuremberg joining other berlin based nazis to make a group of 400 led by goebbels at that time sa was banned in berlin when they returned they were arrested wessel soon impressed goebbels and in january 1928 a period in which berlin city authorities had banned sa in an effort to curb political street violence wessel was sent to vienna to study national socialist youth group as well as organizational and tactical methods of nazi party there he returned to berlin in july 1928 to recruit local youths and was involved in helping to implement a reorganization of nsdap in city into a cell structure similar to that used by german communist party kpd wessel did this despite sa rules forbidding its members from working for party in 1929 wessel became street cell leader of alexanderplatz storm section of sa in may he was appointed district leader of sa for friedrichshain where he lived sa sturm 5 with rank of sturmfuhrer in october 1929 wessel dropped out of university to devote himself full time to nazi movement in that same year wessel wrote lyrics to die fahne hoch raise flag which would later be known as horst wessel song wessel wrote songs for sa in conscious imitation of communist paramilitary red front fighters league in fact music to die fahne hoch was taken from a communist song book to provoke them into attacking his troops and to keep up spirits of his men wessel was recognized by goebbels and berlin nazi hierarchy as an effective street speaker in first 11 months of 1929 for instance he spoke at 56 separate nsdap events wessel s friedrichshain sturm 5 unit had a reputation as being a band of thugs a brutal squad one of his men described way they fought against communists kpd horst made adolf hitler s principle his own terror can be destroyed only by places where kpd met were often visited by a mere handful of loyal supporters and our standpoint was made unequivocally clear to landlord and all who were present in east end of berlin horst wessel opened up a route through which a brown storm tide poured in unceasingly and conquered area inch by inch by period 1929 30 continual violence in berlin between street fighters of nazi party and other extreme right wing groups and those of communist party and other parties on left had become a virtual civil war prussian police were powerless to control this physical violence was encouraged by goebbels nazi gauleiter of berlin who had been given by hitler difficult task of establishing a reorganized nazi presence in red berlin a city sympathetic to communists and socialists one that was under firm control of nazi party headquarters in munich and was not controlled by northern branch of party under strasser brothers with their socialist leanings goebbels violent approach was appreciated by wessel who preferred it to official restraint he experienced as a member of bismarck youth and viking league oddly although wessel kept two journals one specifically about his political life in them he does not describe in concrete terms his physical participation in these street skirmishes he refers to we i e sa and not to i wessel had a weak constitution he had broken one arm several times while horseback riding as a schoolboy which deformed it and had been given a permanent exemption from physical education nonetheless he boxed and practiced martial arts while in viking league and boasted in one journal of having mastered ju jitsu a primarily defensive art he may have needed to compensate for his lack of physical power still limitations of his physicality would have prevented him from taking as full a role in street brawls as his ideology called for and he may therefore have up his rhetoric in an attempt to compensate for his physical disability wessel became well known among communists when on orders from goebbels he led a number of sa incursions into an extremely poor berlin district where communists mingled with underworld figures several of these agitations were only minor altercations but one took place outside tavern which local communist party kpd used as its headquarters as a result of that melee five communists were injured four of them seriously communist newspaper accused police of letting nazis get away while arresting injured communists while nazi newspaper claimed that wessel had been trying to give a speech when shadowy figures emerged and started fight wessel was marked for death by kpd with his face and address featured on street posters slogan of kpd and red front fighters league became strike fascists wherever you find them erna janicke in september 1929 wessel met erna janicke a 23 year old ex prostitute in a tavern not far from alexanderplatz some sources claim wessel earned money as janicke s procurer on 1 november she moved into his room on third floor of 62 grosse frankfurter strasse today karl marx allee which he sublet from 29 year old elisabeth salm whose late husband had been an active communist red freedom fighter although she described herself as apolitical after a few months there was a dispute between salm and wessel over unpaid rent in which salm claimed that wessel threatened her landlady who may have feared that she could lose them if who she assumed was a working prostitute was found to be living there wanted janicke to leave but latter refused to so on evening of 14 january 1930 salm appealed to communist friends of her late husband for help at first communists were not interested in helping salm as she was not well liked by them because she had given her husband a church funeral instead of allowing kpd to give him standard burial rite used for members of red freedom fighters league but when they realized that horst wessel was involved in dispute they agreed to beat him up and get him out of salm s flat by force knowing they needed a tough guy they sent word to a nearby tavern that they needed albrecht ali hohler an armed pimp perjurer and petty criminal hohler a heavily tattooed cabinetmaker who had just recently been released from prison was a communist and a member of red freedom fighters league death thumb left 337px mug shot of albrecht hohler man arrested and later killed for wessel s murder wearing new suit given to him by communist party at around ten o clock that night hohler and erwin ruckert another member of kpd knocked at front door of room where wessel and janicke lived while remainder of gang of at least a dozen men waited on street outside when wessel who was expecting a visit from leader of another sa sturm group opened door he was almost immediately shot at point blank range although it was later claimed that wessel had attempted to draw a gun and so had been shot in self defense this was denied by eyewitnesses who said that wessel had no time to react attackers searched room removed a pistol from wardrobe and a rubber truncheon and then fled scene meeting up with rest of men in street entire group then returned to their usual nighttime activities even as wessel was lying seriously wounded in hospital goebbels was already releasing reports asserting that those who had carried out attack were degenerate communist subhumans wessel received medical attention and recovered somewhat but eventually died in hospital on 23 february from blood poisoning he contracted in hospital following his death nazis and communists offered different accounts of events police led by chief inspector teichmann and several courts determined that both political and private reasons had led to wessel s assassination by 17 january 1930 police had announced that hohler whom janicke had identified as gunman was their prime suspect it was then reported by a non nazi and non communist newspaper that janicke knew hohler prior to murder because wessel had used her to spy on her former clients who were communists communists in turn claimed that hohler had been janicke s pimp until wessel stole her from him and that this was motive behind shooting janicke denied these stories saying that she had never been a spy for wessel and that she only knew hohler as an acquaintance from streets police and courts believed her and hohler was quickly arrested after a trial he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for shooting light sentence was result of court s finding of extenuating circumstances seven accomplices were also found guilty and sentenced to jail executions three years later after nazi ascension to national power in 1933 hohler was taken out of prison under false pretenses by then gestapo chief rudolf diels and members of sa and illegally executed on 10 april 1935 five years after wessel s assassination and two years after sa murder of hohler two persons accused of being involved in wessel s killing were put on trial and subsequently beheaded in berlin s prison sally epstein a jewish painter and hans ziegler a barber two had been arrested in august 1933 and were put on trial in may 1934 with a third defendant peter stoll a tailor in 2009 sentences against all three of them were rescinded by berlin public prosecutor s office funeral goebbels had been looking for someone to turn into a martyr for nazi cause his first attempt was with albert leo schlageter a member of freikorps and a saboteur who was caught attempting to blow up a train in ruhr region while it was under occupation by french troops in retaliation for germany s not making its schedule of reparation payments schlageter was executed by french and his gravesite later became a nazi shrine there were also 16 nazis who had died during beer hall putsch and would have a memorial built for them in munich which was required to be saluted when passing by and who were honored with a public ceremony every year when putsch was remembered with two other party members who headed list that party later made of those members of movement who have been murdered goebbels did not even make an effort to martyr them goebbels saw in wessel s shooting possibility of a propaganda bonanza he eulogized wessel in his newspaper der angriff in overtly christian tones a christian socialist a man who calls out through his deeds come to me i shall redeem you a divine element works in him making him man he is and causing him to act in this way and no other one man must set an example and offer himself up as a sacrifice well then i am ready goebbel s plan was to turn wessel s funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of sa men in uniform but he could not get necessary police permits to do so even after wessel s sister requested president paul von hindenburg to relent wessel was buried in berlin on 1 march 1930 contrary to nazi claims there were no attacks on funeral procession which goebbels claimed was watched by 30 000 people funeral was filmed and turned into a major propaganda event by nsdap wessel was elevated by goebbels propaganda apparatus to status of leading martyr of nazi movement many of goebbels s most effective propaganda speeches were made at but wessel received unusual attention among many unremembered storm troopers in an editorial in volkischer beobachter people s observer alfred rosenberg wrote of how wessel was not dead but had joined a combat group that still struggled with them afterwards nazis spoke of how a man who died in conflict had joined horst wessel s combat group or were summoned to horst wessel s standard prussian police had outlawed public gatherings and display of swastikas at funeral procession with exception of a few nazi party vehicles wessel s coffin was paraded through large parts of center of berlin in a procession that took many hours as coffin reached bulowplatz now rosa luxemburg platz communist hecklers began singing internationale in an attempt to disrupt event police were unable to prevent abusive shouts and at some points flying rocks no major clashes occurred although someone had written to wessel pimp a last heil hitler in white paint on cemetery wall in attendance of wessel s funeral was goebbels who delivered eulogy franz pfeffer von salomon hermann goring and prince august wilhelm of prussia prior to event goebbels and goring had discussed possibility of hitler attending in his diary entry on day of funeral goebbels recalled hitler isn t coming had situation explained to him over telephone and he actually declined oh well goebbels blamed rudolf hess for preventing hitler from coming but in reality hitler s decision not to come was based on advice he received from goring that danger of an attack on hitler in heart of red berlin was too great nazi martyr although goebbels could not get hitler to attend wessel s funeral hitler did speak at wessel s grave three years after his death on 22 january 1933 for dedication of a memorial sixteen thousand members of berlin and brandenburg sa and ss marched past communist party headquarters on bulowplatz now rosa luxemburg platz karl liebknecht house in a deliberately provocative act that goebbels was very proud of having staged calling it a terrible defeat for communists and a proud and heroic victory of sa on behalf of party he felt that communists had a loss of prestige that could never again be made good as they were relegated to fuming on side streets once enormous procession led by hitler goebbels ernst rohm and other top officials of party marched to st nicholas cemetery hitler spoke of wessel s death as a symbolic sacrifice that night addressed a memorial service at berlin sportpalast at which funeral march from richard wagner s gotterdammerung was played and stage was set as an altar made from laurel trees branches candelabra and a larger than lifesize portrait of wessel hitler lavished praise on those fanatics who are consumed by great task of their age fanaticism being a positive virtue among nazis who live for that task and who die for it they would later be not only martyrs of their struggle but also seed from which subsequent harvest would come goebbels continued to use martyrdom of wessel as a propaganda device for years at 1934 nuremberg party rally a group of hitler youth sang an anti christian song which included lines we don t need any christian truth we follow not christ but horst wessel wessel s name was frequently invoked by nazis to bolster core tenets of national socialist ideology during remaining existence of nazi germany for example a wartime article from nazi owned volkischer beobachter newspaper called wessel hero of brown revolution and referred to his sacrificial death that passionately inflamed millions who followed paper further referred to wessel as driving force behind struggle for freedom of armed services and homeland of greater german reich aftermath horst wessel song wessel played shawm a double reed woodwind instrument which was played in groups called orchestras or bands and which is still used in folk celebrations wessel founded an sa band which provided music during sa events in early 1929 wessel wrote lyrics for a new nazi fight song fight song which was first published in goebbels s newspaper der angriff in september under title der sa mann unknown sa man song later became known as die fahne hoch raise flag and finally horst wessel lied horst wessel song nazis made it their official anthem and after they came to power co national anthem of nazi germany along with first stanza of deutschlandlied song was also played in some protestant places of worship as some elements of protestant church in germany had accepted and promulgated horst wessel cult built as it was by goebbels on model of christian martyrs of past it was later claimed by nazis that wessel also wrote music to song but it was considered more likely that tune was in reality adapted from a world war i german imperial navy song and was probably originally a folk song authorship of melody was finally determined by a german court in 1937 as not by wessel posthumous notability hans westmar hans westmar one of many was one of first films of nazi era to idealize a version of wessel s life goebbels however disliked film considering it to be crude in its use of propaganda and on day of its intended premiere issued a ban prohibiting it from being shown hanfstaengl an old friend of hitler s who was one of film s backers and had composed its music went personally to hitler and goebbels to complain about ban which was eventually reversed when enough of nazi party hierarchy weighed in on hanfstaengl s side goebbels however insisted on alterations to film primary one being that main character s name was changed to fictional hans westmar part of problem with film was that authentic depiction of stormtrooper brutality including violent clashes with communists did not fit more reasonable tone nazis initially attempted to present after coming to power unlike wessel westmar preaches class reconciliation and does not alienate his family it was among first films to depict dying for hitler as a glorious death for germany resulting in his spirit inspiring his comrades memorial namings thumb right 237px uscgc eagle formerly horst wessel berlin district of friedrichshain where wessel died was
