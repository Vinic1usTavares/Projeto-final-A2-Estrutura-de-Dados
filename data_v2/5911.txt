game series and he was interested in developing new ideas shortly after gaia was formed new studio learned that sony was interested in finding developers for its upcoming handheld game console playstation portable gaia developed jewel summoner exclusively for psp including visuals tailored to its screen and a creature development system that would utilize console s internal clock to continually train monsters even when unit was not in use jewel summoner borrowed several aspects from okada s previous games including megami tensei s concept of elements despite similarities art style of jewel summoner is more in line with traditional rpgs instead of megaten s darker more adult theme an important design component of game is its monster training system which is a staple of okada s work game s soundtrack was created by shinji hosoe hitoshi sakimoto yasunori mitsuda yoko shimomura kenji ito masaharu iwata tsukasa masuko yasuyuki suzuki ayako saso and takahiro ogata game

gameplay elements in common with jewel summoner reception jewel summoner received mixed reviews its gameplay format especially premise of monster collecting elicited frequent comparisons to pokemon a long running nintendo series of games gameplay itself was considered generic and unoriginal ign stated all too often same battles happen again and again and game informer s reviewer said battle system is as boring a turn based snoozefest as i ve seen in years gamezone called jewel summoner prototypical and said game does not stray too far from formula you fight you level you unlock new skills process of improving monsters was described by gamespot as too long and needlessly complicated and ign declared for most part it s not even worth it reception of game s audio was generally positive with ign referring to music as top notch and gamesradar commenting tunes are varied catchy match settings and show off psp s sound system comments about voice acting were lukewarm however especially regarding amount of dialogue in game gamespot referred to dialogue as dull and ign said script itself is a mess game s beginning was described as especially slow game s art style and visuals were praised x play said monsters sic designs here are creative detailed takes on all kinds of different well known fantasy archetypes gamezone s reviewer said monster details are very good as is majority of artwork and ign noted that each of characters also gets nice crisp art for conversational scenes game informer however mocked character design stating each of major heroes has some kind of glaring aesthetic blunder to make fun of from biggest faux hawk in history to tan lines that itagaki would be ashamed to put on one of his characters there s at least some shallow amusement to be had by mocking these hapless digital rejects references external links official site category 2006 video games category atlus games category playstation portable games category playstation portable only
