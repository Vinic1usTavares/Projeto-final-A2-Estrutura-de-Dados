over a period of time she might start warming to him he is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming so she could fall for him derek branning in february 2012 anthony and tyler get involved with

and tony discipline sat down and spoke about scenes beforehand discussing how we were going to perform them it s like taking on a new project so every time i get a new storyline i m hands on and ready to go for it on scenes involving anthony tyler and derek lapinskas said i think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours anthony was really worried as he didn t want them to get into trouble so as we saw he was trying his best to get them out of it but even though they were scared of derek anthony and tyler are brothers and they ve got each other s backs so it was nice that we saw

brothers to shake up albert square that sounds familiar but are anthony and tyler really new grant and phil mitchell lapinskas commented on this saying it s a lot of pressure to put us both under but what a duo to be compared to phil and grant were in show together for at least 10 years and they were fantastic so to be linked to them is phenomenal it really is a lot to live up to but tony and i are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to eastenders rachel tarley from metro said it s nice to have a bit of fresh blood in soap especially since appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave michael a little more demented than he was before lapinskas revealed to daily mirror that because of his role in eastenders he is recognised in public
