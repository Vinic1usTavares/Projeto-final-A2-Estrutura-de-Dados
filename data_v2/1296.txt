q class is a type of 0 6 0 steam locomotive designed by richard maunsell of southern railway and constructed immediately prior to second world war for use on medium distance freight trains throughout network twenty locomotives were built by maunsell s successor oliver bulleid in 1938 design was relatively old fashioned and class was soon afterwards eclipsed by bulleid s own more powerful q1 class nevertheless locomotives performed adequately and reliably on tasks for which they had been designed until their withdrawal in 1965 only one has survived and is preserved on bluebell railway background southern railway was primarily a passenger carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines there was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however although traffic department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on remaining non electrified lines at peak periods by late 1930s southern railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of s15 and n and n1 classes but there was a need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties this role had been performed by ex lswr jubilee a12 0 4 2 which were approaching end of their useful lives during his last year as chief mechanical engineer cme of southern railway richard maunsell decided on an inside cylinder 0 6 0 tender locomotive to undertake this role in what was to become q class of 1938 this was a relatively old fashioned design for late 1930s although each of britain s major railways built locomotives of this pattern until 1940s class nevertheless contained several modern features such as a belpaire firebox superheater and a side window cab it was last southern steam locomotive design before second world war and represented final design of maunsell s career as he retired due to ill health in 1937 construction history maunsell s successor oliver bulleid oversaw building of twenty members of class at eastleigh railway works between january 1938 and september 1939 bulleid is reported to have found q class uninspiring having been manufactured to traditional victorian principles of locomotive design and is said to have stated that order for q class would have been cancelled if he had been appointed cme earlier retrieved 18 april 2007 for information on bulleid s dislike of design however bulleid had ample opportunity either to cancel order or to build and test a single prototype without incurring expense of building twenty members of class if this was case class performed adequately and reliably on tasks for which they were designed but were less versatile than might have been hoped when requirement for modern freight locomotives on southern increased during second world war bulleid was faced with options of continuing production of q class or to design a completely new locomotive taking latter option bulleid designed what was to become highly utilitarian sr class q1 0 6 0 locomotives modifications thumb no 30537 fitted with lemaitre blast pipe and chimney at norwood locomotive depot 12 march 1960 in common with most maunsell designs q class locomotives were reliable but there were complaints of poor steaming when used on main line trains for which they were never designed in 1940 bulleid fitted one member of class with a lemaitre blast pipe in an attempt to improve their efficiency this proved to be successful and remainder of class were so fitted between 1946 and 1949 during 1950s further experiments were carried out by fitting of a british railways standard class 4 plain blast pipe and small stovepipe chimney to no 30549 in 1955 resulting in further improvements in both steaming and fuel consumption in 1958 61 six more received same blast pipe with a br standard class 4 chimney operational details and preservation locomotives were adequate and reliable on secondary services throughout their working lives their utility compounded by their light weight and steady handling they were however disappointing on main line traffic until was improved after war they were fitted with steam carriage heating and despite being primarily a freight design they periodically deputised in this duty british railways was responsible for class from 1948 and gave it a 4f power classification f

freight locomotive q class carried southern black livery locomotive number and southern were located on tender and were painted in sunshine yellow numbering of locomotives under southern railway ranged from 530 549 even though they were built under tenure of bulleid locomotives never followed his adaptation of uic classification system which refers to number of leading trailing and driving axles in this case three under this system this class would have had prefix c before numbers such as in event this form of numbering was granted to bulleid s q1 class locomotives of 1942 post 1948 nationalisation early livery included temporary retention of southern number and remained black although in certain cases british railways was applied to tender in place of southern in sunshine yellow under british railways class was granted power classification 4f immediately after nationalisation q class was given a temporary s prefix to original southern railway number as overhauls and re paints became due class was eventually re numbered within british railways standard numbering system and livery was changed to british railways goods plain black with crest on tender and numbering on side of
