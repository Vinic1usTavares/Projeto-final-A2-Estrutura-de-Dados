bridgeport and stamford connecting service west of new haven to new york city is available via metro north railroad s new haven line service was introduced in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on i 95 however it proved more popular than expected and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that line was too expensive to operate service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to new london in 1996 and to stamford in 2001 around 2 100 riders use service on weekdays current service most weekday sle trains run local westbound from new london or to new haven in morning with some nonstop eastbound service this traffic pattern is reversed in afternoon and evening rush a handful operate through new haven as far as stamford thumb left a shore line east train at union station in new haven focal point of line with former amtrak p40dc 841 leading most weekend sle trains also run local westbound in morning then express in afternoon stopping only at and between and state street eastbound service is reversed this is because and only have platforms on eastbound track and thus switching is needed to platform a westbound train about half of sle trains operate to and from new london new london sle multi ride pass holders are also allowed to board selected northeast regional trains or acela express train there are plans to increase service to new london which is limited by u s coast guard requirements regarding bridge crossing connecticut river after years with just one or two trains to new london additional new london round trips were added in 2010 and 2013 and weekend service began in june 2013 all trains that do not operate west of new haven make a connection to a metro north railroad train at new haven for service to and from points in connecticut westchester county new york and new york city these connections are commonly used by extreme commuters who live in suburban connecticut and work in new york city although sle service is funded by conndot it is operated under contract by amtrak amtrak owns and controls northeast corridor east of new haven west of new haven new haven line is owned by conndot and trains are dispatched by metro north during opsail and tall ship festivals at new london extra

service history previous service thumb left a shore line east train with equipment painted in new york new haven and hartford railroad colors section of northeast corridor that shore line east operates on was once new york boston mainline of new york new haven and hartford railroad section from new haven to new london was built as new haven new london railroad it was charted in 1848 began construction in 1850 and opened for service in july 1852 line was owned by new york providence and boston railroad stonington road from 1858 to 1862 and by shore line railway from 1864 until it was acquired by new york new haven and hartford railroad new haven in 1870 crossing connecticut river required a ferry transfer until a drawbridge was built in 1870 line was referred to by new haven railroad as shore line to distinguish it from railroad s main line from new haven to springfield massachusetts in recognition of large role played by new haven in history and heritage of state of connecticut conndot paints sle s diesel powered locomotives in new haven s orange and black style new haven railroad colors and emblems have also been placed at several stations particularly new haven union station thumb right clamdigger service as run by amtrak in 1971 new haven railroad operated local service on shore line up until its merger with penn central on january 1 1969 when most commuter service east of new haven was abandoned intercity service continued but generally only stopped at new haven old saybrook and new london penn central continued to operate clamdigger a single daily new london new haven round trip with local stops as well as a new london boston round trip amtrak took over clamdigger along with most intercity passenger service in may 1971 in january 1972 amtrak discontinued clamdigger and penn central cut new london boston trip in 1976 and 1977 amtrak operated clamdigger as a providence new haven round trip with limited local stops for three months in 1978 it was revived with additional commuter based stops it was replaced in april 1978 by beacon hill which stopped at new haven branford madison old saybrook niantic new london and mystic en route to providence and boston beacon hill which served providence and boston commuting markets rather than new haven was discontinued in 1981 due to funding cuts ending commuter rail service in connecticut east of new haven initial service thumb left patrain at pittsburgh in 1985 after that service ended in 1989 conndot purchased equipment for use on shore line east in 1981 and 1986 legislation was proposed to restore commuter service between new haven and new london as well as between new haven and hartford a 1986 conndot study analyzed congestion on interstate 95 which runs parallel to line study showed that old saybrook was a better terminus for initial service with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily based on study governor william o neill ordered conndot in october 1986 to initiate rail service on corridor it was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between union station in new haven and old saybrook to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on i 95 o neill introduced a 50 million transportation program that included 900 000 later reduced to 500 000 for basic stations and 4 million to refurbish 12 budd rail diesel cars for rolling stock rdcs were found to be insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from defunct patrain service in 1989 instead testing of equipment on northeast corridor began on december 2 1989 a second study in 1989 indicated higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders state bought amtrak s new haven maintenance facility in may 1989 and signed a service contract with amtrak in november metro north railroad was not considered for several reasons largely because amtrak already owned rail line east of new haven construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in april 1990 shore line east service began on may 29 1990 with four trains each direction during morning and evening service carried clamdigger name during planning shore line east did not appear until shortly before service began shore line east was threatened to be cut in 1991 by newly elected governor lowell weicker but it proved more popular than expected and was effectively made permanent a 1996 study found that shore line east captured 8 of regional commuter trips and attracted a loyal ridership base in 1995 and 1997 then gov john rowland proposed to replace shore line east and waterbury branch with bus service citing a high subsidy of 18 70 per rider per trip in order to decrease unpopular gas tax lawmakers from region called proposals political and defended line s ability to reduce congestion and pollution while opponents of line called it an example of government waste shore line east rider s association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead early expansions and criticisms thumb right shore line east was extended to new london union station in 1996 in july 1995 governor rowland signed a bill ordering various studies including one that analyzed extending service to new london as had been originally planned before study was completed conndot unilaterally decided to implement new london service which report commended on february 1 1996 two round trips per weekday were extended to new london at that point ridership was up 18 over 1991 numbers thumb left a rush hour shore line east train at stamford in 2007 in january 2001 because of changes in amtrak rules passengers were no longer allowed to cross tracks to access trains new platforms were opened on south side of tracks at branford and westbrook at approximately same locations in december 2001 a single morning rush hour round trip branded was extended to stamford with a stop at bridgeport plus eastbound only stops at stratford and milford an evening eastbound trip was also extended to stamford with only bridgeport intermediate stop this trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in bridgeport and stamford without having to make a transfer at new haven on june 24 2002 additional stamford trains were added for a total of two westbound and three eastbound trains when opened on august 18 2013 it was added to these trips as well in 2003 in order to add four additional amtrak trips along corridor four of then six round trips to new london were cut back to old saybrook an agreement with connecticut department of environmental protection limits service over old saybrook old lyme bridge in order to avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters conndot s agreement with amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain amtrak trains instead after criticism over service cuts in april 2008 conndot began allowing commuters with multi ride passes to board selected amtrak trains as well improved and increased service thumb left state street station in new haven opened in 2002 near city s downtown district when started in 1990 shore line east was intended to be a temporary service except at old saybrook and new haven which were already served by amtrak state constructed new stations consisting of little more than bare wooden decks for minimal cost since service was started two months before americans with disabilities act was signed platforms were not built to be handicapped accessible after a decade of service with shore line east established as part of connecticut s transportation system state began to upgrade service basic stations have been rebuilt with high level platforms to provide handicapped access and level boarding parking lots have been expanded and more trains have been added to schedule a completely new station was also added to line for traffic mitigation as part of reconstruction of pearl harbor memorial bridge on june 7 2002 state street station was opened in new haven to provide better access to downtown area than union station which is half a mile away from business district first station to be rebuilt was old saybrook busy eastern terminus of line new high level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on november 1 2002 old saybrook had previous had only a single side platform serving a relatively small number of amtrak trains rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks to allow amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a sle train is at station thumb right guilford station was rebuilt in 2004 05 with new high level platforms connected by an overhead walkway westbound platform was extended in 2015 beginning on may 24 2004 construction of new platforms began at clinton guilford and branford rebuilt clinton station opened on july 25 2005 and rebuilt branford station opened on august 8 2005 both consist of a single high level platform on south side of tracks new guilford station which has platforms on both sides of tracks connected by a pedestrian bridge to allow for greater operational flexibility opened on november 28 2005 construction at madison started on september 24 2007 and finished with opening of rebuilt station platform on july 28 2008 on october 8 2007 reverse peak and more midday service were introduced which officials hailed as beginning of shore line east as a true bidirectional system several existing express trains also began to stop at guilford since at least 2006 advocates had been calling for establishment of weekend shore line east service a pilot of weekend service was run from november 17 2007 to december 30 2007 with six shopper s special round trips from old saybrook to new haven trains were scheduled to connect with similar metro north specials at new haven year round weekend service began on july 4 2008 with 9 daily old saybrook new haven round trips on weekends no weekend service was run to new london but weekday service was increased as cross honoring of multiple ride and monthly tickets was added on two amtrak trains thumb left a weekend shore line east train arrives at new london in june 2013 thumb right conflicts over closings of old saybrook old lyme bridge are primary obstacle to full service to new london and further eastward expansion major obstacle preventing full new london service is bridge over connecticut river between old saybrook and old lyme drawbridge section is closed for a certain period of time to allow trains to pass which prevents large boats from passing under marine trades association opposes additional service which would mandate more bridge closings 2003 agreement with amtrak limited weekday traffic over bridge to 2 sle and 39 amtrak trains until 2018 although it was revised in 2010 and 2013 since 2003 new london had been served by cross honored amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated sle roundtrips on february 16 2010 an additional round trip was extended to new london three more were extended on may 10 2010 however advocates for full service to new london said that governor rell failed to deliver on promises to new london with one newspaper columnist writing that she seems incapable of standing up to marine trades lobby regarding bridge openings in july 2012 governor malloy announced that 5 weekend round trips would be extended to new london beginning in april 2013 however extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with marine industry over mandated closings of old saybrook old lyme bridge two weekday midday trips were added in may 2013 while weekend service began on june 1 2013 after application for additional bridge closings was approved by state department of energy and environmental protection by july new london represented 26 of weekend ridership in december 2013 state announced that ridership was up 35 for year as a result of increased service from 2009 to 2014 monthly new london ridership increased from less than 1 000 monthly passengers to approximately 5 000 accounting for a significant fraction of ridership increases on shore line east during that period four of five intermediate stations between old saybrook and new haven were rebuilt with accessible platforms between 2004 and 2008 but rebuilding at westbrook was delayed due to environmental and cost issues no site was available until westbrook and conndot traded new station site on norris avenue for a highway garage site off route 145 controversial land swap was begun in 2004 but was not finalized until 2006 and town operations were not moved to route 145 site until september 2011 site clearing began in november 2011 and ground was broken for 14 4 million station in january 2012 a new station with a larger 210 space lot and platforms on both tracks opened on march 25 2014 with full bidirectional service to station beginning on may 11 in 2018 two separate issues caused numerous delays and cancellations with many trains replaced by buses an amtrak track maintenance project required single tracking of sections of line and conndot lacked sufficient functional locomotives as aging fleet was sent out for refurbishment three weekday round trips were reverted from bus to train in january 2019 when one locomotive returned from refurbishment though additional issues were expected during a second summer of track work in 2019 full service was restored on august 5 2019 by that time ridership had fallen by 25 averaging 1 340 weekday riders and 767 weekend riders future in a 2007 report conndot outlined plans to turn sle into a full service bidirectional regional rail line with full day service and all trains extended to new london this involves incremental improvements similar to those that have already been put into place one of first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations which is mandated by 2003 agreement with amtrak new london old saybrook guilford westbrook branford and stops from new haven union station west all have multiple platforms while state street has an island platform serving two tracks and a side platform branford is first previously rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform a 60 million bond in february 2011 included 16 5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at branford 7 3 million for platform extensions at guilford and 11 million to add catenary wires to currently unwired sidings along line construction on new platform at branford began in september 2013 and guilford work is under way as well after delays enlarged branford station opened on september 30 2016 although north platform was not immediately served by trains bidding on a second platform and three level parking garage at madison planned since 2009 was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur per agreement with amtrak a second platform is planned to be added to clinton station project was originally planned to start in early 2012 but has since been indefinitely delayed in october 2017 conndot announced plans to expand current clinton station construction was set to begin in march 2018 and be completed by december 2019 it has once again been postponed along with madison station until new funding is identified expansion of original parking facilities is also necessary to meet demand at many stations since many started with small lots suitable for just a few dozen cars rebuilt stations at branford guilford madison clinton and westbrook have larger lots than 1990 stations and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at branford in june 2011 a 585 space three level parking garage is eventually planned for madison station although route east of new haven is electrified under amtrak s 60 hz traction power system shore line east currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives once full order of m8 railcars are in service and amtrak tests and approves m8s for usage east of new haven conndot plans to use 24 to 32 cars for electric sle service to reduce diesel emissions diesel trainsets will be moved to service on danbury or waterbury branches or to hartford line from new haven to springfield thumb right westerly station is a possible future eastbound terminus of shore line east service in april 2012 state officials released a report detailing possible sites for an infill station in east lyme four sites were analyzed two near downtown niantic and two at rocky neck state park niantic had previously been a stop on clamdigger as part of a bonding proposal made by governor malloy 750 000 would be allocated for a new station at niantic a study will be undertaken to analyze corridor capacity impacts that station would bring possibility of extending service eastward has also been considered several special trains operated to mystic during 2000 opsail festival only such service to date in a 2001 report examining commuter rail for rhode island rhode island department of transportation ridot considered an extension of shore line east to providence via westerly effectively restoring clamdigger service ultimately mbta commuter rail service which already ran to providence as part of providence stoughton line was extended southward instead although only to wickford junction however both ridot and sle have long term plans to extend their services to meet at westerly extending sle service would require negotiations with us coast guard marine trades association and other stakeholders for increased use of thames river bridge and mystic river bridge as part of governor malloy s thirty year transit plan shore line east would be extended to westerly at a cost of 200 million on february 1 2016 connecticut public transportation commission issued a report recommending extension of shore line east rail service to mystic and westerly as soon as possible rolling stock left thumb a typical shore line east train with a p40dc and three mafersa coaches at old saybrook in contrast to electric multiple units used on metro north s new haven line which are also purchased in part by state of connecticut all sle trains are diesel push pull trains sle runs diesel service because amtrak had not yet electrified northeast corridor between new haven and boston at time service began original sle service operated with 2 f 7s and 10 pullman standard coaches purchased from pittsburgh s patrain for 1 7 million in 1991 conndot purchased 10 bombardier iii coaches similar to ones already used on danbury branch and waterbury branch and leased three additional diesel locomotives two emd and one emd gp9 in 1994 amtrak rebuilt 11 of conndot s surplus spv 2000 diesel railcars into coaches dubbed constitution liners in 1996 sle took delivery of six remanufactured gp40 2h diesels to replace entire motive power fleet these were supplemented in 2005 with 8 ge p40dc genesis diesels leased from amtrak conndot purchased in 2008 to augment capacity conndot acquired 33 mafersa coaches from virginia railway express in 2004 these began entering service in 2006 displacing and constitution liners conndot acquired an additional four ge p40dc locomotives from new jersey transit in 2015 originally built for amtrak nj transit employed locomotives on short lived atlantic city express service in january 2018 conndot awarded a contract to amtrak to overhaul all 12 p40dc locomotives at beech grove shops gp40 2h locomotives were sent to for rebuilding in 2017 and 2018 followed by use on new hartford line service conndot plans call for kawasaki m8 to replace most or all of locomotives and coaches currently in service on shore line east in 2018 conndot has proposed to use up to 32 m8 s in sle service as far as old saybrook step fitted diesel equipment will then be used on hartford line and for new london mystic westerly service limited direct service from grand central terminal to may be added once m8s are in service testing
