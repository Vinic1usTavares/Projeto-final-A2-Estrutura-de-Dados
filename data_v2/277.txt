sms tegetthoff his majesty s ship tegetthoff was second of four dreadnought battleships built for austro hungarian navy tegetthoff was named for 19th century austrian admiral wilhelm von tegetthoff most notable for defeating italian regia marina at battle of lissa in 1866 ship was armed with a main battery of twelve guns in four triple turrets constructed shortly before world war i she was built at stabilimento tecnico triestino shipyard in trieste where she was laid down in september 1910 and launched in march 1912 tegetthoff was a member of 1st battleship division of austro hungarian navy at beginning of war alongside other ships of her class and was stationed out of austro hungarian naval base at pola first saw action during bombardment of ancona following italy s declaration of war on austria hungary in may 1915 but saw little combat for rest of war due to otranto barrage which prohibited austro hungarian navy from leaving adriatic sea in june 1918 in an bid to earn safer passage for german and austro hungarian u boats through strait of otranto austro hungarian navy attempted to break barrage with a major attack on strait but it was abandoned after tegetthoff and her sister ship were attacked by italian motor torpedo boats on morning of 10 june tegetthoff was unharmed during attack but szent istvan was sunk by torpedoes launched from mas 15 after sinking of szent istvan tegetthoff and remaining two ships of her class returned to port in pola where they remained for rest of war when austria hungary was facing defeat in war in october 1918 austrian government decided to transfer bulk of her navy to newly formed state of slovenes croats and serbs in order to avoid having to hand ship over to allies this transfer however was not recognized by armistice of villa giusti signed between austria hungary and allies in november 1918 under terms of treaty of saint germain en laye tegetthoff was handed over to italy she was subsequently moved to venice before being shown as a war trophy by italians during that time period she starred in movie eroi di nostri mari heroes of our seas which depicted sinking of szent istvan following adoption of washington naval treaty in 1922 she was broken up at la spezia between 1924 and 1925 background before construction of tegetthoff and her namesake class most of austria hungary s previous battleships had been designed for defense of empire s coastline during 19th century sea power had not been a priority in austrian foreign policy as a result austro hungarian navy had little public interest or support however appointment of archduke franz ferdinand heir to austro hungarian throne and a prominent and influential supporter of naval expansion to position of admiral in september 1902 greatly increased importance of navy in eyes of both general public and austrian and hungarian parliaments franz ferdinand s interest in naval affairs were largely motivated from his belief that a strong navy would be necessary to compete with italy which he viewed as austria hungary s greatest regional threat in 1904 austro hungarian navy began an expansion program intended to equal that of other great powers of europe this naval expansion program coincided with establishment of austrian naval league in september 1904 and appointment of vice admiral rudolf montecuccoli to posts of commander in chief of navy german marinekommandant and chief of naval section of war ministry german chef der in october that same year after montecuccoli s appointment admiral worked to pursued efforts championed by his predecessor admiral hermann von spaun and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy origins of tegetthoff and her namesake class can also be found in developments in first decade of 20th century which greatly increased importance of sea power to austro hungarian empire between 1906 and 1907 railroads linking trieste and dalmatian coastline to interior of empire had been constructed through austria s alpine passes additionally lower tariffs on port of trieste allowed for a rapid expansion of city and a similar growth in austria hungary s merchant marine as austria hungary became more connected to naval affairs than in past decades a new line of battleships would be necessary to match empire s growing naval interests tegetthoff was first envisioned in middle of a heated naval arms race between austria hungary and its nominal ally italy since battle of lissa in 1866 italy s regia marina was considered most important naval power in region which austria hungary measured itself against often unfavorably disparity between austro hungarian and italian navies had existed since unification of italy in late 1880s italy had third largest fleet in world behind french republic s navy and british royal navy while disparity between italian and austro hungarian naval strength had been somewhat equalized with russian imperial navy and german kaiserliche marine surpassing italian navy in 1893 and in 1894 italy had once again regained initiative by turn of century in 1903 year before montecuccoli s appointment italy had 18 battleships in commission or under construction compared to 6 austro hungarian battleships following construction of final two s in 1903 italian navy elected to construct a series of large cruisers rather than additional battleships furthermore a major scandal involving terni steel works armor contracts led to a government investigation that postponed several naval construction programs for three years these delays meant that italian navy would not initiate construction on another battleship until 1909 and provided austro hungarian navy an attempt to even disparity between two fleets construction of tegetthoff can thus be viewed in context of naval rivalry between austria hungary and italy with ship playing a role in a larger attempt by austria hungary to compete with italy s naval power austro italian naval arms race thumb 250px viribus unitis identical sister ship of tegetthoff at anchor in 1914 alt a large battleship sits motionless in water with smoke coming out of its funnels and three small boats moving beside her in foreground revolution in naval technology created by launch of british in 1906 and anglo german naval arms race that followed had a tremendous impact on development of future battleships around world including tegetthoff dreadnought armed with ten large caliber guns was first of a revolutionary new standard of all big gun battleships that rendered pre dreadnought battleships obsolete as a result value of older battleships declined rapidly in years after 1906 this development gave austria hungary opportunity to make up for neglecting its navy in past years furthermore austria hungary s improved financial situation following austro hungarian compromise of 1867 were beginning to reflect in form of larger budgets being allocated to empire s armed forces political will also existed to construct austria hungary s own dreadnought battleship as both archduke ferdinand and admiral montecuccoli were supportive of constructing a new class of modern battleships as a result by 1908 stage was set for creation of tegetthoff and her namesake class shortly after assuming command as chief of navy montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern austrian fleet in spring of 1905 while these plans were ambitious and included 12 battleships none of ships approached eventual size of tegetthoff additional proposals came from outside naval section of war ministry two proposals from slovenian politician ivan sustersic and austrian naval league in 1905 and 1909 included battleships which approached size of tegetthoff while sustersic s plan lacked large caliber guns that would later be found on tegetthoff plans submitted by austrian naval league three dreadnoughts of similar to tegetthoffs eventual displacement of these plans were justified by league by pointing out that newer battleships were necessary to protect austria hungary s growing merchant marine and that italian naval spending was twice that of austria hungary s following construction of austria hungary s last class of pre dreadnought battleships montecuccoli submitted a proposal which would include first design for tegetthoff with threat of war with italy from bosnian crisis in 1908 fresh in minds of austro hungarian military montecuccoli delivered a memorandum to emperor franz joseph i in january 1909 proposing an enlarged austro hungarian navy consisting of 16 battleships 12 cruisers 24 destroyers 72 seagoing torpedo boats and 12 submarines most notable change in this memorandum compared to s previous draft from 1905 was inclusion of four additional dreadnought battleships with a displacement of at load one of these ships would eventually become tegetthoff plans and budget montecuccoli s memorandum would eventually be leaked to italian newspapers just three months after obtaining approval from emperor franz joseph i italian reaction to austro hungarian plans was swift and in june 1909 italian dreadnought battleship was laid down at naval shipyard in castellammare di stabia while dante alighieri was being worked on in italy austria hungary s own plans for tegetthoff and other ships of her class remained on paper funding necessary to begin construction was not to be had either due to collapse of sandor s government in budapest this left hungarian diet without a prime minister for nearly a year with no government in budapest to pass a budget money necessary to pay for tegetthoff could not be obtained as a result largest shipbuilding enterprises in austria hungary witkowitz ironworks and skoda works offered to begin construction on tegetthoff and two other dreadnoughts at their own financial risk in return for assurances that austro hungarian government would purchase battleships as soon as funds were available after negotiations which involved austro hungarian joint ministries of foreign affairs war and finance offer was agreed to by montecuccoli but number of dreadnoughts constructed under this arrangement was reduced to just tegetthoff and viribus unitis in his memoirs former austrian field marshal and chief of general staff conrad von hotzendorf wrote that due to his belief that a war with italy in near future was likely construction on battleships should begin as soon as possible he also worked to secure agreements to sell both tegetthoff and viribus unitis to in his words a reliable ally which only germany could claim to be should budget crisis in budapest fail to be settled quickly outline although smaller than contemporary dreadnought and super dreadnought battleships of german kaiserliche marine and british royal navy tegetthoff was part of first class of its type in mediterranean and adriatic seas tegetthoff and her sister ships were described by former austro hungarian naval officer anthony sokol in his book imperial and royal austro hungarian navy as excellent ships and she was as one of most powerful battleships in region design of battleship also signaled a change in austro hungarian naval policy as she was capable of far more than coastal defense or patrolling adriatic sea indeed tegetthoff and her sister ships were so well received that when time came to plan for replacement of austria hungary s old s navy elected to simply take layout of her class and enlarge them to have a slightly greater tonnage and larger main guns funding cost to construct tegetthoff was enormous by standards of austro hungarian navy while and radetzky class battleships cost navy roughly 18 26 and 40 million krone per ship tegetthoff was projected to cost over 60 million krone under previous budgets for 1907 and 1908 navy had been allocated some 63 4 and 73 4 million krone which at time was considered an inflated budget due to construction of two radetzkys montecuccoli worried that general public and legislatures in vienna and budapest would reject need for a ship as expensive as tegetthoff especially so soon after political crisis in budapest dramatic increase in spending meant that in 1909 navy spent some 100 4 million krone a huge sum at time this was done in order to rush completion of radetzky class battleships though looming construction of three other dreadnoughts in addition to tegetthoff meant austro hungarian navy would likely have to ask government for a yearly budget much higher than 100 million krone in order to guarantee funding for ship from rothschild family in austria who owned witkowitz ironworks creditanstalt bank and had significant assets in both skoda works and stabilimento tecnico triestino archduke franz ferdinand personally courted albert salomon anselm von rothschild to obtain his family s monetary support until government could buy battleship facing potential backlash over constitutional concerns that construction of tegetthoff committed austria hungary to spend roughly 60 million kronen without prior approval by either austrian reichsrat or diet of hungary deal remained secret in event of agreement being leaked to press prior to passage of a new naval budget montecuccoli drafted several explanations to justify construction of battleship and necessity to keep its existence a secret these included navy s urgent need to counter italy s naval build up and desire to negotiate a lower price with their builders by time agreement was leaked to public in april 1910 by arbeiter zeitung newspaper of austria s social democratic party plans had already been finalized and construction on tegetthoff was about to begin general characteristics thumb left 300px a line drawing of tegetthoff class alt schematics for this type of battleship ships mount four gun turrets two forward and two aft designed by naval architect siegfried popper tegetthoff had an overall length of with a beam of and a draught of at deep load she was designed to displace at load but at full combat load she displaced tegetthoffs hull was built with a double bottom deep with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of plates hull design was intended by popper to protect battleship from naval mines though it ultimately failed tegetthoffs sister ships szent istvan and viribus unitis when former was sunk by a torpedo in june 1918 and later by a mine in november of that same year tegetthoff also featured two barr and stroud optical rangefinder posts on both starboard and port sides for secondary guns of battleship these rangefinders were equipped with an armored cupola tegetthoff was equipped with torpedo nets though they were removed in june 1917 propulsion thumb right 300px turbines of tegetthoff alt a large piece

her speed trials that she attained a top speed of though her actual top speed is unknown as official sea trial data and records for all ships of tegetthoff class were lost after war tegetthoff also carried of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on coal to increase its burn rate at full capacity tegetthoff could steam for at a speed of armament constructed at skoda works in plzen bohemia tegetthoffs main battery consisted of twelve 45 calibre skoda k10 guns mounted in four triple turrets two turrets each were mounted forward and aft of ship s main superstructure in a superfiring pair implementation of triple turrets aboard tegetthoff came about for two reasons need to ensure ship had a more compact design and smaller displacement to conform to austro hungarian naval doctrine and budget constraints and to counter implementation of triple turrets on italian dante alighieri having three guns on each turret rather than two made it possible to deliver a heavier broadside than other dreadnoughts of a similar size and meant a shorter citadel and better weight distribution choice of implementing triple turrets also assisted in construction speed of tegetthoff as well guns for battleship were available at short notice because skoda had already been working on a triple turret design ordered by imperial russian navy when their initial order for tegetthoffs armament arrived thumb left diagram of tegetthoffs main armament alt a diagram showing location of main guns on a tegetthoff class battleship there are 12 guns in total divided into four turrets with two apiece located near bow and stern of ship tegetthoff carried a secondary armament which consisted of a dozen 50 calibre skoda k10 guns mounted in casemates amidships additionally eighteen 50 calibre skoda k10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on upper deck above casemates three more skoda k10 guns were mounted on upper turrets for anti aircraft duties two additional schwarzlose m 07 12 anti aircraft machine guns were mounted atop armored cupolas of her rangefinders tegetthoff was also equipped with two skoda g l 18 landing guns and two skoda l 44 s guns for use against small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and submarines furthermore she also fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes one each in bow stern and each side complementing these torpedo tubes tegetthoff usually carried twelve torpedoes armor thumb right 250px tegetthoff conducting sea trails in 1913 alt a large battleship steaming through water at high speeds water breaks against bow of ship while smoke

incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or mine explosion without rupturing this design flaw would ultimately prove to be fatal to her sister ships szent istvan and viribus unitis construction thumb left 250px admiral wilhelm von tegetthoff namesake of battleship tegetthoff montecuccoli s plans for construction of tegetthoff and her sister ships earned approval of emperor franz joseph i in january 1909 and by april plans for design construction and financing for tegetthoff was laid out for a full year austro hungarian navy attempted to keep looming construction of tegetthoff and viribus unitis a state secret this did not prevent rumors from circulating across europe of two dreadnought battleships being constructed in austria hungary french naval attache in vienna complained to paris in 1910 of extensive secrecy within austro hungarian navy which manifested itself in several ways among these were a ban on photography in pola future home port of tegetthoff and near constant observation by austro hungarian police british admiralty considered rumored construction of tegetthoff and viribus unitis as a concealed addition to german fleet and interpreted ships as austria hungary s way of repaying germany for her diplomatic support during former s annexation of bosnia in 1908 during spring and summer of 1909 united kingdom was locked in a heated naval arms race with germany which led royal navy to look upon battleship as a ploy by german grand admiral alfred von tirpitz to outpace british naval construction rather than latest development in austria hungary s own naval arms race with italy admiralty s concerns regarding true purpose of tegetthoff was so great that a british spy was dispatched to berlin when montecuccoli sent an officer from naval section of war ministry to obtain recommendations from tirpitz regarding design and layout of battleship these concerns continued to grow and in april 1909 british ambassador fairfax leighton cartwright asked austro hungarian foreign minister alois lexa von aehrenthal about rumored battleships aehrenthal denied construction of tegetthoff and viribus unitis but admitted that plans to construct a class of dreadnoughts were being considered in an attempt to assure cartwright that austria hungary was not constructing any ships for german navy aehrenthal justified any naval expansion as being necessary to secure austria hungary s strategic interests in mediterranean at time potential that austria hungary was constructing a class of dreadnought battleships was widely regarded among british press public and politicians as a provocation on part of germany neither admiralty s suspicions nor those of some politicians managed to convince parliament that german government was attempting to use tegetthoff and viribus unitis to escalate germany and britain s already contentious naval arms race however when winston churchill was appointed first lord of admiralty in 1911 he rejected any potential austro german collusion regarding battleship roughly a year after tegetthoffs plans were drafted arbeiter zeitung austrian social democratic party newspaper reported details of battleship to general public christian social party supportive of construction of tegetthoff and her sister ships and operating on advice of navy published in its own newspaper reichspost that secret project to construct battleship and related financial agreements to fund it were true lobbied in support of project citing austria hungary s national security concerns with an italian dreadnought already under

pass necessary budget to fund construction of entire class budgets were approved after two meetings of austrian reichsrat and diet of hungary in october and november 1910 opposition being rejected as italian navy had laid down another three battleships during summer final package of budget agreement which funded tegetthoff included provisions which ensured that while armor and guns of battleship were to be constructed within austria electrical wiring and equipment aboard tegetthoff was to be assembled in hungary additionally half of all ammunition and shells for guns of ship would be purchased in austria while other half was to be bought in hungary aside from a brief strike in trieste in may 1911 construction on tegetthoff continued at a fast pace less than a year after being laid down tegetthoff was launched on 21 march after delays due to poor weather around trieste originally referred to as battleship v discussion began over what to name battleship while it was under construction in trieste naval section of war ministry initially proposed naming battleship don juan newspapers within austria reported during construction that one of ships was to be named kaiser franz joseph i were unfounded as hungarian navy had no intentions of renaming cruiser which already bore emperor s name emperor franz joseph i ultimately decided names of all four dreadnoughts selecting to name first ship after his own personal motto viribus unitis latin with united forces while second ship would be named tegetthoff after wilhelm von tegetthoff a 19th century austrian naval admiral known for his victory over italy at battle of lissa in 1866 tegetthoff was commissioned into austro hungarian navy on 14 july 1913 during her gunnery trials a discharge from one of ship s main

of first battle division under command of vice admiral maximilian njegovan in spring of 1914 both ships together with pre dreadnought battleship zrinyi and coastal defense ship traveled eastern mediterranean and levant visiting ports of smyrna beirut alexandria and malta meanwhile tegetthoff and viribus unitis arrived at malta on 22 may before leaving for pola on 28 may exactly one month before archduke franz ferdinand s assassination and two months before start of war upon hearing of assassination of archduke franz ferdinand and his wife sophie on 28 june in sarajevo commander in chief of navy anton haus sailed south from trieste with an escort fleet composed of tegetthoff cruiser and several torpedo boats two days after their murders ferdinand and sophia s bodies were transferred aboard viribus unitis which had been anchored off bosnia waiting to receive archduke for his return tegetthoff and other ships in haus fleet then escorted viribus unitis back to trieste during voyage fleet moved slowly along dalmatian coast and usually within sight of land coastal towns and villages rang church bells when ships passed while spectators watched fleet from shoreline archduke s death triggered july crisis culminating in austria hungary s declaration of war on kingdom of serbia on 28 july 1914 world war i outbreak of war events unfolded rapidly in ensuing days on 30 july 1914 russia declared full mobilization in response to austria hungary s declaration of war on serbia austria hungary declared full mobilization next day on 1 august both germany and france ordered full mobilization and germany declared war on russia in support of austria hungary while relations between austria hungary and italy had improved greatly in two years following 1912 renewal of triple alliance increased austro hungarian naval spending political disputes over influence in albania and italian concerns over potential annexation of land in montenegro caused relationship between two allies to falter in months leading up to war italy s declaration of neutrality in war on 1 august dashed austro hungarian hopes to use tegetthoff in major combat operations in mediterranean as navy had been relying upon coal stored in italian ports to operate in conjunction with regia marina by 4 august germany had already occupied luxembourg and invaded belgium after declaring war on france and united kingdom had declared war on germany in support of belgian neutrality assistance of austro hungarian fleet was called upon by german mediterranean division which consisted of battlecruiser and light cruiser german ships were attempting to break out of messina where they had been taking on coal prior to outbreak of war by first week of august british ships had begun to assemble off messina in an attempt to trap germans while austria hungary had not yet fully mobilized its fleet a force was assembled to assist german ships this consisted of tegetthoff viribus unitis and prinz eugen as well as three radetzkys armoured cruiser scout cruiser admiral spaun six destroyers and 13 torpedo boats austro hungarian high command wary of instigating war with great britain ordered fleet to avoid british ships and to only support germans openly while they were in austro hungarian waters on 7 august when germans broke out of messina austro hungarian fleet had begun to sail for brindisi to link up with germans and escort their ships to a friendly port in austria hungary however german movement toward mouth of adriatic had been a diversion to throw british and french off their pursuit and german ships instead rounded southern tip of greece and made their way to dardanelles where they would eventually be sold to ottoman empire rather than follow german ships towards black sea austrian fleet returned to pola 1914 1915 thumb right 250px tegetthoff lying at anchor alt a large battleship sits at anchor a small boat can be seen moored next to battleship in foreground following france and britain s declarations of war on austria hungary on 11 and 12 august respectively french admiral augustin boue de lapeyrere was issued orders to close off austro hungarian shipping at entrance to adriatic sea and to engage any austro hungarian ships his anglo french fleet came across lapeyrere chose to attack austro hungarian ships blockading montenegro ensuing battle of antivari ended austria hungary s blockade and effectively placed entrance of adriatic sea firmly in hands of britain and france after breakout of goeben and breslau tegetthoff saw very little action spending much of her time in port at pola ship s lack of time spent at sea was part of a greater general inactivity among nearly all ships of austro hungarian navy this was partly caused by a fear of mines in adriatic though other factors contributed to lack of naval activity haus was fearful that direct confrontation with french navy even if it should be successful would weaken austro hungarian navy to point that italy would have a free hand in adriatic this concern was so great to haus that he wrote in september 1914 so long as possibility exists that italy will declare war against us i consider it my first duty to keep our fleet intact haus decision to use austro hungarian navy as a fleet in being earned sharp criticism from austro hungarian army german navy and austro hungarian foreign ministry but it also led to a far greater number of entente naval forces being devoted to mediterranean and strait of otranto these could have been used elsewhere such as against ottoman empire during gallipoli campaign most important factor contributing to tegetthoff spending most of her time at port may have been lack of coal prior to war united kingdom had served as austria hungary s primary source for coal in years before war an increasing percentage of coal had come from mines in germany virginia and from domestic sources but 75 of coal purchased for austro hungarian navy came from britain outbreak of war meant that these sources as well as those from virginia would no longer be available significant quantities of coal had been stockpiled before war however ensuring navy was capable of sailing out of port if need be even so necessity of ensuring that tegetthoff had coal she needed in event of an italian or french attack or a major offensive operation resulted in her and other battleships remaining at port unless circumstances necessitated their deployment at sea in early 1915 germany suggested that tegetthoff and other battleships of austro hungarian navy conduct an attack on otranto barrage in order to relieve pressure on ottoman empire at height of gallipoli campaign haus still weary of taking austria hungary s battleships out of port rejected proposal he countered that french had pulled back their blockade to southernmost end of adriatic sea and that none of anglo french ships assigned to blockading strait had been diverted to dardanelles haus also advocated strongly in favor of keeping his battleships in particular all four ships of tegetthoff class in reserve in event of italy s entry into war on side of entente haus believed that italy would inevitably break her alliance with austria hungary and germany and that by keeping battleships such as tegetthoff safe they could rapidly be employed against italy this strategy enabled austria hungary to engage italians shortly after italy s declaration of war in may 1915 bombardment of ancona thumb left 250px deck of tegetthoff after failed negotiations with germany and austria hungary over italy joining war as a member of central powers italians negotiated with triple entente for italy s eventual entry into war on their side in treaty of london signed on 26 april 1915 on 4 may italy formally renounced her alliance to germany and austria hungary giving austro hungarians advanced warning that italy was preparing to go to war against them haus made preparations for tegetthoff and her sister ships to sortie out into adriatic in a massive strike against italians moment war was declared on 23 may 1915 between two and four hours after italian declaration of war reached main austro hungarian naval base at pola austro hungarian fleet including tegetthoff departed to bombard italian coast while several ships bombarded secondary targets and others were deployed to south to screen for italian ships that could be steaming north from taranto core of austro hungarian navy spearheaded by tegetthoff and her sister ships made their way to ancona bombardment across province of ancona was a major success for austro hungarian navy in port of ancona an italian steamer was destroyed and three others damaged infrastructure of port of ancona and surrounding towns was severely damaged railroad yard and port facilities in city were damaged or destroyed while local shore batteries defending them were knocked out multiple wharves warehouses oil tanks radio stations and coal and oil stores were set on fire by bombardment and city s electricity gas and telephone lines were severed within city itself ancona s police headquarters army barracks military hospital sugar refinery and bank of italy offices all saw damage 30 italian soldiers and 38 civilians were killed while an additional 150 were wounded in attack austro hungarian navy would later move on to bombard coast of montenegro without opposition by time italian ships arrived on scene austro hungarians were safely back in pola objective of bombardment of ancona was to delay italian army from deploying its forces along border with austria hungary by destroying critical transportation systems surprise attack on ancona succeeded in delaying italian deployment to alps for two weeks this delay gave austria hungary valuable time to strengthen its italian border and re deploy some of its troops from eastern and balkan fronts bombardment also delivered a severe blow to italian military and public morale 1916 1917 thumb 250px right map showing location of straits of otranto at southern end of adriatic alt a map showing strait of otranto southeastern tip of italy can be seen on left with coast of albania appearing on right largely unable to engage in major offensive combat operations after bombardment of ancona due to otranto barrage tegetthoff mostly relegated to defending austria hungary s coastline and of island seaboard for next three years lack of combat engagements or even instances where tegetthoff left port is exemplified by career of her sister ship szent istvan ship was unable to join her sisters in bombardment of ancona and rarely left safety of port except for gunnery practice in nearby fazana strait she only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single two day trip to pag island in total only 5 7 of her life was spent at sea and for rest of time she swung at anchor in pola harbour despite haus death from pneumonia on 8 february 1917 his strategy of keeping austro hungarian navy and particularly dreadnoughts like tegetthoff in port continued by keeping tegetthoff and her sister ships as a fleet in being austro hungarian navy would be able to continue to defend its lengthy coastline from naval bombardment or invasion by sea major ports of trieste and fiume would also remain protected furthermore italian ships stationed in venice were effectively trapped by positioning of austro hungarian fleet preventing them from sailing south to join bulk of entente forces at otranto barrage maximilian njegovan was promoted to admiral and appointed commander in chief of navy to replace haus with njegovan appointed to higher office command of first battle division which included that of tegetthoff and her sister ships fell to vice admiral anton njegovan had previously voiced frustration watching dreadnoughts he had commanded under haus sit idle at port and upon taking command he had some 400 000 tons of coal at his disposal however he chose to continue strategy of his predecessor ensuring tegetthoff would continue to see little to no combat having hardly ever ventured out to port except to conduct gunnery practice for past two years most significant moments tegetthoff experienced while moored in pola were inspections by dignitaries first such visit was conducted by emperor karl i on 15 december 1916 during this brief visit emperor inspected pola s naval establishments and szent istvan but he did not board tegetthoff karl i returned to pola in june 1917 in first formal imperial review of austro hungarian navy since 1902 third dignitary visit came during kaiser wilhelm ii s inspection of pola s german submarine base on 12 december 1917 aside from these visits only action port of pola and tegetthoff was subject to between bombardment of ancona and summer of 1918 were more than eighty air raids conducted by newly formed italian air force 1918 following cattaro mutiny in february 1918 admiral njegovan was fired as commander in chief of navy miklos horthy de nagybanya commander of tegetthoffs sister ship prinz eugen was promoted to rear admiral and named commander in chief of fleet horthy used his appointment to take austro hungarian fleet out of port for maneuvers and gunnery practice on a regular basis size of these operations were largest tegetthoff had seen since outbreak of war these gunnery and maneuver practices were conducted not only to restore order in wake of several failed mutinies but also to prepare fleet for a major offensive operation horthy s strategic thinking differed from his two predecessors and shortly after assuming command of navy he resolved to undertake a major fleet action in order to address low morale and boredom and make it easier for austro hungarian and german u boats to break out of adriatic into mediterranean after several months of practice horthy concluded fleet was ready for a major offensive at beginning of june

karl class pre dreadnoughts three s cruiser admiral spaun four s and four torpedo boats submarines and aircraft would also be employed in operation to hunt down enemy ships on flanks of fleet on 8 june 1918 horthy took his flagship viribus unitis and prinz eugen south with lead elements of his fleet on evening of 9 june szent istvan and tegetthoff followed along with their own escort ships horthy s plan called for and to engage barrage with support of tatra class destroyers meanwhile admiral spaun and would be escorted by fleet s four torpedo boats to otranto to bombard italian air and naval stations german and austro hungarian submarines would be sent to valona and brindisi to ambush italian french british and american warships that sailed out to engage austro hungarian fleet while seaplanes from cattaro would provide air support and screen ships advance battleships and in particular dreadnoughts such as tegetthoff would use their firepower to destroy barrage and engage any allied warships they ran across horthy hoped that inclusion of these ships would prove to be critical in securing a decisive victory en route to harbour at north of ragusa to rendezvous with viribus unitis and prinz eugen for coordinated attack on otranto barrage szent istvan and tegetthoff attempted to make maximum speed in order to catch up to rest of fleet in doing so szent istvans turbines started to overheat and speed of two ships had to be reduced when an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase their speed szent istvan produced an excess of smoke at about 3 15 am on 10 june two italian mas boats mas 15 and mas 21 spotted smoke from austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off dalmatian coast mas platoon was commanded by di luigi rizzo individual boats were commanded by capo armando gori and di giuseppe respectively both boats successfully penetrated escort screen and split to engage each of dreadnoughts mas 21 attacked tegetthoff but her torpedoes failed to hit ship mas 15 fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3 25 am at szent istvan both boats evaded any pursuit although mas 15 had to discourage austro hungarian torpedo boat tb 76 t by dropping depth charges in her wake tegetthoff thinking that torpedoes were fired by submarines pulled out of formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks she repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes meanwhile szent istvan was hit by two torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms efforts to plug holes in ship failed upon returning to formation at 4 45 am tegetthoff attempted to take szent istvan in tow which failed after it became clear szent istvan would sink crew of tegetthoff emerged onto her decks to salute sinking ship at 6 12 am with pumps unequal to task szent istvan capsized off film footage and photographs of szent istvans last half hour were taken by linienschiffsleutnant of tegetthoff with his own camera and by an official film crew these films were later spliced together and exhibited in united states after war where proceeds were eventually used to feed children in austria following ending of war fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from italian navy and possible allied dreadnoughts responding to scene horthy believed element of surprise had been lost and called off attack tegetthoff and rest of fleet returned to base

that austria hungary was facing defeat in war with various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing emperor karl i decided to sever austria hungary s alliance with germany and appeal to allied powers in an attempt to preserve empire from complete collapse on 26 october austria hungary informed germany that their alliance was over in pola austro hungarian navy was in process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines horthy was informed on morning of 28 october that an armistice was imminent and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among fleet while a mutiny was spared tensions remained high and morale was at an all time low on 29 october national council in zagreb announced croatia s dynastic ties to hungary had come to a formal conclusion this new provisional government while throwing off hungarian rule had not yet declared independence from austria hungary thus emperor karl i s government in vienna asked newly formed state of slovenes croats and serbs for help maintaining fleet stationed at pola and keeping order among navy emperor karl i attempting to save empire from collapse agreed to transfer all of austria hungary s ships to national council provided that other nations which made up austria hungary would be able to claim their fair share of value of fleet at a later time austro hungarian government thus decided to hand over bulk of its fleet to state of slovenes croats and serbs without a shot being fired this was considered preferential to handing fleet to allies as new state had declared its neutrality furthermore newly formed state had also not yet publicly dethroned emperor karl i keeping possibility of reforming empire into a triple monarchy alive transfer to state of slovenes croats and serbs began on morning of 31 october with horthy meeting representatives from south slav nationalities aboard his flagship viribus unitis after short and cool negotiations arrangements were settled and handover was completed that afternoon austro hungarian naval ensign was struck from viribus unitis and was followed by remaining ships in harbor head of newly established navy for state of slovenes croats and serbs fell to captain janko vukovic who was raised to rank of admiral and took over horthy s old responsibilities as commander in chief of fleet he selected tegetthoffs sister ship viribus unitis as his flagship on 1 november 1918 viribus unitis was destroyed when two men of regia marina raffaele and raffaele rossetti rode a primitive manned torpedo nicknamed or leech into naval base at pola and attacked her using limpet mines when mines exploded at 6 44 am battleship sank in 15 minutes vukovic and 300 400 of crew went down with her tegetthoff was unharmed in attack post war thumb left 250px

as a result on 4 november 1918 italian ships sailed into ports of trieste pola and fiume on 5 november italian troops occupied naval installations at pola while state of slovenes croats and serbs attempted to hold onto their ships they lacked men and officers to do so as most sailors who were not south slavs had already gone home national council did not order any men to resist italians but they also condemned italy s actions as illegitimate on 9 november all remaining ships in pola harbor had italian flag raised at a conference at corfu allied powers agreed transfer of austria hungary s navy to state of slovenes croats and serbs could not be accepted despite sympathy from united kingdom faced with prospect of being given an ultimatum to surrender former austro hungarian warships national council agreed to hand over ships beginning on 10 november 1918 in march 1919 tegetthoff and both flying italian flag were escorted into venice where they were shown as a war trophies by italians it would not be until 1920 when final distribution of ships was settled among allied powers under terms of treaty of saint germain en laye with tegetthoff being formally ceded to italy during that time period she starred in movie eroi di nostri mari heroes of our seas which depicted sinking of szent istvan following adoption of washington naval treaty in 1922 she was broken up at la spezia between 1924 and 1925 after tegetthoff was dismantled one of her anchors was placed on display at monument to italian sailors at brindisi where it can still be found following nazi germany s incorporation of austria via anschluss of march 1938 adolf hitler used austria hungary s naval history to appeal to austrian public and obtain their support hitler lived in vienna during development of much of austro hungarian navy and thus decided upon an austrian sounding name for a german cruiser which was under construction at kiel in 1938 cruiser was originally to be named tegetthoff by kriegsmarine after wilhelm von tegetthoff however concerns over possible insult to italy and benito mussolini of naming cruiser after austrian victor of battle of lissa led hitler to adopt prinz eugen as ship s namesake after austrian general prince eugene of savoy prinz eugen was launched on 22 august 1938 in a ceremony attended by hitler and governor german reichsstatthalter of ostmark arthur seyss inquart who made christening speech also present at launch was regent of hungary admiral miklos horthy horthy had previously commanded tegetthoffs sister ship prinz eugen from 24 november 1917 to 1 march 1918 and had commanded austro hungarian navy in final months of world war i horthy wife s magdolna purgly performed christening in reference to her originally planned name and in homage to
