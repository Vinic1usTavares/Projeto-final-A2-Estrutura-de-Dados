world championship for constructors which were contested concurrently over a sixteen race series that began on 23 january and ended on 25 september drivers championship was won by keke rosberg and constructors championship by ferrari motorsport journalist nigel roebuck later wrote that 1982 season was an ugly year pock marked by tragedy by dissension by greed and yet paradoxically it produced some of most memorable racing ever seen it started with a drivers strike at season opener in south africa and saw a partial race boycott as part of ongoing fisa foca war at san marino grand prix two drivers lost their lives during season gilles villeneuve during qualifying for belgian grand prix and riccardo paletti at start of canadian grand prix later championship favourite didier pironi suffered a career ending accident while qualifying for german grand prix these incidents and several other major accidents led to regulation changes to increase driver security for rosberg won only one race all season swiss grand prix but consistency gave him drivers championship five points clear of pironi and john watson rosberg was second driver to win championship having won only one race in season after mike hawthorn in eleven different drivers from seven different teams won a race during season with no driver winning more than twice there was also a run of nine different winners in nine consecutive races from monaco grand prix to swiss grand prix ferrari who replaced villeneuve with patrick tambay and pironi with world champion mario andretti managed to score enough points to secure

them pulling out of financing race due to uncertainty following drivers strike at previous round at kyalami spanish grand prix was omitted from calendar for several reasons circuito del jarama where race had been held previous year was unloved by drivers and organisers had failed to pay their fees for 1981 race was originally re instated for 27 june after organisers had paid their debts to formula one constructors association foca however protests from teams over dangerous nature of jarama venue led to race to eventually be cancelled two races were added to calendar compared to 1981 detroit grand prix and swiss grand prix held at dijon prenois in france since motor racing is outlawed in switzerland since 1955 le mans disaster addition of detroit meant that united states hosted

leading figures in fisa foca war alt portrait of bernie ecclestone starting in early 1970s bernie ecclestone owner of brabham team had seized control of formula 1 constructors association later renamed formula one constructors association foca in this role he began to negotiate more lucrative contracts between teams and track owners including full control over television rights for foca realising growing influence of ecclestone and foca sport s governing body federation internationale de l automobile fia and its head paul metternich instated frenchman jean marie balestre as head of commission sportive internationale csi in 1978 which was then renamed to federation internationale du sport automobile fisa fisa was running sporting regulations side of formula one delegated by fia over following years a power struggle developed between foca and fisa and ecclestone and balestre in particular this conflict is generally referred to as fisa foca war foca consisted of majorly british constructor teams while manufacturer or works teams renault ferrari alfa romeo and talbot ligier together with osella and toleman were aligned with fisa conflict came to a head at 1980 spanish grand prix where drivers of teams belonging to foca boycotted obligatory drivers briefing and were threatened by fisa with having their licences revoked race went ahead as a non championship event without non foca aligned teams participating following an aborted attempt to establish a break away world championship foca agreed to concorde agreement with fisa in march 1981 this agreement stipulated that all teams were obliged to attend all rounds of championship while at same time settling differences over future regulation changes regulation changes and technological development sporting regulations new rules for season included an increase in number of cars permitted to enter a grand prix from 30 to 34 and number of starters from 24 to 26 to avoid having all 34 cars on track at one time a pre qualifying session was introduced in which three teams with poorest record in previous year would compete to be allowed into qualification proper just as previous year best eleven results from all races counted towards drivers championship technology in years leading up to 1982 two major technological developments had shaped formula one turbocharged engine and ground effect in lotus had revolutionised aerodynamics in formula one by introducing lotus 78 known as wing car car used what is commonly referred to as ground effect with physical principle applied being venturi effect sides of underside of car would be shut off with skirts to trap under pressure airflow underneath car effectively sucking vehicle to ground this led to increased cornering speeds but at same time brought implications that had an adverse effect on drivers safety moveable skirts were thus banned in 1981 accompanied by a minimum ride height for cars of targeted at minimising ground effect and cut cornering speed however for 1982 both regulations were reversed as a result of new concorde agreement skirts around underpart of chassis which locked airflow underneath car necessitated very stiff suspensions to work properly this meant that every bump on track was putting enormous strain on drivers shaking them around in cockpit additionally cornering speed and resulting high g forces put pressure on both drivers and cars suspensions making them prone to breaking cars would also move up and down on road in an effect called porpoising making cars very hard to control these adverse effects were particularly impactful at bumpy circuits such as jacarepagua where riccardo patrese retired due to exhaustion other drivers reported dizziness and blurred vision making it hard to see while driving thumb left cosworth dfv powered williams fw08 was last naturally aspirated car used to win drivers championship until pictured here is eventual world champion keke rosberg at british grand prix alt sideview of a white williams racing car going through a corner during a race potentially dangerous implications of ground effect were only worsened by advent of very powerful turbocharged engines in 1977 renault had introduced first turbocharged engine into sport with their renault regulations at time allowed for either three litre normally aspirated or 1 5 litre turbocharged engines with renault being first to attempt to go latter route over next few seasons turbo engines proved fast yet unreliable by renault had shown that races could be won with this formula and in 1981 ferrari had followed them by introducing their own turbo engine cars however still suffered an effect often labelled throttle lag meaning that a significant and indeterminable time gap existed between applying throttle of car and point when full power of turbo was taking effect this made turbo cars very difficult to drive toleman team also used turbo engines for 1982 supplied by hart alfa romeo retained what motorsport writer doug nye has called most powerful three litre engine seen in formula one at that time with they tested their turbocharged v8 engine during practice for italian grand prix but did not race it until next season most foca teams however still relied upon cosworth dfv engine which had been introduced by lotus in in 1981 mclaren had built first car monocoque from carbon fibre composite this allowed for cars to be lighter while at same time being more rigid mclaren had proven that carbon fibre cars could be quick with john watson winning 1981 british grand prix but maybe more importantly watson s uninjured escape from a severe accident at that year s italian grand prix had shown superiority of material in terms of safety lotus followed suit for 1982 introducing carbon fibre for their lotus 91 even with these effective technical advances in chassis design foca constructor teams still using cosworth dfv were at a significant power disadvantage compared to turbocharged engines to counteract this non turbo teams used a loophole in regulations weight of car was measured before and after race with oil and cooling liquids allowed to be refilled before final weigh in teams would therefore build their cars lighter than allowed by regulations and added water tanks which they claimed were used to cool brake temperatures but in reality water was dumped on track as soon as car left pitlane allowing them to run faster keke rosberg later explained that water tank was one that gave us at least a theoretical chance to compete with in other regulation changes minimum weight of cars was reduced from to a new driver survival cell cockpit protection was made mandatory as well four companies goodyear michelin pirelli and avon supplied tyres including special qualifying tyres which provided much increased levels of grip during qualification sessions that determined starting order for race these qualifying tyres had originally been banned in but had since been for first time number of tyres permitted for qualification was limited to two sets per session creating a situation which villeneuve thought unnecessarily dangerous if i have only two chances to set a time i need a clear track ok if it isn t clear if there s someone in my way i just have to hope he s looking in his mirrors i mean i can t lift because this is my last chance necessity of having a clear track to make most of short lasting qualifying tyres led to drivers taking risks further increasing danger while driving during 1982 season season report pre season week before first grand prix of season in south africa going into race week itself testing for season was conducted at kyalami circuit alain prost set fastest time during testing at 1 05 71 almost eight seconds quicker than previous track record marc surer broke his feet during testing sessions and was due to be replaced by patrick tambay at arrows team jochen mass also crashed in his march 821 but escaped uninjured ferrari did not have their new car 126c2 ready for testing and ran an updated version of their 1981 vehicle instead brabham team were satisfied with progress of their new bt50 with turbo charged bmw engine championship opening rounds before start of season all drivers had received a letter from fisa containing an application form for a new super licence this new document stated that drivers would not be allowed to switch teams freely during course of season with their licence withdrawn should they do so additionally document forbade drivers from actions which might harm moral or material interests of formula one returning lauda was displeased by this and communicated with didier pironi head of grand prix drivers association gpda they contacted other drivers and ultimately six drivers refused to sign document those being lauda pironi villeneuve arnoux bruno giacomelli and andrea de cesaris on wednesday between testing and first practice session during a meeting of formula one commission pironi on behalf of drivers objected to licence application balestre reacted strongly excluding all drivers who had not signed from following day s practice session drivers in turn reacted by going on strike next day boarding a bus to a nearby hotel conflict continued until next day friday before race was set to take place it was partially resolved shortly before noon that day with drivers receiving half hearted assurances towards their demands they would ultimately be fined 5 000 each for strike with new super licence being scrapped following events in south africa gpda disbanded at a driver meeting in paris being replaced by professional racing drivers association when qualifying finally commenced arnoux took pole position from piquet with villeneuve and patrese on second row of grid at start arnoux led while piquet did not get away well and was overtaken by several cars including prost who jumped from fifth to second piquet and villeneuve retired early while prost took lead from his teammate arnoux on lap 14 he would lead until lap 41 when he punctured his left rear tyre forcing him to come into pitlane for new tyres he emerged in eighth place but with this fresh set prost was quickest driver on course allowing him to overtake relatively easily on lap 68 he once again took leading position from arnoux and went on to win race reutemann also overtook arnoux late in race and finished second with lauda in fourth place on his return to formula one racing teams then moved to brazil for second round brabham abandoned their turbo charged bt50 for now reverting to an updated bt49d for this race powered by cosworth dfv engine cars once again proved just how quick they had become when prost qualified on pole position 6 27 seconds faster than piquet had done year before villeneuve was second on grid and went into lead at start followed by rosberg with two renault drivers behind however rosberg fell back behind renaults on first lap and was overtaken by patrese on lap three and by piquet two laps later villeneuve led until lap 30 when he spun out this allowed piquet into lead closely followed by rosberg with two having battled for position during preceding laps order remained to finish with piquet winning from rosberg prost watson and mansell heavy strain posed onto drivers by bumpy circuit and hot humid weather was showcased not only by patrese retiring on lap 34 due to exhaustion but also when piquet fainted on winners rostrum following race both ferrari and renault protested first and second place

in long beach during saturday s qualifying lauda did just one run of a few laps setting a fast time that put him on top of leaderboard however in closing seconds of session andrea de cesaris bettered lauda s time clinching pole position for alfa romeo de cesaris had been ousted by mclaren for lauda over winter and was moved to tears by his accomplishment de cesaris led from start while lauda was overtaken by arnoux for second place on lap six giacomelli running fourth tried to lauda and in process hit arnoux forcing both to retire this allowed villeneuve into third place ahead of watson pironi and prost both retired after hitting wall on laps seven and eleven respectively on lap 15 lauda took advantage of de cesaris missing a gear change and moved into lead immediately beginning to pull away rosberg overtook villeneuve for third on lap 21 this turned into second place on lap 34 when de cesaris crashed into wall after his engine had failed order remained until chequered flag with lauda winning in only his third grand prix back in sport villeneuve was later excluded from results in long beach following a protest by ken tyrrell over ferrari s use of a double rear wing in week before next round san marino grand prix fia international court of appeal sided with ferrari and renault on their complaint over water tanks at race in brazil and disqualified piquet and rosberg handing victory to prost it was further decided that cars would now be weighed after race in condition in which they had finished eliminating cosworth powered teams use of water tanks to increase their performance notably however all other runners results from brazilian grand prix were upheld including john watson s who inherited second place even though his car had been as illegal as others foca teams requested a postponement of next race until july to allow consideration of effects of court s judgement on grounds that it changed regulations of sport race organisers refused to delay race which went ahead without majority of foca teams at this stage in championship prost led with 18 points six ahead of lauda with rosberg and watson sharing third position on eight points first european rounds with foca teams boycotting race san marino grand prix was run with just 14 cars present turbocharged renaults and ferraris were heavily favoured and arnoux duly took pole position ahead of prost with villeneuve and pironi on second row due to fast nature of imola track ferrari team boss mauro forghieri told his drivers to save fuel arnoux led from start while prost lost two positions to ferrari drivers on first lap he eventually retired on lap seven after some swaps of position with villeneuve and pironi arnoux pulled away but retired as well after 44 laps when his engine expired this left only ferrari drivers in a position to win grand prix their team held out slow signs from pit wall urging them to conserve fuel villeneuve who led understood this to mean that cars were to finish in current order pironi however attacked him and took lead on lap 46 and sped up pulling villeneuve with him who retook lead again on lap 49 they changed position three more times as villeneuve slowed down each time he took lead only for pironi to overtake him again eventually pironi won race and villeneuve was furious at his teammate for allegedly not following team orders after race he said people seem to think we had battle of our lives i was coasting those last 15 laps pironi said that slow sign means only to use your head not that if you think you can win don t do it in an interview following week villeneuve said that he would never speak to pironi again two weeks later paddock moved to zolder for belgian grand prix in qualifying villeneuve went out onto track on his second set of fast tyres which were already used and had only one more fast lap to go before falling off in performance on his flying lap he failed to better time of teammate pironi but instead of slowing down as drivers usually did on laps at end of which they were supposed to head back to pits villeneuve continued to drive fast it has been speculated that he was determined to beat pironi s time due to animosity between two it is however unclear if this is true with forghieri claiming that villeneuve had indeed planned to return to pitlane in any event villeneuve caught jochen mass travelling much more slowly through a left handed bend and moved to right to pass him at same instant that mass also moved right to let villeneuve through on racing line two collided and villeneuve was thrown out of his disintegrating car he died of a fractured neck in a local hospital at 9 12 that evening ferrari withdrew from race which john watson won for mclaren his teammate lauda who had finished third behind rosberg was disqualified after race for an underweight car results were dominated by returning foca teams even only finisher piquet s brabham bmw was from their number motorsport journalist nigel roebuck stated that next race monaco grand prix was a sombre edgy place sense of villeneuve s absence was overwhelming canadian had lived in principality and had won previous year s race in race itself arnoux led early on from pole position before spinning off handing lead to his renault teammate prost prost built up a massive lead but a light rain shower in closing laps triggered a chaotic finish prost crashed out handing lead to patrese patrese spun on penultimate lap and stalled allowing pironi into lead followed by andrea de cesaris on final lap pironi de cesaris and derek daly all dropped out because they ran out of fuel while in potential race winning positions meanwhile patrese bump started his car by coasting down a hill completed final two laps and took his first career victory pironi was classified second despite running out of fuel and stopping on last lap after race prost who had scored no points since brazilian grand prix in march led championship by one point from watson and two points from pironi north american rounds thumb defending champion nelson piquet pictured at british grand prix failed to qualify in detroit but won next race in canada alt sideview of a white and brabham racing car during a race next up was inaugural detroit grand prix which was marred by lack of track preparation delaying practice session on a circuit that had never seen a motor race before during shortened qualifying prost took pole position ahead of de cesaris with rosberg in third big surprise of day was defending world champion piquet who failed to qualify as his brabham bt50 had engine problems and spare car was not performing well either in race prost led comfortably until an accident between roberto guerrero elio de angelis and patrese led to race being suspended de cesaris had retired at this point and at restart prost led rosberg and pironi a problem with fuel injection slowed prost down handing lead to rosberg john watson who qualified just 17th on grid had his michelin tyres perform very well and overtook one driver after another until on lap 37 he went into lead as rosberg had gearbox issues watson won race from eddie cheever and pironi taking lead in world championship tragedy struck again at canadian grand prix pironi qualified on pole but stalled at start his stationary car was hit by osella of young italian riccardo paletti who competed in only his second race in formula one paletti suffered severe internal injuries and his car caught fire while track marshals tried to extract him from his vehicle he was pronounced dead upon arrival in hospital race was restarted and won by piquet in bmw powered brabham ahead of teammate patrese still in cosworth powered bt49d watson finished third to consolidate his lead in championship after canadian round watson was on 30 points ten ahead of pironi followed by patrese on 19 prost with 18 and rosberg with 17 points back to europe at dutch grand prix ferrari introduced patrick tambay as a replacement for villeneuve renault drivers once more locked out front row arnoux ahead of prost latter took lead at start followed by arnoux and pironi on lap two pironi overtook arnoux and three laps later moved ahead of prost into lead while prost retired with an engine failure arnoux was lucky to survive a heavy accident on lap 22 at tarzan corner his left front wheel broke off as he approached corner sending his car into tyre wall pironi won race without serious competition ahead of piquet and rosberg thumb left niki lauda won two races in his comeback season first in long beach then in britain pictured alt sideview of a red and white mclaren racing car during a race for next race at brands hatch british grand prix brabham had devised what they referred to as ploy inspired by prost s comeback drive at season opener at kyalami team planned to send out their cars with tanks only half full and softer and therefore faster tyres a pit stop midway through race was supposed to refuel car and change tyres giving brabham drivers advantage to be able to lap quicker than everybody else and gain enough of a lead to win in qualifying however rosberg surprised by taking only second and last non turbocharged pole position of season at start of warm up lap a fuel pressure issue led to his car being stationary his mechanics helped him to a push start but he did not reach field in time and had to start race last this handed front starting spot to patrese but he stalled both arnoux and fabi ran into him taking all three out on spot piquet as only remaining brabham left led from lauda but ploy was not to be executed as piquet retired with fuel injections problems on lap ten this left lauda to take his second victory of season followed by pironi and tambay pironi took over lead of championship now five points ahead of watson renaults were dominant at their home race french grand prix at circuit paul ricard arnoux qualified ahead of prost and with prost being better positioned in championship team decided that if cars should run first and second he should win arnoux did not honour agreement and took victory ahead of his teammate much to prost s dismay another heavy accident marred race as mass ran into back of mauro baldi at corner as mass s car slid towards barrier it was catapulted into grandstands full of spectators although several people had minor injures accident left no one dead or even seriously injured at this stage pironi led championship by nine points ahead of watson and was seen as likely favourite to win title at following event german grand prix at hockenheim pironi qualified on pole position however later in session he collided with prost s renault in wet conditions his car was thrown into air and while he survived impact he suffered severe leg injuries and would never compete in formula one again race took place with first slot on grid vacant brabham were again attempting to employ strategy of having their cars refuel and change tyres halfway through race piquet led comfortably when he collided with eliseo salazar while trying to lap him leading piquet to furiously hit and kick his competitor after he got out of car patrick tambay went on to win race for ferrari ahead of arnoux and rosberg who was now third in championship at austrian grand prix on osterreichring most turbocharged runners retired early leaving prost in lead only to retire with fuel injection issues five laps from finish this left elio de angelis and rosberg to fight out race victory with de angelis reaching finish line 0 050 seconds ahead to win his first ever grand prix grand prix also saw brabham drivers make it to their mid race pit stops for first time only for both to retire later on rosberg in turn achieved his maiden victory at next race swiss grand prix held at dijon prenois circuit renaults of prost and arnoux had qualified in front row rosberg consistently lapping quicker than all other drivers was held up by de cesaris but eventually found a way past him he overtook arnoux on lap 73 of 80 and prost on lap 78 to take lead and race victory in doing so he also took lead in championship at italian grand prix mario andretti returned to take over seat at ferrari left vacant by pironi and qualified in pole position race was won by arnoux leading home ferraris of tambay and andretti rosberg did not score points having finished eighth john watson meanwhile took three points for fourth place leaving him with a mathematical chance of winning title in case he won last race of season and rosberg failed to score last round and title decision at last race of season caesars palace grand prix in las vegas prost took pole position ahead of arnoux while arnoux retired prost was hampered by blistering tyres to finish fourth michele alboreto took a surprising victory for tyrrell watson finished second meaning that rosberg s fifth place finish was enough to secure
