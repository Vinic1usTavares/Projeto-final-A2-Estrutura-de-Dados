gameplay gameplay of age of empires iii asian dynasties followed a similar format to original game age of empires iii rather than introduce new methods of gameplay most changes were focused on introducing new content to game export is a special resource only available to three asian civilizations and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from consulate where player can choose a foreign ally or for japanese isolationism export is generated automatically when villagers are gathering but its gather rate is much slower than other resources making it challenging to afford a large foreign army export rate experience points are also generated by other means like sacred cows for indians and are specific to each civilization civilizations three new civilizations are added in age of empires iii asian dynasties each asian civilization has monks instead of explorers as in previous games these monks have ability of stun instead of sharpshooter attack as for european powers or nature friendship as in war chiefs there are six new native civilizations available for hire in asian dynasties they are sufis shaolin zen bhakti and jesuits india this civilization has no villager cards at home city but they receive one villager with almost every shipment all villagers that are not shipped from home city cost wood instead of food although this can be reversed with a home city card villagers are also not allowed to harvest livestock for food but instead can build a structure called a sacred field which generates experience points whenever livestock are tasked to it sepoys musketeers gurkha skirmishers and rajputs much like are primary infantry units and india has several types of camel cavalry and war elephants both of india s brahmin monks ride atop elephants and can heal other units from start of game their home city is delhi and their leader is akbar great china chinese get only one explorer a shaolin monk along with a weak disciple at start of game chinese monks and disciples have ability to occasionally land critical hits doing extra damage chinese monk is only asian hero who can train military units disciples during discovery age and has largest number of attack points compared to any other monk or explorer chinese monk also has unique ability to convert enemy units defeated by him into disciples although chances are low chinese have a higher population limit than all other civilizations up to 220 population points rather than usual 200 however to reach this cap several upgrades must be made additionally their military units are trained in blocks much like russians except that each block is made up by several types of troops meaning when player creates a block they receive a technically combat ready force chinese build villages rather than houses or shrines villages can garrison villagers and livestock given to them tasked to fatten more quickly these villages also supply 20 population their home city is beijing and their leader is kangxi emperor japan this civilization has daimyo and shogun units who can train troops like a military building japanese villagers cannot gather food via herding or hunting but can build shrines near and animals to gain a slow trickle of food wood or coin or experience once a certain shipment is sent from home city shrines also act as houses supporting 10 population units they have unique ability to ship most cards twice their starting explorers are two ikki archer monks that can be improved with extra attributes via shipment cards or upgrades at monastery monks start off with an ability called divine strike which can be used to finish off guardians or enemy units with less health japanese monks also have ability to build shrines which allows villagers to focus on gathering resources and building other structures their home city is edo and their leader is tokugawa ieyasu campaigns there are three new campaigns one for each new civilization furthermore these campaigns return to historical civilization based single player campaigns which are different from past campaigns in age of empires iii series each campaign consists of five new scenarios they are first campaigns in age of empires iii series to not revolve around fictional black family japanese campaign japanese campaign focuses on unification of japan beginning of which was also a scenario in age of empires ii conquerors establishment of tokugawa shogunate which players control and a young general named kichiro apparently when kichiro was a baby tokugawa ieyasu rescued him from ruins of his conquered village and raised him as his adopted son campaign begins when kichiro meets up with daimyo torii mototada who also narrates this campaign at siege of osaka transported from 1615 to 1600 to capture 5 year old heir of hideyoshi kichiro and mototada ally with local villagers and storm castle next they move to north east of honshu to destroy any villages that might support tokugawa s enemy uesugi and defeat uesugi s army after victory in which they suffer heavy losses mototada learns that tokugawa s main enemy ishida mitsunari is threatening mototada s estate at fushimi forcing mototada to return there meanwhile kichiro marches his exhausted army west again to take control of tokaido road trade route in aftermath of battle there a defeated samurai of oda clan tells kichiro that tokugawa has lied to him since his childhood angered kichiro kills samurai but nevertheless is still shaken by his words he returns to mototada at fushimi and asks him truth of his origins mototada tells kichiro that it was tokugawa who destroyed his home when he was a baby and sentenced his parents leaders of village to death though shocked by this revelation kichiro true to samurai code remains loyal to tokugawa and helps mototada at ensuing battle at fushimi after kichiro escorts non combatants to safety he is forced to leave mototada to fight alone as enemy breaches final defenses mototada commits seppuku detailing in his last statement importance of loyalty kichiro joins tokugawa at sekigahara after battle of sekigahara ends in victory for tokugawa kichiro makes up his mind and abandons his loyalty to his master and rides away through war torn battlefield forsaking his honor and shaming his family name for generations to come which mototada had foreseen chinese campaign chinese campaign focuses loosely on 1421 hypothesis and is about a chinese treasure ship discovering new world before christopher columbus story mainly focuses on jian huang a ming captain who has long dreamed of seeing outside world and his partner and new friend lao chen a large powerful and crude sailor who are given orders to help expand ming empire in initial release of game player s emblems and unit models are representative of qing empire despite being set in ming period in beginning treasure fleet is attacked by pirates while still under construction on orders of spoiled and selfish admiral jinhai nephew of unnamed emperor huang and chen save fleet and eliminate pirates fleet then embarks westward and is next seen to land in a port on coast of india there many of crew including huang and chen are attacked by soldiers of indian zamorin and flee with part of fleet to a nearby island where they set up a new base and mount a rescue mission to save jinhai and remaining crew who have been captured by zamorin s troops and as they discover some chinese defectors fleet continues west at jinhai s insistence although many ships turn back and eventually are cast ashore in yucatan by a storm chen and huang go to rescue crews of other ships from hostile aztec soldiers when they return they find that jinhai has disappeared huang suspects that he was captured along with many of fleet s crewmembers and mounts a rescue mission huang and chen cut through jungle and rescue many of their comrades but jinhai is not among them huang s small army of sailors then enters a nearby aztec city where they learn that jinhai has set himself up as an emperor or perhaps a god among aztecs and that it was jinhai who plotted with zamorin in india huang and chen escape an ambush by jinhai s soldiers and flee back to coast through a series of caves rescuing more of their crew along way once back at coast they set up a base and counterattack defeating and killing jinhai after battle huang chen and surviving crew members scour beaches for all evidence of their presence and then sail home to china hoping that no one will ever know they were there indian campaign indian campaign is about indian rebellion of 1857 and deals with a situation very similar to black s situation in warchiefs campaign shadow protagonist is subedar nanib sahir a portmanteau name of nana sahib a member of sepoy regiments who served british east india company who slowly becomes disillusioned by its cruel ways and abuse of indian citizens campaign begins with nanib and his superior colonel george edwardson regaining british control of saltpetre trade in punjab nanib and edwardson then march south to calcutta and defeat roving bands of arsonists there at close of battle nanib convinces a group of arsonists to lay down their weapons and leave but edwardson s men ambush and massacre them leaving nanib visibly shaken conflict of nanib s loyalty comes to a head when he and his men are ordered by colonel edwardson to use new enfield rifles despite cartridges greasing with beef tallow and pork fat which is a taboo to sepoys hindu and muslim beliefs nanib uses one of rifles to fire a near miss at edwardson loosely based on a similar incident involving mangal pandey killing one of his soldiers nanib and fellow sepoy pravar patel then lead their regiment of sepoy in an attack on local company fort by assaulting weapon caches to cause fires and explosions under its foundations after their victory nanib and pravar quickly rally local citizens and sepoys raising enormous forces although nanib denies leadership of revolt he and pravar decide to rescue bahadur shah ii from british captivity when shah declares himself supreme ruler of india they sneak into delhi in dead of night and destroy weapon caches to cause elephant which destroy various city gates along way they find more rebels who help them battle through delhi freeing shah and escaping into night nanib subsequently leads his forces in an assault on a company fort commanded by colonel edwardson nanib destroys or captures saltpetre sites and plantations supplying edwardson s forces inside fort and fends off three counterattacks finally he assaults fort and captures its outer defenses including fixed guns mortally wounding edwardson in process before destroying fort s command post when heat of battle fades nanib approaches a dying edwardson who threatens and curses indians saying that company is a much larger and more powerful force than all of india nanib replies by explaining that no military force can kill indians passion for their country after edwardson breathes his last breath nanib and pravar leave to begin a long and costly war against company and three rebel sepoys are seen lowering company s flag from nearby wonders thumb an age of empires iii asian dynasties screenshot featuring indian agra fort wonder in age of empires iii asian dynasties three new civilizations must build a wonder to advance from age to age instead of advancing from town center unlike previous age of empires games player does not achieve victory by building a wonder players can choose from a selection of wonders each having benefits unique to their civilization once built this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources while continuing to provide a benefit to player s civilization this initial bonus becomes larger depending on which age is being advanced to since wonder is a building players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it which affects speed of advancement wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt development in developing age of empires iii asian dynasties ensemble studios worked with big huge games for first time this partnership came about as a result of ensemble studios being busy with other projects including halo wars and big huge games real time strategy team with spare time on their hands several big huge games employees including brian reynolds had declared they were fans of age of empires series and thus they asked ensemble studios if two could work together on upcoming expansion two studios did large amounts of communication through internet and reynolds says entire process worked well ensemble studios took role of customer in their relationship with big huge games and thus game was designed to satisfy
