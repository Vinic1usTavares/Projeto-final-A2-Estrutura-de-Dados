girlfriend chrisann brennan he denies he is father of brennan s five year old daughter lisa brennan arrives with lisa to confront him she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth jobs bonds with lisa over her macpaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house apple co founder steve wozniak asks jobs to acknowledge apple ii team in his presentation but jobs feels that mentioning computer which he considers obsolete is unwise by 1988 following apparent failure of macintosh jobs has founded a new company next before next computer launch at war memorial opera house he spends time with 9 year old lisa but his relationship with brennan is still strained he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using lisa to get money from him wozniak arrives and predicts next will be another failure jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him and wozniak questions jobs contributions to computing history jobs defends his role as that of a conductor who directs musicians like wozniak apple ceo john sculley demands to know why world believes he fired jobs jobs was actually forced out by apple board who were resolute on updating apple ii following macintosh s lackluster sales jobs lambasted decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure despite sculley s warnings after hoffman and jobs discuss next s unclear direction she realizes that jobs has designed computer to entice apple to buy company and reinstate him by 1998 apple has fired sculley purchased next and named jobs ceo and jobs is about to unveil imac at davies symphony hall he is delighted by hoffman s strong commercial forecasts but furious that lisa has allowed her mother to sell house jobs bought for them hoffman reminds jobs that he threatened to

up at behest of hoffman jobs apologizes to lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father admitting that he is poorly made lisa watches her father take stage to introduce imac cast michael fassbender as steve jobs co founder of apple inc fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to jobs but stated that he was more interested in capturing jobs essence than his appearance in regards to how he aimed to depict jobs fassbender stated he aimed to depict jobs as a somebody who was passionate about his vision as opposed to a cruel person kate winslet as joanna hoffman apple and next marketing executive and jobs confidant in film when discussing her audition for film winslet later commented that she heard about it through a crew member who i happened to be working with in australia on dressmaker i didn t even care what role it was i just wanted to be in it found out nature of role googled hoffman found one picture of her got my husband to go to a wig shop buy a short haired dark wig stuck it on my head sent a photograph of myself to producer scott rudin danny boyle came to melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me part winslet spent considerable time with joanna hoffman to prepare for role before production began she noted that hoffman has a softness to her she came to america as a young woman and achieved a great deal one thing that was unique about her as a figure in steve s life was that she didn t need anything from him she just needed for him to be best version of himself and that s what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues winslet credits hoffman s difficult childhood that began in armenia with her ability to manage jobs on nature of relationship between hoffman and jobs winslet said that she and fassbender were able to develop as literally co workers i do believe it was very similar to relationship that steve and joanna had she was like his work wife she was head of marketing for macintosh and then she stayed with him for his working life she was an extraordinary feisty eastern european person who was pretty much only person who could actually knock sense into steve and she was also kind of an emotional compass in developing her sense of character winslet stated that she just wanted to please hoffman as much as i could how she sounds and her accent is fairly complicated she grew up largely in armenia spent some time in poland and has russians in her family so she has all three accents but she s been in america since she was a teenager so she had american rhythms you know she really has this accent that goes way up and down it s almost impossible to copy because of just how it becomes so i had to put it into my own register but we were all doing accents i mean michael s irish and he s playing steve jobs for god s sake finally winslet notes that hoffman did genuinely love jobs and spending time with her when i was figuring out how to play this difficult part she would become very emotional she misses him terribly seth rogen as steve wozniak co founder of apple and creator of apple ii rogen admitted to not being familiar with wozniak let alone knowing he was co founder of apple he met with wozniak to prepare for film specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking in regard to wozniak s relationship with jobs rogen stated that his feelings towards jobs were very complex and interesting part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between lines wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by rogen in film jeff daniels as john sculley ceo of apple from 1983 to 1993 katherine waterston as chrisann brennan jobs former girlfriend and lisa s mother michael stuhlbarg as andy hertzfeld a member of original mac team makenzie moss ripley sobo and perla haney jardine as lisa brennan jobs jobs daughter depicted her at different ages throughout film sarah snook as andrea andy cunningham manager of macintosh and imac launches adam shapiro as avie software engineer for next and later apple john ortiz as joel pforzheimer a journalist for gq who interviews jobs throughout film production development sony pictures acquired rights to isaacson s book in october 2011 hiring aaron sorkin to adapt it in november 2011 george clooney and noah wyle who previously portrayed jobs in 1999 tv film pirates of silicon valley were rumored to be considered for title role in may 2012 sorkin officially confirmed that he was writing script and had enlisted help of steve wozniak co founder of apple for historical accuracy sorkin later stated that his screenplay would consist of three 30 minute long scenes covering 16 years of jobs life sorkin developed screenplay around jobs relationship with a few key people apple co founder steve wozniak jobs right hand woman joanna hoffman former apple ceo john sculley original mac team developer andy hertzfeld and jobs first child lisa brennan jobs as well as her mother chrisann brennan sorkin had a chance to speak with all of them while developing screenplay including lisa who did not communicate with isaacson while he was developing his book however sorkin has stated that much of dialogue is fiction after sorkin s completion of script in january 2014 development on project began to heat up when david fincher entered negotiations to direct film with fincher selecting christian bale as his choice for jobs however in april 2014 fincher exited project due to contractual disputes danny boyle was then hired to direct with leonardo dicaprio in discussions for role in october dicaprio exited with bale matt damon ben affleck and bradley cooper being considered sorkin revealed in an interview that month that bale was once again cast in role with seth rogen entering negotiations to play wozniak and jessica chastain being considered for a part ike barinholtz revealed he had auditioned for role of wozniak in november bale again left project with michael fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him and scarlett johansson reportedly being offered a role before sony put project in turnaround and universal pictures acquired it following sony pictures entertainment hack in december 2014 sony emails were leaked which revealed casting demands as cause of delay in film s production also revealed in emails were details that tom cruise matthew mcconaughey and charlize theron were at one point met with to discuss potential roles in film natalie portman entered into negotiations for

thumb right 275px front entrance of de anza s flint center seen early in film during dialogue between fictionalized jobs and wozniak principal photography began on january 16 2015 at jobs s childhood home in los altos california with additional scenes shot throughout san francisco bay area production next moved to berkeley on january 23 24 2015 at la mediterranee a restaurant on college avenue in elmwood district on january 29 2015 filming continued at flint center de anza college location of original unveiling of macintosh in 1984 in late february production moved to san francisco and took place at opera house louise m davies symphony hall and civic center filming wrapped on april 10 2015 after an overnight shoot in san francisco bay area to distinguish each of three product launches depicted in movie danny boyle and cinematographer kuchler implemented three different film formats 16mm for 1984 35mm for 1988 and digital for 1998 they also wanted each of film s three time periods to visually reflect jobs own development at time for instance kuchler explains that filming at flint center de anza college for first act combined graininess of 16 mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional spontaneous look much in vein of how jobs is portrayed at that time third act shot with an arri alexa at davies symphony hall incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of jobs own design philosophies of imac and subsequent apple hardware kuchler describes his experience filming steve jobs as brilliant and challenging at same time and that goal was to make sure that visuals kept up with words in reference to production s collaboration between boyle and sorkin costume designer anne says real jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of launches turtleneck was off book decision in those 3 actual launches in real life he never wore that in 1998 portion of film in real life he was wearing a dark greyish brownish suit we made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it as we got closer to time of filming i thought we d set up rules for 1984 we d set up rules for 1988 there s so much of film that s about design and he was about design fassbender also remarked that historically inaccurate black turtleneck for third act was intentional believing that wearing attire felt like i had arrived at steve jobs vision that person had arrived fassbender later added that he and danny boyle decided on this look during filming and wanted to give audience kind of a payoff post production london based studio union created film s visual effects according to editor elliot graham extensive film editing took place even before principal photography was completed during one week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of three acts shot in chronological order graham worked on existing footage and received ongoing feedback from boyle in editing room in an interview with variety graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing shot frequency and providing enough visual interventions to control for sorkin s dialogue heavy screenplay he described approaching each scene as a series of fight sequences michael fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as jobs which graham and boyle then chose from during post production graham also said danny would be involved a lot but also take time away he would say if i m with you whole time we ll always have same opinions because we re on exact same journey music daniel pemberton composed music for film much like film s visual approach score is divided into three distinguishable sections each corresponding to intended feel of act in which section is heard you have first act which is analog pemberton explains you have second act which is orchestral and you have third act which is digital for first act s composition pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers in particular ones released no later than 1984 time first act takes place such as roland sh 1000 and yamaha cs 80 second act s score is more operatic in nature matching setting of san francisco opera house finally third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of 1998 imac product launch and pemberton correspondingly used his own imac to compose this section soundtrack also features songs by libertines bob dylan and maccabees maccabees grew up at midnight song that played during film s concluding scene was reportedly chosen by danny boyle himself who is a fan of band other songs were considered for final scene even pemberton s own score before song was chosen soundtrack was released digitally on october 9 2015 and in physical format on october 23 2015 release steve jobs premiered at 2015 telluride film festival on september 5 2015 and began a limited release in new york city and los angeles on october 9 2015 it opened nationwide in u s on october 23 2015 movie also served as closing film for 2015 bfi london film festival approximately one month before its release in uk on november 13 2015 steve jobs was released digitally on february 2 2016 and was released on blu ray and dvd on february 16 2016 and includes feature commentary from boyle sorkin and elliot graham physical releases contain a 44 minute making of documentary inside jobs making of steve jobs chronicling production of film reception box office steve jobs grossed 17 8 million in north america and 16 7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of 34 4 million against a budget of 30 million in its opening weekend in limited release film grossed 521 000 from four theaters for a per theater average of 130 250 beating out 67 000 for best average theater gross of 2015 film began its wide release on october 23 2015 alongside last witch hunter paranormal activity ghost dimension rock kasbah and jem and holograms over weekend film was originally projected to gross 11 12 million from 2 491 theaters however after grossing just 2 5 million on its first day it was revised to 7 4 million it ended up grossing 7 1 million finishing seventh at box office on november 10 2015 just over two weeks after its wide release universal pulled film from 2 072 theaters in united states variety said film suffered from fierce competition at box office possible public weariness with jobs and low profile of fassbender in title role and that underperformance at box office could hurt film s award chances after his film was pulled from wide release in u s danny boyle expressed disappointment at box office performance of steve jobs while suggesting that universal expanded film s release too wide too soon and that studio s move was arrogant critical response on review aggregator rotten tomatoes film holds an approval rating of 86 based on 305 reviews with an average rating of 7 65 10 website s critical consensus reads like tech giant co founded by its subject steve jobs gathers brilliant people to deliver a product whose elegance belies intricate complexities at its core on metacritic film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 based on 45 reviews indicating universal acclaim at cinemascore audiences gave film an average grade of a on an a to f scale todd mccarthy of hollywood reporter said boyle s electric direction temperamentally complements sorkin s highly theatrical three act study and praised fassbender in role who doesn t closely physically resemble man yet he fully delivers essentials of how we have come to perceive man justin chang of variety extolled film as a wildly creative fantasia a brilliant maddening ingeniously designed and monstrously self aggrandizing movie sasha stone writing for thewrap stated that fassbender gives a stunning knockout performance as jobs in a film that is a kind of talk opera which to some might seem to be sorkin overkill but same could be said for best of them david mamet edward albee paddy chayefsky and even william shakespeare sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as jobs himself left his eric kohn of indiewire gave film a b stating that cast vanishes into their parts buried under makeup and a distinctive polish accent winslet s transformation is bested only by fassbender whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel he also noted that boyle drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece benjamin lee of guardian gave film three out of five stars writing that despite film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is it s disappointingly difficult to truly care about what s taking place he blames sorkin s dominating script arguing that dialogue stifles and that actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own he also feels that while it is boyle s best film for years his direction plays second fiddle to a script that verges on a kind of apple sponsored hero joe of new york times who knew jobs well took issue with how little film has to do with flesh and blood steve jobs characterizing movie as pure fiction he went on to say in ways both large and small sorkin as well as michael fassbender actor who plays jobs has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense historical accuracy danny boyle film s director speaking on creative liberties he took with portraying steve jobs said it was what shakespeare used to do he would take some of facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of rest and just gotten away at actually getting at human in it and that s what s wonderful about writing i think is that it acknowledges people who disliked steve jobs people he hurt but in end he brings it back to a very simple father daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of most beautiful things in world john sculley praised jeff daniels portrayal of him but claims film misrepresented apple s success with mac and argues that jobs was much nicer than depicted bill atkinson denounced film as not truthful at all that wasn t his character and events didn t happen you think of jobs having a reality distortion field i think of aaron sorkin as having a history distortion field atkinson said that only thing he got right in that movie was spot on depiction of hoffman including her accent and how she tried to rein in steve from making an ass of himself steve wozniak who consulted with sorkin before he had written screenplay commented on a trailer released on july 1 2015 that he does not talk that way i would never accuse graphical interface of being stolen i never made comments to effect that i had credit genius taken from me lines i heard spoken were not things i would say but carried right message at least partly i felt a lot of real jobs in trailer although a bit exaggerated wozniak did not ask to see final script because he did not think that would be appropriate it is creative work of producer and writer and actors and director and others he also noted that trailer s reference to jobs initial rejection of his daughter lisa evoked an emotional response it was hard on me even being quiet when jobs refused to acknowledge his child when money didn t matter and i can almost cry remembering it in september 2015 after seeing a rough cut of film wozniak stated that he felt like he was actually watching steve jobs and others not actors playing them i give full credit to danny boyle and aaron sorkin for getting it so right in an interview with san francisco chronicle on february 10 2016 wozniak claimed that film s scenes between him and jobs never occurred in reality wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested jobs to acknowledge apple ii team onstage as was shown in movie however he added that jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards group when asked about accuracy of film s portrayal of jobs wozniak replied in real life to real people that s way he could be very sharp although never quite as much as in movie edwin catmull president of pixar animation studios and walt disney animation studios felt that jobs would be appalled at his depiction in film arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in picture in an interview with hollywood reporter catmull commented when jobs left apple he then entered into what really is classic hero s journey he s wandering in wilderness he s working with next it s not working he s working with pixar we re failing in that process steve learned some major lessons and he changed he became an empathetic person that aspect of change of steve was missed in a bloomberg west interview with emily chang on august 26 2015 andy cunningham called it a wonderful film it s an incredible character study of a really complex man aaron sorkin and danny boyle did a fabulous job with it her portrayal by sarah snook was a small role but professionally done film also portrays andy as participating in imac launch even though she was not working with apple at that time journalist walt mossberg compared steve jobs to orson welles film citizen kane which was loosely based on life of william randolph hearst mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well developed welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction in contrast according to mossberg who knew jobs for 14 years sorkin s decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction mossberg states that steve jobs portrayed in sorkin s film isn t man i knew sorkin chose to cherry pick and exaggerate some of worst aspects of jobs character and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature it would be as if you made a movie called jfk almost entirely focused on kennedy s womanizing and political rivalries and said nothing about civil rights and cuban missile crisis sorkin opts to end his story just as jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world changing products and to mature into a much broader kinder manager and person accolades steve jobs has received dozens of industry and critics awards film garnered four golden globe award nominations for best actor for fassbender best supporting actress for winslet best screenplay for sorkin and best original score for pemberton it won two for both winslet and sorkin on february 14 2016 winslet won bafta award for best actress in a supporting role both fassbender and winslet received academy award nominations for best actor and best supporting
