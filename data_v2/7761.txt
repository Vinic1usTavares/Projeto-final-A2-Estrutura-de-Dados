moa 2009 blg 387lb is an exoplanet in orbit of red dwarf moa 2009 blg 387l its discovery was announced on february 21 2011 making it eleventh planet discovered using gravitational microlensing planet is thought to be over twice mass of jupiter and to have an orbit 80 percent larger than that of earth s lasting approximately 1 970 days however its exact characteristics are difficult to constrain because characteristics of host star are not well known characteristics mass and orbit moa 2009 blg 387lb is a gas giant with an estimated mass 2 6 times that of jupiter s and a radius of 1 75 times that of jupiter and an estimated mean distance of 1 8 au from its host star it has an orbital period of approximately 1970 days although mass and mean distance of moa 2009 blg 387lb is estimated confidence intervals are very large indicating that there is a large uncertainty present these uncertainties are largely due to how exact parameters of host star are not known host star planet is only one known to be in orbit of star moa 2009 blg 387l which is an m type dwarf star that has a mass that is approximately 0 19 times that of sun star is located at an estimated 5700 parsecs 18 591 light years from earth star is named for microlensing observations in astrophysics group which saw star as a gravitational microlensing event in 2009 and combed data in hope of discovering a planet discovery moa 2009 blg 387 was a gravitational microlensing event detected by microlensing observations in astrophysics collaboration on july 24 2009 which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect which bends light and causes distorted but magnified images that can be interpreted detection of two were logged over next few days by south african astronomical observatory perth observatory and canopus hill observatory in tasmania with a separation of about seven days between caustic events on june 7 2010 long after microlensing event had subsided science teams studying star used naco adaptive optics facility at very large telescope in chile to determine actual apparent magnitude of star that its background star hoping to compare it to magnitude of star measured during microlensing event a discrepancy was found a discrepancy that may have been a result of either error or of a planetary body interpretation of follow up observations led to planet s confirmation ratio between planet s mass and its host star s mass is well constrained but a large interval of uncertainty exists because host star s mass is known within a large confidence interval that spans mass of all red dwarf stars discovery of planet moa 2009 blg 387lb was published on february 21 2011 in journal astronomy and astrophysics by european southern observatory references category hot jupiters category sagittarius constellation category giant planets category exoplanets discovered in 2011 category exoplanets detected by microlensing
