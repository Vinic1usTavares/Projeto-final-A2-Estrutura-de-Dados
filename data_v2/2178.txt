tropical storm gilda in 1973 was first documented tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone it formed on october 16 in western caribbean sea from a tropical wave and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h before striking cuba it later moved slowly through bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status on october 24 with assistance of a cold front off coast of eastern united states gilda transformed into a subtropical storm becoming very large and strong storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical ultimately dissipating near greenland storm first brought heavy rainfall to jamaica causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides while crossing cuba and later bahamas storm caused little impact limited to some crop damage as a subtropical storm gilda brought gusty winds and high waves to much of east coast of united states causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage storm history a tropical wave moved off west coast of africa on october 3 it tracked westward reaching caribbean sea on october 10 by october 13 a large area of convection persisted from hispaniola southwestward through panama and over next few days convection organized and concentrated in northwestern caribbean sea an anticyclone became established near jamaica on october 15 which created a favorable upper level environment for system by reducing wind shear around same time a low level trough emerged from intertropical convergence zone heading north off coast of nicaragua early on october 16 system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between central america and jamaica initial motion of depression was uncertain as steering currents could have resulted in a motion either to west or to north northeast with possibility of western track storm was remarked as being first serious hurricane threat for southern florida since hurricane gladys in 1968 however after formation depression moved slowly north northeastward thunderstorm activity gradually became better organized while rainbands increased around circulation by 0000 utc on october 18 depression attained tropical storm status about 100 mi 160 km northwest of cayman islands after which it was named gilda by national hurricane center nhc storm quickly strengthened as it moved toward southern cuba reaching peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h about 18 hours after reaching tropical storm status shortly thereafter gilda made landfall near border of present day cuban provinces of sancti spiritus and ciego de avila tropical storm gilda weakened slightly over cuba crossing island in less than twelve hours before emerging into atlantic ocean early on october 19 at time anticyclone over jamaica which previously assisted cyclone instead remained over caribbean which increased shear over storm this caused convection to gradually separate from low level circulation early on october 20 gilda passed just southeast of andros island in bahamas around same time that hurricane hunters recorded an atmospheric pressure of 994 mbar this was lowest recorded pressure in association with gilda while it was a tropical cyclone it gradually weakened due to wind shear resulting in low level steering currents becoming dominant after moving through exuma island chain storm passed near or over eleuthera and late on october 21 gilda became nearly stationary about 60 mi 95 km h east of harbour island late on october 22 after moving only about 6 mi 10 km in a 24 hour period gilda weakened to a tropical depression now a tropical depression gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward under influence of an upper level trough exiting east coast of united states cold air from trough interacted with gilda providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying and on october 24 storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between hispaniola and north carolina this made gilda first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone operationally tropical storm advisories were still issued on gilda while it was subtropical due to need to maintain consistency and possibility it could again become tropical circulation of storm became very large at one point stretching from new england to bahamas and eastward beyond bermuda or a diameter of more than 1300 mi 2100 km on october 25 gilda passed about halfway between bermuda and cape hatteras when it reached peak winds of 70 mph 110 km h subsequently it turned northeastward and on october 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical later that day gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of canadian maritimes as it moved over colder waters after passing just southeast of newfoundland storm continued northeastward becoming nearly stationary off coast of greenland before dissipating on october 30 preparations impact and records right thumb gilda as a subtropical storm near united states tropical storm gilda first affected jamaica bringing heavy rainfall in a three day period highest amount measured in a 24 hour period within jamaica was which triggered many landslides across eastern sections of island rains produced landslides particularly in saint andrew parish where six houses were destroyed elsewhere on island mudslides caused further property damage and left some roads six people were killed throughout country storm did not have significant impact in cuba a station in mountains of what was then known as oriente province recorded winds of 60 mph 95 km h city of moron located along northern coast of cuba recorded 6 13 inches 155 mm of rainfall in 6 hour period prior to storm passing area damage was minor limited to some crop damage in eastern portion of island as well as power outages threat of storm forced several thousand people to leave their homes in bahamas officials closed schools and many businesses closed early on day storm moved through country storm s stationary motion caused several days of high tides and heavy rains tropical storm force wind gusts were reported on andros island and gusts peaked at 75 mph 120 km h on golden cay gilda s passage left crop damage on several islands although monetary losses in country were minor when gilda was forecast to move near southeastern florida gale warnings were issued from north key largo to fort lauderdale rough seas affected florida coastline for about 72 hours causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion after becoming a large subtropical cyclone gale warnings were issued at various times from cape hatteras north carolina to mouth of merrimack river in massachusetts high surf and minor beach erosion were reported along coastline and gale force winds were observed from north carolina to new jersey over western atlantic ocean storm produced strong winds and rough seas one ship reported a wave height of 28 ft 8 5 m though no significant marine losses were reported around time of it becoming extratropical sable island off coast of nova scotia recorded a wind gust of 74 mph 119 km h tropical storm gilda was notable as being first observed tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone several subtropical cyclones have undergone tropical cyclogenesis but never opposite since gilda a few other storms accomplished feat in 1980 a tropical depression dissipated reformed as a subtropical depression and later became hurricane georges over open atlantic ocean next year tropical storm jose became subtropical near end of its duration and in 1984 hurricane klaus became a subtropical storm over western atlantic ocean in 2001 tropical storm allison after causing devastating flooding in texas became a subtropical storm over gulf of mexico and moved across much of southeastern united states in 2011 tropical storm lee transitioned into a subtropical storm while approaching louisiana see also other tropical cyclones named gilda external links gilda gilda 1973 gilda 1973 gilda 1973 gilda 1973 gilda 1973
