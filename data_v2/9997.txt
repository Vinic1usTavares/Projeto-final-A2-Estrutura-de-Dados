in early fourteenth century villagers from darnhall and over cheshire were in a major dispute with their feudal lord abbot of vale royal abbey over their bond condition cistercian abbey had been founded by edward i in 1274 as a result of a vow made after a rough channel crossing abbey was unpopular with locals from start as it was granted as part of its endowment exclusive forest and other feudal rights which local villages had come to see as their own moreover rigorous enforcement of these rights by successive abbots was felt to be excessively harsh villagers resented being treated as serfs and made repeated attempts to reject abbey s feudal overlordship villagers efforts ranged from appeals to abbot king s chief justice in cheshire and even to king and queen who may have been somewhat sympathetic they were repeatedly unsuccessful and were unable secure release them from their abbots for their part may have had significant financial pressures upon them vale royal had lost much of its royal funding following edward i s welsh campaign diverted both his money and masons from them and this may have accounted for their strict enforcement of their rights either way their tenants struggle turned increasingly violent from 1326 struggle was led by villagers of darnhall who conspired with their neighbours particularly those from nearby village of over on a number of occasions when their appeals failed they were subsequently imprisoned and fined by their abbot on one occasion villagers of darnhall and over followed their abbot across england in order to appeal to fifth abbot peter who was meeting with king in rutland appealing for royal assistance against his recalcitrant tenantry villagers met peter on his return journey an affray broke out a clerk of abbot s was killed and villagers captured abbot and his entourage king soon intervened and released him abbot then promptly had villagers imprisoned again abbot peter did not confine himself to confronting his serfs he seems to have acted in a similarly high handed fashion to local gentry and this resulted in peter s killing in 1339 background cistercian abbey of vale royal in weaver valley was originally founded by lord edward later king edward iii in 1274 in gratitude for his safe passage through a storm on return from his crusade originally intended to be a grand structure with a complement of 100 monks it soon fell victim to financing of edward i s welsh wars king s campaigns meant that both money and stonemasons were diverted from construction of abbey making not only its future expansion but current sustenance precarious new institution was unpopular in its locale as its existence and grants of land required locals claimed impinged on villagers customary liberties abbey was for example granted forestry rights and free warren of darnhall relations between abbey and its tenantry had thus since arrival of new monks also been precarious in 1275 only a year after abbey s foundation tenants of darnhall attempted to withdraw from paying abbot customs and services a position from which they would not withdraw but rather would push with increasing vigour for next fifty years they complained directly to king edward i and brought with them their iron king refused to countenance their position telling them that villeins you have come and as villeins you shall return they complained again in 1307 but again with no success an inquest into their situation held by justiciar of chester merely confirmed their bondage for them in 1320 during abbacy of richard of evesham one of his monks was attacked and a servant killed while collecting tithes in darnhall abbots were not just abbots they were also feudal lords and as such should not be assumed to be sympathetic landlords purely on account of their ecclesiastical position after all when their tenants appeared before abbot s manorial court they were not appearing before an abbot but before a judge and usual strictures of common law would apply dispute spread to neighbouring village of middlewich with villagers demanding relief from abbot of darnhall s immunities which were oppressive to them although villeins of vale royal s estate actually owed no labour service to their land villagers of darnhall and those that joined them were still angered by principle of their situation paul booth writes they were victims of ownership of their manorial estates from crown to a desperately under endowed religious corporation they were probably not alone theirs was not only dispute of its kind villagers from nearby middlewich also complained that abbey owed them restitution for loss of two salt pits which had been part of abbey s endowment similar disputes had broken out between other abbeys and their tenants too to south of london there was one such feud between tenants of tooting and bec abbey this had also gone from litigation to outright violence and law breaking and again had lasted many years likewise bec abbey s tenants in st george launched a thoroughly organised peasant s revolt in 1309 which also found some support amongst local gentry in east there was a similar tenant s revolt against abbot of bury st edmunds abbey in 1327 which were similar to later struggles of darnhall and over that abbey s chronicler jocelin of railed against all tenants who rose up against their lords claiming that they waxed fat against abbeys revolt of darnhall and over was thus one of many small uprisings before peasants revolt of june 1381 dispute in 1327 abbot drew up a for villages of darnhall and over clearly with intention of reinforcing claims upon those tenants which had historically been belonged to his abbey but which had not been enforced for some time following year a bitter struggle erupted in darnhall village was a manor of local cistercian abbey at vale royal and relations between abbot and his tenants had broken down ever since king edward ii had granted village to abbey villagers now abbot s villeins in historian richard hilton s words appear to have been fighting against a real social degradation it has been suggested that if abbey was as poor as has been assumed then this may account for monks having to be extra harsh landlords ultimately though it is impossible to be certain as to whether abbey was as locally as villagers claimed it is possible that previous earls of chester had been lax in their enforcement of serfdom and that two villages had got used to their relative freedoms it is also possible that it was monks who had been too lax in their enforcement and that villagers of darnhall and surrounding areas saw an opportunity to take advantage of them there were at least four occasions of emancipatory manumission without payment unusually taking place in vale royal records between 1329 and 1340 and one scholar has noted an element of irony in fact that one corporate body which is known to have liberated any native is also most distinguished for its rigid insistence on its legal rights over bondmen it would certainly appear case that monks approached duties with zeal but also that manumissions that did occur were insufficient to quell villagers ire either way two villages not only must have conspired together maliciously states abbey s own manorial roll but pooled mutual resources for their campaign would not have been cheap both travel and litigation cost money from writing of petition by clerks to their advisement on it by lawyers there was no such thing after all says edward powell as cheap litigation tenants resistance included refusing to grind flour at abbot s mill a rejection of their own bondage continuing efforts to prevent restrictions from abbot on leasing of their land and concomitant right to lease it out for up to ten years this resistance in 1328 led only to punishment in form of fines imprisonment and eventual submission abbey s ledger book records how in 1329 as they saw it rebellious tenantry plotted maliciously against abbey s liberty darnhall villagers had approached on first of many occasions cheshire justiciar claiming to have been granted their freedom by an royal charter although legal response is now unknown it was presumably unsuccessful as on their return to village they were thrown in gaol until they swore an oath to cease their complaints presumably this oath was under duress for they did so and were released only to send a delegation to king at this time in north on same matter it is unknown whether party ever reached king but it is known to have at some point ended up in a nottingham prison for some reason only narrowly avoiding being executed there as thieves this was followed by a petition before king in parliament at westminster which resulted in a new justiciar being sent to cheshire to hear their petition before he did however he read and had been immediately persuaded by abbey s royal charters as a result villagers were again returned to abbey for punishment abbey s recorder returned to logging similar complaints in 1337 when again tenants of darnhall and over conspired against their lords and endeavoured to gain their liberty recording how people firstly complained to chester justiciar then petitioned parliament and finally sent a deputation from among their own to present their case to king at windsor writer concluded they were behaving like mad dogs this was because even though by now abbey had asserted and reasserted its rights over them in court and had always received favourable judgements villagers of darnhall refused to accept their position refused payment of their customary dues and reignited argument furthermore when abbot peter attempted to collect monies owed him by confiscating villagers goods they merely decamped with them in 1336 abbot denied villages of over rights of admission of burgage in newly chartered borough this prompted over villagers to join with their neighbours from darnhall against abbey and tenantry relaunched their campaign against abbot they attempted to utilise law in their favour as hilton puts it they beset justiciar of cheshire king himself and even queen philippa in their search for redress of law indeed latter may actually have supported them according to all accounts peasants plotted by night extent to which abbot was held personally responsible is indicated by distances that villagers were willing to travel to confront him they went to extreme lengths on one occasion they travelled as far as rutland to hunt abbot down and ambush him attack on abbot peter abbot of day peter visited king edward iii at latter s royal hunting lodge at king s in june 1336 where he requested royal assistance in his struggle against his rebellious tenants as he passed village of exton he was set upon by what ledger author called a great crowd of country people of darnhall he was not necessarily in immediate danger indeed same author tells of how abbot own cellarer rushed mounted from rear of party like a champion sent from god to defend abbot it seems though that men of cheshire were then joined by some locals and that this resulted in abbot peter being ignominiously taken in course of struggle abbot groom was killed however his release and arrest of his captors was ordered by king following day peter was released and his captors were imprisoned in chains in greatest of misery in stamford curiously although villagers had killed a man in melee king soon released them from their chains even more surprisingly perhaps is fact that king subsequently wrote to abbot peter requesting that he return to his tenants property he had confiscated an order abbot ignored abbot did however reduce their subsequent ps10 fine to ps4 as they found abbot had sufficient political connections and influence in central government to stymie villagers suits early encouragement that hilton says they had received from various royal and official personages had clearly amounted to little abbot s legal victory did not assuage a serious undermining of his authority however as with any lord in middle ages when his authority was questioned by those of a lower social strata law would almost inherently find for him but notes hewitt it would also be idle to identify legality with justice it is certainly unlikely that abbey attained its near permanent favourable legal position without a fair amount of legal manipulation and chicanery villages resorted to further violence and in 1339 probably in course of raiding abbey s crops or outhouses they killed both abbot peter and his legacy despite its assertions of right abbey was never able to fully dominate its own estate or to prove itself as regional lord from which all other tenure relationships sprang abbots of vale royal continued to face disruption from populace almost up until time of abbey s dissolution by king henry viii in 1536 in 1351 they complained that they were so wrongfully annoyed and harassed in many other ways late fourteenth century edward black prince wrote to justice of chester that he believed abbots to be wrongfully annoyed and harassed in many ways by people of these parts justice is therefore to restrain any persons who from malice are going about to molest or annoy them and as late as 1442 abbot that when he attempted to travel to fawr ceredigion
