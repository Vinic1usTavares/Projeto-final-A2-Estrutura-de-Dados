limelight for over 100 years he returned to public consciousness around 1840 when william harrison ainsworth wrote a novel entitled jack sheppard with illustrations by george cruikshank popularity of

in white s row in london s spitalfields moore p 31 lynch para 2 he was baptised on 5 march day after he was born at st dunstan s stepney suggesting a fear of infant mortality by his parents perhaps

into a hedonistic whirl of drinking and whoring inevitably his carpentry suffered and he became disobedient to his master with lyon s encouragement sheppard took to crime in order to augment his legitimate wages his first recorded theft was in spring 1723 when he engaged in petty shoplifting stealing two silver spoons while on an errand for his master to rummer tavern in charing cross

knotted bed clothes to descend to ground level finding themselves in yard of neighbouring bridewell they clambered over 22 foot high 6 7 m prison gate to freedom this feat was widely publicised not

suggests that sheppard s legend was rooted in prospect of excarceration of escape from what michel foucault in folie et called grand great confinement in which unreasonable members of population were locked away and institutionalised linebaugh describes excarceration as growing propensity skill and success of london working people in escaping from newly created institutions that were designed to discipline people by closing them in london hanged pp 7 42 laws levelled at sheppard and similar working class criminals were a means of disciplining a potentially rebellious multitude into accepting
