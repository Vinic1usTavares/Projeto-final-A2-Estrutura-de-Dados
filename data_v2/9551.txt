cape fear shiner notropis is a north american species of freshwater fish in family cyprinidae it is endemic to central part of state of north carolina in southeastern united states and is only found in shallow streams of cape fear river basin fish is small and yellow with black lips and a black stripe that runs down middle of fish s side this shiner is normally found in mixed schools with other minnow species it is unique amongst its genus because it has elongated intestines that are specifically adapted to a primarily herbivorous diet it can breed twice a year and normally lives for only two or three years in wild males and females are normally similar in appearance but become different colors in spawning season this species of shiner was not discovered until 1962 shiner is critically endangered due to its small population size and threats to its habitat from dam construction and pollution it was first recognized as threatened in 1987 species has since undergone a successful captive breeding program and its status has been a significant factor in destruction of a dam that destroyed part of shiner s habitat however species is still limited to just five populations in wild and some experts believe that a single toxic chemical spill into cape fear river could wipe out entire wild population taxonomy cape fear shiner was only discovered in 1962 and described as a distinct species by franklin f snelson jr in 1971 specific epithet is derived from greek mekistos mekistos longest tallest or very long a superlative from mekos mekos length and cholas intestines or bile this fish belongs to carp and minnow family cyprinidae and within this family it belongs to genus notropis which includes a large number of eastern north american minnows cape fear shiner is unusual in its genus because its intestines are elongated and more convoluted than those of other notropis species a trait shared only by ozark minnow this feature better adapts shiner to a diet primarily of plant material it is superficially different from similar members of its genus because of angle and size of its mouth head shape eight anal fin rays and black edge on its lower lip it is also one of few notropis to have a black peritoneum its closest relatives are swallowtail shiner and sand shiner it has no subspecies description cape fear shiner is a small but stocky minnow of about 5 centimeters 2 in long with a maximum length of 7 7 centimeters 3 in it is mostly a silvery yellowish shade with a black stripe running down middle of fish s side to its caudal peduncle and a lighter stripe above this one scales are outlined in black shiner s fins are clear to yellow and moderately pointed dorsal fin s origin is over or slightly before pelvic fin s origin during spawning season males become more golden in color while females become more silvery cape fear shiner s snout is acute and rounded and has a black upper lip and a lower lip that has a thin black bar stretching across its margin upper lip always overhangs above lower lip shiner only has pharyngeal teeth teeth located on back of fish s throat on its gill arches similar to teeth of other omnivorous shiners cape fear shiner s eyes are moderately sized and on side of fish s head it has eight anal fin rays shiner s distinctive long dark intestines are coiled and visible through fish s belly wall and it also has a distinctive black peritoneum distribution and habitat thumb right 160px rocky river shiner habitat cape fear shiner is endemic to upper basin of cape fear river in north carolina s piedmont only five wild populations of this fish are known to exist these populations are found in freshwater deep haw and rocky rivers in chatham harnett lee moore and randolph counties largest of these populations is found where deep and rocky rivers meet during winter shiners may migrate from their shoals in main river channels to smaller tributary streams this shiner has smallest range of any notropis this minnow typically lives in clean streams over gravel cobble and boulder substrates especially where nearby water willows and are available to provide protection from predators shiner rarely ventures into water deeper than 0 5 meters 1 6 ft it has been observed in slow runs riffles and slow pools ecology and behavior cape fear shiner is often found swimming in mixed schools with other minnow species however it is never most numerous minnow in a mixed school it has been known to survive for six years in captivity but is believed to survive for only two or three years in wild cape fear shiner s intestines are adapted to help fish digest plants and they were initially suggested to be primarily herbivorous because of this adaptation however recent studies have shown that shiner eats a variety of both plant and animal matter it is known to eat detritus bacteria phytoplankton diatoms and algae shiner is threatened by numerous predators such as crappie bass and introduced flathead catfish however adult flathead catfish does not pose a significant threat because of differences in habitats of two species within river juvenile catfish which share same habitat as shiner may pose a larger threat this shiner spawns around may 15 when water temperature reaches 19 degc 66 2 degf a second spawning may occur in late summer both male and female change color while spawning and male develops a number of small tubercles along its upper body shiner generally moves to slower flowing pools to lay its eggs in rocky substrates eggs hatch after three days although young generally live off of their egg yolk for another five days juvenile shiners are often found in slow moving water particularly amongst large rocks in middle of a stream or in flooded channels and pools juveniles sexually mature after their first year conservation thumb right carbonton dam which threatened shiner s habitat until its destruction in 2005 cape fear shiner is only known from five different populations two of which are extremely small and run a high risk of extinction other three populations are more stable and are estimated to number between 1500 and 3000 individual fish that are reproductively viable cape fear shiner was recognized as endangered with critical habitat on september 25 1987 under endangered species act of 1973 since 1987 shiner has dwindled both in range and population this fish is also protected from being captured and traded by lacey act shiner is not believed to have had historically large populations this minnow has been endangered by dam construction on cape fear river which has led to flooding and destruction of its shallow water habitat small number of geographically separated populations may also threaten species genetic health although a 2004 study concluded that genetic diversity was still relatively high a deterioration of water quality due to pollution at some of sites has also threatened shiner experiments have shown that shiner is highly sensitive to contaminating chemicals and experts believe that wild population of this species can be wiped out by a single toxic chemical spill united states fish and wildlife service has been working to protect this species some of conservation methods used to protect this species include studying its biology in wild and donating 16 000 in 1998 to help maintain a captive population at north carolina zoo since first successful captive breeding in 1997 this species has bred easily in captivity an experiment was carried out in 2001 in which 900 captive bred shiners were released temporarily into wild to judge water quality at potential reintroduction sites in fall of 2005 work crews began removing carbonton dam which had destroyed part of shiner s habitat after work that removed dam finished in february 2006 lake fell back to its historic creek levels allowing cape fear shiner to expand its range back into several miles of river that was previously unsuitable for inhabitation because of dam in 2009 deep river s riverine and riparian habitat was surveyed to identify areas for protection or restoration references external links north carolina zoo captive breeding program us fish and
