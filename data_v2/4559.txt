andrew as was increasing presence of germans to his rear he requested support from adjacent 23rd battalion but this was refused by his brigade commander brigadier james hargest andrew used his battalion reserve to mount a counterattack with help of two matilda tanks but this failed following this he advised hargest that he may have to withdraw from point 107 if you must you must was reply accordingly andrew withdrew remaining units that he was able to contact as it happened most of his forward companies remained intact and after finding they had been abandoned were able to withdraw from point 107 withdrawal to positions of 21st and 23rd battalions came as a major surprise to hargest but instead of ordering an immediate counterattack he directed andrew take overall command of defences of 5th brigade and conceded airfield was lost once senior commanders became aware of situation they ordered that it be rectified despite a counterattack to recapture airfield mounted in evening of 21 may and into next morning maleme airfield remained in hands of germans and was a significant factor in allowing them to become established on crete andrew and surviving elements of his

criticised for his handling of action at maleme that ultimately led to loss of crete in private correspondence to davin kippenberger expressed view that andrew should have fought his battalion to last man andrew took offence at public criticism and his relations with kippenberger would be distant and cool thereafter as a result andrew was also reluctant to contribute to official history of 22nd battalion implying to its author that kippenberger would distort events as he believed he had with crete book andrew did have his supporters including former soldiers of 22nd battalion and bernard freyberg overall commander on crete did not blame andrew for loss of island lethargic and indecisive conduct of his brigade commander james hargest in early stages of fighting on island was also a
