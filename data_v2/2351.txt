thumb serbsky central research institute for forensic psychiatry also briefly called serbsky institute part of its building in moscow there was systematic political abuse of psychiatry in soviet union based on interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem it was called psychopathological mechanisms of dissent during leadership of general secretary leonid brezhnev psychiatry was used to disable and remove from society political opponents dissidents who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted official dogma see vladimir bukovsky judgment in moscow forthcoming spring 2016 chapter 3 back to future deportation or madhouse term philosophical intoxication for instance was widely applied to mental disorders diagnosed when people disagreed with country s communist leaders and by referring to writings of founding fathers of marxism leninism karl marx friedrich engels and vladimir lenin made them target of criticism article 58 10 of stalin era criminal code anti soviet agitation was to a considerable degree preserved in new 1958 rsfsr criminal code as article 70 anti soviet agitation and propaganda in 1967 a weaker law article 190 1 dissemination of fabrications known to be false which defame soviet political and social system was added to rsfsr criminal code these laws were frequently applied in conjunction with system of diagnosis for mental illness developed by academician andrei snezhnevsky together they established a framework within which non standard beliefs could easily be defined as a criminal offence and basis subsequently for a psychiatric diagnosis applying diagnosis anti soviet political behavior of some individuals being outspoken in their opposition to authorities demonstrating for reform and writing critical books were defined simultaneously as criminal acts e g a violation of articles 70 or 190 1 symptoms of mental illness e g delusion of reformism and susceptible to a ready made diagnosis e g sluggish schizophrenia within boundaries of diagnostic category symptoms of pessimism poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia psychiatric incarceration of certain individuals was prompted by their attempts to emigrate to distribute or possess prohibited documents or books to participate in civil rights protests and demonstrations and become involved in forbidden religious activities religious beliefs of prisoners including those of well educated former atheists who had become adherents of a religious faith was considered to be a form of mental illness that required treatment kgb routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing trials and to discredit dissidence as product of ill minds highly classified government documents which have become available after dissolution of soviet union confirm that authorities consciously used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent see some documents in according to commentary to post soviet russian federation law on psychiatric care individuals forced to undergo treatment in soviet psychiatric medical institutions were entitled to rehabilitation in accordance with established procedure and could claim compensation russian federation acknowledged that before 1991 psychiatry had been used for political purposes and took responsibility for victims of political psychiatry political abuse of psychiatry in russia has continued nevertheless since fall of soviet union and human rights activists may still face threat of a psychiatric diagnosis for their legitimate civic and political activities background definitions political abuse of psychiatry is misuse of psychiatric diagnosis detention and treatment for purposes of obstructing fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society it entails and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health based criteria many authors including psychiatrists also use terms soviet political psychiatry or punitive psychiatry to refer to this phenomenon in his book punitive medicine 1979 alexander podrabinek defined term punitive medicine which is identified with punitive psychiatry as a tool in struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but rather it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to serve of power psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression and soviet punitive psychiatry was one of key weapons of both illegal and legal repression as vladimir bukovsky and semyon gluzman wrote in their joint a manual on psychiatry for dissenters soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon deliberate interpretation of dissent as a psychiatric problem an inherent capacity for abuse psychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine diagnosis of mental disease can give state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in interest of detainee and in broader interests of society in addition receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive in a monolithic state psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without ordinary odium attaching to such political trials in period from 1960s to 1986 abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in soviet union and episodic in other eastern european countries such as romania hungary czechoslovakia and yugoslavia practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in eastern europe and former ussr damaged credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from international community psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across world when definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience as scholars have long argued governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease in many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions in soviet union dissidents were often confined in psychiatric wards commonly called psikhushkas psikhushka is russian ironic diminutive for psychiatric hospital one of first penal psikhushkas was psychiatric prison hospital in city of kazan a chronicle of current events no 10 31 october 1969 10 10 kazan special psychiatric hospital in 1939 it was transferred to control of nkvd secret police and precursor of kgb on orders of lavrentiy beria head of nkvd international human rights defenders such as walter reich have long recorded methods by which soviet psychiatrists in psikhushka hospitals diagnosed schizophrenia in political dissenters western scholars examined no aspect of soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in social control of political dissenters under stalin khrushchev and brezhnev as early as 1948 soviet secret service took an interest in this area of medicine one of those with overall responsibility for soviet secret police pre war procurator general and state prosecutor deputy minister of foreign affairs andrey was first to order use of psychiatry as a tool of repression russian psychiatrist pyotr also believed that in a class society especially during most severe class struggle psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive a system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at end of joseph stalin s regime punitive psychiatry was not simply an inheritance from stalin era however according to alexander gulag or chief administration for corrective labor camps was an effective instrument of political repression there was no compelling requirement to develop an alternative and more expensive psychiatric substitute abuse of psychiatry was a natural product of later soviet era from mid 1970s to 1990s structure of ussr mental health service conformed to double standard in society being represented by two distinct systems which co existed peacefully for most part despite periodic conflicts between them system one was that of punitive psychiatry it directly served authorities and those in power and was headed by moscow institute for forensic psychiatry named in honour of vladimir serbsky system two was made up of elite oriented clinics it was headed by leningrad psychoneurological institute named in memory of vladimir hundreds of hospitals in provinces combined elements of both systems if someone was mentally ill then they were sent to psychiatric hospitals and confined there until they died if his mental health was uncertain but he was not constantly unwell he and his testimonial from employers party and other soviet institutions were sent to a labour camp or to be shot when allusions to socialist legality started to be made it was decided to prosecute such people soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for regime such individuals were no longer tried in court instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane joint session october 1951 in 1950s psychiatrists of soviet union turned themselves into medical arm of gulag state a precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in soviet union joint session of ussr academy of medical sciences and board of all union neurological and psychiatric association took place from 10 to 15 october 1951 event was dedicated supposedly to great russian physiologist ivan pavlov and alleged that several of ussr s leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of time among them grunya sukhareva vasily raisa aleksandr and mikhail gurevich were guilty of practicing anti pavlovian anti marxist idealistic and reactionary science and this was damaging to soviet psychiatry during joint session these eminent psychiatrists motivated by fear had to publicly admit that their scientific positions were erroneous and they also had to promise to conform to pavlovian doctrines these public declarations of obedience proved insufficient in closing speech snezhnevsky lead author of session s policy report stated that accused psychiatrists have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in old anti pavlovian positions thereby causing grave damage to soviet psychiatric research and practice vice president of ussr academy of medical sciences accused them of diligently worshipping dirty source of american pseudo science those who articulated these accusations at joint session among them irina vasily oleg and snezhnevsky were distinguished by their careerist ambition and fear for their own positions not surprisingly many of them were promoted and appointed to leadership posts shortly after session joint session also had a negative impact on several leading soviet academic neuroscientists such as pyotr anokhin aleksey lina stern ivan and leon orbeli they were labeled as anti anti materialists and reactionaries and subsequently they were dismissed from their positions in addition to losing their laboratories some of these scientists were subjected to torture in prison moscow leningrad ukrainian georgian and armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged for a period due to this loss of personnel joint session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come pseudo science took control following a previous joint session of ussr academy of sciences and ussr academy of medical sciences 28 june 4 july 1950 and 10 15 october 1951 joint session of presidium of academy of medical sciences and board of all union society of and psychiatrists s school was given leading role 1950 decision to give monopoly over psychiatry to pavlovian school of snezhnevsky was one of crucial factors in rise of political psychiatry soviet doctors under incentive of snezhnevsky devised a pavlovian theory of schizophrenia and increasingly applied this diagnostic category to political dissidents sluggish schizophrenia incarceration of free thinking healthy people in madhouses is spiritual murder it is a variation of gas chamber even more cruel torture of people being killed is more malicious and more prolonged like gas chambers these crimes will never be forgotten and those involved in them will be condemned for all time during their life and after their death alexander solzhenitsyn psychiatric diagnoses such as diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia in political dissidents in ussr were used for political purposes it was diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents sluggish schizophrenia as one of new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate stifling of dissidents and was a root of self deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when doctors acted as a tool of oppression in name of a political system according to global initiative on psychiatry chief executive robert van voren political abuse of psychiatry in ussr arose from conception that people who opposed soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose sociopolitical system considered best in world diagnosis sluggish schizophrenia a longstanding concept further developed by moscow school of psychiatry and particularly by its chief snezhnevsky furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior weight of scholarly opinion holds that psychiatrists who played primary role in development of this diagnostic concept were following directives from communist party and soviet secret service or kgb and were well aware of political uses to which it would be put nevertheless for many soviet psychiatrists sluggish schizophrenia appeared to be a logical explanation to apply to behavior of critics of regime who in their opposition seemed willing to jeopardize their happiness family and career for a reformist conviction or ideal that was so apparently divergent from prevailing social and political orthodoxy snezhnevsky most prominent theorist of soviet psychiatry and director of institute of psychiatry of ussr academy of medical sciences developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria a carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non essential for diagnosis but symptoms of psychopathy hypochondria depersonalization or anxiety were central to it symptoms referred to as part of negative axis included pessimism poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms according to snezhnevsky patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to untrained eye thereby patients with non psychotic mental disorders or even persons who were not mentally sick could be easily labelled with diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia along with paranoia sluggish schizophrenia was diagnosis most frequently used for psychiatric incarceration of dissenters as per theories of snezhnevsky and his colleagues schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards as a consequence schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in moscow than in cities of other countries as world health organization pilot study on schizophrenia reported in 1973 city with highest prevalence of schizophrenia in world was moscow in particular scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to snezhnevsky and his colleagues patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in social sense their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society thereby sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as reform delusions perseverance and struggle for truth as viktor reported snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient develops a new principle of human knowledge drafts an academy of human happiness and many other projects for benefit of mankind in 1960s and 1970s theories which contained ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth and religious convictions were not referred to delusional paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications but soviet psychiatry proceeding from ideological conceptions referred critique of political system and proposals to reform this system to delusional construct diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and states with delusion of reformism were used only in soviet union and several eastern european countries on covert orders of kgb thousands of social and political reformers soviet dissidents were incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia a disease fabricated by snezhnevsky and moscow school of psychiatry american psychiatrist alan a stone stated that western criticism of soviet psychiatry aimed at snezhnevsky personally because he was essentially responsible for soviet concept of schizophrenia with a sluggish type manifestation by including other symptoms one can readily apply this diagnostic scheme to dissenters snezhnevsky was long attacked in west as an exemplar of psychiatric abuse in ussr leading critics implied that snezhnevsky had designed soviet model of schizophrenia and this diagnosis to make political dissent into a mental disease he was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis which could be bent for political purposes and he himself diagnosed or was involved in a series of famous dissident cases and in dozens of cases he personally signed a commission decision on legal insanity of mentally healthy dissidents including vladimir bukovsky natalya gorbanevskaya leonid plyushch mikola and pyotr grigorenko beginning of trend toward mass abuse from khrushchev to andropov campaign to declare political opponents mentally sick and to commit dissenters to mental hospitals began in late 1950s and early 1960s as vladimir bukovsky commented on emergence of political abuse of psychiatry vladimir boukovsky jugement a moscou robert laffont paris 1996 le goulag p 190 nikita khrushchev reckoned that it was impossible for people in a socialist society to have an anti socialist consciousness whenever manifestations of dissidence could not be justified as a provocation of world imperialism or a legacy of past they were self evidently product of mental disease in a speech published in pravda daily newspaper on 24 may 1959 khrushchev said thumb upright yuri andropov 1914 1984 a kgb chairman and general secretary of cpsu now available evidence supports conclusion that system of political abuse of psychiatry was carefully designed by kgb to rid ussr of undesirable elements according to several available documents and a message by a former general of fifth dissident directorate of ukrainian kgb to robert van voren political abuse of psychiatry as a systematic method of repression was developed by yuri andropov along with a selected group of associates andropov was in charge of wide ranging deployment of psychiatric repression from moment he was appointed to head kgb he became kgb chairman on 18 may 1967 on 3 july 1967 he made a proposal to establish a fifth directorate ideological counterintelligence within kgb to deal with internal political opposition to soviet regime directorate was set up at end of july and took charge of kgb files on all soviet dissidents including andrei sakharov and alexander solzhenitsyn in 1968 kgb chairman andropov issued a departmental order on tasks of state security agencies in combating ideological sabotage by adversary calling for kgb to struggle against dissidents and their imperialist masters his aim was destruction of dissent in all its forms and he insisted that positions of capitalist countries on human rights and their criticisms of soviet union and its own politics of human rights from these positions was just one part of a wide ranging imperialist plot to undermine soviet state s foundation similar ideas can be found in 1983 book speeches and writings by andropov published when he had become general secretary of cpsu implementation and legal framework on 29 april 1969 andropov submitted an elaborate plan to central committee of communist party of soviet union to set up a network of mental hospitals that would defend soviet government and socialist order from dissenters to persuade his fellow politburo members of risk posed by mentally ill andropov circulated a report from krasnodar region bukovsky archives 22 january 1970 pb 151 xiii a secret resolution of ussr council of ministers was adopted andropov s proposal to use psychiatry for struggle against dissenters was adopted and implemented in 1929 ussr had 70 psychiatric hospitals and 21 103 psychiatric beds by 1935 this had increased to 102 psychiatric hospitals and 33 772 psychiatric beds and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116 000 psychiatric beds in soviet union soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses between 1962 and 1974 number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222 600 to 390 000 bukovsky archives 22 february 1972 st 31 19 such an expansion in number of psychiatric beds was expected to continue in years up to 1980 throughout this period dominant trend in soviet psychiatry ran counter to vigorous attempts in western countries to treat as many as possible as out patients rather than in patients on 15 may 1969 a soviet government decree no 345 209 was issued on measures for preventing dangerous behavior acts on part of mentally ill persons this decree confirmed practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals with help of police or entrap them into coming to hospital psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution by end of 1950s confinement to a psychiatric institution had become most commonly used method of punishing leaders of political opposition in 1960s and 1970s trials of dissenters and their referral for treatment to special psychiatric hospitals under mvd control and chronicle of current events no 12 28 february 1970 12 2 trial of p g grigorenko cce no 13 28 april 1970 13 8 trial of ivan and other trials cce no 15 31 august 1970 15 1 trial of natalya gorbanevskaya came out into open and world learned of a wave of psychiatric terror which was flatly denied by those in charge of serbsky institute bulk of psychiatric repression spans period from late 1960s to early 1980s as cpsu general secretary from november 1982 to february 1984 yury andropov demonstrated little patience with domestic and continued brezhnev era policy of confining dissenters in mental hospitals examination and hospitalization political dissidents were usually charged under articles 70 agitation and propaganda against soviet state and 190 1 dissemination of false fabrications defaming soviet state and social system of rsfsr criminal code forensic psychiatrists were asked to examine offenders whose mental state was considered abnormal by investigating officers in almost every case dissidents were examined at serbsky central research institute for forensic psychiatry in moscow where persons being prosecuted in court for committing political crimes were subjected to a forensic psychiatric expert evaluation once certified accused and convicted were sent for involuntary treatment to special psychiatric hospitals controlled by ministry of internal affairs mvd of russian soviet federative socialist republic accused had no right of appeal right was given to their relatives or other interested persons but they were not allowed to nominate psychiatrists to take part in evaluation because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally credible before law according to dissident poet naum atmosphere at serbsky institute in moscow altered almost overnight when daniil lunts took over as head of fourth department otherwise known as political department previously psychiatric departments were regarded as a refuge against being dispatched to gulag now that policy altered first reports of dissenters being hospitalized on non medical grounds date from early 1960s not long after georgy morozov was appointed director of serbsky institute both morozov and lunts were personally involved in numerous well known cases and were notorious abusers of psychiatry for political purposes most prisoners in viktor nekipelov s words characterized daniil lunts as no better than criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on prisoners in nazi concentration camps indeed experimentation took place on patients including sleep deprivation and exposure to electromagnetic radiation for inducement of auditory hallucinations a well documented practice was use of psychiatric hospitals as temporary prisons during two or three weeks around 7 november october revolution day and may day celebrations to isolate socially dangerous persons who otherwise might protest in public or manifest other deviant behavior struggle against abuse in 1960s a vigorous movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in ussr political abuse of psychiatry in soviet union was denounced in course of congresses of world psychiatric association in mexico city 1971 hawaii 1977 vienna 1983 and athens 1989 campaign to terminate political abuse of psychiatry in ussr was a key episode in cold war inflicting irretrievable damage on prestige of medicine in soviet union classification of victims upon analysis of over 200 well authenticated cases covering period 1962 1976 sidney bloch and peter reddaway developed a classification of victims of soviet psychiatric abuse they were classified as advocates of human rights or democratization nationalists would be emigrants religious believers citizens inconvenient to authorities advocates of human rights and democratization according to bloch and reddaway made up about half dissidents repressed by means of psychiatry nationalists made up about one tenth of dissident population dealt with psychiatrically would be emigrants constituted about one fifth of dissidents victimized by means of psychiatry people detained only because of their religious activity made up about fifteen per cent of dissident patients citizens inconvenient to authorities because of their obdurate complaints about bureaucratic excesses and abuses accounted for about five per cent of dissidents subject to psychiatric abuse incomplete figures in 1985 peter reddaway and sidney bloch provided documented data on some five hundred cases in their book soviet psychiatric abuse true scale of repression on basis of available data and materials accumulated in archives of international association on political use of psychiatry one can confidently conclude that thousands of dissenters were hospitalized for political reasons from 1994 to 1995 an investigative commission of moscow psychiatrists explored records of five prison psychiatric hospitals in russia and discovered about two thousand cases of political abuse of psychiatry in these hospitals alone in 2004 anatoly prokopenko said he was surprised at facts obtained by him from official classified top secret documents by central committee of cpsu by kgb and mvd according to his calculations based on what he found in documents about 15 000 people were confined for political crimes in psychiatric prison hospitals under control of mvd in 2005 referring to archives of cpsu central committee and records of three special hospitals leningrad and chernyakhovsk hospitals to which human rights activists gained access in 1991 prokopenko concluded that psychiatry had been used as punitive measure against about 20 000 people for purely political reasons this was only a small part of total picture prokopenko said data on total number of people who had been held in all sixteen prison hospitals and in 1 500 open psychiatric hospitals remains unknown because parts of archives of prison psychiatric hospitals and hospitals in general are classified and inaccessible figure of fifteen or twenty thousand political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals run by soviet ministry of internal affairs was first put forward by prokopenko in 1997 book mad psychiatry bezumnaia psikhiatriia which was republished in 2005 an indication of extent of political abuse of psychiatry in ussr is provided by semyon gluzman s calculation that percentage of mentally ill among those accused of so called anti soviet activities proved many times higher than among criminal offenders attention paid to political prisoners by soviet psychiatrists was more than 40 times greater than their attention to ordinary criminal offenders this derives from following comparison 1 2 of all forensic psychiatric examinations carried out by serbsky institute targeted those accused of anti soviet activities convicted dissidents in penal institutions made up 0 05 of total number of convicts 1 2 is 40 times greater than 0 05 according to viktor struggle against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences we do not know how many secret services kept under surveillance held criminally liable arrested sent to psychiatric hospitals or who were sacked from their jobs and restricted in all kinds of other ways in exercise of their rights no objective assessment of total number of repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents difficulty is that required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive they are scattered between state archive of russian federation archive of russian federation state statistical committee archives of rf ministry of internal affairs mvd of russia fsb of russia rf general prosecutor s office and russian military and historical archive further documents are held in archives of 83 constituent entities of russian federation in urban and regional archives as well as in archives of former soviet republics now 11 independent countries of commonwealth of independent states or three baltic states baltics concealment of data according to russian psychiatrist emmanuil gushansky scale of psychiatric abuses in past use of psychiatric doctrines by totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed archives of soviet ministries of internal affairs mvd and health ussr health ministry and of serbsky institute for forensic psychiatry which between them hold evidence about expansion of psychiatry and regulations governing that expansion remain totally closed to researchers says gushansky dan healey shares his opinion that abuses of soviet psychiatry under stalin and even more dramatically in 1960s to 1980s remain under researched contents of main archives are still classified and inaccessible hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at serbsky institute during stalin s time are on shelves of highly classified archive in its basement where gluzman saw them in 1989 all are marked by numbers without names or surnames and any biographical data they contain is and inaccessible to researchers anatoly sobchak former mayor of saint petersburg wrote in ukraine a study of origins of political abuse of psychiatry was conducted for five years on basis of state archives a total of 60 people were again examined all were citizens of ukraine convicted of political crimes and hospitalized on territory of ukraine not one of them it turned out was in need of any psychiatric treatment thumb upright alexander yakovlev 1923 2005 head of commission for rehabilitation of victims of political repression from 1993 to 1995 a presidential decree on measures to prevent future abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at commission for rehabilitation of victims of political repression for this purpose anatoly prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and at request of vladimir naumov head of research and publications at commission emmanuil gushansky drew up report it correlated archival data presented to gushansky with materials received during his visits conducted jointly with commission of independent psychiatric association of russia to several strict regime psychiatric hospitals former special hospitals under mvd control when materials for discussion in commission for rehabilitation of victims of political repression were ready however work came to a standstill documents failed to reach head of commission alexander yakovlev report on political abuse of psychiatry prepared at request of commission by gushansky with aid of prokopenko lay unclaimed and even independent psychiatric journal zhurnal would not publish it moscow research center for human rights headed by boris altshuler and alexei smirnov and independent psychiatric association of russia whose president is yuri savenko were asked by gushansky to publish materials and archival documents on punitive psychiatry but showed no interest in doing so publishing such documents is dictated by present day needs and by how far it is feared that psychiatry could again be abused for non medical purposes in its 2000 report commission for rehabilitation of victims of political repression included only following four phrases about political abuse of psychiatry in 1988 and 1989 about two million people were removed from psychiatric registry at request of western psychiatrists it was one of their conditions for re admission of soviet psychiatrists to world psychiatric association yury savenko has provided different figures in different publications about one million up to one and a half million about one and a half million people removed from psychiatric registry mikhail provided figure of over two million people removed from psychiatric registry theoretical analysis in 1990 psychiatric bulletin of royal college of psychiatrists published article compulsion in psychiatry blessing or curse by russian psychiatrist anatoly koryagin it contains analysis of abuse of psychiatry and eight arguments by which existence of a system of political abuse of psychiatry in ussr can easily be demonstrated as koryagin wrote in a dictatorial state with a totalitarian regime such as ussr laws have at all times served not purpose of self regulation of life of society but have been one of major levers by which to manipulate behavior of subjects every soviet citizen has constantly been straight considered state property and been regarded not as aim but as a means to achieve rulers objectives from perspective of state pragmatism a mentally sick person was regarded as a burden to society using up state s material means without recompense and not producing anything and even potentially capable of inflicting harm therefore soviet state never considered it reasonable to pass special legislative acts protecting material and legal part of patients life it was only instructions of legal and medical departments that stipulated certain rules of handling mentally sick and imposing different sanctions on them a person with a mental disorder was automatically divested of all rights and depended entirely on psychiatrists will practically anybody could undergo psychiatric examination on most senseless grounds and issued diagnosis turned him into a person without rights it was this lack of legal rights and guarantees that advantaged a system of repressive psychiatry in country according to american psychiatrist oleg russia until 1993 did not have any specific legislation in field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law orders of ussr ministry of health in soviet union any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist in this case patient s consent or dissent mattered not duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on psychiatrist all of that made abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed political regime and that created vicious practice of ignoring rights of mentally ill according to yuri savenko president of independent psychiatric association of russia ipa punitive psychiatry arises on basis of interference of three main factors of science its breakaway from achievements of world psychiatry party orientation of soviet forensic psychiatry lack of legal basis total nationalization of mental health service their interaction system is principally sociological presence of penal code article on slandering state system inevitably results in sending a certain percentage of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination thus it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive but totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease according to larry root cause of problem was state itself definition of danger was radically extended by soviet criminal system to cover political as well as customary physical types of danger as bloch and reddaway note there are no objective reliable criteria to determine whether person s behavior will be dangerous and approaches to definition of dangerousness greatly differ among psychiatrists richard bonnie a professor of law and medicine at university of virginia school of law mentioned deformed nature of soviet psychiatric profession as one of explanations for why it was so easily bent toward repressive objectives of state and pointed out importance of a civil society and in particular independent professional organizations separate and apart from state as one of most substantial lessons from period according to norman a former president of world psychiatric association political abuse of psychiatry in former soviet union was facilitated by fact that national classification included categories that could be employed to label dissenters who could then be forcibly incarcerated and kept in psychiatric hospitals for treatment darrel regier vice chair of dsm 5 task force has a similar opinion that political abuse of psychiatry in ussr was sustained by existence of a classification developed in soviet union and used to organize psychiatric treatment and care in this classification there were categories with diagnoses that could be given to political dissenters and led to harmful involuntary medication according to moscow psychiatrist alexander danilin so called nosological approach in moscow psychiatric school established by snezhnevsky down to ability to make only diagnosis schizophrenia psychiatry is not science but such a system of opinions and people by thousands are falling victims to these opinions millions of lives were crippled by virtue of concept sluggish schizophrenia introduced some time once by an academician snezhnevsky whom danilin called a state criminal st petersburg academic psychiatrist professor yuri nuller notes that concept of snezhnevsky s school allowed psychiatrists to consider for example schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early delayed in their development stages of inevitable process rather than as personality traits inherent to individual dynamics of which might depend on various external factors same also applied to a number of other personality disorders it entailed extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish neurosis like psychopathy like schizophrenia despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with traditions of then soviet science snezhnevsky s hypothesis has immediately acquired status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry snezhnevsky s concept with its dogmatism proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis that carried a great danger any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia with all ensuing consequences it resulted in broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry however snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock according to american psychiatrist walter reich of dissidents resulted from some characteristics of soviet psychiatry that were distortions of standard psychiatric logic theory and practice according to semyon gluzman abuse of psychiatry to suppress dissent is based on condition of psychiatry in a totalitarian state psychiatric paradigm of a totalitarian state is culpable for its expansion into spheres which are not initially those of psychiatric competence psychiatry as a social institution formed and functioning in totalitarian state is incapable of not being totalitarian such psychiatry is forced to serve two differently directed principles care and treatment of mentally ill citizens on one hand and psychiatric repression of people showing political or ideological dissent on other hand in conditions of totalitarian state independent minded psychiatrists appeared and may again appear but these few people cannot change situation in which thousands of others who were brought up on incorrect pseudoscientific concepts and fear of state will sincerely believe that uninhibited free thinking of a citizen is a symptom of madness gluzman specifies following six premises for unintentional participation of doctors in abuses specificity in totalitarian state of psychiatric paradigm tightly sealed from foreign influences lack of legal conscience in most citizens including doctors disregard for fundamental human rights on part of lawmaker and law enforcement agencies declaratory nature or absence of legislative acts that regulate providing psychiatric care in country ussr for example adopted such an act only in 1988 absolute state paternalism of totalitarian regimes which naturally gives rise to dominance of archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice professional consciousness of doctor is based on almost absolute right to make decisions without patient s consent i e there is disregard for principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it fact in psychiatric hospitals of frustratingly bad conditions which refer primarily to poverty of health care and inevitably lead to dehumanization of personnel including doctors gluzman says that there of course may be a different approach to issue expressed by michel foucault according to michael foucault in his book madness and civilization documented history of using institutional psychiatry as a political tool researched expanded use of public hospitals in 17th century in france and came to conclusion that confinement was an answer to an economic crisis reduction of wages unemployment scarcity of coin and by 18th century psychiatric hospitals satisfied economic and moral demand for confinement in 1977 british psychiatrist david cooper asked foucault same question which claude had formerly asked viktor fainberg during a press conference given by fainberg and leonid plyushch when ussr has whole penitentiary and police apparatus which could take charge of anybody and which is perfect in itself why do they use psychiatry foucault answered it was not a question of a distortion of use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project in discussion confinement psychiatry prison foucault states cooperation of psychiatrists with kgb in soviet union was not abuse of medicine but an evident case and condensation of psychiatry s inheritance an intensification ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function foucault believed that abuse of psychiatry in ussr of 1960s was a logical extension of invasion of psychiatry into legal system in discussion with jean and robert foucault says that criminologists of 1880 1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language crime cannot be for criminal but an abnormal disturbed behavior if he upsets society it s because he himself is upset this led to twofold conclusions first judicial apparatus is no longer useful judges as men of law understand such complex alien legal issues purely psychological matters no better than criminal so commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for judicial apparatus and in this vein concrete projects were proposed second we must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick but at same time we must protect society against him hence comes idea of mental isolation with a mixed function therapeutic and prophylactic in 1900s these projects have given rise to very lively responses from european judicial and political bodies however they found a wide field of applications when soviet union became one of most common but by no means exceptional cases according to american psychiatrist jonas psychiatry has been playing a part in controlling deviant behavior for three hundred years vagrants originals eccentrics and homeless wanderers who did little harm but were vexatious to society they lived in were and sometimes still are confined to psychiatric hospitals or deprived of their legal rights some critics of psychiatry consider practice as a political use of psychiatry and regard psychiatry as promoting as vladimir bukovsky and semyon gluzman point out it is difficult for average soviet psychiatrist to understand dissident s poor adjustment to soviet society this view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it conformity reigned in soviet consciousness a public intolerance of non conformist behavior always penetrated soviet culture and threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low an example of low threshold is a point of donetsk psychiatrist valentine pekhterev who argues that psychiatrists speak of necessity of adapting oneself to society estimate level of man s social functioning his ability to adequately test reality and so forth in pekhterev s words these speeches hit point blank on dissidents and revolutionaries because all of them are poorly functioning in society are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements they turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into view that company breaks step and only they know how to help company restructure itself dissidents regard cases of personal as a proof of public ill being more such cases easier it is to present their personal ill being as public one they bite society s hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society unlike dissidents psychiatrists destroy hardly formed defense attitude in dissidents by regarding public well being as personal one psychiatrists extract teeth from dissidents stating that they should not bite feeding hand of society only because tiny group of dissidents feel bad being at their place psychiatrists claim need to treat not society but dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving mental health of its members after reading book institute of fools by viktor nekipelov pekhterev concluded that allegations against psychiatrists sounded from lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers according to response by robert van voren pekhterev in his article condescendingly argues that serbsky institute was not so bad place and that nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it but pekhterev by doing so misses main point living conditions in serbsky institute were not bad those who passed through psychiatric examination there were in a certain sense on holiday in comparison with living conditions of gulag and all same everyone was aware that serbsky institute was more than gates of hell from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in chernyakhovsk dnepropetrovsk kazan and that is not all their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs beatings and other forms of punishment many went crazy could not endure what was happening to them some even died during treatment for example a miner from donetsk alexey nikitin many books and memoirs are written about life in psychiatric gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting mentally ill as most vulnerable group of society had nothing on nazi euthanasia programs punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically recent history of ussr should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry issue remains highly relevant according to fedor kondratev an expert of serbsky center and supporter of snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed concept of sluggish schizophrenia in 1960s those arrested by kgb under rsfsr criminal code article 70 anti soviet agitation and propaganda 190 1 dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame soviet state and social system made up in those years main group targeted by period of using psychiatry for political purposes it was they who began to be searched for psychopathological mechanisms and therefore mental illness which gave grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent to debar him from appearance and defence in court and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of ministry of internal affairs trouble not guilt of soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical as a result of strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from exclusively scientific concept of marxism leninism this showed in particular in fact that soviet psychiatry under totalitarian regime considered that penetrating inner life of an ill person was flawed in this connection one did not admit possibility that an individual can behave in a different way than others do not only because of his mental illness but on ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience it entailed consequence if a person different from all others opposes political system one needs to search for psychopathological mechanisms of his dissent even in cases when confirmed correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia it did not always mean that mental disorders were cause of dissent and all more that one needed to administer compulsory treatment for it in special psychiatric hospitals what seems essential is another fact that mentally ill could oppose totalitarianism as well by no means due to their psychopathological mechanisms but as persons who despite having diagnosis of schizophrenia retained moral civic landmarks any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent kondratev says according to st petersburg psychiatrist vladimir pshizov with regard to punitive psychiatry nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for authorities because it is seemingly possible not to take into account an opinion by person who received a diagnosis therefore issue will always remain relevant while we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained same on spot reflexes as ukrainian psychiatrist ada korotenko notes use of punitive psychiatry allowed of avoiding judicial procedure during which accused might declare impossibility to speak publicly and violation of their civil rights making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can be based on a preconception moreover while diagnosing mental illness subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities at same time most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness german says uncertainty of diagnosis is prone to other than medical influence e g political influence as was case with soviet dissenters who were stifled by a psychiatric diagnosis especially that of sluggish schizophrenia in order to take them away from society in special psychiatric hospitals according to russian psychologist dmitry punitive psychiatry in soviet union was based on assumption that only a madman can go against public dogma and seek for truth and justice k fulford a smirnov and e snow state an important vulnerability factor therefore for abuse of psychiatry is subjective nature of observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by american psychiatrist thomas szasz and he mentioned that these authors who correctly emphasized value laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and subjective character of psychiatric classifications failed to accept role of psychiatric power musicologists drama critics art historians and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications however lacking state legitimated power over persons their classifications do not lead to anyone s being deprived of property liberty or life for instance plastic surgeon s classification of beauty is subjective but plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without patient s consent therefore there cannot be any political abuse of plastic surgery bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment what transforms coercion into therapy are physicians diagnosing person s condition an illness declaring intervention they impose on victim a treatment and legislators and judges legitimating these categorizations as illnesses and treatments in same way physician eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons as a form of treatment for both society and patient long before nazis came to power szasz argued that spectacle of western psychiatrists loudly condemning soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy psychiatric abuse such as people usually associated with practices in former ussr was connected not with misuse of psychiatric diagnoses but with political power built into social role of psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been dissidents it is contents and contours of dissent that has changed before american civil war dissent was constituted by being a negro and wanting to escape from slavery in soviet russia dissent was constituted by wanting to reform marxism or emigrate to escape from it as szasz put it classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as negroes was scientific in sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks but that did not prevent abuse of such racial classification because what we call its abuse was in fact its use collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what szasz calls therapeutic state a system in which disapproved actions thoughts and emotions are repressed cured through interventions thus suicide unconventional religious beliefs racial bigotry unhappiness anxiety shyness sexual promiscuity shoplifting gambling overeating smoking and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured as michael robertson and garry walter suppose psychiatric power in practically all societies expands on grounds of public safety which in view of leaders of ussr was best maintained by repression of dissidence according to gwen adshead a british forensic psychotherapist at broadmoor hospital question is what is meant by word abnormal evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as socially inappropriate if that is case social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by medical terminology and thereby becomes an individual s personal problem not a social matter according to russian psychiatrist emmanuil gushansky psychiatry is only medical specialty in which doctor is given right to violence for benefit of patient application of violence must be based on mental health law must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment while being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications patient should be accompanied by his relatives witnesses or other persons authorized to control actions of doctors and law enforcement agencies otherwise psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function it is police that must come to aid of citizens and is responsible for their security only later after appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken psychiatrist must respond to queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving issues of involuntary hospitalization sanity etc in russia all that goes by opposites psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions is involved in involuntary hospitalization state machine hides behind his back actually manipulating doctor police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by mentally ill after receiving information about their disease bodies of inquiry very often stop investigation and do not bring it to level of investigative actions thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for course of justice and by doing so serves as a source for and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by state machine and is accompanied by aggression against doctors which increases during periods of social unrest vladimir bukovsky well known for his struggle against political abuse of psychiatry in soviet union explained that using psychiatry against dissidents was usable to kgb because hospitalization did not have an end date and as a result there were cases when dissidents were kept in psychiatric prison hospitals for 10 or even 15 years once they pump you with drugs they can forget about you he said and added i saw people who basically were asleep for years us president ronald reagan attributed view that brutal treatment of soviet dissidents was due to bureaucratic inertia residual problems in opinion of moscow helsinki group chairwoman lyudmila attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is most significant factor in assessment of psychiatry during 1960 1980s practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in former ussr and eastern europe destroyed credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries when psychiatric profession is discredited in one part of world psychiatry is discredited throughout world psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in former ussr and in so called euthanasia program in nazi germany there is little doubt that capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned and sustainable pattern of mental life of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost director of moscow research institute for psychiatry valery krasnov says adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old interventions as emmanuil gushansky states today subjective position of a russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents attempt to understand patient and help him assess his condition such a position is related to constant subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry this fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry but also constant violence in totalitarian and post totalitarian society psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence is related to primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease while ignoring psychological existential and psychodynamic factors notices that modern russian psychiatry and structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting patient s right to an own place in life but at discrediting such a right revealing symptoms and isolating patient psychiatrist became a scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels he is feared is not confided is not taken into confidence in secrets of one s soul and is asked to provide only medications psychiatric labels or stigmas have spread so widely that there is no such thing as media that does not call a disliked person schizo and does not generalize psychiatric assessments to phenomena of public life word psikhushka entered everyday vocabulary all persons who deviate from usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill with an approving giggling of public not surprisingly during such a stigmatization people with real mental disorders fear publicity like plague vilnius psychologist oleg lapin has same point that politicians and press attach psychological psychiatric and medical labels he adds that psychiatry has acquired new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion formerly one could say you are going against god or god is with us now one can say i behave reasonably adequately and you do not behave in that way in 2007 alexander dugin a professor at moscow state university and adviser to state duma speaker sergei naryshkin presented opponents of vladimir putin s policy as mentally ill by saying there are no longer opponents of putin s policy and if there are they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination in moscow regional psychiatric newspaper of 2012 psychiatrist in violation of medical privacy and ethics publicized diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder which she in absentia gave sobchak a russian tv anchor and a member of political opposition and stated that sobchak was harmful to society robert van voren noted that after fall of berlin wall it became apparent that political abuse of psychiatry in ussr was only tip of iceberg sign that much more was basically wrong this much more realistic image of soviet psychiatry showed up only after soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over developments and in end entirely disintegrated it demonstrated that actual situation was much and that many individuals had been affected millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital based mental health service living conditions in clinics were bad sometimes even terrible and violations of human rights were rampant according to data of a census published in 1992 mortality of ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of general population by 4 6 times for age of 20 39 years by 3 4 times for age of 30 39 years by 1 5 2 times for age over 40 years larger values are for women according to robert van voren although for several years especially after implosion of ussr and during first years of boris yeltsin s rule positions of soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out storm and retaining their powerful positions they also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in structure of psychiatric services in russia on whole in russia impact of mental health reformers has been least even reform efforts made in such places as st petersburg tomsk and kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under putin brought them back under control throughout post communist period pharmaceutical industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform aiming to explore vast market of former ussr they used situation to make professionals and services totally dependent on their financial sustenance turned major attention to availability of medicines rather than that of psycho social rehabilitation services and stimulated corruption within mental health sector very much at turn of century psychiatric reform that had been implemented by franco in italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in russia with view of retrenchment of expenditures but when it became clear that even more money was needed for reform it got bogged down in same way reform of army and many other undertakings did russia is decades behind countries of european union in mental health reform which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them until russian society gushansky says is aware of need for mental health reform we will live in atmosphere of animosity mistrust and violence many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole as robert van voren supposes russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside city and do not want to have them in community despite 1992 russian mental health law coercive psychiatry in russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of soviet period in soviet union there had been an increase of bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents in 2005 russian federation had one of highest levels of psychiatric beds per capita in europe at 113 2 per 100 000 population or more than 161 000 beds in 2014 russia has 104 8 beds per 100 000 population and no actions have been taken to arrange new facilities for outpatient services persons who do not respond well to treatment at dispensaries can be sent to long term social care institutions internats wherein they remain indefinitely internats are managed by oblast social protection ministries russia had 442 psychoneurologic internats by 1999 and their number amounted to 505 by 2013 internats provided places for approximately 125 000 people in 2007 in 2013 russian psychoneurologic internats accommodated 146 000 people according to consolidated data of department of social protection of moscow and ministry of labour and social protection of russian federation it is supposed that number of beds in internats is increasing at same rate with which number of beds is decreasing in psychiatric hospitals lyubov vinogradova of independent psychiatric association of russia provides different figure of 122 091 or 85 5 places in psychoneurologic institutions of social protection internats per 100 000 population in 2013 and says that russia is high on europe s list of number of places in institutions vinogradova states that many regions have catastrophic shortage of places in psychoneurological internats her words point out to need to increase number of places there and to fact that independent psychiatric association of russia is forcing relocating mentally ill from their homes and psychiatric hospitals to psychoneurological internats 200px thumbnail right one of buildings of pavlov psychiatric hospital in kiev at his press conference in 2008 semyon gluzman said that surplus in ukraine of hospitals for inpatient treatment of mentally ill was a relic of totalitarian communist regime and that ukraine did not have epidemic of schizophrenia but somehow ukraine had about 90 large psychiatric hospitals including pavlov hospital where beds in its children s unit alone were more than in whole of great britain in ukraine public opinion did not contribute to protection of citizens against possible recurrence of political abuse of psychiatry there were no demonstrations and rallies in support of mental health law but there was a public campaign against developing civilized law and against liberalizing provision of psychiatric care in country campaign was initiated and conducted by relatives of psychiatric patients they wrote to newspapers yelled in busy places and around them behaved in unbridled way in ministerial offices and corridors once gluzman saw through a trolleybus window a group of 20 30 people standing by a window of cabinet of ministers of ukraine with red flags portraits of lenin and stalin and slogan coarsely written on white cardboard get gluzman psychiatry off ukraine activists of dissident movement far from nostalgia for past also participated in actions against changes in mental health system but in general it should be remembered that all these protest actions have been activated by nomenklatura psychiatrists whole ukrainian psychiatric system actually consists of two units hospital for treatment of acute psychiatric conditions and internat hospice for helpless chronic patients unable to live on their own and between hospital and internat hospice is desert that is why about 40 percent of patients in any ukrainian psychiatric hospital are so called social patients whose stay in psychiatric hospital is not due to medical indications a similar pattern is in internats a significant part of their lifelong customers could have lived long enough in society despite their mental illnesses they could have lived quite comfortably and safely for themselves and others in special dorms nursing homes halfway houses ukraine does not have anything like that 200px thumbnail left a barrack of a concentration camp seen from outside is of a type of buildings in which russian psychiatric hospitals have often been located 200px thumbnail left a barrack of a concentration camp seen from inside in soviet times mental hospitals were frequently created in former monasteries barracks and even concentration camps sofia dorinskaya a human rights activist and psychiatrist says she saw former convicts who have been living in a russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home has not touched many of hospitals and persons still die inside them in 2013 70 persons died in a fire just outside novgorod and moscow living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on windows no bedside tables often no partitions not enough toilets number of outpatient clinics designed for primary care of mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005 stigma linked to mental disease is at level of xenophobia russian public perceive mentally sick as harmful useless incurable and dangerous social stigma is maintained not only by general public but also by psychiatrists traditional values have endured attempt by western institutions to impose a positive image of deviant behavior for instance in spite of removal of homosexuality from nomenclature of mental disorders 62 5 of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in rostov region view it as an illness and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior psychiatrists sustain ban on gay parades and use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools child care centers and other public institutions chief psychiatrist of russia zurab in his 2013 interview to says that a part of cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder he counters remark that world health organization removed homosexuality from list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true homosexuality was continuously defined as a mental disorder by independent psychiatric association of russia in 2005 when its president savenko expressed their joint surprise at proposal by executive committee of american psychiatric association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western ngos and governments referred proposal to actions and stated that ideological social and liberal reasoning for proposal was substituted for scientific one in 2014 savenko changed his mind about homosexuality and he along with alexei succumb to pressure and in their joint paper criticized and referred trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to soviet mentality in 1994 there was organized a conference concerned with theme of political abuse of psychiatry and attended by representatives from different former soviet republics from russia belarus baltics caucasus and some of central asian republics made a report on situation within lithuanian psychiatric association where discussion had been held but no resolution had been passed yuri nuller talked over how in russia wind direction was gradually changing and systematic political abuse of psychiatry was again being denied and degraded as an issue of hyperdiagnosis or scientific disagreement it was particularly noteworthy that tatyana dmitrieva then director of serbsky institute was a proponent of such belittlement this was not so queer because she was a close friend of key architects of political psychiatry in early 1990s she spoke required words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in soviet union for discrediting intimidation and suppression of human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in st petersburg newspaper chas pik within country however in her 2001 book prava i alliance of law and mercy dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in western countries moreover book makes charge that professor vladimir serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that current generation is wrong to oppose regime in 2007 dmitrieva asserted that practice of punitive psychiatry had been grossly exaggerated while nothing wrong had been done by serbsky institute after that an official at serbsky institute declared patient vladimir bukovsky who was then going to run for president of russian federation undoubtedly psychopathic while speaking of serbsky center yuri savenko alleges that practically nothing has changed they have no shame at institute about their role with communists they are same people and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in past attorney karen agrees serbsky is not an organ of medicine it s an organ of power according to human rights activist and former psychiatrist sofia dorinskaya system of soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed serbsky institute is standing where it did same people who worked in soviet system are working there she says we have a situation like after defeat of fascism in germany when fascism officially collapsed but all governors of acres judges and all people remained after fascist regime in his article of 2002 alan a stone who as a member of team had examined pyotr grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979 disregarded findings of world psychiatric association and later avowal of soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in former ussr he asserted that it was time for psychiatry in western countries to reconsider supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in ussr in hope of discovering that soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation in stone s words he believes that snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics according to stone one of first points soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that revolution is greatest good for greatest number greatest piece of social justice and greatest beneficence imaginable in twentieth century in western view ethical compass of soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in service of this greatest beneficence according to st petersburg psychiatrist vladimir pshizov a disastrous factor for domestic psychiatry is that those who had committed crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because sphere of interests of this public has been reduced to making a business of drugs and taking possession of homes of ill in soviet times all heads of departments of psychiatry all directors of psychiatric research institutes all head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were cpsu nomenklatura which they remained so far representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped for one to two years he run errands as a resident then joined party and became a abbreviation expansion organizer of a party group his junior colleagues usually non partisan ones collected and processed material for his dissertation its review of literature particularly in a research institute for psychiatry was often written by patients because only they knew foreign languages and their party comrades were not up to it natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language robert van voren also says russian psychiatry is now being headed by same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in soviet times since then russian psychiatric system has not almost changed in reality we still see a sort of soviet psychiatry that was in late 1980s russian psychiatrists do not have access to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry staff training has not changed literature is inaccessible same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not same as what is happening in russia are silent and afraid powerful core of old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in moscow and it was clear that struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult but also it would be a waste of time energy and resources so global initiative on psychiatry has been avoiding moscow almost completely for all years instead global initiative on psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming mental health service in ukraine donated a printing plant to ukrainian public organized a publishing house helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free but ukrainian tax police accused publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars and a significant part of humanitarian aid that global initiative on psychiatry had gathered in netherlands for ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in kiev many of current leaders of russian psychiatry especially those who were related to establishment in soviet period have from their avowal read at 1989 general assembly of wpa that soviet psychiatry had been systematically abused for political purposes among such leaders who did so is aleksandr tiganov a pupil of snezhnevsky full member of russian academy of medical sciences director of its mental health research center and chief psychiatrist of ministry of health of russian federation in 2011 when asked whether ill or healthy were those examined because of their disagreements with authority tiganov answered these people suffered from sluggish schizophrenia and were on psychiatric registry according to tiganov it was rumored that snezhnevsky took pity on dissenters and gave them a diagnosis required for placing in a special hospital to save them from a prison but it is not true he honestly did his medical duty same ideas are voiced in 2014 interview by anatoly smulevich a pupil of snezhnevsky full member of russian academy of medical sciences he says what was attributed to was that he recognized healthy as ill it did not happen and is pure slander it is completely ruled out for him to give a diagnosis to a healthy person in 2007 mikhail vinogradov one of leading staff members of serbsky center strongly degraded human rights movement of soviet era in every possible way and tried to convince that all political dissidents who had been to his institution were indeed mentally ill in his opinion now it is clear that all of them are deeply affected people in 2012 vinogradov said same do you talk about human rights activists most of them are just unhealthy people i talked with them as for dissident general grigorenko i too saw him kept him under observation and noted oddities of his thinking but he was eventually allowed to go abroad as you know who bukovsky i talked with him and he is a completely crazy character but he too was allowed to go abroad you see human rights activists are people who due to their mental pathology are unable to restrain themselves within standards of society and west encourages their inability to do so in same year he offered to restore soviet mental health law and said it has never been used for political persecution human rights activists who claim it did in vinogradov s words are not very mentally healthy russian psychiatrist fedor kondratev not only denied accusations that he was ever personally engaged in soviet abuses of psychiatry he stated publicly that very conception of existence of soviet era punitive psychiatry was nothing more than fantasy of very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects this is slander which was previously used for anti soviet ends but is now being used for anti russian ends he says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror he calls allegations about terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of cold war as alexander podrabinek writes psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely kondratev are relatively indifferent to public s indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in soviet times and now they do not notice this public allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion in response to article by podrabinek kondratev instituted a suit against podrabinek under russian civil code article 152 on protecting one s honor dignity and business reputation according to valery krasnov and isaak official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged of their diagnostics and actions absence of acknowledgement and absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in ussr and especially in russia as russian american historian georgi writes after fall of communist regime no matter how some psychiatrists lean over backwards foaming at mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered that they did not give dissidents diagnoses sentences or that at least these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities no matter how doctors if one may call them so try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts it is in 2004 savenko stated that passed law on state expert activity and introduction of profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary based examinations and that serbsky center turned into complete monopolist of forensic examination which it had never been under soviet rule formerly court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts but now court only chooses an expert institution expert has right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by head of his expert institution and can receive certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years director of serbsky center dmitrieva was at same time head of forensic psychiatry department which is only one in country and is located in her center no one had ever had such a monopoly according to savenko serbsky center has long labored to legalize its monopolistic position of main expert institution of country ambition and permissiveness which due to proximity to power allow serbsky center to get in touch over telephone with judges and explain to them who is who and what is guideline although judges themselves have already learned it have turned out to be a considerable drop in level of expert reports on many positions such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in context of serbsky center efforts to eliminate adversary character of expert reports of parties then to maximally degrade role of specialist as a reviewer and critic of presented expert report and to legalize state of affairs lyubov vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes cannot speak in court and can do nothing against state experts on 28 may 2009 yuri savenko wrote to then president of russian federation dmitry medvedev an open letter in which savenko asked medvedev to submit to state duma a draft law prepared by independent psychiatric association of russia to address sharp drop in level of forensic psychiatric examinations which savenko attributed to lack of competition within sector and its increasing nationalization open letter says that level of expert reports has dropped to such an extent that it is often a matter of not only absence of entire sections of report even such as substantiation of its findings and not only gross contradiction of its findings to descriptive section of report but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about disinterestedness of experts arise according to letter courts in violation of procedural rules do not analyze expert report its coherence and consistency in all its parts do not check experts findings for their accuracy completeness and objectivity on 15 june 2009 working group chaired by director of serbsky center tatyana dmitrieva sent supreme court of russian federation a joint application whose purport was to declare appealing against forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against reports reason put forward for proposal was that appeals against expert reports were allegedly filed without regard for scope of case and that one must appeal against expert report only together with sentence in other words according to yuri savenko all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue of fact that they were infiltrated into sentence that is cynicism of administrative resources cynicism of power he says draft of application to supreme court of russian federation was considered in paper current legal issues relevant to forensic psychiatric expert evaluation by elena and sergei focusing on inadmissibility of appealing against expert report without regard for scope of evaluated case while talking about appealing against reports authors of paper according to lawyer dmitry mistakenly identify reports with actions of experts or an expert institution and justify impossibility of parallel examination and evaluation of actions of experts without regard for scope of evaluated case such a conclusion made by authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by experts of rights and
