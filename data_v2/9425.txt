paddlefish family polyodontidae are basal ray finned fish they have been referred to as primitive fish because they have evolved with few morphological changes since earliest fossil records of late cretaceous seventy to seventy five million years ago are exclusively north american and chinese there are six known species four extinct species known only from fossil remains three from western north america one from china and two extant species including american paddlefish polyodon spathula which is native to mississippi river basin in u s and critically endangered chinese paddlefish psephurus glades which is endemic to yangtze river basin in china chinese paddlefish are also commonly referred to as chinese swordfish or elephant fish paddlefish populations have declined dramatically throughout their historic range as a result of overfishing pollution and encroachment of human development including construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed natural flows resulting in loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas chinese paddlefish have not been seen since 2007 and may now be extinct for many of same reasons that have plagued american species morphology thumb general morphology of paddlefish during initial stages of development from embryo to fry paddlefish have no rostrum snout it begins to form shortly after hatching rostrum of a chinese paddlefish is narrow and sword like while rostrum of american paddlefish is broad and paddle like some common morphological characteristics of paddlefish include a spindle shaped smooth skinned scaleless body heterocercal tail and small poorly developed eyes unlike filter feeding american paddlefish chinese paddlefish are piscivores and highly predaceous their jaws are more forward pointing which suggest they forage primarily on small fishes in water column and occasionally on shrimp benthic fishes and crabs jaws of american paddlefish are distinctly adapted for filter feeding only they are ram suspension filter feeders with a diet that consists primarily of zooplankton and occasionally small insects insect larvae and small fish largest chinese paddlefish on record measured in length and was estimated to weigh a few thousand pounds they commonly reach and although american paddlefish is one of largest freshwater fishes in north america their recorded lengths and weights fall short in comparison to larger chinese paddlefish american paddlefish commonly reach or more in length and can weigh more than largest american paddlefish on record was caught in 1916 in okoboji lake iowa fish was taken with a spear and measured long and in girth a report published by j r harlan and e b speaker in iowa fish and fishing 1969 said fish weighed over world record paddlefish caught on rod and reel weighed and was long fish was caught by clinton in a 5 acre pond in atchison county kansas scientists once believed paddlefish used their rostrums to excavate bottom substrate but have since determined with aid of electron microscopy that paddlefish have electroreceptors on their rostrum s ampulla hair cells which are similar in structure to other lorenzini electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields which not only signal presence of prey items in water column such as zooplankton which is primary diet of american paddlefish but they can also detect individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton s appendages paddlefish have poorly developed eyes and rely on their electroreceptors for foraging however rostrum is not paddlefish s sole means of food detection some reports incorrectly suggest that a damaged rostrum would render paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise in addition to electroreceptors on rostrum paddlefish also have sensory pores covering nearly half of skin surface extending from rostrum to top of head down to tips of operculum gill flaps therefore paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health habitat and historic range over past half century paddlefish populations have been on decline attributable causes are overfishing pollution and encroachment of human development including construction of dams which block their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed natural flow and resulted in loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas american paddlefish have been extirpated from much of their northern peripheral range including great lakes and canada new york maryland and pennsylvania there is growing concern about their populations in other states chinese paddlefish is considered anadromous with upstream migration however little is known about their migration habits and population structure they are endemic to yangtze river basin in china where they lived primarily in broad surfaced main stem rivers and shoal zones along east china sea research suggests they preferred to navigate middle and lower layers of water column and occasionally swam into large lakes there have been no sightings of chinese paddlefish since 2007 and species is either very close to extinct or entirely extinct past attempts of artificial propagation for restoration purposes have failed because of difficulties encountered in keeping captive fish alive american paddlefish are native to mississippi river basin from new york to montana and south to gulf of mexico they have been found in several gulf slope drainages in medium to large rivers with long deep sluggish pools as well as in backwater lakes and bayous in texas paddlefish occurred historically in angelina river big cypress bayou neches river red river tributaries sabine river san jacinto river sulphur river and trinity river their historical range also included occurrences in canada in lake huron and lake helen and in 26 27 states in united states ontario ministry of natural resources listed paddlefish as extirpated from ontario canada under their endangered species act iucn red list lists canadian populations of paddlefish as extirpated noting there have been no canadian records since early 1900s and distribution in canada was highly peripheral as a species american paddlefish is classified as vulnerable vu on iucn red list and its international trade has been restricted since june 1992 under appendix ii of convention of international trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna or cites life cycle paddlefish are long lived and sexually late maturing females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old some even as late as sixteen to eighteen years old males begin spawning around age seven some as late as nine or ten years of age paddlefish spawn in late spring provided proper combination of events occur including water flow temperature photoperiod and availability of gravel substrates suitable for spawning if all conditions are not met paddlefish will not spawn research suggests females do not spawn every year rather they spawn every second or third year while males spawn more frequently typically every year or every other year paddlefish migrate upstream to spawn and prefer silt free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for rises in river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding they are broadcast spawners also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners gravid females release their eggs into water over bare rocks or gravel at same time males release their sperm fertilization occurs externally eggs are adhesive and stick to rocky substrate young are swept downstream after hatching and grow to adulthood in deep freshwater pools propagation and culture advancements in biotechnology in paddlefish propagation and rearing of captive stock indicate significant improvements in reproduction success adaptation and survival rates of paddlefish cultured for broodstock development and stock rehabilitation such improvements have led to successful practices in reservoir ranching and pond rearing creating an increasing interest in global market for paddlefish polyculture in a cooperative scientific effort in early 1970s between us fish wildlife service and its former ussr counterpart american paddlefish were imported into former ussr for aquaculture beginning with five thousand hatched larvae from missouri hatcheries in united states they were introduced into several rivers in europe and asia and provided first broodstock that were successfully reproduced in 1984 1986 in russia paddlefish are now being raised in germany austria czech republic and plovdiv and vidin regions in bulgaria reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989 and resulted in exportation of juvenile paddlefish to romania and hungary in may 2006 specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near prahovo in serbian part of danube river in 1988 fertilized paddlefish eggs and larvae from missouri hatcheries were first introduced into china since that time china imports approximately 4 5 million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in russia and united states some of paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production china has also exported paddlefish to cuba where they are farmed for caviar production classification there are two currently or recently extant genera in this family and four extinct genera polyodontidae
