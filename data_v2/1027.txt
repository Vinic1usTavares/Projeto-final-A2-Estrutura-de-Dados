30 5 cm sk l 50 imperial german navy gun nomenclature sk denotes that gun is quick firing while l 50 denotes length of gun in this case l 50 gun is 50 calibers meaning that barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter was a heavy german gun mounted on 16 of 26 german capital ships built shortly before world war i groner pp 23 30 groner pp 54 9 designed in 1908 it fired a shell slightly greater than 12 inches in diameter and entered service in 1911 when four s carrying it were commissioned into high seas fleet it was also fitted on four subsequent five s four s and three s guns were used to great effect at battle of jutland on 31 may 1 june 1916 when two derfflinger class ships and used them to destroy british battlecruisers and gun was eventually superseded in german naval use by much larger and more powerful 38 cm sk l 45 before world war i 30 5 cm sk l 50 guns were emplaced on islands of helgoland and wangerooge to defend germany s north sea coast one battery was emplaced during war to defend port of zeebrugge in occupied flanders guns on helgoland were destroyed by victorious allies at end of war but battery at wangerooge survived intact three of its guns were transferred to helgoland after island was in 1935 during second world war other three guns were transferred to france and employed in coastal defense positions along english channel specifications naval turrets 30 5 cm sk l 50 guns were mounted in twin gun turrets helgoland class ships used six drh lc 1908 mountings these turrets had thick roofs and thick sides groner p 24 later ship classes used improved designs kaiser class carried five drh lc 1909 gun houses while subsequent konig class carried five turrets of drh lc 1911 type primary improvement for lc 1909 turret was an increase in armor thickness of roof from 100 mm to 300 mm side armor remained same groner p 26 turret roofs on lc 1911 mounts were reduced to again sides remained at a thickness of 300 mm groner p 27 derfflinger and lutzow used four drh lc 1912 mountings while their half sister carried an improved drh lc 1913 type lc 1912 mounts had 110 mm thick roofs and 270 mm thick sides turrets on newer hindenburg had thickness of their roofs increased to though sides were same as in preceding lc 1912 type groner p 56 weights for gun houses ranged from 534 549 tons 543 558 metric tons variations depended primarily on thickness of armor in konig class ships each gun turret had a working chamber beneath it that was connected to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to magazine below turrets were electrically controlled though guns were elevated hydraulically in an effort to reduce possibility of a fire everything in turret was constructed of steel herwig p 70 this layout was also used in preceding battleships gardiner and gray pp 146 147 on derfflinger class battlecruisers two forward and superfiring rear turret used this configuration although rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted all of german gun turrets initially allowed for elevation to 13 5 degrees although after battle of jutland they were modified to allow elevation to 16 degrees centerline turrets on warships could train 150 degrees in either direction though wing turrets on helgoland and kaiser classes were limited to an arc of 80 degrees in either direction coast defense mounts left thumb a gun of batterie friedrich august on a bsg mount on wangerooge island island of helgoland received four twin gun turrets between 1909 12 although their exact type is unknown rolf 2004 p 186 battery kaiser wilhelm ii was built to protect port of zeebrugge in occupied flanders during world war i it consisted of four guns in concrete barbettes mounted on bettungsschiessgerust bsg firing platforms these manually powered mounts rotated on a pivot at front of mount and rear was supported by rollers resting on a semi circular rail they were equipped with a gun shield and capable of all around fire they were manned by sailors from naval artillery regiment artillerie regiment 1 by end of world war i six guns in bsg mounts equipped battery friedrich august on island of wangerooge three of these were transferred to helgoland after 1935 when hitler renounced treaty of versailles which had demilitarized island by 1938 they equipped battery von schroder and were manned by troops of second naval artillery battalion ii marine artillerie abteilung later 122nd naval artillery battalion 122 marine artillerie abteilung rolf 1998 pp 38 300 after french were defeated in 1940 all three guns were transferred to le near boulogne sur mer france where they assumed their former name of battery friedrich august rolf 1998 p 335 these guns were initially in open barbettes with 360deg traverse but these were later rebuilt into concrete casemates with overhead cover that could elevate to 50 degrees and train 220 degrees in either direction ammunition thumb right upright forward gun turrets these guns fired two types of shells during world war i armor piercing ap l 3 1 and high explosive he l 4 types during world war ii guns fired a wider variety of shells including armor piercing l 3 4 and l 4 9 types and high explosive l 3 8 l 5 and l 4 8 shells as well as specially designed coast defense artillery projectiles ap and he rounds weighed between 405 and 415 kg 915 lb while coastal artillery projectiles weighed only 250 kg 551 lb shells used during world war i used an rp c 12 main propellant charge that weighed 91 kg 201 lb and a smaller rp c 12 fore charge that weighed 34 5 kg 76 lb this gave guns a muzzle velocity of 855 meters per second 2 805 feet per second coast defense guns used rp c 32 charges that weighed 85 4 kg 188 3 lb for main charge and 41 6 kg 91 7 lb for fore charge after 1942 these were increased to 121 5 kg 268 lb rp c 38 for ap shells and 143 kg 315 lb rp c 38 for he rounds these shells were fired with a muzzle velocity of between 850 855 m s 2 789 2 805 ft s but lightweight coast defense shell had
