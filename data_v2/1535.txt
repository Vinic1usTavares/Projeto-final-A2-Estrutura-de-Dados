sided with massachusetts interests despite openly proclaiming neutrality in matter it was later discovered that he allowed illegal logging on crown lands by political allies his opponents led by

than 15 ships in spring of 1704 belcher s father sent him to london to cultivate business contacts of his own and to secure military supply contracts batinski p 2009 p 333 after forging relations based on his father s letters of introduction in london belcher traveled to netherlands to do same with dutch merchants and to begin a tour of western europe after seeing sights of rotterdam and amsterdam he traveled to hanover where he was received by electress sophia and met future king of great britain george duke of brunswick luneburg batinski pp 12 13 after calling on prussian court in berlin he returned to new england batinski pp 14 16 during these travels he was exposed to a variety of religious practices but found regular comfort in christian services most similar to calvinist leaning new england congregational church batinski p 12 he eventually came to see himself as a defender of that faith practice which permeated his political life batinski p x during years of war of spanish succession whose north american theater is also known as queen anne s war 1702 13 belcher s father was retained as a major supplier to provincial militia and served as province s commissary general belcher was involved in management of family s trading activities batinski pp 16 17 in 1708 he traveled again to london where he secured a major contract with admiralty before returning to massachusetts he once again traveled to hanover where he was well received at court batinski pp 17 18 war effort caused economic upheavals in massachusetts and belchers who stockpiled grain and other supplies for military use became a focus for popular discontent when food shortages arose late in war family s warehouses were targets of mob action and belcher was beaten by a mob on one occasion batinski pp 20 22 his own investments belcher s merchant interests included occasional trafficking in slaves peterson 2002 p 14 he is known to have owned slaves ordering them from his friend isaac royall sr he presented an enslaved indian to electress sophia on his second visit to hanover in 1708 peterson 2002 p 15 despite this he expressed a distaste for slavery writing in 1739 we have but few in these parts and i wish there were less allegro p 17 in addition to mercantile trade belcher family also had extensive land holdings in new england due to errors in early surveys of line between massachusetts and neighboring connecticut massachusetts in early 1700s gave lands in central portion of province to connecticut as compensation for survey errors which were in its favor when connecticut auctioned off these equivalent lands in 1716 belcher was one of buyers lands he was allocated were eventually incorporated as belchertown hyde p 5 belcher also inherited property from his father that was located in what is now wallingford and meriden connecticut he spent a significant amount of money in an unsuccessful attempt to profitably mine property for metal ores particularly copper gillespie and curtis pp 25 26 in 1714 belcher expanded his mining interests acquiring a stake in a mine in simsbury now east granby connecticut in 1735 he reported having invested ps15 000 in these ventures bishop et al p 508 which failed in part because under british law at time it was illegal to smelt copper in colonies necessitating costly shipment of ores to england phelps pp 13 14 he eventually established a technically illegal smelting operation simsbury site later used by state as a prison is now a national historic landmark old new gate prison and copper mine upon accession of king george i in 1714 andrew belcher sent jonathan to london seeking to capitalize on existing connection to new king batinski p 24 during this trip belcher engaged in recruiting for his properties in connecticut in addition to hiring an experienced metal refiner in england he also recruited german miners phelps p p 418 area near simsbury mine became known as hanover as a consequence of their presence phelps p 14 belcher had previously toured mines in harz mountains on his first visit to hanover agent and councilor thumb right belcher commissioned this engraved portrait when he was appointed governor of massachusetts and new hampshire colonies batinski p 50 colonel elizeus burges was commissioned as governor of massachusetts and new hampshire by new king barry p 104 belcher along with compatriot jeremiah dummer representing opponents of a land bank proposal that burges had promised to support bribed him ps1 000 to resign before he left england dummer and belcher were then instrumental in promoting samuel shute as an alternative to burges believing among other things that he was likely to be well received in new england because he was from a prominent dissenting family they also coached shute on political situation in province after he won appointment batinski p 25 shute arrived in boston on 4 october 1716 where he began a difficult and contentious tenure in office barry p 105 he signaled his partisanship by first taking up residence with paul dudley son of last appointed governor joseph dudley and a land bank opponent rather than acting governor william tailer kimball p 199 belcher was elected to massachusetts governor s council in 1718 during shute s tenure belcher was seen as part of a political faction that generally supported governor pencak p 78 he was consequently on and off council several times blocked by efforts of populist leader elisha cooke jr this struggle continued after shute left province at end of 1722 to prosecute his differences with assembly with privy council in london batinski pp 40 42 belcher however became increasingly unhappy that paul dudley wielded more influence than he did during administration of william dummer who was dudley s brother in law that followed batinski pp 42 p 319 when william burnet arrived in 1728 as governor belcher was unexpectedly elected moderator of boston s town meeting in an election apparently engineered by cooke in burnet s dispute with assembly over his salary which exceeded that of shute in its acrimony and occupied most of burnet s brief tenure cooke and belcher made common cause over issue batinski p 46 belcher was elected by assembly as an agent to london to explain colonial position on governor s salary and cooke helped raise funds needed for trip batinski pp 46 47 governor of massachusetts and new hampshire in 1729 while belcher was in london news arrived that governor burnet had died quite suddenly belcher lobbied for and was awarded job of governor of both massachusetts and new hampshire this was accomplished in part by bypassing board of trade and appealing directly to higher level ministers in government earning him enmity of powerful board secretary martin bladen who opposed his nomination batinski pp 49 50 in accepting appointment he was effectively promising to argue in colony in favor of position he had been sent to london to argue against during belcher s long tenure he served from 1730 to 1741 one of longer tenures of a massachusetts provincial governor he would argue with colonial politicians that he was acting in their interest while also working to convince london colonial administrators he was implementing their policies pencak p 62 historian william pencak writes that as a consequence by trying to keep on good terms with province and administration he lost respect of both pencak p 92 massachusetts thumb right upright despite being treated with indifference by belcher william shirley obtained political prominence and power later maneuvering to obtain belcher s removal from office in 1741 while he was in london belcher arranged for lieutenant governor dummer to be replaced by william tailer whose appointment to that post in 1715 he had ironically managed to supersede by lobbying for dummer s appointment and recommended that jeremiah dummer with whom his relations had become seriously strained be dismissed as colonial agent he was well received in massachusetts upon his arrival in 1731 but immediately began to purge opponents and their supporters from positions over which he had control this immediately put all on notice that he would freely use patronage power as a political weapon zemsky p 105 one early issue belcher took on was that of defending established church as an ardent congregationalist which was establishment in massachusetts he perceived as dangerous attempts of adherents of church of england in particular to gain exemptions from church taxes he was willing to countenance such an exemption for relatively modest number of quakers but refused to support one for more numerous and politically connected anglicans until it was apparent in 1735 that he would be instructed to do so batinski pp 66 67 his support of quaker exemption brought him a potent support base in that community in london batinski p 68 in 1735 belcher presided over a meeting in deerfield at which stockbridge indians agreed to accept congregationalist missionaries and authorized erection of a mission house batinski pp 68 70 mission house built c 1742 pursuant to this agreement still stands and is a national historic landmark mission house belcher also sought to improve business conditions in boston while on his tours of europe he had opportunity to witness comparatively orderly markets in dutch cities he used what he learned from those experiences to significantly reform previously chaotic markets of boston peterson 2009 p 336 his positive feelings towards prompted him to name boston s hanover street in their honor peterson 2009 p 367 new hampshire thumb right upright richard waldron was belcher s kinsman and right hand man in administration of new hampshire province belcher s administration of new hampshire started out friendly but rapidly turned sour he learned that lieutenant governor john wentworth had offered his support to samuel shute when governorship became available and consequently turned on entire wentworth clan in retaliation he took on as an ally and confidant richard waldron a bitter opponent of wentworths and a relative by marriage because john wentworth had during his long tenure as lieutenant governor established a large power base with both province s land owners and merchants this made him many powerful enemies biographer michael batinski theorizes that it was waldron s influence that drove belcher to strip many wentworths and their allies from patronage positions batinski pp 107 109 wentworth power base was also generally unhappy that new hampshire was tied to massachusetts with shared governorship and many resented fact that a massachusetts man occupied post batinski p 111 because of their influence new hampshire s assembly was hostile to belcher and his opponents were able to convince board of trade to appoint some of their number to provincial council over his objections batinski pp 113 114 belcher made repeated unsuccessful attempts to get sympathetic assemblies calling for elections ten times during his tenure intransigent legislatures refused to enact his legislative proposals daniell pp 204 205 belcher was disheartened when david dunbar was appointed lieutenant governor of new hampshire after john wentworth died in december 1730 dunbar who was friendly with wentworths was also king s surveyor responsible for identifying trees suitable for use as ship masts and ensuring no illegal logging was taking place on lands in all of northern new england this work was in opposition to a significant number of belcher s supporters who engaged in illegal logging on those lands behavior explicitly by governor belcher took all steps possible to ensure dunbar could not exercise any significant powers refusing to seat him on council and making frequent trips from boston to portsmouth to exercise his authority personally daniell p 205 two men disliked one another and dunbar began moving supporters in london to lobby for belcher s replacement not long after his appointment in 1731 batinski pp 112 114 illegal logging activity by belcher s allies eventually came to attention of william shirley crown advocate of provincial admiralty court whose patron was powerful duke of newcastle batinski p 130 boundary dispute belcher was unwilling to resolve longstanding boundary disputes between new hampshire and massachusetts disputed territory included areas west of merrimack river from its great bend near present day chelmsford massachusetts to present day concord new hampshire competing grantees from two provinces were by 1730s engaging in increasingly tense legal action and petty violence against each other daniell p 135 despite claims that he was neutral on matter belcher orchestrated affairs to prefer settlement of lands north and west of merrimack river by massachusetts residents dispute eventually reached highest levels of government and court in england new hampshire s advocates for separation from massachusetts found an able spokesman in john thomlinson a london merchant with logging interests who in 1737 convinced board of trade to establish a commission on boundary issue zemsky pp 113 p 120 despite belcher s attempts to orchestrate legislative proceedings to advantage of massachusetts for example allowing new hampshire assembly only one day to prepare a case on dispute while that of massachusetts had several months final ruling on boundary issued in 1739 went significantly in new hampshire s favor batinski pp 121 122 133 united opposition thumb right upright samuel waldo a wealthy massachusetts businessman with considerable interests in logging objected to practice of illegal logging on crown lands permitted by belcher during his tenure as governor by 1736 representatives of belcher s many political enemies began to coalesce into a unified opposition in london william shirley who sought a more lucrative position sent his wife to london to lobby on his behalf making common cause with samuel waldo a wealthy lumber baron whose supply contracts with royal navy were harmed by belcher s support of illegal logging zemsky pp 108 109 113 david dunbar resigned as lieutenant governor in 1737 and went to london where he provided documentation of logging practices these forces united with thomlinson in an effort to orchestrate replacement of belcher preferably with shirley in massachusetts and benning wentworth in new hampshire batinski pp 120 124 matters became more complicated in 1739 due to london politics and a currency crisis in massachusetts belcher had been ordered to effect retirement of a large amount of massachusetts paper currency by 1741 and legislation to accomplish this was rejected by board of trade leading to introduction of competing banking proposals in province one faction dominated by landowners proposed a land bank while merchants proposed a bank that would issue silver backed paper zemsky pp 114 119 proposals polarized massachusetts political establishment and belcher was unable to take sides for fear of alienating supporters on either side he instead sought without success to browbeat assembly into passing a currency retirement scheme acceptable to london in 1740 elections land bank supporters swept into office and bank began issuing notes zemsky pp 119 121 merchant interests opposed to land bank began widespread lobbying in london for parliamentary pp 142 143 which came in 1741 when it passed legislation extending 1720 bubble act which disallowed unchartered companies to colonies zemsky p 130 likely abetted by john thomlinson batinski p 143 while this crisis brewed in massachusetts ascendant duke of newcastle successfully pressured prime minister robert walpole to declare war on spain in 1739 batinski p 133 part of war strategy involved raising of provincial forces to assist in operations against spanish holdings in west indies belcher who was expected to raise about 400 men promised to raise 1 000 but was only able to raise about 500 in massachusetts and not even 100 he had promised from new hampshire batinski pp 139 140 this was due in part on reluctance of extra companies to travel to caribbean without assurances of pay and supply foster p 194 belcher also in pursuit of financial agenda vetoed bills to issue currency with which to fund militia that were raised batinski p 141 exact reasons for belcher s dismissal have been a recurring subject of scholarly interest due to many colonial imperial and political factors at play foster p 180 documents at least seven scholarly approaches to subject including batinski and zemsky referenced here two principal themes within these analyses are belcher s acquisition of many local enemies and idea that good imperial governance in london eventually required his replacement foster p 181 before issues of 1739 most of efforts to unseat belcher had failed belcher himself noted that year that warr i am d in is carrying on in much same manner as for 9 years past foster p 188 historian stephen foster further notes that someone as powerful as newcastle was at time generally had much weightier issues to deal with than arbitrating colonial politics in this instance however imperial and colonial considerations coincided over need for massachusetts to provide a significant number of troops for newcastle s proposed west indies expedition foster pp 189 190 in april 1740 newcastle in effect offered shirley opportunity to prove in light of belcher s political difficulties that he could more effectively raise troops than governor could foster p 190 shirley consequently engaged in recruiting principally outside massachusetts where belcher had refused his offers of assistance understanding what was going on and deluged newcastle with documentation of his successes while belcher was preoccupied with banking crisis wood pp 84 pp 194 197 newcastle handed issue off to martin bladen secretary to board of trade and a known belcher opponent board of trade then apparently decided based on weight of evidence that belcher needed to be replaced foster pp 197 198 in april 1741 privy council approved william shirley s commission as governor of massachusetts and benning wentworth s commission as governor of new hampshire was issued following june wood p p 153 governor of new jersey thumb left upright belcher became influenced by theology and preaching of several evangelical clergymen including george whitefield pictured here who were affiliated with great awakening fact that he had been supplanted by shirley came as a surprise to belcher he had expected to lose new hampshire governorship but was shocked when news of shirley s commissioning arrived schutz p 40 following shirley s inauguration belcher retired to his milton estate seemingly restless and in some financial need he expressed weak interest in possibility of holding another colonial appointment and in 1743 traveled to england stopping in dublin to visit his son jonathan jr when he arrived in london he joined social circles of congregationalist and quaker communities latter including among its influential members his brother in law richard partridge and called on colonial administrators in hopes of acquiring a new posting batinski pp 150 151 there he remained for three years until in 1746 word arrived that governor of new jersey lewis morris had died since new jersey had a strong quaker political establishment belcher immediately began mobilizing supporters in london quaker community to assist in securing post due to this alacrity he was able to get posting before agents for morris son robert hunter morris had time to organize their effort batinski pp 151 152 he served as governor of new jersey from 1747 until his death in 1757 about a year after his arrival in burlington then provincial capital he married for second time louise teale a widow he met in london in september 1748 batinski p 158 political situation he arrive in was highly acrimonious and there had been riots in previous year over widespread disagreements on land titles between land owners who controlled provincial council and farmers and tenants who controlled assembly most legislation had been stalled since 1744 due to inability of assembly council and governor to resolve differences on these issues fisher p 145 governor morris high handed actions in support of proprietors had united previously divided populist factions against him and council batinski pp 153 156 province was also a rural patchwork quilt of different cultures and religions unlike predominantly english and congregationalist new england batinski p 154 elizabethtown near new york was heavily populated by evangelical christians among them reverend aaron burr and belcher found himself welcome there batinski p 153 he regularly attended services there and was particularly influenced by preachers including george whitefield and jonathan edwards leaders of great awakening with whom he corresponded batinski p 159 thumb right 300px listed on national register of historic places belcher ogden house in elizabeth new jersey was residence of governor in former provincial capital then called elizabethtown although belcher s arrival prompted some goodwill resulting in passage of bills to fund government and deal with ongoing counterfeiting of colonial paper currency divisions soon resurface along same sectional lines fisher pp 133 136 belcher believed that land issues should be resolved by negotiation between parties and sought to maintain a position as a neutral arbiter of dispute because he had been propelled into office by antiproprietary interests he refused to unconditionally support council in moves to advance proprietary interests but also received little support from assembly batinski p 157 because assembly and council divided over issue of how to tax undeveloped lands which proprietors owned in large amounts government was short of funds between 1748 and 1751 fisher pp 140 152 one controversial matter that belcher was able to finesse was establishment of college of new jersey now known as princeton university college was proposed by new jersey s evangelical presbyterians with whom belcher found religious agreement however quaker leaders and proprietors had expressed great reservations about presbyterians drive to gain a charter for school on grounds that it would be used as a vehicle for converting their children and governor morris had refused to grant one after his death council president john hamilton acting prior to belcher s appointment granted charter maclean p 70 college s opponents pressured belcher to withdraw charter he instead adopted college as a cause to support and expanded its board to include a diversity of religious views when its first building was constructed in 1754 college s board wanted to name it after belcher but he demurred preferring it to be named in honor of king william who hailed from dutch house of orange nassau as a result building which still stands is known as nassau hall princeton university catalog p xxi he also supported establishment of college s library to which he bequeathed his personal library princeton university catalog p 153 in 1748 belcher issued a second charter to college of new jersey since validity of initial charter which was granted in 1746 by acting governor jonathan dickinson came under question legislature remained divided until after french and indian war broke out in 1754 when demands for support of military action brought some unity assembly objected to increased funding of militia in 1755 because belcher refused to authorize emission of additional paper currency it later acceded to demands for increased security but was reluctant to support militia for action outside province s boundaries fisher pp 160 161 legislators also complained that its meetings were too frequently held at elizabethtown primarily because of belcher s poor health fisher p 162 for much of his new jersey administration belcher was ill suffering from a type of progressive paralytic disorder in summer of 1751 he moved from burlington to elizabethtown in hopes that his health would improve it did not eventually his hands became paralyzed and his wife was employed to write for him batinski p 165 he died at his home in elizabethtown on 31 august 1757 his body was transported to massachusetts batinski p 171 where he was buried at cambridge trask

p 166 belcher was also uncle of future massachusetts lieutenant governor andrew oliver and massachusetts superior court of judicature chief justice peter oliver stark pp 181 188 and was great grandfather of british admiral edward belcher p 354 belcher had a reputation for exhibiting an abrasive personality something that was said by contemporaries to heighten divisions in new jersey batinski p 156 historian robert zemsky wrote of belcher he was almost a caricature of a new england yankee arrogant vindictive often impetuous despite a most solemn belief in rational action and calculated maneuver zemsky p 102 once he acquired governorship he took potential assaults on his power personally and reacted vindictively in attempts to destroy or marginalize his enemies zemsky p 108 in personal correspondence with friends family and supporters he used condescending names to refer to his opponents batinski p 109 and he applied pressure to press in boston to ensure reasonably
