dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face on october 26 2010 levy s then 64 year old father robert took stand and refuted statements about his past suspicions of condit robert levy testified that he told authorities during early years of investigation that his daughter chandra would have been too cautious to jog in woods alone but said that he no longer believed this to be true he said that he also told police that his daughter and condit had a five year plan between them to get married in retrospect robert levy admitted i just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as villain levy added that he had been convinced that condit was guilty until we learned about this character here referring to guandique on november 1 condit testified at trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and chandra levy had been involved in a sexual relationship he replied i am not going to respond to that question out of privacy for myself and chandra fbi biologist alan

out of six charges against guandique sexual assault and murder associated with that assault on november 15 defense rested its case without calling guandique to stand other prison witnesses called by defense refuted morales testimony jose manuel alaniz said that guandique made no mention of rape or murder while sharing a cell with both alaniz and morales at penitentiary in kentucky alaniz admitted under cross examination that he didn t want to be too nosy and was often asleep at prison while recovering from a gunshot wound prosecution dropped two more charges because statute of limitations had passed kidnapping and attempted robbery during closing arguments for remaining charges of first degree murder committed during a kidnapping and during a robbery prosecutor amanda haines contended that guandique bound and gagged levy after attacking her leaving her to die of dehydration or exposure in park defense attorney santha sonenberg countered with lack of any dna evidence connecting guandique to crime scene calling prosecution s case fiction sonenberg suggested that levy had been murdered elsewhere with her dead body being dumped in park jury began deliberations on november 17 2010 scheduled proceedings of case met delays because of increased security at courthouse after two days of deliberations all but one juror had voted to convict guandique on third day jury asked judge gerald fisher to clarify definition of assault fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault regardless of how small on november 22 2010 jury found guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first degree murder after trial a juror said testimony of morales was decisive in reaching verdict conviction was called a miracle for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence gladys weatherspoon who had previously represented guandique in 2001 assault cases stated that she was troubled by jury s verdict i just think they were going to convict anyway they felt bad for that woman mom she s sitting in there every day at a post trial press conference susan levy said there s always going to be a feeling of sadness i can surely tell you it ain t closure since conclusion of trial susan levy has acted to keep photographic evidence of her daughter s remains sealed from news media sentencing and appeals on february 1 2011 guandique s attorneys requested a new trial on grounds that verdict had been improperly attained 17 page filing claimed that prosecutors had appealed to emotions of jury using references to facts not in evidence motion also alleged that one juror who did not take notes had breached judge s instructions not to be influenced by another juror s notes prosecution opposed a retrial arguing that issue regarding notes was no more than a technicality that did not have a significant effect on verdict guandique faced a minimum penalty of 30 years to a maximum of life imprisonment without possibility of parole in seeking maximum possible sentence prosecutors stated that guandique is unable to control himself and thus will always remain a danger to women a memo submitted by prosecution in february 2011 cited guandique

could get new trial a fourth hearing was scheduled for april 2013 charges dropped on may 22 2015 prosecutors dropped their opposition to a new trial this came largely due to defense claims that prosecution s star witness armando morales had perjured himself on stand defense contended that prosecutors failed to disclose that morales was a jailhouse informant with a reputation for being untrustworthy morales had denied ever being an informant defense also argued that morales made up guandique s confession in order to boost his stock with prosecutors on june 3 2015 defense said a new witness a neighbor called 911 at 4 37 a m on last day levy was alive to report hearing a blood curdling scream possibly coming from levy s apartment on june 4 2015 judge gerald fisher granted a motion

prosecutors lost confidence in case after learning that morales who now lives in maryland was secretly recorded admitting lying on witness stand during 2010 trial babs woman who made recording turned it over to police u s attorney s office stated only that based on new information that had come to light during previous week there was no longer enough evidence to go forward with retrial in episode 3 of an american murder mystery on case it is mentioned that in march 2017 guandique lost his bid to remain in united states and was deported to his native el salvador on may 5 2017 media coverage disappearance of chandra levy became a national topic of news media in summer of 2001 with 63 percent of americans closely following case media swamped levy s parents from moment they decided to go to washington d c in search of their daughter according to condit there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during morning of september 11 2001 but they all left after news spread about that day s terrorist attacks in new york and washington media critics and cable news executives later cited levy case as well as concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks as a reflection of manner of news coverage in united states before september 11 attacks had taken priority in 2002 d c newspaper roll call first reported possible connection of ingmar guandique to case with little effect on news media s focus on condit conservative commentator michelle malkin noted lack of headlines that an illegal immigrant had been questioned in levy case she said that in her review of 115 news items from lexis nexis database not a single mention of guandique referred to his status as a criminal illegal alien she called glaring omission of his status a newsworthy act of negligence she wrote that only very conservative human events reported that immigration and naturalization service had approved his working legally while applying for temporary protected status that application was ultimately denied but not before he had assaulted two other women at rock creek park in 2005 investigative journalist dominick dunne said on larry king live that he believed gary condit knew more information about levy case than he had been disclosing condit filed two lawsuits against dunne forcing him into an undisclosed financial settlement on one of them in 2008 u s district judge peter leisure dismissed other suit that alleged slander because context in which dunne s statements were made demonstrates that they were part of a discussion about speculation in media and inaccurate media coverage during summer of 2008 washington post ran a 13 part series billed in part as a tale of tabloid and mainstream press pack journalism that helped derail investigation two investigative reporters behind post series scott higham and sari horwitz wrote a book detailing their investigation book finding chandra was published in may 2010 commentators including washington post metro reporter robert pierre wrote that emphasis on a glamorous white murder victim when about 200 people are killed in this city every year most of them black and male was absolutely absurd and dare i say racist at its core media were criticized for their rush to judgment in suggesting sometimes blatantly that condit was guilty of murder especially in early days of investigation some of reporters camped in front of condit s washington apartment house were quoted as saying that they would remain there until he resigns when ingmar guandique was convicted in november 2010 of murdering levy condit s lawyer bert fields remarked it s a complete vindication but that comes a little late who gives him his career back on 17th anniversary of homicide levy s mother continued to push for further investigation into her daughter s death https www 11alive com article news investigations gone cold chandra levys mom hopes petition will spark new law for investigating cold cases 85 impact levy s death has had a lasting impact due in part to efforts of her family and friends levy s disappearance came after a number of other high profile cases that led to creation of resources for missing young adults for example levy s parents quickly turned for help to carole sund carrington memorial reward foundation a nonprofit group that was established in modesto after three female hikers disappeared from a 1999 trip to yosemite national park and were later found slain that foundation which offered levys staff support and contributed towards a cash reward for information about chandra s disappearance was merged into laci conner search and rescue fund in 2009 susan levy had previously participated in efforts to find laci peterson another missing woman from modesto in 1997 when kristen modafferi mysteriously disappeared from san francisco bay area just three weeks after her 18th birthday her parents turned to their congresswoman for help they were ineligible to receive from national center for missing and exploited children as a result congress enacted kristen s law in october 2000 which established national center for missing adults within u s department of justice to coordinate such missing person cases by time levy disappeared institutions were in place to provide her family with support and to assist in a nationwide search to locate her although levy family moved quickly to mobilize all such available resources including offering a cash reward for information hiring their own investigators and seeking media attention those efforts to locate chandra levy or find her killer were overshadowed by speculation surrounding her possible relationship with condit susan levy later joined with donna mother of another young woman who disappeared in 1999 from modesto to form wings of protection a support group for people with missing loved ones mary ann liebert company publishers of journal of women s health and gender based medicine presented their annual criterion award in may 2002 to susan levy for her work with wings of protection newsweek magazine stated that media may have become more skeptical of herd mentality and open to alternative suspects after levy case d c police claimed that they would have discovered levy s body earlier if not for a miscommunication regarding scope of search commanders had ordered a search within of each road and trail in rock creek park but searches were focused within 100 yards of roads only resulting in body remaining undiscovered for a longer period of time both chief of detectives jack barrett and chief of police charles h ramsey have since left force in d c ramsey became head of philadelphia police department barrett who became an analyst for an intelligence support firm in arlington virginia stated in hindsight that media had imposed enormous amounts of pressure on d c police morales who is serving time for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and crack cocaine was scheduled to be released on august 5 2016 condit retired from politics and moved with his wife to phoenix arizona to manage real estate and open two baskin robbins franchises which have
