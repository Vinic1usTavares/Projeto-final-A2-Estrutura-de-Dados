in 1987 by crafting traditional novels in regency romance literary subgenre lord of scoundrels published in 1995 was her ninth such novel released it was third installment of her debauches also known as scoundrels series following lion s daughter 1992 and captives of night 1994 as such some of characters who feature in lord of scoundrels such as comte d esmond and francis beaumont also appear in previous chase works in 2007 chase said lord of scoundrels was her only book that came to me as a gift from writing gods every other book is a struggle some bloodier than others this book was pure fun from start to finish possessing a love for italian culture chase decided to make her male protagonist dain a mongrel english aristocrat and half italian by giving dain italian ancestry through his mother chase was able to develop his character and justify his motivations she explains having dain be half italian fit so many aspects of his story his background as well as his behavior which does get operatic at times chase adds that dain s difficult childhood stemmed from his parents inability to accept each other s cultures which then warps him and makes him a misfit in a loving household he would have grown up with a better self image and would have dealt with bullying at school in a different way and thus would have grown up into someone altogether different from man jessica meets in that antique shop when writing novel chase knew that her female protagonist had to be strong enough to equal dain s forceful personality chase admits that because novel is set in period leading up to victorian era a woman like jessica could not have dealt with dain writing that if jessica were like what we assume to be typical young lady of her time she could never handle dain and he d think her too boring to live chase instead modeled jessica after type of women who lived a few generations previously and who had a more practical frank attitude toward sex wishing to depict jessica as extreme female chase emphasizes her clothing and gives dain a chance to exercise his caustic wit as he deems latest fashions to be ridiculous upon their first meeting he silently observes that jessica is wearing a blue of some sort and one of hideously bonnets currently in fashion jessica differs from many other chase heroines by being interested in fashion author felt that way they dress to a great extent tells us who they are in same way that other heroines simpler or less fashionable attire expresses something about them analysis right thumb 220px lord of scoundrels has been described as a modern retelling of beauty and beast 1874 representation pictured lord of scoundrels is typically classified as a regency romance novel though its story is set in post regency era of 1828 it features a strong female heroine a characteristic that chase has become known for including in her romances author explains that for most of history and in too many cases today women are considered and too often consider themselves lesser beings who do not matter in my books women are not lesser and they do matter in other words i make world way i think it should be romantic fiction scholars have identified jessica trent as a feminist heroine with whom alpha male hero has met his match chase inverts many qualities typical of archetypical romantic hero and heroine near end of story jessica is one who initiates consummation of their marriage by seducing dain afterwards jessica promptly falls asleep causing her husband to seethe that was what he was supposed to do in her entry for bloomsbury introduction to popular fiction maryan wherry posits that lord of scoundrels represents a modern retelling of classic fairytale beauty and beast suggesting chase s story is a morality tale of restoring humanity that is directed at all levels of society rather than at lower classes as classic fairytales were intended chase makes direct reference to this fairytale in novel when dain silently compares his relationship with jessica to that of beauty and beast in a 2007 interview author described novel as her beauty and beast story stating that like beast dain is an outcast and misfit among novel s society chase describes dain as truly awful rude overbearing and intimidating he consciously uses his in same way he uses his vast wealth and his social position to control his world and protect himself it s sad in a way because he s isolated like beast of fairy tale trapped in his castle but dain is not pitiful by any means he s smart cynical and sarcastic with a sharp eye for ridiculous he has a sense of humor and is adept with clever comebacks and jessica represents beauty of story someone who enters beast s lair of her own accord as his equal no matter how awful he acts leading up to couple s marriage dain cynically makes many assurances that he will provide for jessica financially at one point jessica brings a defamation lawsuit against dain before they agree to convert it into a prenuptial agreement leading english professor kamble to liken their relationship to a take over bid kamble has studied presence of capitalism and modern economics on storylines in contemporary romance genre to her while lord of scoundrels is a regency romance novel and thus less apt to depict types of economic pairings seen in many contemporary romances kamble argues that dain s repeated monetary promises still contain echoes of kind of wealth monetary security and financial reward that heroes of harlequin mills and boon promise as husbands couple is physically attracted to each other while financial considerations also play a factor release and reception lord of scoundrels was released in january 1995 by avon books same publisher that had released chase s last two
