received mostly positive reviews john kubicek of buddytv called it easily my favorite episode of past two seasons and quite possibly one of best episodes show has ever made damian holbrook of tv guide described it and episode that followed nationals as clever funny and filled with moments that felt like little gifts to fans who have hung in there houston chronicle bobby hankinson said double feature continued recent hot streak of episodes and michael slezak of tvline highlighted this episode s script that acknowledged fan complaints that ryan murphy co all too often ignore some of glee original players in favor of new and more hyped flavors a v club emily vanderwerff wrote that it showcased writer and director ian brennan s strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small town teenagers who ll never get anything but to sweat it out on streets of a runaway american dream she gave props a b grade rae votta of billboard said it felt organically glee zany but with heart e online s jenna mullins thought body swap sequence breathed fresh n crazy air into glee and kubicek called it best thing glee has ever done and will ever do saskin of mtv said it was super trippy makes no sense plot wise and was a totally awesome glee moment entertainment weekly erin strecker wrote that entire cast deserved an mvp award for their completely on point mannerisms and singled out finn and puck all snuggly together holding hands and dressed up like kurt and blaine vanderwerff however described it as a totally odd curiosity that comes out of nowhere and said that car trip taken by tina and rachel later in episode was more successful at showing tina what rachel s life is like kubicek called offer of trip and subsequent drive a sweet bonding moment between pair and called it great that tina is one who saves day at meeting with carmen but chaney wondered why it took rachel two episodes to regain her drive and aspirations scenes with puck and beiste were much praised as were actors while reviewers such as bell and vanderwerff criticized domestic abuse storyline both were far happier with way it was ended than with how it had been introduced in choke vanderwerff wrote that fact that both puck and beiste s storylines resolve at same time in same scene is a nice piece of writing with some strong acting votta called pair s scenes delightful and thought they merited a road trip adventure spin off bell said that she could have seriously watched an hour dedicated to beiste and puck slezak highlighted terrific work by jones and salling and scenes with beiste holding a sobbing puck and confronting cooter as pretty remarkable strecker called latter scene painful to watch in best possible way and bell described salling s performance in former as truly incredible music and performances musical performances were greeted with somewhat less enthusiasm than episode as a whole and given mixed to positive reviews an example of this was song s opening number i won t give up saskin wrote that rachel sings jason mraz like everything else beautifully while rolling stone erica futterman credits her for having made a sappy ballad mildly more tolerable strecker gave performance a b grade and called it a classic berry power ballad b grades were given by slezak and washington post jen chaney who also noted rachel s vocal power thumb right upright because you loved me sung by ushkowitz pictured as rachel was well received because you loved me performed by tina as rachel received most consistently positive reviews though both chaney who gave song an and strecker who graded it a b stated their belief that real rachel would have done it better and saskin was more blunt we love you tina but you just can t belt like rachel futterman was most pleased and wrote richness of her voice removes some of lite fm softness embedded in tune and it really is great to see tina get a song that suits her vocal abilities most divergent views were expressed about puck and beiste s performance of mean crystal bell of huffington post asked how could you not be moved by their duet in auditorium e online s jenna mullins called it one of highlights of season and slezak gave it a grade of a chaney s b followed her statement that it was more effective than swift s version because i can believe that both puck and beiste have had it rough and strecker described it as lovely and thematically perfect and gave it a b vanderwerff said he could have done without their duet and futterman was even harsher it was quite unfortunate houston chronicle bobby hankinson wrote that he sort of liked how pair were simultaneously improving upon and butchering a taylor swift song and saskin characterized it as heartfelt and passionate futterman said of flashdance what a feeling that there was a glimmer of old school glee in performance carefree underdog status that made me smile saskin and chaney both found performance lacking former wrote that something about this version falls flat and chaney gave it a and said it wasn t as soaring as it could have been though rachel and tina s bonding moment was sweet and she liked way it took us from hour one into hour two and nationals slezak and strecker both gave performance an chart history one of four singles released for episode mean charted on billboard canadian hot 100 at number seventy one which was higher than either of two songs that debuted on that chart from nationals in same week none of these songs charted in us one other single from episode i won t give up though it did not sell well enough to chart on us billboard hot 100 week it was released affected charting there of jason mraz original which moved up from thirty four to twenty nine on hot 100 it had previously charted as high as number eight references
