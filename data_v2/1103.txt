of original design for long island parkway system developed by robert moses and lispc in 1924 to alleviate congestion on unattractive local roads system was designed to connect several parks that were under construction at time including jones beach state park bethpage state park and sunken meadow state park in 1927 parkway system was linked to parkways in new york city s boroughs of brooklyn and queens jones beach state park and ocean parkway opened in 1929 with access to mainland via jones beach causeway now part of wantagh state parkway parkway was named after meadow brook stream that follows its route between east meadow and freeport thumb beach at jones beach state park for which meadowbrook was constructed to serve drivers from new york city construction of meadowbrook causeway began in may 1933 with a 5 050 000 loan 1933 usd given from reconstruction finance corporation to long island state park commission in april 1933 in order to repay this loan long island state park commission working with jones beach state parkway authority would institute a 25 cent toll on meadowbrook and jones beach causeways 50 cent parking fee on jones beach would be reduced to 25 cents in order to keep total charged to motorists at 50 cents it was proposed that loan would be repaid in 25 years meadowbrook causeway was designed as a road from southern state parkway in freeport to jones beach with six bridges across channels of south oyster bay three grade separating structures would be designed as well by state of new york department of public works and lispc a trumpet interchange with lido beach loop causeway current day loop parkway was constructed as well designs also included 10 1 million cubic yards of hydraulic fill and a new water channel for boats proposed completion of project was set for january 1 1935 road was constructed by 3 800 people and completed in october 1934 six months ahead of schedule on october 27 1934 meadowbrook and lido beach loop causeways were opened to vehicular traffic by lispc a motorcade of cars was led across new roadways by robert moses then a republican party candidate for governor of new york event was preceded by parades in freeport and rockville centre during a speech moses cited praises to reconstruction finance corporation for donating money and letting lispc and jones beach state parkway authority do work without interference other speakers that afternoon praised moses and lispc and new york city mayor fiorello la guardia showed up late to give his congratulations despite opening ceremony two way traffic was not permitted on meadowbrook between southern state and merrick road until june 1 1935 prior to that time motorists had to use renamed wantagh causeway to access jones beach extension to northern state parkway thumb meadowbrook at southern state parkway exit in barnum woods moses announced during opening of bethpage state parkway in november 1936 that land for extending meadowbrook from southern state parkway to northern state parkway had been acquired by nassau county and plans for road were being designed by state division of highways moses stated that funds would be requested at next session of new york state legislature with a completion date of 1939 to coincide with opening of 1939 world s fair in flushing queens this would make it plausible for motorists to go from flushing to jones beach state park directly new extension would also alleviate congestion along several north south highways in nassau county and provide quicker access to jones beach however construction on 10 million 1956 usd highway was delayed until december 1953 on october 13 1956 governor averell harriman officially opened new extension of meadowbrook state parkway with a ribbon cutting ceremony at 11 30 a m near jerusalem avenue overpass robert moses hempstead town supervisor edward larkin and nassau county executive holly patterson also attended event after ceremony a

bids were to be accepted on project in august with a price tag of 3 851 million 1962 usd construction would widen segment from four lanes to six and add a new center median widening was prompted by frequency of accidents along stretch and efforts to develop project were sped up as a result completion was set for 1964 and reconstruction and repaving was finished on november 18 1964 reconstruction concerns interchange constructed between meadowbrook and northern state parkways in 1956 was undergoing a new 61 million 1989 usd reconstruction project in late 1980s although it was previously redesigned in 1968 it was still site of about 180 accidents per year over six times statewide average for accident frequency junction was to be rebuilt with three lanes in each direction for northern state in middle of exit 31a a direct ramp between westbound northern state parkway and southbound meadowbrook connections from glen cove road to both parkways and relocation of exit and entrance ramps within interchange construction began in may 1988 and project was expected to be completed on october 31 1991 it was proceeding on schedule until village of westbury filed a suit against nysdot in february 1989 lawsuit claimed that nysdot did not follow proper environmental guidelines while designing project because their environmental impact report failed to consider impacts of a nearby future widening project on northern state parkway this widening project considered a second phase of interchange reconstruction had no intended date of construction thumb meadowbrook northbound approaching interchange with northern state parkway scene of a lawsuit in 1989 appellate division of new york state supreme court ruled that nysdot had to provide a new environmental report by may 12 1989 or face having reconstruction shut down order by court reversed a decision by new york state supreme court that determined that a revised report was unnecessary residents of westbury claimed that project would bring noise concerns to village along with a spillover of diverted traffic to local roads concerns were also stated by then mayor ernest strada about westbury s water supply and potential impacts from project nysdot claimed that no disruption would be caused by project but strada insisted there were still concerns strada also stated that village had no interest in shutting down project rather they wanted to ensure that their community would be protected from any disruptions caused by reconstruction on april 24 nysdot announced they had appealed stoppage of work on interchange which had been suspended pending a ruling by court of appeals highest court in state on december 19 1989 court of appeals announced their decision on case of village of westbury v department of transportation of state of new york et al ruling in favor of westbury in its decision court stated nysdot should have issued a joint report for interchange and widening projects because both projects improved flow of traffic on northern state parkway and thus were related ruling made by previous court was affirmed and nysdot was advised to consider environmental impacts of projects on other nearby projects in future while village of westbury was praising ernest strada for taking on state residents of village of carle place felt they were being taken hostage by his actions and that stoppage of work was hurting their community more than westbury editorials in newsday also called mayor parochial and overzealous while carle place was complaining about inability to access their section of town a january 1990 article in new york times mentioned that court s decision put westbury alone against state then governor mario cuomo and regional planners who were worried about safety of roughly 140 000 drivers who used interchange daily local business leaders claimed that westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction even after ruling strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on impacts of a nearby widening project on northern state nysdot officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set project back three years officials also went out of their way to call this a simple not in my backyard case nysdot continued to claim that projects were separate and filed three years apart despite court s ruling that they were similar projects cuomo worried about safety of drivers invited strada to come to albany to meet with nysdot commissioner franklin white and state senator norman j levy to make an agreement strada however felt that in order to compromise they would have to continue original violation of not giving a report westbury and nysdot came to a deal allowing construction to resume in february 1990 with lane changes and other modifications being made by end of month this truce made by governor cuomo allowed work to resume at a normal pace with nearly 200 workers doing daily work on project by april 1990 speed of progress on reconstruction put project back on track to meet original october 1991 deadline mayor strada however stated that he thought nysdot would not advance any work that would need to be ripped up interchange reconstruction project was ultimately completed in 1991 as expected recent changes in 1947 lispc approved 37 000 1947 usd to construct a stone ornate gasoline station along meadowbrook in jones beach state park gas station one of eight constructed by robert moses throughout long island would serve drivers when there were fewer stations throughout area after 1975 nysdot who took control of parkways from lispc started demolishing some of stations including meadowbrook which ended up being one of first buildings to go stations which were once useful would fork from left lane into median however according to nysdot with change in traffic patterns entrances to these stations became dangerous by 1997 over two decades after demolition station site became a problematic place for people parking and walking up meadowbrook and loop to fish on bridges according to new york state police site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies however not for use of dropping people off for fishing which is also illegal to fish from atop bridge except it is around and under bridges thumb signage denoting state senator

parkways on island inserting high occupancy vehicle lanes hov lanes for buses and meadowbrook would receive a new hov lane between southern and northern state parkways while everything south of southern state parkway would remain same northern state parkway would get lanes from long island expressway to meadowbrook and southern state would get lanes from meadowbrook to sunrise highway in october 2008 nassau county legislator david demonstrated with ten civic leaders in front of nysdot building in east meadow about slow progress of construction on ny 102 front street overpass
