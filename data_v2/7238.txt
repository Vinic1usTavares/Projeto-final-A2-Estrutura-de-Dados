everybody is debut single by american singer madonna from her eponymous debut studio album madonna 1983 it was released on october 6 1982 by sire label as her debut single madonna had recorded a demo of song with steve bray she urged dj mark kamins who played at her dance club to play it he was impressed by song and took her to sire records who signed her for a two song deal however after recording of two singles was over sire executive michael rosenblatt was not interested in other song produced and decided to release only everybody by incorporating r b infused beats in music and not including her image on cover artwork marketing for song gave impression of madonna as a black artist that impression did not last long as madonna would later convince sire executives to shoot a music video for song low budget video directed by ed steinberg showed madonna and her friends in a club singing and dancing to song video helped to further promote song and madonna as an artist critically everybody did not receive any acclaim and failed to enter billboard hot 100 chart it did however appear on dance charts song helped madonna achieve her first appearance in a dance magazine she has performed everybody live a number of times it was first performed during virgin tour then as final song of girlie show world tour later on mdna tour and most recently on rebel heart tour song was included in a remixed form on madonna s 1987 remix album you can dance and on deluxe edition of her 2009 compilation album celebration background and recording in 1982 23 year old madonna was living in new york and trying to set up her music career she was joined by her boyfriend from detroit steve bray who became drummer of her band breakfast club which generally played hard rock music after that however they abandoned playing songs in hard rock genre and got signed by a music management company called gotham records with plan of pursuing a new musical direction they decided to pursue funk genre but record company was not happy with their musical abilities hence they were dropped and madonna and bray left band meanwhile madonna had written and developed some songs on her own she carried rough tapes of three of songs namely everybody ain t no big deal and burning up at that time she frequented danceteria nightclub in new york it was there that madonna convinced dj mark kamins to play everybody for crowd and song received a positive reaction kamins offered to get her a record deal with understanding that he would produce single kamins presented madonna to his boss chris blackwell who was owner of island records but blackwell rejected her madonna finally went to sire records in 1982 michael rosenblatt who worked at artists and repertoire department of sire commented that madonna is great she will do anything to be a star and that s exactly what i look for in an artist total co operation with madonna i knew i had someone hot and co operative so i planned to build her career with singles rather than just put an album right away and run risk of disaster rosenblatt offered madonna 5 000 in advance plus 1 000 in royalties for each song she wrote madonna was ultimately signed for two 12 inch singles by president of sire seymour stein who was impressed by her singing after listening to everybody at a hospital in lenox hill where he was admitted 12 inch version of everybody was produced by mark kamins at bob blank s blank tapes studio in nyc kamins was romantically involved with madonna at that time he took over production work from steve bray new recording ran 5 56 on one side and 9 23 for dub version on flipside madonna and kamins had to record single at their own cost arthur baker friend of mark kamins guided him through role of a music producer and provided him with studio musician fred zarr who performed keyboard on track zarr became one of common musical threads on album by eventually performing on every track due to restrained budget recording was a hefty affair as madonna could not understand kamins directions and kamins himself faced problems directing hence a side ain t no big deal did not become as successful as everyone expected rosenblatt wanted to release everybody with ain t no big deal on other side but later changed his mind and put everybody on both sides of vinyl record after hearing recorded version of ain t no big deal release and composition everybody was commercially released as madonna s first single in october 6 1982 and came with a lou beach designed sleeve depicting a hip hop style nyc street scene because of ambiguous nature of record sleeve and r b groove of song madonna was widely believed to be a black artist when single was released according to matthew lindsay of quietus it was ironic that record sleeve did not depict madonna on cover as she would become face of 80s everybody was recorded at sigma sound studios in new york city track starts with a heavily synthesized and spoken introduction with madonna taking a loud intake of breath madonna displayed her bubblegum pop voice in song which was song is written in key of a minor with melody of song beginning in g and rising to second scale degree on syllable bo of everybody thus highlighting chorus which follows in chord progression of g a b a everybody incorporated r b infused beats sire records marketed soulful nature of dance song for black audience and madonna was promoted as an african american artist thereby fitting record into a radio playlist where song might chart in new york song was played on 92 ktu which had an african american audience for cover of single sire records portrayed a hip hop collage of downtown new york rather than a portrait shot of madonna further perpetuating notion that madonna was african american reception critical response author rikky rooksby in his book complete guide to music of madonna noted that song closed madonna album on a flat note he called music artificial repetitive and uninspired don shewey from rolling stone commented that at first it everybody doesn t sound like much at all then you notice its one distinguishing feature a girlish hiccup that singer uses over and over until it s irritating as hell finally you get hooked and you start looking forward to that silly little catch in her voice author j randy taraborrelli in his biography on madonna commented that song was a rhythmic call to party author santiago fouz hernandez in his book madonna s drowned worlds complimented chorus of song saying that everybody and music are two madonna singles which define her artistic credo that music has power to overcome divisions of race gender and sexuality matthew lindsay of quietus praised song calling it spectacular and hard to resist lindsay added with its breathy spoken word passages and invitation to dance madonna s debut single was a template that would be revisited throughout her career in 2012 louis virtel of backlot listed everybody at number two on his list of 100 greatest madonna songs commenting that song is an example of madonna s undeniable talents virtel goes on to say through song madonna shows she is a commander baryshnikov of pop chutzpah and a rightful disco empress commercial performance 12 inch single of everybody failed to chart on billboard hot 100 in united states it peaked at number 107 on billboards bubbling under hot 100 singles chart on january 22 1983 however song moved quickly up dance charts and was madonna s first single to chart on billboard hot dance club play chart peaking at number three one of
