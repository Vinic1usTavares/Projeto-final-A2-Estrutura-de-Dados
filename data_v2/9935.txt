marsileaceae are a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi aquatic ferns though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns group is commonly known as pepperwort family or as water clover family because leaves of genus marsilea superficially resemble leaves of a four leaf clover a flowering plant leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on saint patrick s day in all family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to marsilea natural history members of marsileaceae are aquatic or semi aquatic plants often grow in dense clumps in mud along shores of ponds or streams or they may grow submerged in shallow water with some of leaves extending to float on water surface they grow in seasonally wet habitats but survive winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard desiccation resistant reproductive structures thumb left an african species of marsilea with floating leaves there are only three living genera in family marsileaceae majority of species about 45 to 70 belong to genus marsilea which grows worldwide in warm temperate and tropical regions marsilea can be distinguished from other two genera by presence of four leaflets on each leaf although some species occasionally produce six leaflets per leaf a second genus regnellidium includes a single living species that grows only in southern brazil and neighboring parts of argentina it has only two leaflets per leaf third genus pilularia grows widely in temperate regions of both northern and southern hemispheres its leaves do not subdivide into leaflets but are slender and tapered to a point so that it is often overlooked and mistaken for a grass there are only about five species known closest relatives of marsileaceae are salviniaceae which are also aquatic and heterosporous however both of these other fern families float freely on surface of ponds or lakes instead of rooting in soil or mud close relationship of these groups to marsileaceae is supported by both morphologic and molecular analysis as well as by discovery of an intermediate fossil named in general salviniaceae and have a much better fossil record than marsileaceae until recently was oldest fossil member known it is a preserved sporocarp containing spores found in tertiary chert of india in 2000 discovery of fossilized sporocarps from cretaceous of eastern north america was announced these fossils were assigned to species regnellidium and pushed known history of marsileaceae back into mesozoic oldest fossil known for marsileaceae is from upper jurassic or lower cretaceous of japan fossils include leaves with visible veins as well as sporocarps morphology marsileaceae share many of basic structural characteristics common to most ferns but differences are more noticeable than similarities species of this family have long slender rhizomes that creep along or beneath ground their fronds leaves grow in distinct clusters at nodes along rhizome with wide spacing between leaf clusters as a result plants appear to be more stem than leaf unlike other ferns roots grow primarily from same nodes as leaves but may also grow from other locations along rhizome roots of marsilea and regnellidium are noteworthy for containing vessel elements vessels have also been found in rhizome of two species of marsilea these vessels have evolved independently of vessels in other groups of plants thumb left leaves of hawaiian species marsilea villosa leaves are most easily observed characteristic for marsileaceae they have a long slender leaf stalk ending in zero two or four occasionally six leaflets number of leaflets differs among three genera and can therefore be used for identification in pilularia leaves are narrowly cylindrical and taper to a point leaves of regnellidium bear two broad leaflets while leaves of marsilea bear four leaflets at tip four leaflets on leaf of marsilea are not borne equally instead they are borne in pairs with one pair of leaflets attached slightly higher than other thus in developing leaf leaflets are folded more like wings of a butterfly than like leaflets of a clover as with other ferns leaves develop in a pattern they begin as small tight spirals which as leaf matures at full maturity they are held erect with leaflets unfolded except in pilularia whose leaves have no blade temperate species are deciduous losing their vegetative leaves in winter tropical species may also lose their leaves during dry season these leaves are photosynthetic and produce most of food used by plant some aquatic species of marsilea especially those growing with their rhizome submerged may have vegetative leaves that are dimorphic some of their leaves grow up to surface of water and look just like leaves of species growing out of water these plants also produce other leaves with shorter leaf stalks that are not long enough to reach surface and so leaflets remain underwater these leaves have different anatomical and cellular characteristics better suited to their submerged environment in addition to their vegetative sterile leaflets all species of marsileaceae produce fertile spore producing leaflets at or near base of photosynthetic leaves this reproductive portion looks and functions very differently from vegetative portion of leaves life cycle like other ferns members of marsileaceae produce spores but not seeds when they reproduce unlike other ferns spores in this family are produced inside sporocarps these are hairy short stalked bean shaped structures usually 3 to 8 mm in diameter with a hardened outer covering this outer covering is tough and resistant to drying out allowing spores inside to survive unfavorable conditions such as winter frost or summer desiccation despite this toughness sporocarps will open readily in water if conditions are favorable and specimens have been successfully germinated after being stored for more than 130 years each growing season only one sporocarp typically develops per node along rhizome near base of other leaf stalks though in some species of marsilea there may be two or occasionally as many as twenty resemblance of sporocarps to gives family its common name of pepperwort thumb european species pilularia globulifera bearing sporocarps sporocarps are functionally and developmentally modified leaflets although they have much shorter stalks than vegetative leaflets inside sporocarp modified leaflets bear several sori each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue indusium each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium each type producing only one of two kinds of spores toward center of each sorus and developing first are each of which will produce a single large female megaspore surrounding them at edge of sorus and developing later are each of which will produce many small male microspores because marsileaceae produce two kinds of spore and thus two kinds of gametophyte they are called heterosporous while is norm among all plants with seeds such as flowering plants and conifers it is very rare among other groups of plants also most heterosporous plants produce their two kinds of sporangia in different places on plant since marsileaceae grow both kinds together in a single cluster they differ from other plants in this regard as well spores remain dormant inside sporocarp through unfavorable conditions but when conditions are suitable and wet sporocarp will germinate it splits into halves allowing tissue coiled inside to become hydrated as this internal tissue swells with water it pushes halves of hard outer covering apart and emerges as a long gelatinous worm like sorophore sorophore is a sorus bearing structure unique to marsileaceae it may extend to more than ten times length of sporocarp inside which it was coiled this extension carries numerous spore producing sori attached along each side of sorophore out into water human uses some species of marsilea are cultivated in garden pools or aquaria indigenous australians once made a porridge of pulverized marsilea sporocarps called nardoo however sporocarps contain toxic levels of so careful preparation methods must be used in order for nardoo to be safe for consumption references external links description in flora of north america diversity
