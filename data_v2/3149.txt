maroubra force composed of troops 39th battalion and papuan infantry battalion pib were sent to kokoda arriving there on 15 july thompson 2008 p 321 this move proved prescient as a large japanese force landed at gona only a week later and they quickly began to move inland towards kokoda first clash occurred at on 23 july when a platoon from b company under command of captain sam templeton having destroyed footbridge over river engaged japanese on far side of river thompson 2008 p 322 australians were forced to withdraw however when hundreds of japanese marines began crossing river

order to get more reinforcements on evening of 29 july japanese attacked main position kokoda there were only 80 men from b company left at that time and armed only with small arms and a few bren light machine guns they were no match for assaulting japanese casualties on both sides were high as australians resorted to hand to hand combat and battalion s commanding officer lieutenant colonel william owen who had flown in to take over battalion following templeton s death was killed while organising withdrawal thompson 2008 p 323 it became clear that kokoda was lost and following morning under cover of a dense mist with pib s commanding officer major william watson assuming temporary command survivors abandoned position and fell back towards village of deniki a mile or so back along

maroubra force most of them were sent back to isurava in disgrace as he was under mistaken belief that they had run away from fighting thompson 2008 p 325 nevertheless on 8 august rest of 39th battalion now without only troops who had any experience fighting japanese launched a counterattack at kokoda they managed to secure one side of airfield but due to close proximity of japanese on

fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease although japanese were experiencing similar problems in relation to supplies they began their advance once again on 26 august and despite several rugged defensive actions australians were forced back again first to eora creek on 30 august then templeton s crossing on 2 september and finally to efogi three days later exhausted from their efforts
