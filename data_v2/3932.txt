robust hardware design introduction of android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and third party software in comparison to more established platforms but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature notifications system and heavy integration with google s services history development thumb left 160px sooner prototype was shelved in favor of dream in july 2005 google acquired android inc a company led by andy rubin which was working on unspecified software for mobile devices under leadership of google team was in process of developing a standardized linux based operating system for mobile phones to compete against likes of symbian and windows mobile which would be offered for use by individual original equipment manufacturers initial development of what would become android was targeted towards a prototype device codenamed sooner device was a messaging phone in style of blackberry with a small non touch screen navigation keys and a physical qwerty keyboard january 2007 unveiling of iphone apple s first smartphone and its pioneering design aspects caught rubin off guard and led to a change in course for project operating system s design was quickly reworked and attention shifted to a new prototype device codenamed dream a touchscreen device with a sliding physical keyboard inclusion of a physical keyboard was intentional as android developers recognized users did not like idea of a virtual keyboard as they lacked physical feedback that makes hardware keyboards useful android operating system

mobile devices these companies included google along with htc a company which was at time one of largest manufacturers of phones while google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were being

released for t mobile usa s g1 in october 2009 1 6 update was not released on rogers htc dream in canada which stayed on 1 5 cupcake rogers claimed that update was only being made available for google branded models of device development and modding due to open source nature of android platform dream became a popular target for modding shortly after release of dream developers discovered a software exploit which would allow a user to gain superuser access to phone a process which would be referred to as rooting as a parallel to jailbreaking on ios devices root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances such as adding auto rotation and installing a custom kernel that restored aforementioned multitouch support after dream s bootloader was dumped work began on modifying it so that it could install third party firmware and on converting official android update files into a format that could be installed using modified bootloader around same time google made android dev phone 1 available for registered android developers dev phone 1 was a sim and hardware unlocked version of htc dream that came pre configured for superuser access to internal files of phone allowing users to completely replace bootloader and operating system as a result of these developments a dedicated community centered on forums such as xda developers emerged surrounding creation of custom firmware roms built from android source code projects such as continued to produce ports of newer versions of android for dream and later android devices while adding their own features and enhancements to operating system as well on later android devices where a number of factors including carrier practices and custom software provided by device manufacturers that sit atop android such as htc sense and samsung touchwiz led to fragmentation regarding availability of newer versions of os for certain devices development and use of custom roms which are usually based on stock version of android have ultimately become an important yet controversial aspect of android ecosystem in august 2012 a group of users released an unofficial port of a later version of android 4 1 jelly bean for dream as a proof of concept however port lacked key functionality and had severe performance issues due to phone s relatively weak hardware in comparison to modern devices that 4 1 was designed for reception critical reception dream was released to mixed reviews design of dream was considered to be solid and robust joshua topolsky of engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of iphone due to its numerous navigation buttons in comparison to just a home button and its charming retro future look like a gadget in a 1970 s sci fi movie set in year 2038 dream s keyboard as only method of text input prior to android 1 5 s introduction of a virtual keyboard was considered to be sufficient although some felt that its keys were too small its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class but john brandon of techradar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to iphone android itself was considered to still be in its infancy primarily due to its bare bones functionality in certain areas limited application catalog lack of multitouch gestures or syncing with certain enterprise platforms but showed promise through its customizable interface increased flexibility over ios its notification system ability to display security permissions when downloading apps and its heavy integration with google services brandon gave dream a 4 5 5 despite stating that it was no apple iphone killer given its lower quality of its application selection and multimedia features in comparison in conclusion dream was considered to be a stellar phone that points to a future when a phone is as flexible and useful as pc on your desk engadget felt that dream isn t going to blow anyone s mind right out of gate due to its hardware but that android platform as a whole held its own against its competitors and that early adopters of android through g1 were buying into one of most exciting developments in mobile world in recent memory noted that dream would have been another average smart qwerty messenger had it not been for its introduction of android in conclusion dream was considered far from perfect package but still believed that it gets things that matter done and gets them done right commercial reception in april 2009 t mobile announced that it had sold over a million in united states accounting for two thirds of devices on its 3g network estimated in march 2009 that android and g1 had reached a market share
