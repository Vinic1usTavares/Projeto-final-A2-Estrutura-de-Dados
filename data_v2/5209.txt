typhoon utor known in philippines as typhoon swept through central philippines in december 2006 exacerbating damage left behind by previous philippine typhoon strikes that year residual moisture from tropical cyclone indirectly contributed to extensive flooding in malaysia utor originated from an area of disturbed weather that organized into a tropical depression on december 7 west southwest of yap cyclone steadily progressed westward while gradually intensifying reaching tropical storm intensity late on december 7 on december 9 and ensuing two days utor crossed central philippines and reached typhoon strength before weakening somewhat upon entry into south china sea reintensification ensued afterwards and utor reached its peak intensity on december 13 with maximum sustained winds of 155 km h 100 mph shortly after regaining typhoon strength however wind shear and dry air began to take its toll on utor thereafter quickly weakening storm until its dissipation on december 15 due to destruction wrought by typhoon durian just weeks prior preparations began in earnest in philippines over 91 000 people were evacuated from areas at risk primarily from albay two major summits to be held in cebu were postponed as a result of forecast inclement weather in addition recovery efforts for victims of durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in philippines were cancelled utor s impacts in central philippines were extensive with 30 casualties reported and damage toll reaching us 15 8 million widespread power outages affected entirety of eastern visayas numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by typhoon including a ferry carrying 104 passengers and crew following storm relief agencies began to allocate resources to those affected by typhoon in turn also adding to relief efforts for three philippine typhoons which preceded utor precautionary efforts also took place in vietnam thailand and malaysia while paracel islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities although storm mostly dissipated in south china sea utor s remnant moisture later contributed in part to peninsular malaysia s worst flood event in recorded history as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short four day period eight people were killed by floods which were worst in kota tinggi and segamat district meteorological history predecessor to typhoon utor was first noted by joint typhoon warning center jtwc as a cluster of thunderstorms southeast of chuuk on december 2 over next few days a center of circulation accompanied by intermittent shower activity began to develop in presence of favorable conditions at 00 00 utc on december 7 japan meteorological agency jma determined that disturbance had become sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical depression at time cyclone was centered 175 km 110 mi west southwest of yap tracking westward under influence of a powerful subtropical ridge to its north depression strengthened into a tropical storm at 18 00 utc in accordance storm was given name utor this name had been submitted by united states and means squall line utor s development following its naming was slow but quickened as tropical storm neared philippines tropical cyclone reached southeastern coast of samar by 06 00 utc on december 9 and began tracking through central philippine archipelago over next two days despite its interaction with nearby islands utor continued to strengthen without much impediment and reached typhoon strength in visayan sea at 12 00 utc that day twelve hours later typhoon attained an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 km h 85 mph and a minimum barometric pressure of 955 mbar hpa 28 20 inhg in sibuyan sea according to jma jtwc analyzed an intensity of 185 km h 115 mph at that time by 12 00 utc on december 10 utor had emerged into south china sea although utor tracked back over water on december 10 storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and dry air from west as a result jma downgraded utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into south china sea despite these hindering conditions storm s improved outflow was sufficient enough to enable redevelopment at 18 00 utc on december 11 jma once again upgraded system to typhoon strength southeast of hainan intensification continued until utor peaked with winds of 155 km h 100 mph and a minimum pressure of 945 mbar hpa 27 91 inhg next day this strength was held for only twelve hours before utor s outflow began to succumb to wind shear and dry air stemming from monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed traveling in a tight clockwise loop typhoon rapidly weakened on december 13 by following day utor was a minimal tropical storm at 06 00 utc on december 14 storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small anticyclonic loop before dissipating on december 15 preparations impact and aftermath philippines thumb tropical storm utor making landfall

extremities although philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa did not recommend their delay both 2006 asean and east asia summits in cebu city were postponed due to threat of utor impacting city officials denied allegations that postponements were instead due to a possible terrorist attack this was first time than an asean summit had been postponed due to inclement weather potentially hazardous conditions also delayed humanitarian aid to victims of typhoon durian which struck philippines in late november first public storm warning signals for philippines were issued by pagasa on december 8 for several islands in central philippines third level of four tier warning system was issued for samar leyte and with landfall imminent on december 9 15 000 people were evacuated to temporary evacuation shelters from around 12 villages this figure increased to 59 000 people as landfall occurred and later to 91 121 with storm passing over philippines most of evacuees were from albay due to fears of deadly mudslides and lahars associated with mount mayon as witnessed during typhoon durian in addition philippines office of civil defense considered relocating typhoon durian refugees in bicol region to special holding areas other domestic flights were also cancelled thumb left map of highest public storm warning signals by province

passage of utor path that typhoon took is superimposed on map utor caused extensive power outages in cebu leyte and boracay resulting in widespread loss of telecommunication a single electric pole in northern cebu caught fire during storm cutting out power to eight peripheral towns downtown tacloban also suffered a blackout off of boracay a boat operator was killed after their ship capsized another 67 ships which consisted of and ferries sunk during storm s passage buildings were unroofed and trees were torn apart on island littering its beaches with debris a barge was forced by large waves into pier at san agustin romblon resulting in spilling of 25 000 l 6 600 gal of diesel fuel two children were killed in tacloban and capiz as a result of falling trees an additional three people in capiz were feared to have drowned due to floods two thousand people became stranded after philippine coast guard cancelled operation of 43 ferry services similarly 8 000 people became stranded at seaports after coast guard barred vessels from sailing extensive damage occurred in occidental mindoro where 422 homes were destroyed and an additional 1 421 damaged rough seas caused outriggers on a ferry between batangas and puerto galera oriental mindoro to break apart causing ship to begin disintegrating offshore however 104 passengers and crew on board were able to escape and were later rescued further north in southern luzon roads and bridges were rendered impassable after sustaining damage a state of emergency was declared for aklan where property damage equated to p51 million us 1 million central visayas region of philippines suffered worst impacts with a damage cost of p345 2 million us 7 million primarily to agriculture following storm s passage chapters of philippine red

accounted for damage toll wrought by utor amounted to us 15 8 million furthermore 36 542 houses were damaged by utor of which 9 439 were destroyed capiz and aklan were areas that sustained most residential damage people who were evacuated out of hazardous regions in advance of utor were able to return home beginning on december 18 nine days after initial landfall elsewhere in southeastern asia thailand s royal irrigation department released water from local dams in order to mitigate a potential flood event caused by utor flooded areas of western half of country drained floodwaters into chao phraya river off of malaysia a rough sea warning for coastal stretches of sabah and northern sarawak due to threat of high wind swept waves caused by utor in vietnam delegations were sent to coastal areas to guide residents in preparing for utor and secure fishing boats while troops were sent to reinforce buildings and fortify sea defenses preparations for mass evacuations also went into effect particularly along vietnam s central coastline border guards called back 3 785 fishing vessels with over 21 000 fishermen to shore aircraft automobiles canoes and ships were dispatched into threatened areas to disseminate information regarding typhoon similar precautionary measures took place in hainan where more than 20 000 fishing boats were called back to shore forty nine people were evacuated out of paracel islands due to threat of typhoon as utor was traversing south china sea a fishing boat became stranded near reef in paracel islands occupants were rescued by a rescue ship operated by hainan maritime bureau though five were flown to hospitals for medical treatment a total of 140 sheds on islands of and bei dao were flattened by passing typhoon while a ship at harbor sank and five others ran aground on qilian yu island sub group 98 fishermen on islands were rescued by rescue bureau following days without clean water and food supplies utor had destroyed all of islands bunkhouses resulting in requests for rescue moisture associated with utor was partially blamed for heavy rains which produced extensive flooding in peninsular malaysia these floods were first in a long string of flood events that would plague region until february 2007 tropical moisture acted in tandem with wind shear and a monsoonal flow to produce continuous precipitation over malaysian states of pahang johor and malacca rainfall peaked at 567 8 mm 22 35 in in bandar shah over a four day period with similar rainfall totals occurring elsewhere these floods were considered worst in history of southern malaysia worst affected areas were segamat and kota tinggi where both towns were inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were flooded eight fatalities resulted from historical flooding see also typhoons in philippines typhoon axel 1994 late year typhoon which passed through central philippines typhoon faith 1998 displaced several thousand people
