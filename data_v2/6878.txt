thumb aerial view of etstc in 1941 history of east texas state teachers college etstc comprises history of university now known as texas a m university commerce from its renaming as east texas state teachers college in 1923 to define its purpose more clearly to its renaming as east texas state college in 1957 to recognize its broadening scope during this era etstc was led by four different presidents randolph b binnion samuel h whitley a c ferguson and james gilliam gee two of whom whitley and gee served for more than a decade etstc period was marked by increasing recognition notably through obtaining membership in southern association of colleges and schools sacs in 1925 as well as marked growth in its faculty student enrollment and physical plant etstc grew from 65 faculty in 1925 to 132 in 1957 from approximately 1 000 students in 1925 to over 3 000 in 1958 59 and from six buildings valued at roughly 500 000 in early 1920s to a physical plant valued at over 4 million in 1949 while in early 1920s etstc s faculty lacked advanced degrees and was relatively poorly compensated by 1927 a majority of faculty held degrees higher than bachelor s degrees and by 1957 59 of its 132 faculty members held doctorates all four etstc presidents exerted a marked conservative influence on campus during his presidency for instance whitley disapproved of smoking and refused to hire married women etstc era also included great depression which witnessed a steep drop in enrollment and federal student aid principally from federal emergency relief administration fera and national youth administration nya and world war ii which saw campus host women s army auxiliary corps waac army specialized training program astp and civilian pilot training program while 63 former students were killed in conflict post world war ii era at etstc was marked by a return to growth in terms of faculty student enrollment and physical plant alike new dormitories and athletics buildings including memorial stadium and field house were built during this period gee s tenure as president which began in 1947 included two major controversies his feud with sam rayburn congressman representing hunt county and an alumnus of college and his support of a doctrinaire general studies program that angered and alienated numerous faculty and resulted in demotion of two dissident department heads gee also was able to block integration from occurring at east texas state for much of his presidency college would not integrate until forced to do so by board of regents in 1964 etstc era was also a banner period for athletics as school joined lone star conference lsc as a founding member in 1931 while during golden fifties both football and men s basketball teams won multiple conference championships and basketball team won naia national basketball tournament in 1954 55 1920s and 1930s have been referred to as truly golden age of student clubs at east texas state and despite vast majority of student body having 5 or less in spending money a month in 1925 students found creative and inexpensive forms of recreation from attending theaters and dating to attending college sponsored events such as saturday night dances and appearances by noted performing artists such as john philip sousa and united states marine band as well as noted speakers such as frances perkins emily post and carl sandburg 1920s thumb 175px samuel h whitley in 1921 then dean of faculty east texas state normal college was renamed east texas state teachers college etstc in 1923 to define its purpose more clearly in 1925 college became a true four year institution when its sub college program was transferred to its training school however it was slow in gaining respect from university of texas at austin which refused to accept etstc credits beyond sophomore level at face value until 1922 even before being fully recognized by ut austin though east texas state students had gained admission at various other prestigious universities including university of chicago peabody college vanderbilt university and yale university furthermore in 1925 etstc was granted membership in southern association of colleges and schools sacs south s major accrediting agency for institutions of higher learning thumb left education building in 1941 on november 20 1924 president randolph b binnion resigned presidency to become provost at george peabody college for teachers in nashville tennessee and board of regents selected samuel h whitley as his successor whitley was dean of faculty at etstc and a professor of mathematics at time of his selection prior to which he had been a high school principal in corsicana and briefly assistant state superintendent whitley was inaugurated as etstc s third president on january 16 1926 same day as dedication of education building first campus building to be paid for by state funds building was constructed with an appropriation of 285 000 from texas legislature and was built by jones construction company of san antonio it featured a 2 500 seat auditorium and originally included 35 classrooms it was later renamed arthur c ferguson social sciences building and as of 1993 was still one of most used buildings on campus by that year all of buildings constructed during presidencies of mayo and binnion had been demolished and replaced leaving ferguson social sciences building as oldest structure still standing on campus like binnion before him whitley subscribed to a conception of that was similar to mayo s which helped ease presidential transition under whitley college s student population increased eclipsing 1 000 in 1925 before reaching 1 953 during 1932 33 school year state funds failed to keep up with enrollment growth however rising only slightly from 253 060 during 1926 27 academic year to 265 950 in 1932 33 another challenge facing etstc during 1920s and 1930s was state of its physical plant aside from new education building many campus buildings were in poor condition especially industrial hall and old main which were eventually demolished in 1941 and early 1950s respectively new buildings were constructed to address this issue during whitley administration in 1927 a new two story colonial style president s home was built for whitley just to south of education building and in 1929 30 school s first dedicated library was constructed featuring room for 125 000 volumes and a showpiece two story reading room library also included classrooms and a museum and featured such ornate details as dark oak woodwork and bronze chandeliers thumb original library in 1941 just before whitley became president in 1925 etstc employed a total of 65 faculty which grew to 80 by 1932 33 academic year historian of university william e sawyer described teaching loads for 1925 summer normal institute as excessive one single teacher was assigned to teach agriculture physical geography physiology and zoology while another teacher taught ancient history modern history texas history united states history and school law however due to relative paucity of school s budget salaries remained low during early 1930s department heads were paid 3 600 annually but salaries as low as 2 500 for associate professors 1 800 for instructors and 728 for maintenance staff were recorded in 1926 texas state finance committee had set salary for all presidents of state teachers colleges at 5 000 along with a residence in 1931 whitley admitted that etstc s salary scale was lower than any other state institution furthermore in 1932 school began giving employment preference to native texans and adopted a policy of not employing more than one member of any family according to history professor donald e reynolds etstc was reported to have lowest cost per student in state and a 1933 report on school by southern association of colleges and secondary schools found that it only spent 160 per student additionally noting that both its library and faculty were undersized and somewhat below average in comparison to comparable schools in 1938 no raises were given to faculty and equipment budgets were drastically cut from 4 500 to 1 800 for chemistry department and from 9 200 to 3 800 for industrial education department by 1940 etstc employed 135 teaching faculty reynolds argued that academic standards had risen faster nationally than they had at et and noted that in 1925 etstc employed more faculty members with no college degrees or only bachelor s degrees than with master s degrees that year also marked hiring of rural education department head albert s school s first member of faculty to have earned a doctorate to address this general lack of credentials at etstc whitley implemented a policy of hiring and retaining only faculty members who had obtained advanced degrees which resulted in a majority of faculty holding degrees higher than bachelor s degrees by 1927 and by 1933 8 faculty with doctorates 72 with master s degrees and just 6 with less than a master s degree either a bachelor s degree or no degree at all whitley once confided i am doing my to shake this old faculty up here so that some of them will get ph d s but i am having dickens of a time of it in addition to academic credentials whitley also stressed proper behavior albeit not as strictly as binnion while he did not officially disapprove of dancing as his predecessor did whitley did disapprove of smoking refused to hire married women and was displeased with thought of his faculty spending their weekends in area cities perceived to be more liberal than commerce according to sawyer however at least one teacher was fired and multiple female students dismissed for dancing during binnion s presidency during 1923 24 academic year etstc was offering 370 classes in 23 different disciplines compared to 156 in 17 subjects when it became a state school in 1917 additionally high school level sub college program was gradually phased out during this period as it was reduced to only senior level of high school in late 1920s and was completely eliminated in 1931 other structural changes during etstc era came from state government in austin including a shift from mayo s old quarter system to semesters and more stringent requirements for prospective teachers and programs that educated them including a new statewide policy effective from 1934 35 that required teachers employed by schools receiving state aid to have a minimum of two years college training and to hold a state teaching certificate great depression reverberations of great depression struck texas and its economy in earnest during 1932 33 academic year with state legislature reducing etstc s budget for that year by over 35 000 over a three year period school s total budget was reduced by over 25 although did not resort to mass layoffs he did drastically reduce salaries faculty saw a 25 reduction in their compensation in fall 1934 while he himself lost his life s saving in failed banks great depression also decimated enrollment at etstc in 1933 34 it dropped by 40 from 1 953 to 1 168 students at time there were a limited number of scholarships provided by state notably for high school valedictorians as well as free tuition for spanish american war and world war i veterans while there were some campus jobs available to students including in library and cafeteria more substantive relief for students was provided by franklin d roosevelt s new deal programs including federal emergency relief administration fera and civil works administration cwa two hundred days congress programs implemented in time for 1933 34 academic year fera provided roughly 100 student jobs in 1934 which allowed students to work 55 hours a month for 0 30 an hour for a total of 15 a month 12 of students secured part time jobs that year by 1935 public works administration pwa works progress administration wpa and national youth administration nya also provided employment assistance thumb mayo hall boys dormitory in 1941 thumb east dormitory girls dormitory in 1941 nya provided between 87 and 144 jobs every year between 1935 and 1940 by 1942 43 its final year nya only employed 72 students most of whom were employed in library physical education department or registrar s office furthermore thanks to 106 000 from pwa and a 108 000 federal grant respectively etstc was able to build mayo hall a men s dormitory in 1935 and east dormitory for women later renamed henderson hall in 1939 other campus buildings built during whitley s presidency included whitley gymnasium in 1935 a new football and track stadium in 1936 a new science and industrial building and a home management house in 1936 in 1930 board of regents allowed teachers colleges in state to offer master s degrees despite whitley s opposition to idea of graduate programs as late as 1932 at which time he argued that our problems have been greatly agitated by introducing graduate work into teachers colleges at this time etstc began its graduate education program in 1935 at its inception master s programs were only offered in education english and history and both m a and m s degrees required 30 hours of graduate course work as well as a thesis only major difference was that m a had a mandatory language requirement during 1930s room and board in private homes averaged 15 a month although a room could be found for rent for just 5 not including food costs which could range between 1 and 12 50 per month for female students room and board at etstc s east dormitory cost 20 per month while west dormitory charged as little as 14 a month after it became a cooperative room rent in a dormitory for male students was 8 50 throughout 1930s full term tuition and fees totaled 34 50 or 16 50 for a six week summer session for comparison in 1923 there was no tuition but there was a blanket tax of 9 and a matriculation fee of 8 for summer term textbooks were free world war ii after japanese attack on pearl harbor at a december 10 1941 assembly president whitley advised etstc students to continue getting an education until duty calls to something else students and faculty did everything from joining military including waves for women and coordinating red cross drives and morale committees to teaching courses on subjects such as first aid maximizing food production and morse code numerous social fixtures at etstc were suspended during world war ii from sadie hawkins day to intramural sports to locust student yearbook although women s clubs remained active often by buying war bonds and donating blood in march 1942 college was selected as a war information center in its region of state in 1943 etstc hosted approximately 300 women of women s army auxiliary corps waac and later that year it did same for a company of army specialized training program astp which numbered 200 men in 1943 44 term etstc also participated in civilian pilot training program beginning in 1940 63 of its students went on to serve in army and another 28 in navy by time war ended in august 1945 63 former students had been killed in line of duty post world war ii in fall 1945 etstc s enrollment nearly doubled to 1 205 up from 633 previous year during 1947 48 academic year etstc s enrollment was 1 593 by fall 1949 enrollment reached a peak of 3 167 thus growing fivefold in only six years this boom was partially fueled by servicemen s readjustment act often referred to as g i bill under which veterans administration paid tuition and fees including cost of books and supplies for veterans up to a limit of 500 per academic year after peaking in 1949 50 student enrollment dropped to 2 162 in fall 1953 before recovering to 1949 levels in 1958 59 facing a housing shortage as enrollment surged whitley turned to makeshift solutions acquiring 20 prefabricated army dwellings from camp maxey in paris for student housing despite these and an additional 54 provided by federal government approximately 600 prospective students were turned away due to lack of housing in 1946 47 academic buildings were also needed and during end of his tenure whitley had plans for new dormitories a new women s gymnasium a 10 000 seat stadium and a swimming pool a drive to fund new stadium which was conceived as a memorial for etstc students who died in world war ii was organized by local businessman and ex students association president noble arthur who asked each faculty member to donate 75 to effort president whitley within three years of mandatory retirement age of 70 died suddenly of a heart attack while on a hunting trip on october 2 1946 sending a shocked campus and community into mourning during his 27 years at college campus expanded from to while number of buildings doubled from 6 to 12 and their value more than doubled from approximately 500 000 to more than 1 million his immediate replacement was an interim a c ferguson dean of college for past 22 years university of texas ph d was selected both to ensure continuity with whitley s administration and for his age at 69 he was a year away from mandatory retirement and could not be selected as a permanent president thus simplifying board of regent s choice on september 1 1947 ferguson officially retired and james gilliam gee was inaugurated president of etstc fifth in school s history regarded by reynolds as with possible exception of mayo unquestionably most individualistic president in school history gee s style was one of involvement engagement and impulsiveness he was a graduate of clemson university cornell university and peabody college a veteran of two world wars who had risen to rank of colonel as a staff officer under george s patton and dean and briefly acting president of sam houston state teachers college while recognizing primary importance of etstc s mission as a teacher training college gee also stressed importance of liberal pre professional education for occupations other than teaching thumb memorial stadium in 2013 as whitley had done before him gee prioritized building of sorely needed new residential and academic buildings first buying over of land for expansion of physical plant by 1948 he had led construction of three new buildings binnion hall a women s dormitory central cafeteria and a student center built from pieces of a prefabricated army service club from camp maxey by end of academic year another new building journalism and speech s dealey hall joined them more than doubling value of etstc s physical plant to 4 140 000 from 1 800 000 1950 and 1951 also witnessed major growth especially for athletic buildings memorial stadium field house and a swimming pool were all built in addition to a new administration building that later became education north building spree continued throughout 1950s as numerous academic departments ranging from agriculture and audio visual education to industrial education and music moved into new buildings gee spearheaded numerous changes to college s programs in addition to its physical plant he shut down etstc training school in 1948 after it had served as a laboratory for teacher training program since college became a state institution in 1917 he also terminated department of rural education and moved most of its courses into department of education in 1948 same year that journalism was moved out of department of english and joined with speech to form a new department of journalism and speech in 1952 etstc created a school of education that grew throughout decade with audio visual education being elevated to departmental status in 1956 one of gee s main initiatives as president was to increase number of faculty members holding ph d s when he was named president in 1947 only 21 of 111 faculty held doctorate degrees 70 had master s degrees while just 8 of 24 department heads had ph d s gee implemented a policy of only hiring professors who already held doctorate degrees or who promised to him that they would work toward them and he even threatened currently employed faculty who did not make progress toward a ph d with demotion by 1957 59 of etstc s 132 faculty members held doctorates one especially notable faculty member of period was historian louis r harlan a noted biographer of booker t washington he was a professor at college between 1950 and 1959 who was advised by nannie tilley prior to teaching at university of cincinnati and university of maryland gee was known for taking a hard line with his faculty holding them to a dress code requiring them to attend mandatory meetings and preventing them from owning a business in addition to working for college which was a common previous practice while a stickler for detail and at times petty he was a staunch supporter of academic freedom according to reynolds even his enemies never accused him of punishing a single teacher for what they taught etstc was renamed east texas state college in 1957 after texas legislature recognized broadening scope of institution controversies gee rayburn feud thumb sam rayburn with his blunt direct and at times profane style gee was no stranger to creating enemies and sparking controversies one of great controversies of his tenure as president was his feud with sam rayburn congressman representing hunt county and an alumnus of college feud apparently began with conservative and segregationist gee s opposition to changes in democratic party and rayburn s apparent support for them especially new deal and president s committee on civil rights appointed by harry s truman in 1946 in 1948 gee backed g c morris of greenville then a state senator in his effort to defeat rayburn in 1948 democratic primary while morris had demonstrated strong support for higher education while serving in austin reynolds declared gee s decision a daring gamble to support opponent of one who was arguably most powerful man in congress and indisputably et s most distinguished alumnus despite gee helping to organize a morris for congress club and even dropping campaign fliers from an airplane over commerce and greenville rayburn won primary handily leading many to fear that congressman might retaliate against gee although he declared i didn t want anything to do with gee rayburn developed a relationship with frank young dean of college and in 1949 and 1950 helped etstc obtain an air force reserve officer training corps unit and funding for a new vocational agriculture program rift between gee and rayburn never healed years later gee called rayburn my personal enemy during a faculty meeting and after learning of rayburn s death he remarked that some on campus complained that i had not bowed knee in an appropriate manner to pseudo deity that some would make of our politically distinguished and recently deceased alumnus gee s animosity towards rayburn even extended to sign on new sam rayburn memorial student center on campus which read simply memorial student center throughout his presidency and may have prevented college from obtaining sam rayburn library which was instead established in bonham general studies program another major controversy involving gee was general studies program which began with a recommendation from texas education agency that teacher education programs include more liberal arts in their curricula after convening in 1951 a faculty steering committee addressing issue delivered its recommendations in 1955 a core curriculum emphasizing democratic values that consisted of 14 courses in liberal arts sciences and social sciences that would be required for all etstc students during their freshman and sophomore years controversy began in earnest when v clyde arnspiger was named director of general studies program in 1955 and developed a list of eight values power respect wealth enlightenment skill well being rectitude and affection which he contended should be framework for all general studies courses which angered and alienated many of faculty according to sawyer gee insisted that every course must be taught with a utilitarian objective committee and gee fully supported arnspiger and his framework but there were dissidents most notably two department heads nannie tilley of history and l d parsons of chemistry as well as an unconfirmed story about a music professor who sarcastically demonstrated how a bach fugue exemplified arnspiger s eight values after sharp criticism of program was published in greenville s herald banner and dallas morning news which lampooned it as a sort of tossed salad with sociology as a thousand islands dressing and an anti general studies demonstration was organized by students in fall 1957 controversy reached fever pitch in spring 1958 when gee supported by board of regents removed tilley and parsons from their positions as department heads however administration then quickly retreated from arnspiger s doctrinaire approach to framework and after 1958 it made no substantive effort to force faculty to abide by it an investigation by board of regents into general studies program revealed no wrongdoing and in june 1958 arnspiger even received a citation from shattuck school in faribault minnesota that proclaimed etsc general studies program has been commended by eastern and northern educators segregation president gee was a staunch segregationist who prevented integration at east texas state for much of his presidency after a supreme court decision that ruled against segregation of university of texas school of law in 1950 and landmark brown v board of education ruling in 1954 gee had refused to admit african americans who applied claiming that board of regents and constitution of texas had mandated that those of different races must be segregated etstc was one of last three state teachers college system institutions to integrate as both sam houston state teachers college in huntsville and stephen f austin state college in nacogdoches also refused to admit african americans who applied for admission starting in 1954 as framed by historian shabazz key question facing university system and state officials at time was how long should they trample constitutional rights of blacks to appease white supremacists gee dug in his heels on issue of integration and declared that he had no other alternative than to do what texas state teachers college board of regents mandated college would not integrate until forced to do so by board of regents in 1964 athletics thumb 1923 east texas state lions baseball team intercollegiate athletics were a bright spot during etstc era school s baseball team won several texas intercollegiate athletic association titles in 1920s before program was dropped in 1930 for financial reasons 1930s were also a banner decade for sports at etstc after state board of education required public schools to offer physical education in 1930 etstc s department of physical education began offering majors for both men and women in 1931 and glenn brush maloney was named school s first director of intramural sports that year although women were not included in intramural program while 169 male students participated in intramural basketball alone in 1939 female students organized a physical education club and women s athletic association in 1931 etstc joined lone star conference lsc as a founding member in which it competed in men s basketball football tennis and track lions football team was particularly successful winning five lsc championships and a share of a sixth between 1933 and 1943 1934 team considered one of et s greatest by reynolds and institution s first truly great team by sawyer finished season undefeated and untied conceding a total of only six points against football team was well supported by student body during this period drawing attendances of up to 10 000 at home as well as road support in abilene san marcos and especially denton home of etstc s archrival north texas state teachers college ntstc ntstc students and alumni also traveled to commerce to attend football games against etstc budget for men s athletics grew from 27 050 in 1935 36 to 47 291 in 1940 41 while only 56 80 was spent on women s athletics in 1940 41 which in reynolds words graphically illustrated that intercollegiate sports was still exclusive preserve of male after finishing in second place in lsc in 1946 and winning conference championship in 1949 football team won five straight conference championships from 1951 to 1955 golden fifties also applied to men s basketball which after winning shares of lsc conference title in 1947 48 and 1949 50 won or shared conference championships five times between 1952 53 and 1957 58 team also won naia national basketball tournament in 1954 55 student life 175px left thumb kalir club in 1923 1920s and 1930s have been referred to as truly golden age of student clubs at east texas state among most notable of clubs during this period were free spirited and unusual mystic order of slippery ten which was organized in 1923 and ogima current events society for young men which became first club on campus to be sanctioned by administration when it was founded in 1926 during binnion s tenure as president female students were barred from eating at either men s boarding houses or at downtown restaurants sawyer described him as terribly overprotective of girls general social conservatism persisted into ferguson s presidency as a june 1947 poll of female students revealed that less than 1 of them believed that they should be permitted to wear shorts anywhere they wanted to although a 1935 survey revealed that 94 of student body had 5 or less in spending money a month local attractions such as theaters cafes hamburger stands and soda fountains proved popular in 1938 more than half of college s students were working their way through their education a 1941 survey demonstrated that only 30 of students regularly attended church services although college sunday school class offered by first baptist church was so well attended in 1930s sometimes by as many as 350 students that it was taught in a theater in downtown commerce car excursions and alcohol were also popular among etstc students in 1930s especially when paris legalized alcohol after prohibition was repealed in 1933 although drinking and smoking as well as breaking curfew for female students were cause for suspension or even expulsion 175px thumb queen of may 1923 dating was also popular among students it was enabled by an extension of curfew for female students from 8pm to 11pm and often took place at soda fountains theaters or churches not to mention a variety of creative locations chosen for their privacy including cars city park or even cemeteries student clubs and saturday night dances which were hosted in library s reading room also provided inexpensive entertainment for student body one dance was even played by lawrence welk and his band before they attained major fame annual events were also very popular especially sadie hawkins day and may fete a springtime precursor of modern homecoming during 1920s and 1930s etstc also provided its students with a wide range of cultural opportunities both in form of performing artists such as john philip sousa united states marine band and boston english opera company as well as noted speakers such as frances perkins emily post and carl sandburg public figures such as governor james allred and senator a m aikin jr also spoke at chapel which had significantly changed since mayo days it was only held twice weekly instead of daily was voluntary and had long since lost any spiritual connotation student activities evolved after world war ii with a lackluster effort to revive sadie hawkins day in 1945 preceding more successful western week and orphan s christmas which debuted in 1947 and 1948 respectively homecoming which had traditionally been celebrated in spring as may fete was moved to fall in 1949 to correspond with a football game which increased student participation notes references 1923
