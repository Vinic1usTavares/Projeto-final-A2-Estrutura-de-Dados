despite courage of his actions during raid ritchie was not initially recommended for victoria cross delayed by discussion at admiralty concerning correct medal to award it was not until 24 april 1915

exclusive west end edinburgh and leith post office directory 1880 81 henry was educated at george watson s boys college and blair lodge before he enrolled on training ship hms britannia at age of fourteen in 1890 rapidly rising in navy due to keen intelligence and impressive strength ritchie was promoted to lieutenant six years later and served for next fifteen years as a junior staff officer at sheerness gunnery school in 1900 ritchie became armed forces lightweight boxing champion and was runner up in same contest following year p 6 naval vcs stephen snelling in july 1902 he was posted to battleship hms sans pareil docked in medway as part of reserve squadron whilst stationed at sheerness he met and married christiana lilian jardine with whom he had two daughters his shore service ended in march 1911 when he was posted as senior lieutenant to pre dreadnought battleship hms goliath promoted to commander later that year he managed ship s gunnery exercises and procedures while goliath was part of channel fleet stationed in british waters it was said by one of his junior officers that ritchie had reputation of being very strict but i always found him most fair p 7 naval vcs stephen snelling war service thumb 300px right at outbreak of world war i goliath was ordered to indian ocean to lead a blockade of german colony of german east africa and specifically its main port at dar es salaam it was feared by admiralty that german navy would use its colonial ports to support commerce raiding cruisers such as sms emden or sms konigsberg both of which were known to be operating in indian ocean at that time p 1 naval vcs stephen snelling this concern was amplified because konigsberg blockaded in delta of rufiji river had operated from dar es salaam in early months of war and had sunk british cruiser hms pegasus on a raid from port remaining in dar es salaam s large natural harbour were german cargo ships ss konig and ss feldmarschall hospital ship ss tabora and several smaller coastal vessels all of which could conceivably be used to resupply trapped cruiser should they leave port despite a declaration from german governor heinrich schnee that neither harbour nor its ships would be used for military purposes decision was taken by british admiral herbert king hall that shipping in port must nevertheless be neutralised p 2 naval vcs stephen snelling germans had pre emptively scuttled a blockship in port s entrance channel with intention of preventing goliath and other heavy british warships from entering harbour to shell undefended city with close range bombardment impossible british assembled assault teams with volunteers from small blockading flotilla their mission was to augment existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in port thus denying its use to germans as well command of assault was given to commander ritchie as second most senior officer present and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats dupleix and helmuth to carry his raiding parties raid on dar es salaam thumb right 225px in 1905 this was main street of city and was very badly damaged by naval bombardment during and after raid day prior to raid decision was taken that in order to allow germans time to evacuate target ships and minimise casualties they would be warned of british intentions in a brief parley german defenders requested that british conduct their operations under a white flag which request was denied ritchie was informed that he could begin his assault on following morning of 28 november 1914 due to a breakdown aboard dupleix before it reached harbour ritchie had to begin his assault with only helmuth and a handful of small boats and launches from blockading ships there were no signs of life on target ships as ritchie s flotilla moved uncontested into port and shoreline was described by officers in raiding party as utterly deserted and cool and inviting shortly after 10 00 raiders laid explosive charges on abandoned konig and feldmarschall however they were then challenged by port s commanding officer who questioned their right to be in anchorage and demanded to be permitted to observe their actions in order that he could make a report in a meeting aboard helmuth it was explained to him that british orders were to disable german assets in harbour and that being at war his permission was unnecessary after some discussion he was persuaded to disembark so that helmuth could continue operations p 3 naval vcs stephen snelling leaving demolition parties aboard cargo vessels ritchie then took helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping but small ship grounded on a sandbar assuming route was blocked he returned to two cargo ships on one of expedition s small launches it was at this stage whilst conducting a final inspection that he made discovery of a large number of empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in holds of cargo ships deducing that german crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave harbour despite this discovery ritchie resolved to continue as ordered he took precaution of sending helmuth to harbour entrance to cover withdrawal and gathered together several small boats moored in harbour these he secured around his launch providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in engagement he was sure would ensue first world war com how commander henry peel ritchie won v c at dar es salaam retrieved on 27 may 2007 with preparations complete one of ritchie s boats from cruiser hms fox moved to harbour entrance there it was met with a hail of fire from shore where hidden german crews and town garrison had lain in wait helmuth was also attacked but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety carrying several wounded from outside harbour fox and goliath responded with a heavy barrage demolishing several streets in town including governor s palace ritchie aboard only remaining british boat in harbour attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard german hospital ship ss tabora to conduct a medical inspection p 4 naval vcs stephen snelling this effort was unsuccessful and on leaving harbour ritchie s launch came under sustained fire from machine guns rifles and light artillery with most of his crew wounded ritchie refused to relinquish his place at helm until he had steered his boat to safety he was discovered simply smothered in blood and barely conscious by goliath s crew when they went to his aid in battleship s pinnace ritchie was rushed to sick bay where it was ascertained that he had been hit in eight separate places p 5 naval vcs stephen snelling raid had cost british one dead fourteen seriously wounded and twelve captured after they were left behind in confusion raiders had in turn immobilised three large merchant vessels and destroyed several shore installations as well as taking thirty five prisoners two days later with wounded hospitalised in zanzibar goliath and fox returned to dar es salaam and reduced most of seafront to rubble setting fire to several other districts of town as well this reprisal served only to turn hitherto neutral local populace against british feelings ran high in both camps following raid with british claiming that white flags flying from several shore installations should have prevented any german attack and germans insisting that british had attempted to capture their merchant vessels crews despite promises not to do so according to stephen snelling in naval vcs both sides had entered operation with intention of breaching predetermined agreements retirement and victoria cross ten were honoured for their role in operation seven receiving distinguished service medals two conspicuous gallantry medal and one grievously wounded ritchie victoria cross ritchie had not initially been recommended for this award recommendation being submitted at a later date by an unidentified figure in admiralty snelling speculates that admiralty s change of heart was possibly a morale boosting measure although ritchie s courage during action was never called into question shrapnel and bullet wounds he sustained in raid were extensive including injuries to his forehead left thumb left arm twice right arm right hip and a badly broken right leg after being hit by two large calibre machine gun bullets ritchie spent six weeks in hospital in zanzibar before he was considered well enough to be transported home in england he recovered during spring of 1915 at plymouth hospital with his family present although judged fit in late february ritchie was assigned light duties and was not returned to goliath a disappointment which proved fortunate for him when she was sunk off dardanelles in may 1915 by turkish destroyer with loss of five hundred lives his victoria cross was presented by king george v at buckingham palace in april 1915 promoted acting captain he retired in 1917 having been deemed unfit for further service as a legacy of wounds he had received following his retirement ritchie settled with his family back in his home city of edinburgh and lived a quiet and uneventful retirement he was not involved in any official capacity during second world war and died at his home in 1958 ritchie was cremated at grave location for holders of victoria cross in city of edinburgh retrieved on 27 may 2007 there are no memorials or headstones dedicated to him today
