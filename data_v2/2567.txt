was a japanese naval operation plan in 1945 consisting of four likely scenarios its first scenario operation heaven one or ten ichi go tian yi hao became last major japanese naval operation in pacific theater of world war ii resulting engagement is also known as battle of east china sea in april 1945 largest battleship in world along with nine other japanese warships embarked from japan on a deliberate suicide attack upon allied forces engaged in battle of okinawa japanese force was attacked stopped and almost completely destroyed by u s carrier borne aircraft before reaching okinawa yamato and five other japanese warships were sunk battle demonstrated u s air supremacy in asiatic pacific theater by this stage in war and vulnerability of surface ships without air cover to aerial attack battle also exhibited japan s willingness to sacrifice entire ships even pride of its fleet in desperate kamikaze attacks aimed at slowing allied advance on japanese home islands background by early 1945 following solomon islands campaign battle of philippine sea and battle of leyte gulf once formidable imperial japanese navy s combined fleet was reduced to just a handful of operational warships and a few remaining aircraft and aircrew most of remaining japanese warships in combined fleet were stationed at ports in japan with most of large ships at kure hiroshima hara japanese destroyer captain 274 as a final step before planned invasion of japanese home islands allied forces invaded okinawa on 1 april 1945 in march in briefing emperor hirohito on japan s response to expected okinawan invasion japanese military leaders explained that imperial japanese army was planning extensive air attacks including use of kamikaze emperor then reportedly asked but what about navy what are they doing to assist in defending okinawa have we no more ships now feeling pressured by emperor to also mount some kind of attack japan s navy commanders conceived a kamikaze type mission for their remaining operational large ships which included battleship yamato feifer battle of okinawa 7 resulting plan drafted under direction of commander in chief of combined fleet admiral toyoda requiem xiii called for yamato and her escorts to attack u s fleet supporting u s troops landing on west of island yamato and her escorts were to fight their way to okinawa and then beach themselves between higashi and and fight as shore batteries until they were destroyed once ships were destroyed their surviving crewmembers were supposed to abandon ship and fight u s forces on land very little if any air cover could be provided for ships which would render them almost helpless to concentrated attacks from us carrier based aircraft in preparation for executing plan assigned ships left kure for tokuyama yamaguchi off japan on 29 march yoshida requiem 6 7 however despite obeying orders to prepare for mission vice admiral seiichi ito commander of ten go force still refused to actually order his ships to carry it out believing plan to be futile and wasteful yoshida requiem 62 other commanders of imperial japanese navy also had very negative feelings about operation believing that it was a waste of human life and fuel captain atsushi oi who commanded escort fleets was critical as fuel and resources were diverted from his operation as he was told that aim of this operation was tradition and glory of navy he shouted this war is of our nation and why should honor of our surface fleet be more respected who cares about their glory damn fools atsushi oi vice admiral ryunosuke kusaka flew from tokyo to tokuyama on 5 april in a final attempt to convince assembled commanders of combined fleet including admiral ito to accept plan upon first hearing of proposed operation it had been kept secret from most of them combined fleet commanders and captains unanimously joined admiral ito in rejecting it for same reasons that he had expressed admiral kusaka then explained that navy s attack would help divert u s aircraft away from army s planned kamikaze attacks on u s fleet at okinawa he also explained that japan s national leadership including emperor were expecting navy to make their best effort to support defense of okinawa upon hearing this combined fleet commanders relented and accepted proposed plan ships crews were briefed on nature of mission and given opportunity to stay behind if desired none did however approximately 80 crew members who were new sick or infirm were ordered off ships including sixty seven naval cadets of etajima naval academy class no 74 who had arrived on battleship three days earlier hara japanese destroyer captain 277 ships crews now engaged in some last minute intense drills to prepare for mission mostly practicing damage control procedures yoshida requiem 15 at midnight ships were fueled reportedly in secret defiance of orders to provide ships with only just enough fuel to reach okinawa tokuyama personnel actually gave yamato and other ships almost all of remaining fuel in port although this probably still was not enough to allow force to return to japan from okinawa spurr a glorious way to die 162 165 in a ceremonial farewell officers and enlisted men drank sake together prelude thumb routes to area of battle at 16 00 on 6 april yamato with admiral ito on board light cruiser and eight destroyers departed tokuyama to begin mission yoshida requiem 30 two american submarines and sighted japanese force as it proceeded south through bungo suido although they were unable to attack due to ships speed they did spend several hours shadowing japanese sortie and sending updates of its course to u s fleet submarines messages which were reportedly sent were also picked up by radio operators on japanese ships skulski battleship yamato 12 eight japanese destroyers involved in operation were and at dawn on 7 april japanese force passed osumi peninsula into open ocean heading south from kyushu toward okinawa they shifted into a defensive formation with yahagi leading yamato and eight destroyers deployed in a ring around two larger ships with each ship from each other and proceeding at yoshida requiem 47 49 one of japanese destroyers developed engine trouble and turned back u s reconnaissance aircraft began to shadow main force of ships at 10 00 japanese force turned west to make it look like they were withdrawing but at 11 30 after being detected by two american pbm mariner flying boats yamato fired a salvo with her bow guns using special but could not prevent two planes from shadowing japanese force they turned back towards okinawa upon receiving contact reports early on 7 april u s 5th fleet commander admiral raymond spruance ordered task force 54 which consisted mostly of modernized standard type battleships under command of rear admiral morton deyo which were engaged in shore bombardment to intercept and destroy japanese sortie deyo moved to execute his orders but vice admiral marc a mitscher who commanded task force 58 tf 58 preempted spruance and deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers without informing spruance until after launches were completed triumph in pacific by e b potter also history of united states naval operations in world war ii by samuel eliot morison as a senior naval aviation officer mitscher had spent a career fighting battleship admirals who had steered navy s thinking for most of current century one of those was his immediate superior raymond spruance mitscher felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry though carriers had mostly fought great battles of pacific whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt here was an opportunity to end debate forever around 10 00 on 7 april task groups 58 1 and 58 3 tg 58 1 and 58 3 began launching almost 400 aircraft in several waves from eight carriers tg 58 1 tg 58 3 and that were located just east of okinawa aircraft consisted of f6f hellcat and f4u corsair fighters sb2c helldiver dive bombers and tbf avenger torpedo bombers after being informed of mitscher s launches spruance agreed that airstrikes could go ahead as planned as a contingency spruance ordered admiral deyo to assemble a force of six battleships and together with seven cruisers including large cruisers and and 21 destroyers and to prepare for a surface engagement with yamato should airstrikes prove unsuccessful order of battle final sortie of imperial japanese navy 7 april garzke and dulin speculate that likely outcome of a battle between these two surface forces would have been a victory for allies but at a serious cost due to large margin of superiority yamato held over american battleships in firepower 460 mm vs 356 mm armour and speed vs garzke and dulin 1985 p 60 battle thumb aircraft such as this sb2c helldiver begin their attacks on nova sinking around 12 00 first american aircraft arrived over yamato these were f6f hellcat and f4u corsair fighters which were under orders to deal with any japanese aircraft that might appear to defend ships below none did garzke and dulin 1985 pp 60 61 since it soon became obvious that japanese force had no air cover u s aircraft were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from japanese aircraft u s bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over yamato group after their two hour flight from okinawa were thus able to circle japanese ship formation just out of anti aircraft range in order to methodically set up their attacks on warships below first wave of u s carrier planes were spotted by a japanese lookout on bridge at 12 32 two minutes later yamato opened fire with her 460 mm main batteries japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to beginning evasive maneuvers and opened fire with their anti aircraft guns yamato carried almost 150 anti aircraft guns including her massive 460 mm main guns that fired san shiki anti aircraft shells yoshida requiem 62 64 u s pilots deduced that use of san shiki and colored gunfire meant that yamato s gunners relied on visual aiming and ranging rather than being radar directed and as a result were missing with great consistency despite storm of fire that they put up american f6f hellcat and f4u corsair fighters were supposed to go first strafing rocketing dropping light ordnance distracting enemy gunners while sb2c helldivers plunged almost straight down with their heavy armor piercing bombs this was because tbm avenger torpedo bombers needed all distraction and diversion they could get when they made their dangerous low altitude runs straight at enemy ships avengers mainly attacked from port side so that if torpedoes hit that side it would increase likelihood of target ship capsizing yoshida requiem 74 thumb under intense bomb and torpedo com at 12 46 a torpedo hit yahagi directly in her engine room killing entire engineering room crew and bringing her to a complete stop yahagi was hit by at least six more torpedoes and 12 bombs by succeeding waves of air attacks japanese destroyer attempted to come to aid but was attacked and heavily damaged and sank sometime later yahagi capsized and sank at 14 05 hara japanese destroyer captain 298 during first attack wave despite evasive maneuvers that caused most of bombs and torpedoes aimed at her to miss yamato was hit by two armor piercing bombs and one torpedo yoshida requiem 66 her speed was not affected but one of bombs started a fire aft of superstructure that was not extinguished also during first attack wave japanese destroyers and were heavily damaged and taken out of battle hamakaze sank later thumb right yamato listing to port and on fire between 13 20 and 14 15 second and third waves of u s aircraft attacked concentrating on yamato during this time yamato was hit by at least eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs bombs did extensive damage to topside of ship including knocking out power to gun directors and forcing anti aircraft guns to be individually and manually aimed and fired greatly reducing their effectiveness yoshida requiem 78 torpedo hits almost all on port side caused yamato to list enough that capsizing was now an imminent danger yoshida requiem 80 water damage control station had been destroyed by a bomb hit making it impossible to counter flood specially designed spaces within ship s hull to counteract hull damage at 13 33 in a desperate attempt to keep ship from capsizing yamatos damage control team counter flooded both starboard engine and boiler rooms this mitigated danger but also drowned several hundred crewmen manning those stations who were given no notice that their compartments were about to fill with water yoshida requiem 82 feifer battle of okinawa 17 25 loss of starboard engines plus weight of water caused yamato to slow to about yoshida requiem 83 at that same moment americans launched another 110 aircraft from task group 58 twenty avengers made a new torpedo run from 60 degrees to port yamato started a sharp turn to port but three torpedoes ripped into her port side amidships jamming her auxiliary rudder in position hard port http www combinedfleet com yamato htm with yamato proceeding more slowly and therefore easier to target u s torpedo aircraft concentrated on hitting her rudder and stern with torpedoes in order to affect her steering ability which they succeeded in doing yoshida requiem 95 96 at 14 02 after being informed that ship could no longer steer and was unavoidably sinking admiral ito ordered mission canceled crew to abandon ship and for remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors yamato communicated this message to other surviving ships by signal flag because her radios had been destroyed yoshida requiem 108 thumb only known photo of yamato exploding at 14 05 yamato was stopped dead in water and began to capsize admiral ito and captain aruga refused to abandon her with rest of survivors at 14 20 yamato capsized completely and began to sink at 14 23 she suddenly blew up with an explosion so large that it was reportedly heard and seen away in kagoshima and sent up a mushroom shaped cloud almost into air yoshida requiem 118 japanese survivor mitsuru yoshida said that her large explosion downed several u s planes observing her end explosion is believed to have occurred when fires ignited by bomb hits reached main magazines skulski battleship yamato 13 attempting to make it back to port japanese destroyer was bombed and sunk with all hands by u s aircraft japanese destroyer was also crippled by u s carrier aircraft attack during battle and had to be scuttled by other relatively undamaged japanese destroyers suzutsuki despite her bow being blown off was able to make it to sasebo japan by steaming in reverse entire way remaining three less damaged japanese destroyers and were able to rescue 280 survivors from yamato sources differ on size of yamatos crew giving it as between 2 750 and 3 300 men plus 555 survivors from yahagi out of a crew of 1 000 and just over 800 survivors from isokaze hamakaze and kasumi between 3 700 and 4 250 japanese naval personnel perished in battle jentshura p 39 says that 2 498 yamato crewmen died combinedfleet com says 3 063 on yamato died one possible reason for part of discrepancy in numbers is that admiral ito s staff may not have been included in total ship s complement abe saburo yamato kantai special attack fleet yamato kasumi co 1995 gives following breakdown in deaths for japanese in operation yamato 3056 killed 276 survivors yahagi 446 killed isokaze 20 killed hamakaze 100 killed yukikaze 3 killed kasumi 17 killed 326 killed all hands fuyutsuki 12 killed suzutsuki 57 killed ships took survivors to sasebo yoshida requiem 140 thumb yamato moments after explosion a total of 10 u s aircraft were shot down by anti aircraft fire from japanese ships some of aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine in total u s lost 12 men some of japanese survivors reported that u s fighter aircraft strafed japanese survivors floating in water then americans started to shoot with machine guns at people who were floating so we all had to dive under hara japanese destroyer captain 301 japanese survivors also reported that u s aircraft temporarily halted their attacks on japanese destroyers during time that destroyers were busy picking up survivors from water yoshida requiem 144 aerial kamikaze attacks during battle japanese army conducted an air attack on u s naval fleet at okinawa as promised but they failed to sink any ships around 115 aircraft many of them kamikaze attacked u s ships throughout day of 7 april kamikaze aircraft hit aircraft carrier hancock battleship and destroyer causing moderate damage to hancock and maryland and heavy damage to bennett about 100 of japanese aircraft were lost in attack hara japanese destroyer captain 304 aftermath ten go was last major japanese naval operation of war and remaining japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations for rest of conflict suzutsuki was never repaired fuyutsuki was repaired but hit a u s air dropped mine at moji japan on 20 august 1945 and was not subsequently repaired yukikaze survived war almost undamaged hit a u s air dropped mine on 30 july 1945 near maizuru japan and was 129th and last japanese destroyer sunk in war hara japanese destroyer captain 281 maryland was kept out of war following kamikaze attacks okinawa was declared secure by allied forces on 21 june 1945 minear requiem xiv after an intense and costly battle japan surrendered in august 1945 after being bombed twice with atomic weapons apparent willingness of japan to sacrifice so many of its people using suicidal tactics such as operation ten go and in battle of okinawa reportedly was a factor in american decision to employ atomic weapons against japan feifer battle of okinawa 410 430 story of operation ten go is revered to some degree in modern japan as evidenced by appearances of story in popular japanese culture which usually portray event as a brave selfless but futile symbolic effort by participating japanese sailors to defend their homeland one of reasons event may have such significance in japanese culture is that word yamato was often used as a poetic name for japan thus end of battleship yamato could serve as a metaphor for end of japanese empire minear requiem xvii jiji press yamato survivor 87 recalls doomed mission japan times 20 august 2015 references footnotes
