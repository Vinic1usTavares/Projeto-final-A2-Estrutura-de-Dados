1996 north indian ocean cyclone season featured several deadly tropical cyclones with over 2 000 people killed during year india meteorological department imd regional specialized meteorological center for northern indian ocean as recognized by world meteorological organization issued warnings for nine tropical cyclones in region storms were also tracked on an unofficial basis by american based joint typhoon warning center which observed one additional storm basin is split between bay of bengal off east coast of india and arabian sea off west coast during year activity was affected by monsoon season with most storms forming in june or after october first system originated on may 7 in bay of bengal which is body of water east of india storm developed in tandem with a storm in southern hemisphere and ultimately struck bangladesh three storms formed in june first struck oman and later caused devastating flooding in yemen killing 338 people and causing 1 2 billion in damage other two storms struck opposite sides of india collectively resulting in 226 deaths after causing widespread flooding after a brief land depression in july and a weak depression in early october season featured four notable cyclones beginning in late october a low pressure area moved across southern india killing 388 people before taking an unusual track in arabian sea at end of october a deep depression killed 14 people in bangladesh strongest cyclone of season was also deadliest killing 1 077 people when it struck andhra pradesh in early november final storm of season executed a rare loop in bay of bengal before weakening and striking southern india in early december killing seven toc season summary during season imd used satellite imagery and surface data to assess and predict storms agency also utilized a tropical cyclone forecast model that used climatology and a storm s persistence to forecast future movement warnings and advisories were broadcast throughout india by telegraph and news media basin s activity is sub divided between arabian sea and bay of bengal on opposite coasts of india and is generally split before and after monsoon season imd tracked nine tropical disturbances including one that developed over land which is below average of 13 systems five of storms formed from october to december after end of monsoon season in general storms moved slower than average and two of cyclones took unusual tracks near land one executed a rare loop in bay of bengal and another turned abruptly away from indian state of gujarat according to jtwc activity in basin was 60 greater than average with eight tropical cyclones four of these storms attained hurricane intensity winds of at least 120 km h 75 mph which was a record at time during june a series of storms affected india in height of monsoon season two storms on opposite sides of country contributed to northward progression of monsoon continued rainfall from monsoon led to additional flooding as of july 24 flooding from widespread rains had killed 731 people across india floods also wrecked 368 420 houses and ruined of crop fields monsoon became reestablished over open waters on october 9 spawning two storms in basin that month there were two simultaneous storms on opposite sides of india in october which would not happen again until may 2010 systems deep depression bob 01 01b in early may a westerly wind burst spawned two disturbances on both sides of equator in eastern indian ocean in association with monsoon trough system in southern hemisphere eventually became tropical storm jenna while system in northern hemisphere developed an area of convection about 445 km 275 mi northwest of sumatra this disturbance moved generally northward and initially remained disorganized thunderstorms were removed from circulation however jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on may 5 once system became better organized amid low wind shear rounding periphery of a ridge system turned to northeast based on appearance on satellite imagery jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 01b at 00 00 utc on may 7 three hours later imd classified system as a depression about 400 km 250 mi south of kolkata storm intensified further while moving toward southeastern bangladesh jtwc upgraded it to a 75 km h 45 mph tropical storm while imd upgraded it to a deep depression around 00 00 utc on may 8 storm made landfall along cox s bazar district quickly weakening over land system dissipated over northern myanmar later that day system brought rainfall to southeastern india and bangladesh upazila in latter country recorded of precipitation on may 7 a station in cox s bazar recorded peak winds of 75 km h 45 mph storm produced high tides that flooded villages on coast while one girl was swept away by high waves high winds knocked down trees and houses there were 140 fishermen missing following storm on 10 boats tropical storm 02a on may 31 a weak circulation persisted over warm waters of gulf of aden it moved east northeastward along coast of yemen and oman bringing dry air from north which decreased convection system moved farther offshore on june 7 into open arabian sea where it interacted with south west monsoon and developed more convection convection became more persistent by june 9 about 1 480 km 920 mi northeast of somalia by june 9 moving northwestward system organized enough for jtwc to classify it as tropical cyclone 02a about 160 km 100 mi from oman coastline this marked first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in gulf of aden later on june 11 it struck oman s southeast coast storm weakened over land dissipating on june 12 although it continued to produce rainfall heavy at times over next few days imd did not track system offshore oman storm s rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat killing one person in latter incident striking oman storm produced significant rainfall totals well above monthly average peaking at in dhofar region strong winds where storm moved ashore damaged buildings and local water plant rains washed out roads and isolated villages killing two people due to drowning in al ghubra however effects were more severe in yemen where floods were considered worst on record storm produced heaviest rainfall in 70 years reaching in ma rib flood waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges some of them dating back 2 000 years to roman era storm washed away topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields accounting for us 100 million in agriculture damage at least 1 820 houses were destroyed many of them built on wadis or dry river beds overall damage was estimated at us 1 2 billion and there were 338 deaths in yemen world bank assisted in a project to rebuild damaged infrastructure in yemen and to mitigate against future floods cyclonic storm bob 02 03b on june 9 a disturbance began forming within monsoon trough off southeast coast of india inflow from south helped system organize and convection became more defined on june 11 at 06 00 utc next day jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 03b and three hours later imd classified it as a depression a ridge to east initially steered system to northwest although an approaching trough turned it to northeast parallel to coastline early on june 13 jtwc assessed peak 1 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph and on next day imd upgraded system to a cyclonic storm both intensity and track were unusual for month of june at 00 00 utc on june 16 imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 85 km h 50 mph around which time storm turned back to northwest five hours later storm made landfall near visakhapatnam andhra pradesh and it rapidly weakened into a remnant low jtwc continued tracking remnants until june 18 when system was over madhya pradesh about 3 000 people evacuated ahead of storm in andhra pradesh when storm struck state highest winds on land were around 55 km h 35 mph however most severe effects were due to heavy rainfall in part due to storm s interaction with monsoon chennai in northeastern tamil nadu recorded on june 14 breaking 100 year old record for greatest june daily rainfall total three people died near city after rains flooded streets highest daily rainfall was in khammam district in telangana widespread areas in andhra pradesh received over of precipitation locally peaking at causing flooding that breached reservoirs and damaged 3 833 canals in flood waters reached 6 m 20 ft deep forcing 1 500 people to leave their homes floods also damaged of crop fields with damage to bananas coconuts and mangroves storm damaged or destroyed 1 594 homes leaving over 3 000 families homeless overall damage was estimated at rs 820 million us 23 5 million in andhra pradesh and there were 68 deaths in state mostly due to flash flooding elsewhere in india storm killed 111 people including 44 in tamil nadu where 18 boats were damaged or missing in some areas rains helped end a drought after storm passed andhra pradesh government provided each family rs 1 000 us 30 if their house was destroyed and rs 100 000 us 3 000 if they lost a family member severe cyclonic storm arb 01 04a while previous storm was paralleling east indian coastline another disturbance formed off west coast on june 15 also associated with monsoon new area of convection persisted developing a distinct circulation by next day early on june 17 a depression developed about 365 km 265 mi west of mumbai at 18 00 utc that day jtwc classified it as tropical cyclone 04a after wind field became more defined system moved to northeast within influence of monsoon and quickly intensified due to an anticyclone aloft providing favorable conditions on june 18 imd upgraded system to a cyclonic storm and further to a severe cyclonic storm by 18 00 utc that day at 23 00 utc storm made landfall on gujarat near diu only fourth cyclone since 1891 to strike state in june an hour later imd assessed peak 3 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph based on appearance of an eye feature meanwhile jtwc assessed slightly stronger 1 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph equivalent to a minimal hurricane storm turned northward and slowly weakened degenerating into a remnant low over rajasthan on june 20 before being swept up by an approaching trough storm moved ashore with a high storm surge estimated at in bharuch winds reached 85 km h 53 mph in veraval while heavy rainfall spread across region totaling over in some parts of gujarat south of landfall point high winds and waves washed 10 boats ashore near mumbai forcing crews to be rescued by helicopters storm disrupted wheat production and port operations in western india in gujarat storm uprooted trees and damaged of crop fields with 2 113 cattle killed between gujarat and neighboring maharashtra to south storm damaged 41 134 houses in two states and overall damage was estimated at rs 196 million us 5 6 million there were 47 deaths related to cyclone land depression toward end of july a well defined low pressure area developed in northwest bay of bengal it moved onshore and developed into a depression over southeastern india near daltonganj on july 26 turning to west system moved through central india bringing heavy rainfall along its path system degenerated into a remnant low on july 28 over rajasthan and next day was absorbed by monsoon trough depression bob 03 on october 1 a depression formed in western bay of bengal moving westward it failed to intensify beyond 45 km h 30 mph around 00 00 utc on october 2 system made landfall near ongole andhra pradesh later that day system degenerated into a remnant low over karnataka state it turned northward and moved through central india bringing widespread heavy rainfall along its path eventually it turned to northeast dissipating over himalayas on october 5 in southern india storm wrecked houses while flash flooding swept away people into rivers at least 22 people were killed in country severe cyclonic storm arb 02 05a described by jtwc as having one of most unusual tracks in north indian ocean cyclone history storm originated as an area of convection that formed on october 14 in southern bay of bengal moving westward it struck andhra pradesh on october 17 as a well defined low pressure area it crossed southern india and emerged into arabian sea on october 20 system developed into a depression on october 22 and quickly intensified while moving northward by october 24 cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye imd estimated peak 3 minute winds of 110 km h 70 mph and jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph on october 25 storm abruptly stalled and weakened offshore gujarat and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by october 28 although its remnants persisted until november 2 when they dissipated east of somalia in southern india storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in andhra pradesh at least 112 reservoirs or dams were breached killing 200 people in prakasam district waters ruined about of crop fields and damaged about 53 000 houses leaving thousands homeless and forcing 100 000 people to leave their homes floods killed 388 people in southern india and caused us 128 5 million in damage storm later brushed west coast of india stranding 50 boats deep depression bob 04 06b monsoon trough produced an area of convection south of andaman and nicobar islands on october 21 located south of a ridge system moved westward through an area of hostile wind shear which prevented quick development by displacing circulation east of convection jtwc issued a tcfa on october 22 once it appeared shear was decreasing although system did not organize initially after convection became more defined jtwc classified system as tropical cyclone 06b on october 25 in central bay of bengal an approaching trough from west weakened ridge allowing storm to turn to north and later northeast imd classified system as a depression on october 27 and later that day estimated peak 3 minute winds of 55 km h 35 mph making it a deep depression jtwc assessed a higher intensity of 85 km h 50 mph accelerating northeastward storm made landfall near border of india and bangladesh around 18 00 utc on october 28 moving through bangladesh system quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low on october 29 over indian state of assam ahead of storm government of bangladesh evacuated about 500 000 people with assistance of 32 000 people helping spread word of storm to coastal villages boats were advised to return to port as cyclone moved ashore it produced heavy rains and 80 km h 50 mph winds along with a 3 m 9 ft storm surge heavy rainfall caused disruptions and flooding in kolkata in eastern india in bangladesh flooding drowned thousands of cattle in chittagong and damaged of crop fields storm wrecked about 15 000 thatch huts across country about 400 houses were destroyed in barisal district leaving thousands homeless three children were killed in after their house collapsed at least 14 people were killed and over 2 000 people were injured with 100 fishermen left missing after their boats were wrecked two fishermen seeking shelter were accidentally shot and killed by members of bangladesh navy who thought fishermen were pirates very severe cyclonic storm bob 05 07b after a tropical depression from western pacific dissipated over myanmar another disturbance formed in extreme eastern bay of bengal on november 1 it moved westward due to a ridge to north slowly organizing on november 4 imd classified system as a depression although jtwc had classified it as tropical cyclone 07b a day prior storm quickly organized and developed a well defined eye on november 6 cyclone struck about 50 km 30 mi south of kakinada andhra pradesh at peak intensity imd estimated peak winds of 145 km h 90 mph while jtwc assessed peak winds of 215 km h 130 mph soon after landfall cyclone weakened and dissipated by november 7 ahead of storm about 225 000 families evacuated although many towns lacked proper storm shelters when cyclone made landfall it produced strong winds up to 100 km 60 mi inland dropped of rainfall across a 40 km 25 mi region and flooded over 250 villages along 60 km 37 mi portion of coast about 70 of overall damage was in east godavari district where two villages were entirely destroyed storm destroyed of crops and killed millions of cattle and chicken across andhra pradesh storm damaged 647 554 houses including over 10 000 that were destroyed overall damage totaled rs 21 5 billion us 602 million comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that also hit andhra pradesh there were 1 077 confirmed deaths with many others missing although many of dead were washed into sea and were unlikely to be found after storm government and local red cross chapters helped residents recover from damage while world bank provided money to better prepare andhra pradesh for future storms very severe cyclonic storm bob 06 08b originating from monsoon trough a well defined circulation persisted on november 26 near andaman and nicobar islands accompanied by a poorly defined area of convection it formed in an area of moderate wind shear allowing system to slowly organize while moving to west northwest both imd and jtwc initiated warnings on november 28 latter classifying it as tropical cyclone 08b on november 29 storm turned to north and east beginning a four day loop in central bay of bengal jtwc noted that it was longest lasting loop on record in body of water during this time system remained weak never intensifying beyond deep depression status a strengthening ridge to north turned storm back to west on november 30 into an area of lighter wind shear on december 2 system intensified into a cyclonic storm and eventually to a very severe cyclonic storm on next day with imd estimating peak 3 minute winds of 120 km h 75 mph jtwc upgraded system to equivalent of a hurricane on december 4 estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km h 85 mph increased wind shear decoupled convection from center thunderstorms continued to west northwest and struck andhra pradesh while circulation turned southwestward weakening further system made landfall on tamil nadu between chennai and pondicherry around 16 00 utc on december 6 it rapidly weakened over land dissipating next day ahead of storm about 200 000 people evacuated indian coastline following damaging cyclone that struck andhra pradesh a month earlier officials used buses and trucks to transport residents in nearly 500 villages officials warned fishermen not to go out to sea during storm to prevent accidents workers closed roads and shut off power ahead of storm two people died in andhra pradesh while storm was still offshore one due to a house collapsing and other due to a fallen tree heavy rainfall related to cyclone killed two people before system moved ashore storm dropped heavy rainfall in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu winds in chennai reached 100 km h 62 mph strong enough to knock down trees and cause accidents one motorist was killed by a tree near madras municipal airport overall storm resulted in seven fatalities see also 1996 atlantic hurricane season 1996 pacific hurricane season 1996 pacific
