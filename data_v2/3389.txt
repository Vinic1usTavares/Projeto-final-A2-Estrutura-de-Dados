siege of aiguillon an episode in hundred years war began on 1 april 1346 when a french army commanded by john duke of normandy laid siege to gascon town of aiguillon town was defended by an anglo gascon army under ralph earl of stafford in 1345 henry earl of lancaster was sent to gascony in south west france with 2 000 men and large financial resources in 1346 french focused their effort on south west and early in campaigning season an army of 15 000 20 000 men marched down valley of garonne aiguillon commands both rivers garonne and lot and it was not possible to sustain an offensive further into gascony unless town was taken duke john son and heir apparent of philip vi laid siege to town garrison some 900 men sortied repeatedly to interrupt french operations while lancaster concentrated main anglo gascon force at la reole some away as a threat duke john was never able to fully blockade town and found that his own supply lines were seriously harassed on one occasion lancaster used his main force to escort a large supply train into town in july main english army landed in northern france and moved towards paris philip vi repeatedly ordered his son duke john to break off siege and bring his army north duke john considering it a matter of honour refused by august french supply system had broken down there was a dysentery epidemic in their camp desertion was rife and philip vi s orders were becoming imperious on 20 august french abandoned siege and their camp and marched away six days later main french army was decisively beaten in battle of crecy with very heavy losses two weeks after this defeat duke john s army joined french survivors background left thumb upright 0 75 alt a map of french territory as it was in 1340 showing enclave of gascony in south west france in 1330 since norman conquest of 1066 english monarchs had held titles and lands within france possession of which made them vassals of kings of france over centuries english holdings in france had varied in size but by 1337 only gascony in south western france and ponthieu in northern france were left independent minded gascons had their own customs and claimed to have a separate language they preferred their relationship with a distant english king who left them alone to one with a french king who would interfere in their affairs following a series of disagreements between philip vi of france and edward iii of england on 24 may 1337 philip s great council in paris agreed that duchy of aquitaine effectively gascony should be taken back into philip s hands on grounds that edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal this marked start of hundred years war which was to last one hundred and sixteen years gascony before war commenced well over 1 000 ships a year departed gascony for england among their cargoes were over of locally produced wine duty collected by english crown on wine from bordeaux exceeded all other customs duties combined and was by far largest source of state income bordeaux capital of gascony had a population of over 50 000 greater than london s and bordeaux was possibly richer however by this time english gascony had become so truncated by french encroachments that it relied on imports of food largely from england any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve gascony and financially cripple england french were well aware of this although gascony was cause of war edward was able to spare few resources for it and whenever an english army campaigned on continent it had operated in northern france in most campaigning seasons gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by french in 1339 french besieged bordeaux capital of gascony even breaking into city with a large force before they were repulsed typically gascons could field 3 000 6 000 men large majority infantry although up to two thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons thumb upright 4 border between english and french territory in gascony was extremely unclear to extent that idea of a border is anachronistic many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each each small estate was likely to have a fortified tower or keep and larger estates had castles fortifications were also constructed at transport choke points to collect tolls and to restrict military passage fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over many rivers in region military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on at frequent intervals if they wished to remain in one place for any length of time as was necessary to besiege a castle then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points and for mutable loyalty of local nobility region had been in a state of flux for centuries and many local lords served whichever country was stronger regardless of national ties by 1345 after eight years of war english controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from bordeaux to bayonne with isolated strongholds further inland during 1345 henry duke of lancaster during 1345 campaign he was known as earl of derby but his father died in september 1345 and he became earl of lancaster had led a whirlwind campaign at head of an anglo gascon army he had smashed two large french armies at battles of bergerac and auberoche captured french towns and fortifications in much of perigord and most of agenais and given english possessions in gascony strategic depth during winter following this successful campaign lancaster s second in command ralph earl of stafford had marched on vitally important town of aiguillon which commanded junction of rivers garonne and lot town s inhabitants had attacked garrison and opened gates to english prelude john duke of normandy son and heir apparent of philip vi was placed in charge of all french forces in south west france as he had been previous autumn he assembled at orleans largest army french had yet fielded in south west it was supported by every military officer of royal household as always money was short in spite of borrowing over 330 000 florins ps in terms from pope duke john had to issue orders to local officials to amass all of money you can for support of our wars take it from each and every person you can it was a clear indication of desperate state of french finances a second army was formed at toulouse based on contingents from languedoc it included a siege train and five cannon duke john planned to march on and besiege large strongly fortified town of la reole on north bank of garonne river only from bordeaux which lancaster had captured previous year aiguillon commanded both lot and garonne and its possession was essential to supply any army around la reole lancaster understood that no french offensive could have a permanent effect so long as aiguillon described by modern historian kenneth fowler as key to gascon plain was held so he garrisoned it very strongly 300 men at arms and 600 archers commanded by stafford town was well stocked with supplies and materiel although physical defences were in a poor state main wall long was modern but incomplete gaps were filled with improvised defences a bridge over river lot was fortified and had a barbican gate but it was centuries old and poorly maintained there were two small forts within town both overlooking garonne northern wall of town was protected by lot and western by garonne while southern and eastern walls were more easily approached lancaster based himself in la reole on garonne downstream throughout siege siege investment upright 0 65 left thumb alt image of a man dressed in late medieval finery center ralph de stafford 1st earl of stafford french armies assembled and marched unusually early in campaigning season by march they were both in province of quercy size of french forces at this point is not recorded but it has been estimated that later in campaign they numbered between 15 000 and 20 000 modern historians have described french army as a huge force and as enormously superior to any force anglo gascons could field army marched down valley of garonne from agen reaching aiguillon on 1 april on 2 april arriere ban formal call to arms for all able bodied males was announced for south of france isolating town presented a problem for french junction of two rivers created three different areas each of which would need to be interdicted but separating their army into three divisions was inviting defeat in detail they needed to be able to rapidly combine their forces if one part was threatened a bridge over lot from aiguillon was easily taken but it was necessary to construct a new bridge over garonne duke john employed over 300 carpenters in its construction escorted by 1 400 crossbowmen and an unknown but significant number of men at arms garrison sortied repeatedly against this work sometimes several times a day they twice broke it up but it was completed by end of may three parts of french army each dug impressive earthworks to protect themselves both from sorties by garrison and from lancaster s main army operations upright 1 alt pen and ink sketch of a ruined and overgrown stone fortification thumb a derelict section of aiguillon s walls pictured in 1855 as was normal within a matter of days large french army had swept surrounding area clear of supplies and was entirely dependent on rivers for its logistics anglo gascon army based in la reole harassed french foragers intercepted their supplies and kept them in a constant state of alarm dysentery soon broke out in french camps in mid june french attempted to pass two large supply barges down lot to their contingent west of garonne they needed to pass under fortified bridge held by garrison garrison sortied from bridge s barbican through french lines and captured barges bringing them into town fierce fighting broke out as sortie party attempted to retreat to barbican which after several hours was lost to french garrison closed gates and secured town at cost of trapping most of this party outside survivors were taken prisoner french were unable to effectively isolate town throughout siege anglo gascons were able to run blockade at will with small quantities of supplies and reinforcements in july a larger force fought its way through with a greater quantity of supplies from start of siege french had concentrated their efforts against southern side of defences at least twelve large siege engines probably trebuchets carried out a round clock area bombardment results were considered unsatisfactory in july an attack was attempted from north across lot using three siege towers mounted on large barges as they were being manoeuvred across river one was hit by a missile from an english trebuchet capsizing it with heavy loss attack was abandoned siege became an end in itself for duke john having laid siege to aiguillon it was a matter of knightly honour not to retreat before it fell at one point he solemnly vowed not to abandon siege until he had occupied town by july french were drawing supplies from over away a distance barely sustainable with 14th century overland transportation in early 1346 english captured castle of from agen capital of agenais on garonne this was one of several strongholds from which english carried out raids on french lines of communication in late july a french force of 2 000 men marched against it small english garrison under de durfort attacked french defeated them and captured their commander robert de seneschal of agenais french army began to starve horses died for lack of fodder dysentery epidemic worsened cases of desertion increasingly to english mounted french withdrawal thumb upright 0 58 alt profile of a bearded man with long red hair in 1345 edward iii had sent expeditionary forces to gascony and brittany and had assembled his main army for action in northern france or flanders it had sailed but never landed after fleet was scattered in a storm knowledge of edward iii s intent had kept french focus on north until late in campaigning season in 1346 edward iii again gathered a large army and french once again became aware of this french assumed that edward would sail for gascony where lancaster was heavily outnumbered to guard against any possibility of an english landing in northern france philip vi relied on his powerful navy this reliance was misplaced given naval technology of time and on 12 july an english army of 7 000 10 000 landed near saint vaast la hougue in north west normandy this force pillaged its way across richest parts of france capturing and sacking every town in its path english fleet paralleled its march devastating everything up to five miles inland and destroying most of french navy in its ports philip vi recalled his main army under duke john from gascony after a furious argument with his advisers and according to some accounts his father s messenger duke john refused to move until his honour was satisfied on 29 july philip vi called an arriere ban for northern france at rouen on 7 august english reached seine philip vi sent orders to duke john insisting that he abandon siege of aiguillon and march his army north edward iii marched south east and on 12 august his army was from paris on 14 august duke john attempted to arrange a local truce lancaster well aware of situation in north and in french camps around aiguillon refused on 20 august after over five months french abandoned siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder french camps were left under guard of local levies who promptly deserted entire equipment of french army was captured supplies materiel siege engines and many horses in at least early stages of their retreat discipline amongst french was poor there are accounts of men being jostled off bridge over garonne and drowned stafford s garrison and other local anglo gascon forces pursued closely part of duke john s personal baggage was captured french castles and minor fortifications along lot upstream from aiguillon were mopped up as were french positions between lot and dordogne aftermath upright thumb left alt photograph of an isolated stone tower in a modern setting duke john and his army made contact with philip vi on or shortly after 7 september two weeks after french army of north 20 000 25 000 strong had been decisively beaten at battle of crecy with very heavy losses after crecy french stripped their garrisons in south west to build up a new army to face main english threat in north east areas facing lancaster were effectively defenceless he launched three separate offensives between september and november local gascon forces besieged few major strongholds in bazadais region still held by french they were all taken including town of bazas further gascon forces raided to east deep into quercy penetrating over modern historian jonathan sumption describes this as dislocating royal administration in central and southern france for three months meanwhile lancaster himself took a small force 1 000 men at arms and an unknown number of archers possibly 1 000 to north on a grand chevauchee a great mounted raid during which he captured rich provincial capital of poitiers and many towns and castles throughout saintonge and aunis with these offensives lancaster moved focus of fighting from heart of gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders notes citations and sources notes citations sources category 1346 in england
