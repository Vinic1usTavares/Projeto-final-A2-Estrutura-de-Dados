trento class was a group of two heavy cruisers built for italian regia marina royal navy in late 1920s first such vessels built for italian fleet two ships in class and were named after redeemed cities of trento and trieste taken from austro hungarian empire after victory in world war i ships were very lightly armored with only a thick armored belt though they possessed a high speed and heavy armament of eight guns nominally built under restrictions of washington naval treaty two cruisers nevertheless exceeded displacement limits imposed by treaty in interwar period two cruisers served in cruiser division frequently alternating as divisional flagship trento made two extensive trips abroad first was a tour of south american countries in mid to late 1929 and second was a deployment to china to protect italian nationals during chinese civil war in 1938 trieste assisted in repatriation of italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in spain during spanish civil war both ships saw extensive action in world war ii including battles of calabria cape spartivento and cape matapan trieste was damaged by a british submarine in november 1941 and therefore missed first and second battles of sirte where at latter action trento damaged a british destroyer trento was torpedoed and sunk by a british torpedo bomber and a submarine in june 1942 with heavy loss of life in april 1943 trieste was also sunk in port at la maddalena during an attack by united states heavy bombers salvage operations began in 1950 and after it was determined that ship s engines had been preserved by leaked fuel oil hull was sold to spanish navy which planned to convert vessel into a light aircraft carrier plan was eventually cancelled in 1956 due to rising costs of project and trieste was broken up for scrap in 1959 design in early 1920s regia marina began design studies for cruisers that would adhere to limitations of washington naval treaty which limited cruisers to a displacement of and an armament of guns design for what became trento class was prepared by general filippo in 1923 brescia p 72 73 in 1924 french navy laid down first of two s prompting regia marina to order two vessels to match their rival marriott p 50 designers emphasized very high speed which required a significant reduction in armor protection to keep ships within displacement limit in addition they were designed with a narrow beam to help them reach high speeds which reduced their stability this would be general pattern for italian cruisers and destroyers built in 1920s and 1930s with exception of later s and some of later s gardiner chesneau p 283 while ships were still on slipways officers in regia marina expressed concerns that thin armor protection of trentos would leave vessels poorly equipped for combat as a result navy ordered more balanced zara class which featured a significantly thicker scale of armor protection brescia p 76 lightly built trento design nevertheless provided basis for s built by odero terni orlando for argentine navy argentine vessels were scaled down slightly with thinner armor and guns friedman p 263 another derivative design built for italian fleet started construction in 1930 and was commissioned in 1933 though bolzano was quite different from other two vessels she is sometimes considered a member of trento class marriott p 156 general characteristics thumb left line drawing of trento class ships of trento class were long between perpendiculars and long overall they had a beam of and a draft of they had a design displacement of and they displaced up to at full load though their displacement was nominally within 10 000 long ton restriction set in place by washington naval treaty their hulls had a flush deck and a bulbous bow first time latter feature was employed on an italian warship brescia p 73 ships were completed with a pair of tripod masts though on trials they were found to vibrate excessively and foremast was strengthened with two extra legs they had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men though during war this increased to 781 they carried a pair of imam ro 43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance hangar was located under forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on centerline at bow gardiner chesneau p p 72 trento class cruisers power plant consisted of four parsons steam turbines powered by twelve oil fired yarrow boilers which were trunked into two funnels amidships boilers were divided into three boiler rooms with four each two powered forward engines that drove outboard propellers and remaining four were allocated to turbines that drove center shafts engines were rated at for a top speed of with projected service performance of for at normal displacement on sea trials trieste only reached and trento managed slightly less than that these speeds could only be reached on a very light displacement and in service her practical top speed was only ships had a storage capacity of of fuel oil which provided a cruising range of at a speed of during refits in early 1940 funnel caps were added to reduce smoke interference with masts brescia pp 72 chesneau pp 291 292 armament and armor thumb upright bow view of trento note very close mounting of turret guns trento and trieste were armed with a main battery of eight mod 24 50 caliber guns in four gun turrets each turret carried guns in a single cradle rather than independent mounts turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft and allowed for elevation to 45 degrees for a maximum range of they had a rate of fire of three rounds per minute and guns had to reset to 15 degrees to reload turrets were electrically operated including training and elevation gear and ammunition hoists campbell p 328 guns suffered from excessive shell dispersion like many other italian guns of period initially supplied with shells fired at a muzzle velocity of shells and propellant charges were reduced to at in an unsuccessful attempt to tighten shell grouping problem was in large part due to poor quality control in italian munition factories which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells friedman p 310 in addition single cradle mounts required guns to be very close together this caused shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to dispersion problem brescia pp 73 74 fire control was provided by a pair of barr stroud coincidence rangefinders friedman pp 263 264 anti aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen 47 cal guns in twin mounts four vickers terni 40 mm 39 guns in single mounts and four machine guns 100 mm guns were copies of austro hungarian guns designed in 1910 by skoda that were placed in newly designed dual purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of in addition to gun armament they carried eight torpedo tubes in four deck mounted twin launchers campbell p 339 ships secondary batteries were revised several times during their careers both ships had their 100 mm guns replaced with newer mod 31 versions of same caliber in 1937 1938 two aft most 100 mm guns were removed along with all four 12 7 mm machine guns eight 54 cal breda m1932 guns and eight breda m1931 machine guns all in twin mounts were installed in their place in 1942 trento received four 65 cal breda m1940 guns in single mounts with trieste receiving eight of those guns following year campbell pp 345 347 both vessels were protected with an armored citadel that covered ships vitals including machinery spaces and ammunition magazines vertical armored belt was thick and ran from forward of fore main battery turrets to aft of rear turrets either end of belt was capped with armored bulkheads thick on upper portion forward bulkhead had a lower section that was reduced to and aft bulkhead s lower portion was reduced to their armor deck was 50 mm thick in central portion of ship and reduced to aft with thick sloped sides armor deck did not extend forward of citadel gun turrets had thick plating on faces and supporting barbettes they sat in were 70 mm thick above armor deck and 60 mm thick below main conning tower had 100 mm thick sides and a 50 mm thick roof above tower was a fire control director with thick sides and a 60 mm thick roof ships name builder laid down launched completed odero terni orlando 8 february 1925 4

cities taken from austria hungary in aftermath of world war i brescia p 74 they frequently served as flagship of cruiser division throughout 1930s during pre war period trento made lengthy trips abroad including a tour of south america from may to october 1929 and a deployment to china from january to june 1932 to protect italian nationals during chinese civil war both vessels took part in numerous naval reviews held for visiting foreign leaders in 1930s including adolf hitler of nazi germany and miklos horthy regent of hungary in 1938 trieste helped transport soldiers of corpo truppe corps of volunteer troops which had been sent to spain to fight in spanish civil war back to italy in 1938 hogg wiper pp 2 10 after italy entered world war ii in june 1940 trento and trieste saw extensive action against british forces in mediterranean sea including at battles of calabria cape spartivento and cape matapan in july and november 1940 and march 1941 respectively trento was present at calabria where she battled british cruisers but did not sustain any damage hogg wiper pp 2 3 11 at battle of cape spartivento either trento or trieste scored a hit on british cruiser greene massignani p 119o hara pp 70 71 and trieste was briefly engaged but not seriously damaged by battlecruiser stern p 62 at cape matapan two cruisers engaged several british cruisers at very long range with neither side scoring any hits greene massignani pp 150 151 in november 1941 trieste was torpedoed by submarine she spent most of next year under repair in meantime trento was also present during inconclusive first and second battles of sirte and at latter she severely damaged a british destroyer both cruisers were also frequently tasked with escorting convoys to supply italian forces in north africa as well as interdicting british convoys to island of malta in central mediterranean during one of latter missions to attack british operation harpoon convoy in june 1942 trento was torpedoed twice first by a bristol beaufighter torpedo bomber and then sunk by submarine with very heavy loss of life on 15 june hogg wiper p 3 10 11 out of a wartime complement of 51 officers and 1 100 enlisted men 549 were killed in sinking and a further 21 later died of wounds fioravanzo p 312 trieste returned to action in august 1942 for an operation that was cancelled following torpedoing of another italian cruiser by a british submarine trieste was moved to la maddalena sardinia where she was later sunk by united states heavy bombers on 10 april 1943 salvage work on trieste began in 1950 her superstructure was cut away and she was refloated and towed to la spezia an inspection revealed that fuel oil had leaked into machinery spaces protecting them while ship had been submerged spanish navy purchased hull in 1952 and had her towed to ferrol with plans to convert vessel into a light aircraft carrier project ultimately came to nothing due to growing costs of project forcing its cancellation in 1956 she was ultimately broken up by 1959 hogg wiper p 11 notes references category cruiser classes category world war ii cruisers of italy category ships built in italy
