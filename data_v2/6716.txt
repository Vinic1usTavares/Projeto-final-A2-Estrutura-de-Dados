thumb 300px alt single lead eeg readout one second sample of an eeg alpha wave recording this wave occurs at frequencies similar to mu wave although alpha wave is detected over a different part of brain thumb alt left motor cortex highlighted on brain left motor cortex or is highlighted in green on this left lateral view of brain this is area over which mu waves are detected bilaterally mu waves also known as mu rhythms comb or wicket rhythms rhythms or rhythms are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons probably of pyramidal type in part of brain that controls voluntary movement these patterns as measured by electroencephalography eeg magnetoencephalography meg or electrocorticography ecog repeat at a frequency of 7 5 12 5 and primarily 9 11 hz and are most prominent when body is physically at rest unlike alpha wave which occurs at a similar frequency over resting visual cortex at back of scalp mu wave is found over motor cortex in a band approximately from ear to ear a person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or with practice when he or she visualizes performing a motor action this suppression is called desynchronization of wave because eeg wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics researchers such as v s ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression although others disagree mu wave is of interest to a variety of scholars scientists who study neural development are interested in details of development of mu wave in infancy and childhood and its role in learning since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder asd is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu wave suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating mu wave in people with asd assorted investigators are also in process of using mu waves to develop a new technology brain computer interface bci with emergence of bci systems clinicians hope to give severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments mirror neurons mirror neuron system consists of a class of neurons that was first studied in 1990s in macaque monkeys studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when monkeys view others performing same simple tasks this suggests they play a role in mapping others movements into brain without actually physically performing movements these sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up mirror neuron system mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans there is evidence that mirror neurons exist in humans as well as in non human animals right fusiform gyrus left inferior parietal lobule right anterior parietal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus are of particular interest some researchers believe that mu wave suppression can be a consequence of mirror neuron activity throughout brain and represents a higher level integrative processing of mirror neuron activity tests in both monkeys using invasive measuring techniques and humans using eeg and fmri have found that these mirror neurons not only fire during basic motor tasks but also have components that deal with intention there is evidence of an important role for mirror neurons in humans and mu waves may represent a high level coordination of those mirror neurons development a fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use is that mu wave suppression is a representation of activity going on in world and is detectable in frontal and parietal networks a resting oscillation becomes suppressed during observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights usually within frontoparietal motor cortical region mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months when peak frequency wave reaches can be as low as 5 4 hz there is a rapid increase in peak frequency in first year of life and by age two frequency typically reaches 7 5 hz peak frequency of mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8 13 hz these varying frequencies are measured as activity around central sulcus within rolandic cortex mu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant s developing ability to imitate this is important because ability to imitate plays a vital role in development of motor skills tool use and understanding causal information through social interaction mimicking is integral in development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand in action execution mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization while executing a goal oriented action however infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults just as with an action execution during action observation infants mu waves not only show a desynchronization but show a desynchronization greater in degree than one evidenced in adults this tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization rather than actual changes in frequency becomes measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood although most changes take place during first year of life understanding mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in earliest years of life has implications for language development learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds sharing experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in development of language autism autism is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits a single cause of autism has yet to be identified but mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in disorder in a typically developing individual mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs task him or herself in individuals with autism mirror neurons become active and consequently mu waves are suppressed only when individual performs task him or herself this finding has led some scientists notably v s ramachandran and colleagues to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals intentions and goals due to problems with mirror neuron system this deficiency would explain difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others while most studies of mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits fmri activation magnitudes in inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism but not in typically developing individuals furthermore greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning scientists believe inferior frontal gyrus is one of main neural correlates with mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism these findings suggest that mirror neuron system may not be non functional in individuals with autism but simply abnormal in its development this information is significant to present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in brain other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity in this case eegs of mu waves this type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism and has conflicting forecasts for success brain computer interfaces brain computer interfaces bcis are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to severely physically disabled those technology has potential to help include people with near total or total paralysis such as those with tetraplegia quadriplegia or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als bcis are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs or robotic grasping tools few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level one type of bci uses event related desynchronization erd of mu wave in order to control computer this method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other when a participant is cued to imagine movement an event resulting desynchronization group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements typically of foot hand and or tongue which are each in different locations on cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an eeg or ecog recording of electrical activity over motor cortex in this method computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave erd contralateral to visualized movement combined with event related synchronization ers in surrounding tissue this paired pattern intensifies with training and training increasingly takes form of games some of which utilize virtual reality some researchers have found that feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns erd method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring brain s electrical activity to create hybrid bcis which often offer more flexibility than a bci that uses any single monitoring method history mu waves have been studied since 1930s and are referred to as wicket rhythm because rounded eeg waves resemble croquet wickets in 1950 henri gastaut and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects but also while subjects observed actions executed by someone else these results were later confirmed by additional research groups including a study using subdural electrode grids in epileptic patients latter study showed mu suppression while patients observed moving body parts in somatic areas of cortex that corresponded to body part moved by actor further studies have shown that mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions and by passively viewing point light biological motion see also brain waves delta wave 0 1 3 hz theta wave 4 7 hz alpha wave 8 12 mu wave 8 13 hz smr
