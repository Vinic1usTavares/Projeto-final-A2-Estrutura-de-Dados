ron saggers was a member of donald bradman s famous australian cricket team of 1948 which toured england and went undefeated in their 34 matches this unprecedented feat by a test side touring england earned them sobriquet invincibles team s reserve wicket keeper saggers played in only fourth of five tests due to an injury to first choice gloveman don tallon match was saggers s test debut and he scored five in his only innings with bat and took three catches despite being second choice gloveman saggers conceded byes at a lower rate than tallon did during english summer during fourth test saggers conceded only six byes as england amassed a match total of 861 lowest percentage of byes conceded by australia in a match during tour despite this tallon remained favoured gloveman as bradman deemed him to be faster and more athletic bradman rotated two during tour and saggers played in 17 of 31 first class matches taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings due to australia s powerful batting line up saggers had few opportunities with bat scoring 209 runs at an average of 23 22 including his only century at first class level 104 not out against essex background saggers started tour as clear second choice wicket keeper as don tallon had played in each of australia s 11 tests since resumption of cricket after second world war while saggers was yet to make his test debut saggers made his first class debut shortly before start of war and after resumption was regarded as second in line for test selection behind tallon however as australia did not make any substantial tours in years immediately after end of hostilities there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips however trip to england meant more than six months abroad so a back up wicketkeeper was needed and saggers was selected for his first national squad early tour australia traditionally fielded its first choice team in tour opener which was customarily against worcestershire accordingly tallon was selected as wicket keeper for match tallon scored six made five dismissals and conceded 11 byes as australia crushed hosts by an innings and 17 runs tallon was then rested and saggers took his place for next county match against leicestershire saggers scored six took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as australia won by an innings saggers was then rested for next two matches against yorkshire and surrey australia scraped home by four wickets in former and won by an innings in latter tallon batted steadily with 10 17 not out and 50 not out but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches tallon was having difficulty with bounce and movement of ball in english conditions and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a ray lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during surrey match he was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection and ball ran away for four byes perry 2000 p 197 while tallon nursed a bruised finger saggers played in three successive tour matches against cambridge university he made two stumpings and took one catch and was not required to bat as australia won by an innings he then played in match against essex where australia scored 721 runs on first day to set a new world record for most runs scored in a day of first class cricket saggers made his highest first class score 104 not out only first class century of his career in a partnership of 166 runs in 65 minutes of batting with sam loxton this made him fourth century maker for innings after bill brown bradman and loxton of saggers s innings former test batsman jack fingleton said that he reminded me at times of alan kippax in his artistry he plays all strokes fingleton p 67 saggers took one catch as australia won by an innings and 451 runs their largest winning margin of season he then faced oxford university scoring six runs and taking one catch in another innings victory saggers conceded six eight and 14 byes respectively in three matches up to this point saggers had conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches while tallon had conceded 46 in three n next match was against marylebone cricket club at lord s mcc fielded seven players who went on to represent england in tests n and were basically a full strength test team as were australia who fielded their first choice team it was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of test matches and tallon was selected ahead of saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate in opening tour matches saggers looked on as tallon conceded 26 byes and australia won by an innings there were four more county fixtures before first test against lancashire nottinghamshire hampshire and sussex australia drew first two before winning latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively saggers played in all but nottinghamshire match against lancashire saggers came in at 6 145 and held up his end making an unbeaten 22 as australia reached 204 he then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as hosts replied with 182 before rain affected match ended in a draw saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as hampshire made 195 in their first innings he came to crease with australia having scored 98 runs for loss of seven wickets 7 98 and was last man out for 17 one of only four players to pass five as australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead for first time in season he then completed another stumping in second innings and conceded four byes as australia recovered to win by eight wickets saggers final opportunity to stake a claim for test selection was in match against sussex he did not concede a bye and took a catch in first innings saggers was not required to bat as australia declared their innings closed at 5 549 and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as australia won by an innings test omission left thumb 290px saggers centre pictured with stan mccabe left and don tallon right during a country match in 1945 in saggers last three matches before first test he conceded 36 byes and made six dismissals in contrast tallon conceded 18 byes in his only match and scored 27 despite averaging more byes per innings than saggers during warm up matches n tallon was retained in test team he took four catches and conceded 17 byes as australia won by eight wickets between tests australia played northamptonshire and yorkshire and tallon was rested for both matches first was won by an innings and second was drawn saggers scored four against northamptonshire and 22 against yorkshire after not making a dismissal against northamptonshire he took two catches and two stumpings in latter match he conceded 14 and 10 byes in two matches respectively tallon was retained for second test at lord s where he scored 53 took three catches and conceded 16 byes as australia won by 409 runs a dive to stop a leg glance resulted in tallon severely bruising little finger on his left hand perry 2000 p 200 nursing his finger injury tallon was rested for both tour matches between tests which were against surrey and gloucestershire australia won matches by ten wickets and an innings respectively in tallon s place saggers scored 12 completed a catch and made four stumpings while conceding 18 byes against surrey in match against gloucestershire saggers was deprived of an opportunity to bat as australia amassed 7 774 its highest score of tour and its second highest ever in england he took two catches completed three stumpings and conceded 13 byes for match tallon was retained as teams then played out a draw in third test at manchester lemmon p 103 during match tallon conceded 16 byes and dropped denis compton three times as english batsman went from 50 to 145 not out fingleton pp 131 137 tallon s little left finger swelled up after third test and he exacerbated injury during next tour match against middlesex which australia won by ten wickets test debut as a result of tallon s finger injury saggers made his test debut in fourth test which started at headingley on 22 july 1948 as england made 496 runs in their first innings saggers took catches to remove denis compton for 23 caught down leg side fingleton p 158 and jim laker for four during innings saggers was noted by fingleton for maintaining a quiet presence behind stumps whereas tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing in concert with bowler when he was playing fingleton felt that saggers failure to appeal dampened morale of bowlers who were vocally supported by tallon in other four tests fingleton p 152 australia conceded 496 runs but saggers leaked only two byes australia replied with 458 but saggers was unable to make a substantial contribution stumped by england s wicket keeper godfrey evans off bowling of laker for only five runs england s second innings reached 8 365 as saggers took one catch to secure wicket of ken cranston and conceded four byes this left australia needing a world record test run chase of 404 for victory however an innings of 182 runs from arthur morris and 173 not out from bradman meant that saggers was not required to bat in second innings australia defeated england by seven wickets and set a world record for highest successful test run chase saggers s six byes out of england s match total of 861 runs was lowest percentage of byes conceded by australia in a match on tour n saggers made six not out completed two catches a stumping and conceded 15 byes in innings victory over derbyshire before being rested in next match against glamorgan in his first match back from injury tallon took a catch and two stumpings but conceded 19 byes in a rain affected draw tallon s byes were 9 64 of hosts total highest percentage contribution made by byes to an innings on tour n saggers returned for nine wicket win over warwickshire and struggled making a duck although he took two catches and a stumping he conceded 28 byes 9 56 of warwickshire s total runs second highest percentage contribution of byes to a match total against australia n saggers was then rested for australia s second match and second draw against lancashire as tallon made three dismissals and conceded 23 byes in non first class match against durham tallon played purely as a batsman while saggers kept wicket saggers came in at 8 226 and made 22 to help australia reach 273 he then made two stumpings and conceded four byes as hosts reached 5 73 when rain ended match with tallon fit again for fifth test saggers was omitted as australia won by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4 0 series victory later tour matches seven matches remained on bradman s quest to complete an english tour without defeat tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against kent gentlemen of england and somerset and saggers kept wickets in all three fixtures australia won all three by an innings saggers made only eight as australia scored 361 against kent he then conceded only two byes and took two catches and made two stumpings as home side made 51 and 124 saggers did not bat as australia amassed 5 610 against gentlemen of england he then took a catch

conceded 13 byes before match was washed out when hosts were dismissed for 298 australia s biggest challenge in post test tour matches was against leveson gower s xi during last tour in 1938 this team was effectively a full strength england outfit but this time bradman insisted that only six current test players be allowed to represent hosts fingleton pp 207 209 bradman then fielded a first choice team perry 2005 pp 253 254 only difference from fifth test team was ian johnson s inclusion at expense of doug ring saggers was left out as match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays tour ended with two non first class matches against scotland in first match tallon played as a batsman while saggers kept wicket saggers scored only eight in australia s 236 and then took two catches three stumpings and conceded 13 byes in innings victory in second match in aberdeen saggers was rested as australia completed another innings win role 300px right thumb a chart showing saggers s batting performance during tour runs scored per innings are represented by bars with red bars being test innings and pink bars being other first class innings blue line is average of five most recent innings and dots indicate not outs reserve wicket keeper saggers played in 17 first class matches and scored 209 runs at an average of 23 22 including a career high score of 104 not out against essex cashman p 267 23 catches and 20 stumpings also career records for one season this compared with first choice gloveman tallon who scored 283 runs at 25 72 in all his matches on tour tallon missed 249 byes as australia conceded runs a bye percentage of 4 67 in contrast saggers conceded 221 byes from runs scored against australia when he was behind stumps a percentage of 3 57 n in his 1950 book farewell to cricket bradman said of saggers he had not quite speed or agility of tallon but could always be relied on for a solid performance a most polished and unostentatious player bradman p 227 during tour saggers had few opportunities with bat generally batting between no 8 and no 10 n because australia s frontline bowlers included likes of ray lindwall colin mccool ian johnson and doug ring who were all capable batsmen lindwall scored two test centuries in his career while mccool scored 18 first class centuries one in tests johnson and ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first class level cashman pp 152 175 199 258 as a result many of bowlers batted before he did as australia often won by an innings and declared in first innings on many occasions saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed see also 1948 ashes series notes statistical notes n 1 this statement regarding byes in early warm up
