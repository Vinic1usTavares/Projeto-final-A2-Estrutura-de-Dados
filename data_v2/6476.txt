new britain campaign was a world war ii campaign fought between allied and imperial japanese forces campaign was initiated by allies in late 1943 as part of a major offensive which aimed to neutralise important japanese base at rabaul capital of new britain and was conducted in two phases between december 1943 and end of war in august 1945 initial fighting on new britain took place around western end of island in december 1943 and january 1944 with us forces landing and securing bases around arawe and cape gloucester this was followed by a further landing in march 1944 around talasea after which little fighting took place between ground forces on island in october 1944 australian 5th division took over from us troops and undertook a landing at jacquinot bay following month before beginning a limited offensive to secure a defensive line across island between wide bay and open bay behind which they contained numerically superior japanese forces for remainder of war japanese regarded new britain campaign as a delaying action and kept their forces concentrated around rabaul in expectation of a ground assault which never came operations on new britain are considered by historians to have been a success for allied forces however some have questioned necessity of campaign in addition australian historians have been critical of limited air and naval support allocated to support operations on island between october 1944 and end of war background geography new britain is a crescent shaped island north east of mainland of new guinea it is approximately long and its width varies from around to this makes it largest island in bismarck archipelago interior of new britain is rugged with a range of volcanic mountains over high running for most of its length island s coast is indented by a large number of bays island has a tropical climate at time of world war ii mountains were covered by a rainforest of tall trees coastal plains which ring most of island were covered in dense jungle most of beaches on new britain were backed by forested swamps and a large number of rivers and streams ran from mountains to sea all of these characteristics greatly complicated movement of military units on new britain number of sites suitable for amphibious landings was also constrained by coral reefs which lay off most of island s coastline island s population in 1940 was estimated as over 101 000 new guineans and 4 674 europeans and asians rabaul located on north east coast of new britain was main settlement on island and largest in bismarcks town had served as capital of australian administered territory of new guinea since australian forces had captured region from germany during 1914 japanese occupation japanese forces captured new britain in january 1942 as part of efforts to secure rabaul quickly overwhelming small australian garrison during battle of rabaul this invasion was undertaken to both prevent allied forces from using rabaul to attack important japanese base at truk in central pacific and to capture town so that it could be used to support potential further japanese offensives in region while hundreds of australian soldiers and airmen managed to escape and were evacuated between february and may around 900 became prisoners of war and were treated harshly 500 european civilians captured by japanese were interned on 1 july 1942 849 pows and 208 civilian men who had been captured on new britain were killed when montevideo maru was torpedoed by an american submarine en route to japan most of remaining european internees were transported to solomon islands where they died due to poor conditions thumb 350px left alt colour map of new britain and nearby islands marked with location and strength of japanese forces stationed on them disposition of japanese forces on new britain and nearby islands in november 1943 japanese authorities adopted australian system of administering island through village chiefs and many villages shifted their loyalties to japanese to survive or to gain an advantage against other groups few chiefs who refused to cooperate with japanese were severely punished with several being killed while european women and children had been evacuated to australia prior to war asian people had not been assisted to leave chinese ethnic community feared that it would be massacred by japanese forces as had happened elsewhere in pacific but this did not occur however men were forced to work as labourers and some women were raped and in several cases forced to become comfort women following invasion japanese established a large base at rabaul facilities located near town were attacked by allied air units from early 1942 but these operations were generally unsuccessful by mid 1943 a network of four airfields had been constructed at rabaul which could accommodate 265 fighters and 166 bombers in protective revetments more aircraft could also be accommodated in unprotected parking areas aircraft based at these facilities operated against allied forces in new guinea and solomon islands town was also developed into a major port with extensive dock and ship repair facilities large stockpiles of supplies were stored in warehouses and open air dumps in and around rabaul few other japanese facilities were constructed on new britain though a forward airfield was developed at gasmata on island s south coast both japanese and australians maintained small parties of coastwatchers at other locations on new britain australians were civilians who had volunteered to remain on island following invasion during 1943 small parties of allied intelligence bureau aib personnel which comprised both australian and new guinean troops were landed on new britain aib units sought to gather intelligence re assert australian sovereignty and rescue downed allied airmen japanese attempted to hunt down allied coastwatchers and aib patrols and committed atrocities against civilians who assisted them aib also trained and equipped new guineans to serve as guerrillas which led to a successful low intensity campaign against japanese garrison however it also sparked tribal warfare with guerrillas attacking villages they believed to have collaborated with japanese opposing forces by 1943 there were more than 100 000 japanese military and civilian personnel on new britain and a smaller nearby island new ireland these were centred on headquarters of eighth area army under command of general hitoshi imamura 17th division 11 429 personnel at end of war 38th division 13 108 39th brigade 5 073 65th brigade 2 729 14th regiment 2 444 34th regiment 1 879 and 35th regiment 1 967 together these formations amounted to a force equivalent to four divisions naval troops provided equivalent of another division by end of war these japanese forces were restricted to rabaul and surrounding gazelle peninsula these forces lacked naval and air support and were increasingly isolated and eventually cut off from resupply due to allied interdiction efforts which meant that garrison was largely left to its own devices indeed direct communications between rabaul and japan were severed in february 1943 and not reestablished until after war in contrast united states australian and new guinean forces assisted by local civilians were always a division level command or smaller us director task force which secured arawe was effectively a regimental combat team based on 112th cavalry regiment it was later followed by 1st marine division before it handed over to 40th infantry division which in turn handed over to australian 5th division this was due partly to a miscalculation of size of japanese forces holding island as well as broader allied strategy which dictated a limited operation for new britain focused initially upon seizing and defending suitable locations for airbases and then containment of larger japanese force preliminary operations thumb 350px alt

allied and japanese operations associated with operation cartwheel between june 1943 and april 1944 from mid 1942 allied plans for pacific had a strong focus on capturing or neutralising rabaul in july 1942 us military s joint chiefs of staff ordered a two pronged offensive against rabaul forces assigned to south pacific area were directed to capture solomon islands starting with guadalcanal simultaneously units assigned to south west pacific area commanded by general douglas macarthur were to secure lae and salamaua on north coast of new guinea once these operations were complete forces from both commands would land on new britain and capture rabaul this plan proved premature however as macarthur lacked forces needed to execute his elements of it japanese offensive towards port moresby which was defeated after months of heavy fighting in kokoda track campaign battle of milne bay and battle of buna gona also disrupted allied plans but left them in control of territory needed to mount their own offensives allies re cast their plans in early 1943 following a major conference on 28 march joint chiefs of staff issued a new plan for reducing rabaul which was designated operation cartwheel under this plan macarthur s forces were to establish airfields on two islands off coast of new guinea capture huon peninsula region of mainland and land in western new britain south pacific area was to continue its advance through solomon islands towards rabaul culminating with a landing on bougainville island while initial plans for operation cartwheel directed macarthur to capture rabaul in june 1943 joint chiefs of staff decided that this was unnecessary as japanese base there could be neutralized by blockade and aerial bombardment macarthur initially opposed this change in plans but it was endorsed by british and united states combined chiefs of staff during quebec conference in august united states fifth air force main american air unit assigned to south west pacific area began a campaign against rabaul in october 1943 goal of attacks was to prevent japanese from using rabaul as an air or naval base and to provide support for planned landing on bougainville scheduled for 1 november as well as landings in western new britain planned for december first raid took place on 12 october and involved 349 aircraft further attacks were made whenever weather conditions were suitable during october and early november on 5 november two united states navy aircraft carriers also attacked town and its harbour following this attack imperial japanese navy ceased using rabaul as a fleet base campaign against rabaul was intensified from november when air units operating from airfields on recently captured islands in solomons joined attacks invasion of western new britain opposing plans on 22 september 1943 macarthur s general headquarters issued orders for invasion of new britain which was designated operation dexterity these directed us sixth army which at time was typically designated alamo force to land forces in cape gloucester region of western new britain and at gasmata to secure all of new britain west of line between gasmata and talasea on north coast macarthur s air commander lieutenant general george kenney opposed this operation as he believed that it would take too long to develop airfields at cape gloucester given rapid pace of allied advances in new guinea region and existing airfields were adequate to support attacks on rabaul and planned landings at other locations however lieutenant general walter krueger commander of alamo force and macarthur s naval commanders believed that it was necessary to invade new britain to gain control of strategic vitiaz strait through which it was planned to send convoys carrying allied forces to locations in western new guinea however planned landing at gasmata was cancelled in november due to concerns over japanese reinforcing region and its proximity to airfields at rabaul as well as terrain being judged too swampy instead on 21 november it was decided to capture arawe area on south west coast of new britain to establish a base for pt boats and hopefully divert japanese attention away from main landing at cape gloucester after taking into account availability of shipping and air cover landing at arawe was scheduled for 15 december and that at cape gloucester for 26th of that month thumb 350px left alt a map of western new britain showing movements of japanese forces and landings of allied forces as described in article movements of japanese

commenced in august 1943 intelligence to inform these plans was sourced from marine and alamo scout patrols which were landed in new britain between september and december as well as from aerial

selected for arawe was built around 112th cavalry regiment which had been dismounted and was serving as infantry cavalry regiment was augmented with artillery and engineer units with overall force being designated director task force japanese imperial general headquarters assessed strategic situation in southwest pacific in late september 1943 and concluded that allies would attempt to break through northern solomon islands and bismarck archipelago in coming months en route to japan s inner perimeter in western and central pacific accordingly reinforcements were dispatched to strategic locations in area in an attempt to slow allied advance strong forces were retained at rabaul however as it was believed that allies would attempt to capture town at time japanese positions in western new britain were limited to airfields at cape gloucester on island s western tip and several small way stations which provided small boats travelling between rabaul and new guinea with shelter from allied aerial attacks as new britain lay well to east of absolute national defence zone which had been adopted by japanese military on 15 september overall goal for forces there was to delay any allied advances to buy time to improve defences of more strategically important regions during october commander of eighth area army imamura judged that allies next move would probably be an invasion of western new britain in response he decided to dispatch further units to area to reinforce its garrison which was based around under strength 65th brigade and designated matsuda force after its commander major general iwao matsuda 17th division was selected to provide troops for this purpose main body of this unit arrived in rabaul from china on 4 and 5 october having suffered around 1 400 casualties due to submarine and air attacks while en route to new britain commander of 17th division lieutenant general yasushi sakai was appointed new commander of japanese forces in western new

operation director task force under command of brigadier general julian cunningham concentrated on goodenough island where they carried out training prior to embarking on 13 december 1943 in weeks prior to operation allied aircraft had carried out heavy attacks across new britain but area around landing beaches was purposefully left alone until day prior to landing in order not to alert japanese ships carrying invasion force arrived off arawe peninsula near cape merkus around 03 00 on 15 december two small advanced elements set off almost immediately under cover of darkness with orders to destroy a radio transmitter on pilelo island to south east and to sever track leading towards peninsula around umtingalu village subsidiary landing around umtingalu met with heavy resistance and was subsequently repulsed while landing on pilelo proved more successful with cavalrymen quickly overwhelming a small japanese force before securing their objective meanwhile after a deal of confusion while troops embarked in their landing craft main assault began after 06 25 supported by a heavy naval and aerial bombardment opposition ashore was limited as there were very few japanese in vicinity although first wave experienced machine gun fire that was quickly dealt with japanese aircraft from rabaul sortied over landing beach but were chased away by us fighters flying combat air patrols further confusion resulted in a delay in bringing second wave in while final three waves got mixed up and landed at same time nevertheless us cavalrymen quickly secured a beachhead and by afternoon they had secured amalut plantation and established a strong defensive position across base of arawe peninsula in days that followed japanese reinforcements arrived and they subsequently launched a counterattack but americans also brought in reinforcements including tanks and counterattack was repelled in aftermath japanese withdrew further inland towards a nearby airfield and fighting around arawe petered out cape gloucester thumb upright us marines landing at cape gloucester new britain 26 december 1943 alt heavily laden troops wade ashore through heavy surf landing at

william h rupertus was selected for attack for landing two beaches were chosen to east of airfields at cape gloucester which was main goal of operation a subsidiary landing site was also chosen on opposite side of cape to west of airfields troops from 7th marines embarked from oro bay escorted by us and australian warships from task force 74 en route they were reinforced by 1st marines and artillery from 11th marines a heavy aerial bombardment was directed against cape gloucester s garrison in weeks before landing which destroyed many of fixed defences and affected soldiers morale strikes continued on 26 december prior to assault resulting in heavy smoke which partially obscured beaches american landing was successful with counter attacks by japanese forces on 26 december being defeated next day 1st marine regiment advanced west towards airfields a japanese blocking position was reduced that afternoon but american advance was halted while reinforcements were landed it resumed on 29 december with airfields being captured during first two weeks of january 1944 marines advanced south from their beachhead to locate and defeat japanese force they believed was in area this led to some heavy fighting with japanese 141st infantry regiment attempting to defend positions located on high ground marines eventually secured area on 16 january with successful landing allies effectively gained control of sea lanes of communication to bismarck sea having secured lodgements on either side of vitiaz strait after earlier capturing finschhafen in january 1944 allies sought to press their advantage further launching another dexterity operation on new guinea coast with a landing at saidor as huon peninsula was cleared by australian and us forces in response japanese high command at rabaul ordered their forces that were withdrawing from huon peninsula to bypass saidor and they subsequently began withdrawing towards madang in mid january sakai requested permission to withdraw his command from western new britain and this was granted by imamura on 21st of month japanese forces subsequently sought to disengage from americans and move towards talasea area marine patrols pursued japanese and a large number of small engagements were fought in centre of island and along its north coast talasea thumb alt black and white photo of four men wearing military uniforms and helmets carrying bags and boxes along a trail several other men are standing at edge of trail and behind them us marines advance towards talasea airstrip in months following operations to secure arawe and cape gloucester there was only limited fighting on new britain as japanese forces largely chose to avoid combat during this period and continued their withdrawal towards rabaul us forces secured rooke island in february 1944 but by then island s garrison had already been withdrawn following month a further landing was undertaken at talasea on willaumez peninsula conceived as a follow up operation to cut off withdrawing japanese operation involved a regimental combat team formed primarily from 5th marines landing on willaumez peninsula on western side of a narrow isthmus near volupai plantation following initial landing marines advanced east towards emergency landing strip at talasea on opposite coast a small group of japanese defenders held up us troops and prevented them from advancing quickly enough to cut off withdrawal of main japanese force falling back from cape gloucester allied air attacks on rabaul were further intensified following completion of airfields on bougainville during january 1944 all of town was destroyed along with a large number of aircraft and ships japanese army lost relatively little equipment though as its stockpiles had been moved into volcanic caves during november due to shipping losses japanese stopped sending any further surface vessels to town from february japanese air units stationed at rabaul made their last attempt to intercept an allied raid on area on 19 february following this air raids which continued to end of war were contested only by anti aircraft gunfire as a result of its prolonged bombardment town ceased to be a base from which japanese could contest allied advance however it remained very well defended by a garrison of around 98 000 men and hundreds of artillery and anti aircraft guns extensive fortifications were constructed around gazelle peninsula where rugged terrain would have also favoured defenders on 14 march 1944 imperial general headquarters directed eighth area army to hold area around rabaul for as long as possible to divert allied forces away from other regions in april 1944 once arawe and cape gloucester had been secured us 40th infantry division under major general rapp brush arrived to relieve marines and cavalrymen that had landed in december 1943 after this a period of relative inactivity followed as us and japanese forces occupied opposite ends of island while guerilla actions were fought in centre by australian led forces of aib patrols from aib were subsequently successful in pushing back japanese outposts to on north coast and to kamandran in south in mid 1944 headquarters of eighth area army re assessed allied intentions on new britain while up to this time it had been believed that allies were planning a major assault on rabaul advance of allied forces towards philippines was interpreted to mean that this was no longer likely instead japanese judged that allies would advance slowly across new britain towards town and attack it only if their campaign towards japan became bogged down or concluded or if size of australian forces on island was increased australian operations 350px thumb alt black and white map showing operations of australian forces in new britain described in article australian operations in central new britain between october 1944 and march 1945 transfer to australian responsibility in october 1944 decision was made to transfer us 40th infantry division to fight in philippines with responsibility for new britain passing to australians in line with australian government s desire to use their own troops to recapture australian territory japanese had taken earlier in war australian 5th division commanded by major general alan ramsay was chosen for this operation having concentrated around madang in may 1944 following operations to secure huon peninsula allied intelligence at time had underestimated japanese strength on island believing it to be held by around 38 000 men while this was incorrect by a factor of two allied assessments of japanese intentions were more accurate with planners believing that imamura s force would adopt a defensive posture remaining largely inside fortifications that had been established around rabaul in fact japanese combat strength was approximately 69 000 men including 53 000 army troops and 16 000 marines and while they were mainly located in gazelle peninsula in north around rabaul there were watching stations established as far forward as due to garrison s increasing isolation many were involved in growing rice and gardening with american enclaves at talasea cape hoskins arawe and cape gloucester two sides were geographically separated and observing a tacit truce allied bombing had heavily reduced japanese air and naval forces to extent that there were only two operational aircraft left and only vessels that remained were 150 barges that could move small amounts of supplies or troops around coast ramsay s force was ordered to carry out a containment operation designed to isolate japanese garrison on gazelle peninsula in doing so ramsay was ordered to keep pressure on japanese while avoiding committing large scale forces nevertheless it was decided that australians would carry out a limited offensive consisting largely of patrol actions with goal of advancing beyond western tip of island where us garrison had remained to achieve this australian commanders decided to establish two bases one around jacquinot bay on southern coast with a supporting base on north coast around cape hoskins central new britain thumb left alt black and

on a transport ship near jacquinot bay in november 1944 in early october 1944 36th infantry battalion was landed at cape hoskins to begin taking over from us garrison early next month remaining elements of australian 6th infantry brigade landed at jacquinot bay in weeks that followed large amounts of stores and equipment were landed along with support personnel and labourers to begin construction on facilities including roads an airstrip dock facilities and a general hospital this work would last until may 1945 two squadrons of royal new zealand air force corsair fighter bombers were later flown in to support allied operations on island and us landing craft from 594th engineer boat and shore regiment provided support until australian landing craft company arrived in february 1945 due to limited shipping resources transfer of 5th division was delayed significantly and was not completed until april 1945 nevertheless in december australian advance began with goal of moving along northern and southern coasts towards gazelle peninsula to capture a line between wide bay and open bay along which to contain larger japanese force which remained largely static around rabaul fortress with only about 1 600 troops deployed in forward areas this saw a series of amphibious landings river crossings and small scale actions 36th infantry battalion began expanding their foothold around cape hoskins in early december pushing forward towards via barge where two companies established a forward base from where they began patrolling east after establishing that japanese had withdrawn behind pandi river a new base was established around ea ea with troops again being moved forward by barge 1st new guinea infantry battalion arrived to reinforce them in january 1945 after this australians on north coast pushed their line towards open bay establishing an outpost around baia and patrolling mavelo plantation during which several minor skirmishes were fought thumb 37th

during which a patrol from 1st new guinea infantry battalion carried out a successful ambush at this point japanese resistance on southern coast began to grow and in final phase of advance australians began advancing on foot around henry reid bay to secure waitavalo tol area which was held by a japanese force around battalion strength after this a series of engagements took place over a six week period to reduce main japanese position around mount sugi commencing with 19th infantry battalion s assault across wulwut river on 5 march position around mount sugi which stretched across a number of ridges to west of wulwut was strongly defended with mortars machine guns and pillboxes and heavy rain also frustrated australian attempts to reduce japanese stronghold fierce fighting followed culminating with 14th 32nd s attack on bacon hill on 18 march following capture of waitavalo tol area in march and april australians exploited towards jammer bay and sent patrols to link up their northern and southern drives they also brought in reinforcements first from 13th infantry brigade and then 4th as offensive part of their campaign effectively came to an end in months that followed australians mounted a series of patrols aimed at maintaining line around neck of gazelle peninsula to prevent any attempt by japanese to break out from rabaul this lasted until end of war in august 1945 2 2nd commando squadron conducted a patrol which penetrated close to rabaul and judged that terrain was so rough it would not be possible for large japanese units to move over it to attack australian forces a series of command changes had occurred around this time in april major general horace robertson took over command from ramsay while major general kenneth eather assumed control in early august aftermath rabaul was secured by 29th 46th infantry battalion which formed part of 4th infantry brigade on 6 september 1945 at which time over 8 000 former prisoners of war were liberated from japanese camps on island australian losses during fighting on new britain between october 1944 and end of war were limited amounting to 53 killed and 140 wounded a further 21 died from non battle injuries or illnesses losses amongst us 1st marine division amounted to 310 killed and 1 083 wounded in addition casualties for all allied units during fighting around arawe came to 118 killed and 352 wounded with four missing total japanese losses in new britain and other islands in bismarck archipelago are estimated at around 30 000 dead mostly from disease and starvation thumb left alt black and white photograph of men wearing military uniforms standing on top of tanks parked on a grassed area australian soldiers posing with captured japanese tanks at rabaul in september 1945 in aftermath of campaign there are mixed opinions among historians as to whether us landings around arawe and even around cape gloucester were necessary while according to henry shaw and douglas kane authors of marine corps official history landing around arawe arguably made landing at cape gloucester easier us naval historian samuel eliot morison argues that landing at arawe was of small value pointing out that it was never developed into a naval base and that potentially resources and manpower could have been employed elsewhere us army historian john miller also concluded that operations to secure arawe and cape gloucester were probably not essential to reduction of rabaul or approach to philippines while there were some benefits to offensive in western new britain and comparatively few casualties in summarising australian involvement in campaign gavin long australian official historian wrote that it was inadequately resourced particularly in terms of air and sea power with latter delaying concentration of 5th division until very late in campaign regardless long writes that australian force which was relatively inexperienced and matched against a japanese force of around five divisions achieved a remarkable result in circumstances lachlan grant also reaches a similar conclusion highlighting limited casualties that were sustained in campaign in comparison to those in other locations such as aitape wewak retired general john coates judged that in many respects australian operations on new britain had been a classic containment campaign but contrasted insufficient air and naval support for them with excesses of both which had been allocated to borneo campaign peter charlton also regarded australian operations as successful but was critical of both decision to deploy 5th division against a much more powerful japanese force and limited support provided for campaign defensive tactics of japanese commander imamura were likely a factor in ensuring successful containment by much smaller australian force according to japanese historian kengoro tanaka imamura had been under orders to preserve his strength until mutual action could be achieved with imperial japanese navy and had as such chosen to deploy only a small portion of his troops forward of fortress of rabaul eustace keogh concurs with this assessment arguing that any offensive would have lacked strategic purpose without sufficient naval and air support which at time was unavailable to japanese gregory blake has written that extremely rugged terrain made a large japanese offensive impossible
