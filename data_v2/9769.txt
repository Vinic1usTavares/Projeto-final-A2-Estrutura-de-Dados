indomitable spirit of black people using repetition and categorization of injustices against them she quoted it during interviews and often included it in her public readings despite adversity and racism angelou expresses her faith that one will overcome and triumph hagen compares still i rise with spirituals that express hope as she does in phenomenal woman and throughout her poetry and
