content it inspired me to take a different approach lyrically you have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so i just took this and ran with it those types of lyrics are fun to write you know dark subject matter dark master stuff it s another way of writing a fresh one to me he also summarizes lyrics it s a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with
