service workers defense league a socialist labor rights organization began a national campaign calling for commutation of waller s sentence and was supported in its efforts by novelist pearl s buck philosopher john dewey and first lady eleanor roosevelt president franklin d roosevelt also made a private appeal on waller s behalf to virginia governor colgate darden though campaign won several postponements of sentence waller was finally executed on july 2 1942 case failed to overturn poll tax but led to reform of virginia s penal system and motivated pauli murray to begin her career in civil rights law killing of oscar davis background odell waller was born in 1917 to dollie jones and an unknown father who died shortly after his birth jones gave boy to her sister annie waller and annie s husband willis waller to adopt and odell considered annie his mother odell completed three years of high school but was later forced to leave school to work on farm from 1935 to 1938 he was convicted of seven offenses including assault reckless driving bootlegging and carrying a concealed razor in january 1939 he married a woman named mollie during great depression wallers fell behind on mortgage for their farm and after willis died in 1938 bank foreclosed annie and odell then agreed to become sharecroppers for a white landlord oscar davis relationship quickly soured davis was also a sharecropper and when his own landlord reduced davis land allotment davis reduced that of wallers to only wallers accused davis of failing to pay annie an agreed 7 50 for taking care of davis ill wife for three weeks when wallers subsequently refused to work in davis fields davis evicted them following eviction someone on davis farm mutilated one of wallers dogs after annie s cousin robert helped her harvest farm s wheat davis took whole crop rather than give wallers their share in april 1940 odell had taken a job constructing electrical lines in maryland but he returned on weekend of july 13 14 to investigate worsening situation shooting at 6 30 am on july 15 1940 odell drove to davis s farm to get wheat with annie relatives archie waller and thomas younger and a friend named buck fitzgerald he brought a 32 caliber pistol subsequent events remain in dispute henry davis a teenage black employee of oscar davis maintained that odell waller had fired at oscar davis without provocation or warning hitting him four times oscar davis s sons testified that their father had stated before he died that waller had shot him without cause one son added that davis had said waller had continued to shoot after davis had already fallen to ground testimony of other witnesses including waller s relatives was inconclusive as they were too distant to hear conversation between waller and davis waller stated that davis had refused to let him take waller family share of wheat and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun waller then fired on davis davis escaped through cornfield after being shot and was taken to hospital where he died of his wounds on july 17 afraid he would be lynched waller fled to columbus ohio but was arrested there at home of an uncle on july 24 after a manhunt involving police and federal bureau of investigation trial during waller s trial which began on september 19 1940 he was represented by thomas h stone of small communist splinter organization revolutionary workers league rwl rwl s members had been expelled from communist party usa in 1934 for their trotskyist beliefs and organization was unpopular due to its opposition to world war ii group compared trial to that of scottsboro boys nine african american young men accused of rape in alabama under suspicious circumstances and began to criticize racism and economic conditions of waller s rural virginia county historian richard b sherman argues that group brought negative publicity to waller s trial from start by creating perception that radical outsiders were behind his defense a socialist labor rights organization workers defense league wdl offered to take over defense and public campaign to avoid stigma of communism from influencing waller s case but rwl rebuffed them stone and another defense attorney j byron hopkins were given only three days to prepare waller s defense after an all white jury was selected composed only of citizens that could pay poll tax stone moved that case be dismissed on grounds that waller was deprived of a trial by a jury of his peers however stone failed to submit evidence that this was case a factor that would prove crucial in later unsuccessful appeals judge dismissed motion as well as a tactically questionable motion by stone that judge himself was prejudiced in case and should withdraw testimony of henry davis and oscar davis s sons proved damning and several witnesses also testified that they had heard waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill oscar davis in an analysis of transcript sherman proposes that phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors but defense counsel did not pursue this possibility on september 27 1940 after less than an hour s deliberation jury found waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death a verdict praised by virginia press covering trial his execution was scheduled for december 27 of that year campaign for commutation after trial rwl agreed to pass responsibility for public campaign and legal appeals to wdl provided that case continue to be handled on a class struggle basis with attention to national issues as well as waller s specific situation eager to help waller wdl reluctantly agreed to terms organization assumed control of case in november 1940 and immediately began fundraising

people naacp joined case same month as did brotherhood of sleeping car porters giving case national publicity attorney martin a martin president of danville naacp developed information that both grand jury that indicted waller and petit jury that convicted him were composed only of white men who paid polled taxes thus excluding most blacks and waller s peers although county clerk initially gave him runaround groups hoped that case would lead us supreme court to rule that poll tax was unconstitutional in december virginia governor james h price granted waller his first stay of execution this one for three months giving new defense additional time to study case on march 28 1941 philosopher john dewey joined cause sending murray 5 00 for waller s defense and giving permission to use his name in further fundraising dewey later co signed an open letter comparing waller to dred scott a slave who had unsuccessfully sued for his freedom before us supreme court one of dewey s letters to new york times about case caught attention of nobel prize for literature laureate pearl s buck who also became involved in case she wrote in an open letter of her own that waller has ceased to be an individual he has become a personification of all those to whom democracy is denied in our country us first lady eleanor roosevelt also worked on waller s behalf historian richard b sherman states that she became involved after receiving a letter from murray which prompted her to write governor price requesting that he investigate whether waller had received a fair trial and delay execution roosevelt biographer doris kearns goodwin in contrast holds that first lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from waller himself saying i have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady you are and what i can hear is that you believe in helping poor please write to governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance whatever its beginnings roosevelt s involvement in case caused

porters a philip randolph and naacp s walter white traveled to washington in an attempt to lobby president personally unaware that he had already secretly appealed on their behalf president s apparent refusal to act damaged his relationship with civil rights leaders murray in an open letter on behalf of movement called it a stab in back murray and eleanor roosevelt however would remain friends
