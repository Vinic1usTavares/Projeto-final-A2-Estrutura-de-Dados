white dog is a 1982 american drama film which samuel fuller directed from a screenplay he and curtis hanson had dramatized which in turn they based on romain gary s 1970 novel of same name film depicts struggle of a dog trainer named keys paul winfield who is black trying to retrain a stray dog found by a young actress kristy mcnichol that is a white dog a dog trained to make vicious attacks upon and to kill any black person fuller uses film as a platform to deliver an anti racist message as it examines question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable condition film s theatrical release was suppressed for a week in united states by paramount pictures out of concern over negative press after rumors began circulating that film was racist prior to date it was released internationally in france in july 1982 its first official american home video release came in december 2008 when criterion collection released original uncut film to dvd critics praised film s hard line look at racism and fuller s use of melodrama and metaphors to present his argument and its somewhat disheartening ending that leaves impression that while racism is learned it cannot be cured reviewers consistently questioned film s lack of wide release in united states when it was completed and applauded its belated release by criterion plot in civil rights era of united states actress julie sawyer accidentally runs over a stray white german shepherd dog after veterinarian treats him julie takes him home while trying to find his owners a rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her but dog protects her she decides to adopt him against wishes of her boyfriend roland unbeknown to her dog was trained by a white racist to attack black people on sight dog sneaks out of house and kills a black truck driver later julie takes dog to work with her and he mauls a black actress on set realizing that her dog is vicious julie takes him to a trainer carruthers who tells her to euthanize dog another dog trainer named keys who is black undertakes reprogramming dog as a personal challenge he dons protective gear and keeps dog in a large enclosure taking him out on a chain and exposing himself to dog each day and making sure he is only one to feed or care for dog dog escapes and kills an elderly black man in a church after which keys manages to recover him and opts not to turn him over to authorities to continue training over julie s protests he warns her that training has reached a tipping point where dog might be cured or go insane he believes that curing dog will discourage white racists from training dogs like this after a lengthy time it seems dog is cured in that he is now friendly towards keys julie confronts dog s original owner who has come to claim him and who presumably trained him to attack black people she angrily tells him dog has been cured by a black person in front of his grandchildren who knew dog to be a loving pet just as julie and keys celebrate their victory dog without warning turns its attention to carruthers and brutally attacks him dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him no explanation for this is given but implication is that dog s programming has somehow been reversed though that was never keys intention or that carruthers has a similarity to dog s original owner to save his employer s life keys is forced to shoot and kill dog and film ends with image of dog s body lying in center of training enclosure themes white dog is a blunt highly cinematic parable about race relations that questions whether racism is a curable mental illness or learned behavior or if it is an untreatable disease unnamed white german shepherd is metaphor of racism with his radically contrasting moments of innocent typical dog behavior when not around black persons and his snarling viciousness when he sees a target paul winfield s character keys who believes he can help dog unlearn this behavior represents view that racism can be keys s attempts to reprogram dog become a bold of race war and as film progresses keys becomes obsessed with idea that he can cure dog much like captain ahab he declares that if he fails with this dog he will find another and another until he succeeds keys s counterpart carruthers a white trainer believes dog is irredeemable and should be killed representing view that racism cannot be cured scenes showing kristy mcnichol innocently burying her hands in dog s fur and his normal loving behavior when alone with her provides a stark image of how hatred can be familiar reassuringly close j hoberman argues that film racism in an unnatural way in contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by dog s behavior and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life film s ending has been argued to emphasize fuller s own view that racism is something that is learned but that once learned is a poison that can never truly be banished from those it infects but on other hand dog is actually cured of attacking blacks but not cured of his own hatred since last thing he does is to attack a white man and without being provoked into doing so at that ending implies therefore that it is hatred and not racism that cannot be banished from those it infects in romain gary s original novel this was not story that was told dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained him to do so production white dog s roots lie with a 1970 autobiographical novel written by romain gary of same name story was purchased for use by paramount in 1975 with curtis hanson selected to write screenplay and roman polanski hired to direct before shooting commenced polanski was charged with rape and fled country leaving production in limbo over a span of six years project was given to various writers and producers who all focused on stray dog story from gary s original work gary s activist wife was replaced in script with a young unmarried actress because paramount wanted to contrast dog s random attacks with a loving relationship between protagonist and dog paramount executives noted that they wanted a jaws with paws and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed in one memo company noted given organic elements of this story it is imperative that we never overtly address through attitude or statement issue of racism per se by 1981 gary s wife and then gary himself had both committed suicide at same time hollywood was under threat of strikes by both writers and directors guilds needing enough films to carry studio through in case strikes happened white dog was one of 13 films considered to be far enough along to be completable in a short time frame with a push from michael eisner white dog was one of seven that paramount put on a fast track for production eisner pushed for film to be one of selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned producer jon davison was less certain and early on he questioned how film was being marketed hanson back on board as film s screenwriter suggested that samuel fuller be named film s director as he felt fuller was only one available with experience needed to complete film on such a short schedule and with a low budget while still doing so responsibly with regard to sensitive material davison agreed after visiting fuller and seeing fuller act out how he would shoot film fuller readily agreed having focused much of his own career on racial issues already familiar with novel and with concept of white dogs he was tasked with film to have conflict depicted in book occur within dog rather than people in an earlier variety magazine interview fuller stated that viewers would see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity before filming began national association for advancement of colored people naacp black anti defamation coalition badc and other civil rights leaders began voicing concerns that film would spur racial violence in an editorial in los angeles times robert price executive director of badc criticized studio for producing film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew rather than producing film with african americans in key positions he also considered gary s work to be a second rate novel and questioned its use when bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety fuller however was confident in his work and idea that film would be strongly anti racist particularly with changes he had made to original work original novel s hate filled muslim black trainer who had deliberately retrained dog to attack white people was converted into character of keys who genuinely wished to cure animal fuller also changed novel s original ending into a more pessimistic film ending film was shot in only forty five days at a cost of 7 million five white german shepherd dogs played unnamed central character after filming commenced paramount pictures brought in two african american consultants to review and approve depiction of black characters willis edwards vice president of local naacp chapter and david l crippens vice president and stage manager of local pbs affiliate in end they walked away with different views of film crippens did not find film to have any racist connotations while edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made particularly not during that year when a series of murders of black children was occurring in atlanta two men provided a write up of their views for studio executives which were passed to davison along with warnings that studio feared a film boycott but fuller was neither told of these discussions nor given notes until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non stereotypical roles fuller was furious finding studio s actions insulting he reportedly had both representatives banned from set afterwards though he did integrate some of suggested changes into film film was completed in 1981 but paramount was hesitant to release film out of continuing concerns that film would be misconstrued though no one from organization had viewed completed film naacp threatened boycotts in early 1982 studio finally held a preview screening in seattle and later in august in denver with mixed responses afi entry it was finally released in us at five detroit theatres on november 12 1982 for just one week with no trailer no poster and no promotion at all it did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by paramount dumbfounded and hurt by film s shelving fuller moved to france and never directed another american film later in april 1987 during an interview held in milan fuller stated that paramount shelved film also because they feared negative reactions from kkk l unita april 7 1987 distribution paramount felt film was too controversial for release giving it only a few preview showings and a one week run in detroit before shelving it film s first theatrical release occurred in france on july 7 1982 in united kingdom it was part of 37th edinburgh international film festival and 27th london film festival in 1983 and was released late that year by united international pictures it received positive reviews in both countries lisa dombrowski of film comment notes in end sam fuller s white dog was muzzled by a collision of historically specific economic and political interests as support for freedom of expression took a back seat to paramount s bottom line and naacp s ongoing battles with hollywood over representation and employment a sam fuller thriller was simply not kind of antiracist picture that a major studio knew how to market in 1981 or that african american organizations wanted hollywood to make at time in 1983 white dog was edited for a direct to television broadcast and made available for purchase by cable channels following year nbc bought broadcast rights for 2 5 million and slated film to air during february sweeps then canceled broadcast two days later due to pressure from continuing naacp campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as hbo showtime and movie channel sporadically and without fanfare it was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals in 1991 michael schlesinger then head of paramount s repertory division convinced his bosses to let him book film as part of a complete fuller retrospective at new york s film forum he did not tell them that it would be a full one week booking instead of usual single day and billed as its new york premiere film received rave reviews and crowds packed theatre at year s end village voice called it best film of year demands to play film increased after some deliberation paramount said he could continue to accept dates provided that there would be no racial outcry if there were he would have to stop he accepted deal and it successfully played revival houses in rest of country without incident its first official american home video release came on december 2 2008 when criterion collection released film to dvd dvd has uncut version of film video interviews from original producer and writer an interview with trainer of dog used in film and a booklet of critical essays national society of film critics bestowed distributor with a special film heritage award for releasing film reception due to its limited release it only grossed 46 509 film was praised by critics upon its release particularly for its treatment of racism and fuller s directorial talents dave kehr of chicago tribune praised fuller for pulling no punches in film and for his use of metaphors to present racism as a mental disease for which there may or may not be a cure kehr considered film less melodramatic or bizarre than fuller s earlier works which was also positive since it left film clean and uncluttered with a single concentrated line of development mounting toward a single crushingly pessimistic moral insight entertainment weekly s kim moran called it a uncompromising poignant examination of racism and felt it was one of fuller s most inspired films and a gripping meditative and ultimately beautiful achievement video business reviewer cyril pearl called it bombastic odd and quite chilling and felt film was an antiracist work that deserve d an audience but charles taylor writing for new york times lambasted film s original suppression due to stupidity of pressure groups that wrongly labeled film as racist when it is in his words a profoundly antiracist film though a despairing one he praised winfield s tense performance and fuller s use of melodrama to create one of his most potent films lisa dombrowski author of films of samuel fuller if you die i ll kill you and an associate professor of film studies at wesleyan university referred to film as an impassioned attack on racial hatred another new york times reviewer janet maslin praised fuller s command of stark spooky imagery b style bluntness and way cinematography scene setting and soundtrack combine to give film blunt unnerving power of a horror story she also commended paul winfield s performance as keys feeling actor turned what might have been a boring character into one audiences would find interesting slant magazine s fernando f croce felt film was part marauding animal horror movie part afterschool special and part tragic sardonic agitprop b movie that is searing confrontation of irrationality of prejudice in magic hour film at fin de siecle j hoberman referred to film as an unusually blunt and suggestive metaphoric account of american racism though he felt film was a sad waste of fuller s talent he praised director s treatment of work including changes made to source material noting that filmed in headlines framed as allegory white dog combines hard boiled sentimentality and hysterical violence
