her storyline grew at a great pace not all reviews were positive television columnist alan sepinwall of star ledger said that past 30 rock episodes took old sitcom cliches and were able to find a demented new take on them in his review sepinwall wrote that generalissimo felt like staff came up with cliches they wanted to mock goofy evil twins a character spinning a ridiculous web of lies to land a new crush and never moved to next step references external links category 2009 american television episodes category 30 rock season 3 episodes
