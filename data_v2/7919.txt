physicians and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in areas around lu an and it is commonly stated that zhengyan himself was also a doctor though earliest sources attesting to this occur only in second half of 19th century by 1619 hu had moved to nanjing where he lived with his wife wu their home on now also known as ge a hill located just within northern city wall served as a meeting house for like minded artists hu named it ten bamboo studio shizhuzhai after ten bamboo plants that grew in front of property it functioned as headquarters for his printing

overthrown and replaced by china s last imperial dynasty qing following fall of capital beijing in 1644 remnants of imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime in nanjing with zhu yousong on throne as hongguang emperor hu who was noted for his seal carving and facility with seal script created a seal for new emperor court offered him position of drafter for secretariat zhongshu sheren as a reward but he did not accept role although he did accord himself title of zhongshu sheren in some of his subsequent personal seals according to wen s lost history of south prior to qing invasion of nanjing hu studied at national university there and whilst a student was employed by ministry of rites to record official proclamations he produced imperial promotion of minor learning qin ban and record of displayed loyalty biaozhong ji as part of this work as a result he was promoted to ministry of personnel and gained admittance to hanlin academy but before he could take up this appointment beijing had fallen to manchu rebellion since contemporaneous biographies wen s work was not published until 1830 make no mention of these events it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu s death hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 after end of ming dynasty xiao and lu recorded visiting him during his later years in 1667 and 1673

was a noted seal carver producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries his style was rooted in classical seal script of han dynasty and he followed huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary he zhen hu s calligraphy although balanced and with a clear compositional structure is somewhat more angular and rigid than classical models he followed huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient weathered impression although unlike other huizhou artists hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals hu s work was known outside his local area zhou a poet who lived in nanjing around same time as hu and was a noted art connoisseur stated in his biography of seal carvers zhuan that hu creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through nanjing in 1644 hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal for hongguang emperor which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer he presented his creation with an essay great exhortation of seal zhen in which he bemoaned loss of chongzhen emperor s seal and begged heaven s favour in restoring it hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in form of rhyming equally footed couplets used in imperial examinations but his submission and seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by southern ming court ten bamboo studio thumb alt chinese painting of four pieces of fruit fruit persimmon and three yellow from ten bamboo studio manual of painting and calligraphy showing colour gradation achieved through hu zhengyan s printing methods despite his reputation as an artist and seal carver hu was primarily a publisher his publishing house ten bamboo studio produced reference works on calligraphy poetry and art medical textbooks books on etymology and phonetics and copies of as well as commentaries on confucian classics unlike other publishers in area ten bamboo studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels this bias towards academia was likely a consequence of studio s location mountain on which hu took up residence was just to north of nanjing national academy which provided a captive market for academic texts between 1627 and 1644 ten bamboo studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind aimed at a wealthy literary audience studio s earliest publications were medical textbooks first of which tested prescriptions for myriad illnesses was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later hu s brother zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been author of these books thumb left upright alt chinese calligraphy in black ink on

continued to publish well into qing dynasty for most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing hu s carving work ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in process of colour printing in china at his studio hu zhengyan experimented with various forms of woodblock printing creating processes for producing multi coloured prints and embossed printed designs as a result he was able to produce some of china s first printed publications in colour using a block printing technique known as assorted block printing douban yinshua this system made use of multiple blocks each carved with a different part of final image and each bearing a different colour it was a lengthy painstaking process requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy and impressions to create a single image hu also employed a related form of multiple block printing called set block printing yinshua which had existed since yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of ink off blocks before printing this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible in some images hu employed a blind embossing technique known as embossed designs gonghua or embossed blocks using an uninked imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper he used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants this was a relatively new process having been invented by hu s contemporary wu who was also a nanjing based publisher wu had used this technique for first time in his book wisteria studio letter paper jianpu published in 1626 both hu and wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers sale of which provided a sideline income for ten bamboo studio major works file hu zhengyan bamboo in snow 1 png thumbnail bamboo in snow from ten bamboo studio manual of painting and

volumes as well as a collection of artworks it was also intended as an artistic primer with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy although these instructions only appear in sections on orchids and bamboo book still remains first example of a categorical and analytical approach to chinese painting in this book hu used his multiple block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in images rather than obvious outlines or overlaps manual is bound in butterfly binding zhuang style whereby whole folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double page spread this binding style allows reader to lay book flat in order to look at a particular image cambridge university library released a complete digital scan of manual including all writings and illustrations in august 2015 said charles aylmer head of cambridge university chinese department binding is so fragile and manual so delicate that until it was digitized we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it despite its undoubted importance to scholars this volume went on to influence colour printing across china where it paved way for later but better known manual of mustard seed garden jieziyuan huazhuan and also in japan where it was reprinted and foreshadowed development in ukiyo e of colour woodblock printing process known as nishiki e popularity of ten bamboo studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all way through to late qing dynasty hu also produced work ten bamboo studio letter
