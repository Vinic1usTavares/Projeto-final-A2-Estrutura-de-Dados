convict wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity orwell p 289 orwell s rationale was that wodehouse s moral outlook has remained that of a public school boy and according to public school code treachery in time of war is most unforgivable of all sins which was compounded by his complete lack so far as one can judge from his printed works of political awareness orwell p 296 on 15 january

shop and visit family and friends wodehouse never left america after his arrival in 1947 mccrum p 368 it was not until 1965 that british government indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings and by then he felt too old to make journey donaldson p 340 biographers benny green and robert mccrum both take view that this exile benefited wodehouse s writing helping him

after he had completed his notes he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words which ensured plot holes were avoided and allowed for dialogue to begin to develop voorhees 1966 p 168 when interviewed in 1975 he revealed that for a humorous novel you ve got to have a scenario and you ve got to test it so that you know where comedy comes in where situations come in splitting it up into scenes you can make a scene of almost anything and have as little stuff in between as possible he preferred working between 4 and 7 pm but never after dinner and would work seven days a week in his younger years he would write around two to three thousand words a day although he slowed as he aged so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books when younger he would produce a novel in about three months while bachelors anonymous published in 1973 took around six months voorhees 1966 pp 168 169 although studies of language production in normal healthy ageing show a marked decline from mid 70 s on a study of wodehouse s works did not find any evidence of a decline in linguistic ability with age wodehouse believed that one of factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life and he stated that if you take life fairly easily then you take a humorous view of things it s probably because you were born that way he carried this view through into his writing describing approach as making thing a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether easdale p 111 literary critic edward l galligan considers wodehouse s stories to show his mastery in adapting form of american musical comedy for his writings wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done

333 although some critics thought wodehouse s fiction was based on a world that had never existed wodehouse affirmed that it did it was going strong between wars although he agreed that his version was to some extent a sort of artificial world of my own creation wodehouse and donaldson p 144 novels showed a largely unchanging world regardless of when they were written and only rarely and mistakenly in mccrum s view did wodehouse allow modernity to intrude as he did in 1966 story bingo bans bomb mccrum pp 407 and 501 when dealing with dialogue in his novels wodehouse would consider book s characters as if they were actors in a play ensuring that main roles were kept suitably employed throughout storyline which must be strong if they aren t in interesting situations characters

english prose levin bernard as jeeves would have said perfect music sir times 18 february 1975 p 14 hall identifies several techniques used by wodehouse to achieve comic effect including creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes so when pongo removes housemaid elsie bean from a cupboard wodehouse writes that character de beaned cupboard wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two thus wodehouse divides when he writes to offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing nor when you light it for her does that constitute richard voorhees wodehouse s biographer believes that author used cliches in a deliberate and ironic manner voorhees 1966 p 165 his opinion is shared by academic stephen medcalf who deems wodehouse s skill is to bring a cliche just enough

stylistic device most commonly found in wodehouse s work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes hall opines that humour comes from wodehouse s ability to accentuate resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous examples can be seen in joy in morning chapter 29 there was a sound in background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside jeeves sailing into action or psmith chapter 7 a sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation hall also identifies that periodically wodehouse used stylistic device of a transferred epithet with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object form of expression is used sparingly by wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms only once or twice in a story or novel according to hall hall robert a jr transferred epithet in p g wodehouse linguistic inquiry winter 1973 pp 92 94 i balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on teaspoon joy in morning chapter 5 as i sat in bath tub a meditative foot jeeves and feudal spirit chapter 1 first thing he did was to prod jeeves in lower ribs with an uncouth forefinger much obliged jeeves chapter 4 wordplay is a key element in wodehouse s writing this can take form of puns such as in jeeves and feudal spirit when bertie is released after a night in police cells and says that he has a pinched look about him linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism such as in uncle dynamite when constable potter says he has been assaulted by duck pond in reply sir aylmer confusing two meanings of word by asks how devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour some come through exaggeration such as bingo little s infant child who not only has aspect of a mass murderer but that of a mass murderer suffering from an or wooster s complaint that that bobbie wickham is already starting may be amusing to her but not to unfortunate toads beneath harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into soup voorhees 1966 pp 166 167 bertie wooster s half forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device in jeeves and feudal spirit bertie asks jeeves let a like young thos loose in community with a cosh and you are inviting disaster and what s word something about cats jeeves replies cataclysms sir reception and

1922 david heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of farcical novels they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life and in his most comic works author seemed to lack never oblivious to grief and despair he opts in clear eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly headed peers it s an austere almost bloodless preference for
