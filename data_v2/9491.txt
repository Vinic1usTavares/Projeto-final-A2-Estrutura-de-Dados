amanita bisporigera is a deadly poisonous species of fungus in family amanitaceae it is commonly known as eastern north american destroying angel or just as destroying angel although fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white amanita species a ocreata a verna and a virosa fruit bodies are found on ground in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests of eastern north america south to mexico but are rare in western north america fungus has also been found in pine plantations in colombia mushroom has a smooth white cap that can reach up to across and a stipe up to long by thick that has a delicate white skirt like ring near top bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac like volva white gills are free from attachment to stalk and crowded closely together as species name suggests a bisporigera typically bears two spores on basidia although this characteristic is not as immutable as was once thought amanita bisporigera was described as a new species in 1906 it is classified in section phalloideae of genus amanita together with other amatoxin containing species amatoxins are cyclic peptides which inhibit enzyme rna polymerase ii and interfere with various cellular functions first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption followed by a period of apparent improvement then by symptoms of liver and kidney failure and death after four days or more amanita bisporigera closely resembles a few other white amanitas including equally deadly a virosa and a verna these species difficult to distinguish from a bisporigera based on visible field characteristics do not have two spored basidia and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide is applied dna of a bisporigera has been partially sequenced and genes responsible for production of amatoxins have been determined taxonomy classification and phylogeny amanita bisporigera was first described scientifically in 1906 by american botanist george francis atkinson in a publication by cornell university colleague charles e lewis type locality was ithaca new york where several collections were made in his 1941 monograph of world amanita species edouard jean gilbert transferred species to his new genus but this genus is now considered synonymous with amanita in 1944 william murrill described species amanita collected from gainesville florida that species is now thought to be synonymous with a bisporigera after a 1979 examination of its type material revealed basidia that were mostly 2 spored amanita phalloides var a poorly known taxon originally described from united states in 1902 by charles horton peck is considered by amanita authority rodham tulloss to be synonymous with a bisporigera vernacular names for mushroom include destroying angel deadly amanita white death cap angel of death and eastern north american destroying angel amanita bisporigera belongs to section phalloideae of genus amanita which contains some of deadliest amanita species including a phalloides and a virosa this classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses which demonstrate that toxin producing members of section phalloideae form a clade that is they derive from a common ancestor in 2005 zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed spacer its sequences of several white bodied toxic amanita species most of which are found in asia their results support a clade containing a bisporigera a subjunquillea var alba a exitialis and a virosa guangzhou destroying angel amanita exitialis has two spored basidia like a bisporigera description thumb left white gills are crowded closely together and stipe base is bulbous cap is in diameter and depending on its age ranges in shape from egg shaped to convex to somewhat flattened cap surface is smooth and white sometimes with a pale tan or cream colored tint in center surface is either dry or when environment is moist slightly sticky flesh is thin and white and does not change color when bruised margin of cap which is rolled inwards in young specimens does not have striations grooves and lacks volval remnants gills also white are crowded closely together they are either free from attachment to stipe or just barely reach it lamellulae short gills that do not extend all way to stipe are numerous and gradually narrow thumb 150px surfaces turn yellow when stained with potassium hydroxide solution white stipe is by thick solid i e not hollow and tapers slightly upward surface in young specimens especially is frequently floccose covered with tufts of soft hair fibrillose covered with small slender fibers or covered with small scales there may be fine grooves along its length bulb at base of stipe is spherical or nearly so delicate ring on upper part of stipe is a remnant of partial veil that extends from cap margin to stalk and covers gills during development it is white thin membranous and hangs like a skirt when young mushrooms are enveloped in a membrane called universal veil which stretches from top of cap to bottom of stipe imparting an oval egg like appearance in mature fruit bodies veil s remnants form a membrane around base volva like an eggshell shaped cup on occasion however volva remains underground or gets torn up during development it is white sometimes lobed and may become pressed closely to stipe jenkins 1986 pp 140 41 volva is up to in height measured from base of bulb and is about 2 mm thick midway between top and base attachment mushroom s odor has been described as pleasant to somewhat nauseous becoming more cloying as fruit body ages cap flesh turns yellow when a solution of potassium hydroxide koh 5 10 is applied a common chemical test used in mushroom identification this characteristic chemical reaction is shared with a ocreata and a virosa although some authors have expressed doubt about identity of north american a virosa suggesting those collections may represent four spored a bisporigera tulloss suggests that reports of a bisporigera that do not turn yellow with koh were actually based on white forms of a phalloides findings from chiricahua mountains of arizona and in central mexico although nearly identical to a bisporigera do not stain yellow with koh their taxonomic status has not been investigated in detail microscopic features thumb left spores are roughly spherical and spore print of a bisporigera like most amanita is white spores are roughly spherical thin walled hyaline translucent amyloid and measure 7 8 9 6 by 7 0 9 0 mm cap cuticle is made of partially gelatinized filamentous interwoven hyphae 2 6 mm in diameter tissue of gill is bilateral meaning it diverges from center of gill to its outer edge subhymenium is composed of relatively thin branching unclamped hyphae spore bearing cells basidia are club shaped thin walled without clamps with dimensions of 34 45 by 4 11 mm they are typically two spored although rarely three or four spored forms have been found although two spored basidia are a defining characteristic of species there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four spored basidia as fruiting season progresses volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae 2 10 mm in diameter that are sparsely to moderately branched there are few small inflated cells which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic tissue of stipe is made of abundant sparsely branched filamentous hyphae without clamps measuring 2 5 mm in diameter inflated cells are club shaped longitudinally oriented and up to 2 3 by 15 7 mm annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae measuring 2 6 mm in diameter inflated cells are sparse broadly elliptic to pear shaped and are rarely larger than 31 by 22 mm pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia cystidia found on gill faces and edges respectively are absent but there may be cylindrical to sac like cells of partial veil on gill edges these cells are hyaline and measure 24 34 by 7 16 mm thumb right development of basidia as illustrated by lewis in 1906 charles e lewis studied and illustrated development of basidia in order to compare nuclear behavior of two spored with that of four spored forms initially 1 young basidium appearing as a club shaped branch from subhymenium is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei which have distinct as basidium grows larger membranes of two nuclei contact 2 and then membrane disappears at point of contact 3 two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time but eventually two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus 4 5 basidium increases in size after primary nuclei fuse and nucleus migrates towards end of basidia 6 7 during this time nucleus develops vacuoles filled by nuclear sap in living cell chromosomes are produced from nucleolar threads and align transversely near apex of basidium connected by spindles 8 10 chromosomes then move to poles forming daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in basidium daughters now have a structure similar to that of parent nuclei 11 two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei similar to fungi with four spored basidia 12 13 four nuclei crowd together at some distance from end of basidium to form an irregular mass 14 shortly thereafter sterigmata slender projections of basidia that attach spores begin to form 15 and cytoplasm begins to pass through sterigmata to form spores 16 although lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether contents of two or four nuclei passed through sterigmata he deduced by examining older basidia with mature spores that only two nuclei enter spores 16 17 toxicity thumb left a amanitin principal toxic component of a bisporigera amanita bisporigera is considered most toxic north american amanita mushroom with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies three subtypes of amatoxin have been described a b and g amanitin principal amatoxin a amanitin is readily absorbed across intestine and 60 of absorbed toxin is excreted into bile and undergoes enterohepatic circulation kidneys clear remaining 40 toxin inhibits enzyme rna polymerase ii thereby interfering with dna transcription which suppresses rna production and protein synthesis this causes cellular necrosis especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein synthesis this process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and ultimately liver failure amatoxins are not broken down by boiling freezing or drying roughly 0 2 to 0 4 milligrams of a amanitin is present in 1 gram of a bisporigera lethal dose in humans is less than 0 1 mg kg body weight one mature fruit body can contain 10 12 mg of a amanitin enough for a lethal dose a amanitin concentration in spores is about 17 that of fruit body tissues a bisporigera also contains phallotoxin phallacidin structurally related to amatoxins but considered less poisonous because of poor absorption poisonings from similar white amanitas have also been reported in domestic animals including dogs cats and cows first reported poisonings resulting in death from consumption of a bisporigera were from near san antonio mexico in 1957 where a rancher his wife and three children consumed fungus only man survived amanita poisoning is characterized by following distinct stages incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion in gastrointestinal stage about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion there is onset of abdominal pain explosive vomiting and diarrhea for up to 24 hours which may lead to dehydration severe electrolyte imbalances and shock these early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin in cytotoxic stage 24 to 48 hours after ingestion clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed but patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice hypoglycemia acidosis and hemorrhage appear later there is an increase in levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia and signs of hepatic encephalopathy and or kidney failure appear risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms severe coagulopathy blood clotting disorder severe jaundice and rising serum creatinine levels similar species color and general appearance of a bisporigera are similar to those of a verna and a virosa a bisporigera is at times smaller and more slender than either a verna or a virosa but it varies considerably in size therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic a virosa fruits in autumn later than a bisporigera a elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in southeastern united states while a ocreata is found on west coast and in southwest other similar toxic north american species include amanita magnivelaris which has a cream colored rather thick felted skirt like ring and a virosiformis which has elongated spores that are 3 9 4 7 by 11 7 13 4 mm jenkins 1986 p 146 neither a elliptosperma nor a magnivelaris typically turn yellow with application of koh koh reaction of a virosiformis has not been reported jenkins 1986 p 141 is another all white mushroom with an annulus free gills and white spore print but it lacks a volva and has thick walled dextrinoid staining red brown in melzer s reagent egg shaped spores with a pore a bisporigera may also be confused with larger edible species agaricus silvicola horse mushroom like many white amanitas young fruit bodies of a bisporigera still enveloped in universal veil can be confused with puffball species but a longitudinal cut of fruit body reveals internal structures in amanita that are absent in puffballs in 2006 seven members of hmong community living in minnesota were poisoned with a bisporigera because they had confused it with edible paddy straw mushrooms volvariella that grow in southeast asia habitat and distribution like most other amanita species a bisporigera is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees this is a mutually beneficial relationship where hyphae of fungus grow around roots of trees enabling fungus to receive moisture protection and nutritive byproducts of tree and giving tree greater access to soil nutrients jenkins 1986 p 5 fruit bodies of amanita bisporigera are found on ground growing either solitarily scattered or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests they tend to appear during summer and early fall fruit bodies are commonly found near oak but have been reported in birch aspen areas in west it is most commonly found in eastern north america and rare in western north america it is widely distributed in canada and its range extends south to mexico species has also been found in colombia where it may have been introduced from trees exported for use in pine plantations genome sequencing amanita genome project was begun in jonathan walton s lab at michigan state university in 2004 as part of their ongoing studies of amanita bisporigera purpose of project is to determine genes and genetic controls associated with formation of mycorrhizae and to elucidate biochemical mechanisms of toxin production genome of a bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated sanger sequencing and and genome sequence information is publicly searchable sequence data enabled researchers to identify genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis and cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes and require proline specific from prolyl family for processing genetic sequence information from a bisporigera has been used to identify molecular polymorphisms in related a phalloides these single nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics sequence information has also been employed to show that a bisporigera lacks many of major classes of secreted enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls like cellulose in contrast saprobic fungi like coprinopsis cinerea and galerina marginata which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients have a more complete complement of cell wall degrading enzymes although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way authors suggest that absence of plant cell wall degrading ability may correlate with ectomycorrhizal
