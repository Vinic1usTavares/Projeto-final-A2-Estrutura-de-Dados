we had to write a montage song for episode evicted while finn and jake are looking for a new house pen wrote a bunch of lyrics so i brought them home and fine tuned them and put them to music i recorded a demo that was too long so i just digitally sped it up to be right length which is recording above song was supposed to sound sort of lame like sort of like a lame singer songwriter guy who s into dave matthews but isn t nearly as talented that was like a thing in early 2000s a lot of people played this certain acoustic guitar style but i don t know name for it maybe it has tinges of what was called emo or what does hoobastank sound like uhh i don t know who cares i m old now and i don t remember anything in end i didn t want to sing final version so pen did singing in show he did more of a blink 182 style thing blink 182 is that right ashley played all of bass in episode according to series composer casey james basichis she is classically trained as a bassist and can do just about anything ryan conner recorded guitar feedback that basichis later autotuned into melodies episode marks first appearance of marceline one of main characters in adventure time although she did
