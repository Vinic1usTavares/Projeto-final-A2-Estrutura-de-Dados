rockwell b 1 lancer is a supersonic variable sweep wing heavy bomber used by united states air force it is commonly called bone from b one it is one of three strategic bombers in u s air force fleet other two being b 2 spirit and b 52 stratofortress b 1 was first envisioned in 1960s as a platform that would combine mach 2 speed of b 58 hustler with range and payload of b 52 and was meant to ultimately replace both bombers after a long series of studies rockwell international now part of boeing won design contest for what emerged as b 1a this version had a top speed of mach 2 2 at high altitude and capability of flying for long distances at mach 0 85 at very low altitudes combination of high cost of aircraft introduction of agm 86 cruise missile that flew same basic profile and early work on stealth bomber all significantly affected need for b 1 this led to program being canceled in 1977 after b 1a prototypes had been built program was restarted in 1981 largely as an interim measure due to delays in b 2 stealth bomber program with b 2 eventually reaching initial operational capability in 1997 this led to a redesign as b 1b which differed from b 1a by having a lower top speed at high altitude of mach 1 25 but improved low altitude performance of mach 0 96 electronics were also extensively improved during redesign and airframe was improved to allow takeoff with maximum possible fuel and weapons load b 1b began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with strategic air command sac as a nuclear bomber in that same year by 1988 all 100 aircraft had been delivered in early 1990s following gulf war and concurrent with disestablishment of sac and its reassignment to newly formed air combat command b 1b was converted to conventional bombing use it first served in combat during operation desert fox in 1998 and again during nato action in kosovo following year b 1b has supported u s and nato military forces in afghanistan and iraq air force had 66 b

was chosen in 1957 to replace b 58 hustler but suffered as a result of a switch in doctrine from high to low altitude flying profiles by late 1950s however antiaircraft surface to air missiles sams could threaten high altitude aircraft as demonstrated by 1960 downing of gary powers u 2 may 1960 u 2 incident soviet and american statements s record of world events volume 6 1960 usaf strategic air command sac was aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low level penetration even before u 2 downing this tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through use of terrain masking using features of terrain like hills and valleys line of sight from radar to bomber can be broken rendering radar and human observers incapable of seeing it additionally radars of era were subject to clutter from stray returns from ground and other objects which meant a minimum angle existed above horizon where they could detect a target bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from radar sites this combination of effects made sams of era ineffective against low flying aircraft same effects also meant that low flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher flying interceptors since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against clutter from ground reflections lack of look down shoot down capability switch from high altitude to low altitude flight profiles severely affected b 70 whose design was highly tuned to provide desired high altitude performance planners outlined a series of low level profiles for b 70 but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited b 70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than b 52 but less range unsuited for new low altitude role and because of a growing shift to intercontinental ballistic missile icbm force b 70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by president john f kennedy nasa cr b 70 aircraft study final report vol i p i 38 nasa 1972 and two xb 70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program although never intended for low level role b 52 s flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as nature of air war environment changed b 52 s huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times and large airframe allowed addition of improved radar jamming and deception suites to deal with radars during vietnam war concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head and big belly modifications increased b 52 s total bomb load to turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes much smaller bomb bay of b 70 would have made it much less useful in this role design studies and delays although effective b 52 was not ideal for low level role this led to a number of aircraft designs known as penetrators which were tuned specifically for long range low altitude flight first of these designs to see operation was supersonic f 111 fighter bomber which used variable sweep wings for tactical missions

2009 arguments that led to cancellation of b 70 program had led some to question need for a new strategic bomber of any sort usaf was adamant about retaining bombers as part of nuclear triad concept that included bombers icbms and submarine launched ballistic missiles slbms in a combined package that complicated any potential defense they argued that bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe option because bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked however introduction of slbm made moot mobility and survivability argument and a newer generation of icbms such as minuteman iii had accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets during this time icbms were seen as a less costly option based on
