toyota aurion xv40 is original series of toyota aurion a mid size car produced by toyota in australia and parts of asia designated xv40 toyota manufactured first generation aurion between 2006 and 2012 until it was fully replaced by xv50 series while asian production of xv50 series began in late 2011 toyota s australian operations did not take on production of new model until 2012 although marketed as a separate model xv40 series aurion is essentially a toyota camry xv40 with revised front and rear end treatment along with changes to interior and australian tuned suspension in lieu of aurion nameplate majority of east and southeast asian markets received camry based aurion under name toyota camry however in australasia and middle east toyota sold original version of camry alongside aurion in these markets aurion replaced avalon model which could trace its roots back to 1994 in north america in australasian and middle eastern markets to further differentiate aurion from its camry sibling toyota equipped aurion exclusively with a 3 5 litre v6 engine with camry company only offered 2 4 litre four cylinder version previously in these markets prior to introduction of camry xv40 toyota had offered both four and a six cylinder powerplants along with naturally aspirated version toyota produced an australia only supercharged trd aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by toyota racing development trd at its release toyota claimed this performance variant to be world s most powerful front wheel drive car powertrains used in asian specification camry vary slightly from those of aurion as well as 3 5 litre v6 two four cylinder engines are offered in either 2 0 or a 2 4 litre form these engines are teamed with a six four and five speed automatic transmissions respectively history of development before commencing production of aurion toyota australia manufactured full size avalon model at its altona plant in melbourne until june 2005 production of avalon had begun in 2000 taking much of its basic design and mechanical features from then six year old avalon model sold in north america avalon was offered as a larger more upmarket car than toyota camry which it was built alongside original sales predictions were not met with avalon failing to challenge rivals such as holden commodore and ford falcon reasoning behind this has been widely attributed to avalon s older design and styling which has been widely described as bland as well as front wheel drive configuration and smaller engine displacement in its best year avalon only managed to reach half of toyota s projected sales target with many potential buyers opting for slightly smaller sized v6 camry featuring same engine as avalon toyota discovering that australian public wanted something that was modern and designed with consideration to australian market began full scale planning work on its avalon replacement in 2002 toyota australia realised that no other model being developed at time for japan or north america was going to be suitable and due to size limitations of australian market a completely indigenous model was unrealisable however at that time toyota australia did not have any designers of its own as a result company recruited paul beranger in august 2002 to set up toyota style australia tsa in an industrial complex located in dingley village victoria tsa first developed x runner and sportivo coupe concepts and in 2003 nick hogios who had previously worked for ford australia on designing xr performance models of ba falcon was appointed chief designer carey 2006 p 103 108 tsa s next venture was more significant a privately developed model based on camry a car that signalled beginning of aurion programme codenamed 380l and developed during course of 2003 this one off model was forged by stripping panels and interior components from donor camry and substituting these for tsa developed versions total cost was approximately million focus groups conducted by toyota in early 2003 had ranked avalon at bottom of list when compared to competing holden commodore ford falcon and mitsubishi magna later on in year same focus groups were called back and avalon was exchanged for 380l overall groups ranked toyota as their first preference and according to beranger didn t see car as a camry as such toyota australia deduced that if 380l was available for purchase there and then they could sell it alongside regular camry as a six cylinder car under a different name during 380l development tsa had regular discussions with toyota japan on how its avalon replacement would eventually turn out because tsa were an unknown quantity having never designed a production vehicle it took division some time to convince japan that they could indeed design a car themselves when 380l was consigned to a presentation with japanese toyota officials tsa s lead designer nick hogios was requested to tender a proposal for next generation 042l camry design competition while his submission was not chosen hogios was summoned to work on what would become aurion then exclusively referred to as asian or prestige camry and codenamed 043l due to success of tsa s earlier concepts and 380l toyota australia was given authorisation to manufacture both regular 042l and 043l camrys and sell them side by side in australia however regular camry was to be limited to four cylinder engine and prestige camry later to become aurion to six hogios worked in japan for nine months during 2004 designing prestige camry and his final design was a collaborative effort between japanese and taiwanese designers but car s front end styling is largely hogios s own work while work in japan was being undertaken tsa began to make changes for australian aurion variants after design stage was completed toyota australia then commenced work on development of car concurrently developing both australian car and version for asia beranger proclaims that entire engineering undertaking is probably one of most significant jobs that any subsidiary of toyota japan has done anywhere in world australian variant of car was codenamed despite both cars being essentially identical australia was given a different code due to car occupying a broader range in that market from a fleet vehicle to a sports oriented model in asia car s role is much narrower being a high end luxury car on 9 february 2006 toyota australia unveiled aurion alongside aurion sportivo concept at melbourne international motor show at an official press conference toyota dropped avalon tag for their new large car as it had gained a reputation to be an uninspiring car both in flesh and to drive toyota made use of aurion name to give car a fresh start aurion means tomorrow in ancient greek and aurora translates to dawn in latin name was chosen after consumer research on more than 30 potential names this gives implications of a completely new car and ties in with toyota s advertising slogan can t wait for tomorrow first aurion based camry rolled off assembly line in china in may 2006 design aurion takes its doors windows roof panels body sides except front quarters from camry xv40 however other panels are unique from regular camry this component sharing also means that aurion has same wheelbase front and rear axle tracks and interior dimensions interior design also largely parallels camry notable differences include redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console plus substitution of australian camry s hand operated parking brake with a foot operated equivalent as shared with camry for japan and north america carey february 2007 p 108 reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow car to be built alongside camry thus simplifying manufacturing process toyota claims that aurion is designed to australian tastes although it has been designed with markets such as asia in mind hogios states that aurion follows traits of current australian styling with a tendency to look towards european designs for inspiration in addition like its other vehicles of similar vintage toyota designed aurion within realm of its vibrant clarity design language according to chief designer hogios car makes particular use of vibrant clarity theory known as perfect imbalance this involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on front fascia which are balanced by horizontal headlamps front end s double concave architecture can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille same architecture is applied at rear with a deep bumper a clamshell shaped boot lid that envelops over flanks dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps design patents were filed on 27 december 2005 at united states patent and trademark office for certain markets like china where camry sits right below similar sized mercedes benz cars as a luxury model it is important for aurion to exemplify traits of such vehicles with development of aurion designers produced two separate philosophies each pitched at a specific niche of market base model at x and luxury prodigy and presara variants employ comfort design with more aggressive sports oriented style found on sportivo versions robinson 2006 p 53 to meet this requirement sportivo variants feature unique 17 inch alloy wheels a rear spoiler body kit appendages and a three spoke steering wheel high performance trd models offer a similar sports oriented design but are distinguishable by use of unique body parts these include a redesigned formula one inspired front bumper with integrated foglamps a unique rear bumper with fixed facelift toyota of thailand unveiled a reworked version of east and southeast asian market camry in june 2009 equipped with a hybrid drivetrain revised aurion based camry previewed australian aurion s then upcoming facelift updated car features new and lens clusters with integrated foglamps along with a redesigned front bumper grille insert and revised interior trim details revised aurion was designed by australian chief designer nick hogios who also designed original aurion and anthony cheung assistant project manager from thailand during 2007 hybrid version was also designed by takafumi ito who also designed facelifted regular camry design registrations for facelifted hybrid version nothing changes made to original were filed on 19 december 2008 at us patent and trademark office toyota australia later revealed updated car as its aurion on 21 september while front end of original aurion was designed with a double concave architecture revised version abandons this for an x form design philosophy characterised by a lower and wider trapezoidal shaped grille like original version aurion continues to offer differing frontal design treatments across range from side rehashed design is identified by deletion of moulding strips and a range of new wheels designs including standard fitment of alloy wheels on base line at x interior upgrades in form of new colour combinations are featured along with upgraded instruments and gauges giving greater turn signal and warning signal clarity revised audio systems lighting and in cabin storage are also featured prodigy and presara versions receive a new linear satin wood grain finish safety safety was a key aspect in development of aurion all safety features are standard across entire range and there are no optional safety devices features such as dual front side and curtain airbags traction control brake assist electronic brakeforce distribution and vehicle stability control come standard in tests conducted by australasian new car assessment program ancap base model scored a four star rating with 30 03 out of 37 points toyota caused controversy by not providing a third test vehicle for ancap to use for optional side pole impact test this third test allows tested vehicles to be eligible for a five star rating if initial score is high enough toyota cited additional expense of a 75 000 100 000 including car as being unjustifiable and that they did not agree with nature of pole test scores given without optional test indicate that maximum two points that could have been earned would have been slightly less than needed to give aurion a five star rating anyway due to toyota s decision to fit a driver and front passenger seat belt reminder along with their decision to fund optional pole test aurion s safety rating was upgraded to a full five stars from august 2009 production with a score of 33 03 out of 37 powertrains aurion employs a version of toyota s 2gr fe v6 engine that also

designer he was chosen by toyota styling australia chief paul in 2005 one of moran s focuses was to reduce size of grille and add emphasis to front bumper line below it this was done so car had more of a formula one oriented look in toyota wind tunnel in japan vehicle s drag coefficient was confirmed at 0 30 meaning that car would operate better aerodynamically than its non trd variants trd also
