type ub i submarine sometimes known as ub 1 class was a class of small coastal submarines u boats built in germany at beginning of first world war 20 boats were constructed most of which went into service with german imperial navy boats of this design were also operated by austro hungarian navy kaiserliche und konigliche kriegsmarine or k u k kriegsmarine and bulgarian navy in austro hungarian navy it was called built to meet need for small maneuverable submarines able to operate in narrow shallow seas off flanders vessels were intended to be quickly constructed then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation design effort began in mid august 1914 and by mid october first 15 boats were ordered from two german shipyards german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to austria hungary who ordered a further three boats in april 1915 a total of 20 ub is were built construction of first boats for germany began in early november 1914 all 20 were completed by october 1915 several of first boats underwent trials in german home waters but rest were assembled and tested at either antwerp or pola german boats operated primarily in flanders baltic and constantinople flotillas boats were about long and displaced when surfaced and while submerged all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes and were equipped with a deck mounted machine gun in 1918 four of surviving german boats were converted into coastal minelayers of seventeen boats in german service two were sold to austria hungary one was sold to bulgaria and nine were lost during war one of five austro hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired five surviving german boats four surviving austro hungarian boats and bulgarian boat were all turned over to allies after end of war and were broken up design in earliest stages of first world war german army s rapid advance along north sea coast found german imperial navy without submarines suitable to operate in narrow and shallow seas off flanders miller pp 46 47 karau p 48 by 18 august 1914 two weeks after german invasion of belgium planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun german imperial navy stipulated that submarines must be transportable by rail which imposed a maximum diameter of rushed planning effort which had been assigned name project 34 resulted in type ub i design created specifically for operation from flanders boats were to be about long and to displace about with two bow torpedo tubes a further refinement of design replacing torpedo tubes with mine chutes but changing little else led to type uc i coastal minelaying submarine miller p 458 boats of type ub i design were built by two manufacturers germaniawerft of kiel and ag weser of bremen williamson p 12 which led to some variations in boats from two shipyards eight germaniawerft built boats were slightly longer at length overall while twelve weser built boats came in shorter than their counterparts all were abeam and had a draft of boats all displaced while surfaced but differed slightly in displacement submerged slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced while submerged as they weighed more than weser boats drivetrain of boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a daimler germaniawerft or korting weser diesel engine on surface or a siemens schuckert electric motor for underwater travel weser boats were capable of nearly on surface and a little more than submerged germaniawerft boats were about slower than their bremen made counterparts boats were equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes they were also armed with a single machine gun affixed to deck none of type ub i boats had a deck gun construction german imperial navy ordered its first fifteen type ub i boats on 15 october 1914 eight boats numbered ub 1 to ub 8 were ordered from germaniawerft of kiel and seven boats numbered ub 9 to u 15 from ag weser of bremen after two of class ub 1 and ub 15 were sold in february 1915 to ally austria hungary becoming u 10 and u 11 in austro hungarian navy gardiner p 341 german imperial navy ordered ub 16 and ub 17 from weser a further three for austria hungary u 15 u 16 and u 17 had been ordered from weser by april bringing total number constructed to 20 in austro hungarian navy type ub i boats were known as u 10 class ub 1 and ub 2 were laid down on 1 november 1914 at germaniawerft yard at kiel tarrant p 160 ub 1 was launched on 22 january 1915 tarrant p 163 just 75 working days later ub 2s launch followed on 13 february among weser boats ub 9 was laid down first on 6 november 1914 and launched on 6 february 1915 a week ahead of ub 2 these first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters but most of other members of class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point karau p 49 process of shipping submarines by rail involved breaking submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars type ub i boats destined for service with flanders flotilla made a five day journey to antwerp for two to three week assembly process after assembly at antwerp boats were towed by barge to bruges for trials boats selected for service in mediterranean were sent to austro hungarian port of pola for assembly messimer pp 126 27 gibson and prendergast p 71 total time from departure of railcars from shipyard to operational readiness for boats was about six weeks by july 1915 all seventeen of german imperial navy type ub is had been completed tarrant p 16 history during their trials type ub is were found to be too small and too p 48 and had a reputation for being underpowered gibson and prendergast pp 38 39 one commander compared his type ub i to a sewing machine according to authors r h gibson and maurice prendergast in their 1931 book german submarine war 1914 1918 ubs did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater exhausting their batteries after little over an hour s running in service use revealed another problem with a single propeller shaft engine combination if either component failed u boat was almost totally disabled miller p 48 many of problems with type ub i design were rectified in larger type ub ii which had twin propellers larger engines and a higher top speed williamson p 13 another reported problem with type ub is was tendency to break trim after firing of torpedoes boats were equipped with compensating tanks designed to flood and offset loss of c 06 torpedo s weight but this system did not always function properly stern p 25 as a result when firing from periscope depth boat could broach after firing or if too much weight was taken on plunge to depths when ub 15 torpedoed and sank in june 1915 sokol p 109 tank failed to properly compensate forcing entire crew to run to stern to offset trim imbalance despite problems tin tadpoles as germans referred to them were in active service from march 1915 through end of war tarrant pp 23 34 56 74 75 with half of 20 boats lost during war boats of class served in three navies german imperial navy austro hungarian navy and bulgarian navy in german service they served primarily in flanders flotilla baltic flotilla and constantinople flotilla german imperial navy flanders flotilla first type ub i to enter service was ub 10 which formed nucleus of flanders flotilla on 27 march 1915 by end of april five more type ub i boats had become operational tarrant p 16 ub 10 was eventually joined in flanders flotilla by ub 2 ub 4 ub 5 ub 6 ub 12 ub 13 ub 16 and ub 17 tarrant p 23 of these only ub 2 made journey to flanders by sea rather than rail ub 4 departed on first patrol from flanders on 9 april karau p 50 and was responsible for sinking first ship sent down by flotilla type ub i boats of flanders flotilla originally patrolled area between united kingdom and netherlands but began patrolling english channel after ub 6 pioneered a route past british antisubmarine nets and mines in straits of dover in late june karau p 51 over type ub is first year of service ub 4 and ub 13 were both lost messimer pp 129 134 and ub 2 and ub 5 were transferred to baltic flotilla tarrant p 34 in march 1917 ub 6 ran aground in dutch waters and was interned for rest of war along with her crew messimer p 132 gibson and prendergast p 332 ub 6 entered dutch territorial waters due to a navigational error and ran aground because netherlands was neutral during war and ub 6 did not leave dutch territorial waters within 24 hours as required by international law submarine and her crew were interned by dutch germany protested but because ub 6 s grounding was result of an error and not because of distress dutch could not release submarine four remaining type ub is in flanders ub 10 ub 12 ub 16 ub 17 were all converted to minelayers by 1918 having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines all but ub 10 were lost in 1918 messimer pp 133 135 6 ub 10 in poor repair and out of service was scuttled in october 1918 when germans evacuated from flanders messimer p 132 baltic flotilla ub 9 was initially assigned to baltic flotilla and was joined by ub 2 and ub 5 in early 1916 all three became training boats at kiel in 1916 joining ub 11 in that duty gibson and prendergast p 63 little information is available about type ub i boats operating in baltic constantinople flotilla four of german imperial navy boats ub 3 ub 7 ub 8 and ub 14 were selected for service with constantinople flotilla all were sent to pola for assembly and trials there as part of pola flotilla before sailing on to join constantinople flotilla ub 3 disappeared en route to constantinople in may 1915 but other three arrived there by mid june three type ub i boats of constantinople flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in black sea ub 8 was transferred to bulgarian navy in may 1916 and ub 7 disappeared in black sea in october 1916 messimer p 131 leaving ub 14 as sole remaining german type ub i in flotilla tarrant pp 74 75 she was surrendered at sevastopol in november 1918 to french armies stationed there during russian civil war austro hungarian navy ub 1 and still incomplete ub 15 were sold to austria hungary in february 1915 both were dismantled and shipped to pola in may imperial and royal navy association p 12 after one cruise under german flag each boat was commissioned into austro hungarian navy pair renamed u 10 and u 11 respectively were joined by u 15 u 16 and u 17 in october known as u 10 or class as a part of austro hungarian navy

royal navy association pp 13 17 u 10 ex ub 1 hit a mine in july 1918 and was beached but had not been repaired by end of war u 16 was sunk after she torpedoed an italian destroyer in october 1916 and remaining three and unrepaired u 10 were ceded to italy at end of war bulgarian navy after ub 8 was transferred to bulgarian navy in may 1916 she was renamed podvodnik no 18 in cyrillic podvodnik no

of neuilly sur seine list of type ub i submarines a total of 20 type ub i submarines were built 17 for german imperial navy and three for austro hungarian navy two of german submarines ub 1 and ub 15 were sold to austria hungary and commissioned into austro hungarian navy as u 10 and u 11 respectively those two and a further three built by ag weser comprised virtually identical u 10 class for austro hungarian navy another of german submarines ub 8 was sold to bulgaria in may 1916 becoming podvodnik no 18 pp 130 145 german imperial navy became austro hungarian u 10 july 1915 became bulgarian podvodnik no 18 may 1916 became austro hungarian u 11 june 1915 austro hungarian navy in austro hungarian navy type ub i boats were known as u 10 class which consisted of two former german type ub i boats and three built specifically for austria hungary former german ub 1 former german ub 15 in addition four of german type ub is assigned to pola flotilla based at austro hungarian navy s main naval base at pola were assigned austro hungarian designations gardiner p 341 after italy had entered first world war by declaring war on austria hungary on 23 may 1915 germany felt treaty bound to support austro hungarians in attacks against italian ships even though germany and italy were not officially at war as a result german u boats operating in mediterranean were assigned austro hungarian numbers and flags after 28 august 1916 when germany and italy were officially at war practice continued primarily to avoid charges of flag misuse practice was largely ended by 1 october 1916 except for a few large u boats that continued using austro hungarian numbers gardiner p 341 as u 9 as u 7 as u 8 as u 26 sometimes cited as u 26 in austro hungarian navy but she was never officially transferred to austro hungarian navy from german imperial navy sokol p 109 these four boats remained under commission in german imperial navy retained german crews and commanders and received orders from german flotilla commander at pola bulgarian navy germany and bulgaria negotiated purchase of two ub i boats for bulgarian navy and in 1916 two crews of bulgarian sailors were sent to kiel for training before purchase could be completed ub 7 was sunk leaving only one boat for bulgaria on 25 may 1916 ub 8 was officially transferred to bulgaria for remainder of war podvodnik no 18 former
