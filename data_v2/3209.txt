heavy emphasis on martial arts battles as it progresses makyo toitsusen allows player to choose one of 11 key characters from manga it has no story mode does not adapt or tie into plot of its source material and features few appearances from supporting cast game adopts a versus fighting game template made popular by street fighter series where objective of each match is for player or players to eliminate opponents by depleting their health gauges using various short and long ranged attacks fighters move horizontally on 2d battlefields and can jump from ground toward or over opponents one on one matches are possible but makyo toitsusen allows up to four characters to battle simultaneously in a single match this added action is complemented by inclusion of a second layer in each stage similar to fatal fury series players can leap onto a separate horizontal plane in background matches have no time limit since multiple opponents can potentially face either in front of or behind player pushing back on controller s directional pad will cause a character to face opposite direction rather than simply back away or block enemy attacks makyo toitsusen is compatible with both mega drive s three button and six button gamepads three button controller s a b and c face buttons can be mapped to light attack heavy attack and guard while movement actions like dashing forward dashing backward and shifting planes are performed using basic combinations of directional pad and face buttons additional x y and z inputs on six button controller allow for mapping these six actions to one face button each all characters can use combos and unique special attacks that may be performed either on ground or in air some of which can be charged for larger amounts of damage since three button controller is standard and pushing back button changes a character s direction combos are fairly simple to execute a few abilities require spirit energy that is represented by a second gauge under a fighter s health and can be refilled by holding down an attack button a charged attack can be temporarily cancelled and stored by pushing back on directional pad and then instantly unleashed at that strength next time player uses it game offers several modes that consist of a single player campaign for fighting consecutive one on one matches an endless practice mode and multiplayer options

makyo toitsusen was developed by treasure and was produced in association with yu yu hakusho author yoshihiro togashi manga s publisher shueisha anime adaptation s studio pierrot and its television broadcaster fuji tv home console market of early 1990s was in midst of a fighting game craze thanks to hits such as street fighter ii simultaneous popularity of yu yu hakusho in japan led to games in this genre showing up on several home and handheld gaming platforms after treasure s debut on mega drive with gunstar heroes makyo toitsusen was one of four games in simultaneous development by company for system with sega as publisher makyo toitsusen is treasure s first fighting game and its second game based on a licensed property after mcdonald s treasure land adventure project was supervised by treasure founder and president masato maegawa sega assigned yoichi to support game s production after he joined company s third consumer research division in 1993 despite developer s seemingly close relationship with sega maegawa claimed publisher s communication was poor and that it offered no help to treasure during game s creation treasure s staff was made up chiefly of programmers masaki ukyo and mitsuru yaida graphics artists makoto and hiroshi iuchi director and graphics designer tetsuhiko kikuchi and lead sound effects and music composer satoshi murata alongside katsuhiko suzuki aki hata and norio hanzawa murata composed original music tracks for game while also providing instrumental versions of songs no and unbalance na kiss o shite from yu yu hakusho anime game s main theme was written and arranged by hata who also performed a vocal version of song for its official soundtrack cd and later one of her own albums game also features an extensive array of digitized character voice samples portrayed anime s voice cast makyo toitsusen was released in japan on september 30 1994 mega drive was less commercially successful in japan than it was overseas and because treasure maintained profits by shipping small numbers of its products few units of game went to retail maegawa insisted that treasure always developed games with foreign markets in mind despite these factors makyo toitsusen was never officially localized in north america or europe perhaps due to yu yu hakusho franchise being relatively unknown in those regions during mega drive s lifespan it remains only mega drive game by treasure not to see a release in these territories notably game was licensed by tectoy translated into portuguese and released in brazil in 1999 as yu yu hakusho sunset fighters a portuguese dub of anime had already begun airing in south america while mega drive maintained a strong presence in brazil throughout decade largely due to a distribution partnership between tectoy and sega other than text two versions of makyo toitsusen are nearly identical portuguese translation is mostly faithful to original japanese text though some character names were altered like japanese edition very few copies were shipped makyo toitsusen had not seen a digital re release likely due to licensing issues until its inclusion on japanese version of sega genesis

egm all found gameplay to be well balanced stratton used game s dual layer stages as an example of how this balance was accomplished explaining that players could tactically parry enemies by switching planes or charge an attack to meet an opponent jumping into their plane kulata similarly credited plane shifting mechanic for allowing an equal emphasis on player defense and offense and noted that projectile attacks are made less powerful than standard punches and kicks as opposed to its fighting genre contemporaries mean machines sega writers gus swan and steve merrett and anime news network contributor todd ciolek were all pleased with variety of extra game modes however swan and merrett were more critical of gameplay overall pointing to a sluggish pace and simple minded computer ai duo

with multiple characters in a single battle reception for graphics and sound of makyo toitsusen has been mixed des barres stratton kulata and retro gamer all had positive comments regarding its visuals and audio retro gamer felt game boasted slick animations and detailed character sprites while both des barres and stratton thought characters properly mimicked their anime counterparts kulata was especially impressed with backgrounds which utilize various effects such as parallax transparencies and warping des barres and retro gamer enjoyed music former proclaiming it to be best mega drive music he had ever heard kulata made similar constructive remarks about its voice samples and sound effects but considered soundtrack to be forgettable in contrast to other mega drive games by treasure ciolek opined that treasure focused too much on refining gameplay and failed to fully develop its presentation he criticized it for having small character sprites a bland soundtrack scratchy voice overs and dynamic backgrounds that try to compensate for frequently boring scenery with changes in lighting swan and merrett were complimentary of sprite animation and voice sample quality but echoed complaints that backgrounds lacked detail and coloring and that soundtrack was not up to standard of treasure s other in game music retro gamer agreed that backgrounds were drab and unfinished when compared to rest of game s aesthetic egm seconded notion that sprites were too small while also experiencing break up when too many present were on screen at once treasure s next fighting game guardian heroes was released for sega saturn in 1996 this game features 2d sprites and gameplay mechanics resembling makyo toitsusen like simplified combos and multiple horizontal planes in battle for guardian heroes treasure president masato maegawa told gamestm that developer wanted to evolve what they had created in makyo toitsusen into an original game with more madness and excess treasure also carried this design over into two nintendo ds fighting games that are based on manga series bleach this includes supporting up to four players simultaneously and having two horizontal planes between
