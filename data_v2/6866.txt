thumb upright 1 5 a female goldenrod crab spider vatia ambushing female of a pair of mating flies ambush predators or sit and wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture or trap prey by stealth or by strategy typically not conscious rather than by speed or by strength ambush predators sit and wait for prey often from a concealed position and then launch a rapid surprise attack ambush may be set by hiding in a burrow by camouflage by aggressive mimicry or by use of a trap predator then uses a combination of senses to assess prey and to time strike nocturnal ambush predators such as cats and snakes have vertical slit pupils helping them to judge distance to prey in dim light different ambush predators use a variety of means to capture their prey from long sticky tongues of chameleons to expanding mouths of frogfishes ambush predation is widely distributed in animal kingdom spanning some members of numerous groups such as starfish cephalopods crustaceans spiders insects such as mantises and vertebrates such as many snakes and fishes strategy thumb video of a water bug nymph attacking a fish ambush predators usually remain motionless sometimes hidden and wait for prey to come within ambush distance before pouncing ambush predators are often camouflaged and may be solitary pursuit predation becomes a better strategy than ambush predation when predator is faster than prey ambush predators use many intermediate strategies for example when a pursuit predator is faster than its prey over a short distance but not in a long chase then either stalking or ambush becomes necessary as part of strategy bringing prey within range concealment ambush often relies on concealment whether by staying out of sight or by means of camouflage burrows ambush predators such as trapdoor spiders on land and mantis shrimps in sea rely on concealment constructing and hiding in burrows these provide effective concealment at price of a restricted field of vision trapdoor spiders excavate a burrow and seal entrance with a web trapdoor hinged on one side with silk best known is thick bevelled cork type it neatly fits burrow s opening other is wafer type it is a basic sheet of silk and earth door s upper side is often effectively camouflaged with local materials such as pebbles and sticks spider spins silk fishing lines or trip wires that radiate out of burrow entrance when spider is using trap to capture prey its chelicerae protruding mouthparts hold door shut on end furthest from hinge prey make silk vibrate and alert spider to open door and ambush prey camouflage many ambush predators make use of camouflage so that their prey can come within striking range without detecting their presence among fishes stargazer buries itself nearly completely in sand and waits for prey devil scorpionfish typically lies partially buried on sea floor or on a coral head during day covering itself with sand and other debris to further camouflage itself world database of marine species spiny devil fish accessed 03 22 2010 com scorpion of subfamily by bob fenner accessed 03 27 2010 tasselled is a shark whose adaptations as an ambush predator include a strongly flattened and camouflaged body with a fringe that breaks up its outline aggressive mimicry thumb upright orchid mantis hymenopus coronatus mimics a rainforest orchid of southeast asia to lure its prey pollinator insects many ambush predators actively attract their prey towards them before ambushing them this strategy is called aggressive mimicry using false promise of nourishment to lure prey alligator snapping turtle is a well camouflaged ambush predator its tongue bears a conspicuous pink extension that resembles a worm and can be wriggled around fish that try to eat worm are themselves eaten by turtle similarly some reptiles such as elaphe rat snakes employ caudal luring tail luring to entice small vertebrates into striking range zone tailed hawk which resembles turkey vulture flies among flocks of turkey vultures then suddenly breaks from formation and ambushes one of them as its prey there is however some controversy about whether this is a true case of wolf in sheep s clothing mimicry flower mantises are aggressive mimics resembling flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar orchid mantis actually attracts its prey pollinator insects more effectively than flowers do crab spiders similarly are coloured like flowers they habitually rest on but again they can lure their prey even away from flowers traps some ambush predators build traps to help capture their prey lacewings are a flying insect in order neuroptera in some species their larval form known as antlion is an ambush predator eggs are laid in earth often in caves or under a rocky ledge juvenile creates a small crater shaped trap antlion hides under a light cover of sand or earth when an ant beetle or other prey slides into trap antlion grabs prey with its powerful jaws some but not all web spinning spiders are sit and wait ambush predators sheetweb spiders tend to stay with their webs for long periods and so resemble sit and wait predators whereas orb weaving spiders such as tend to move frequently from one patch to another and thus resemble active foragers detection and assessment thumb upright many nocturnal ambush predators like this leopard cat have vertical pupils enabling them to judge distance to prey accurately in dim light ambush predators must time their strike carefully they need to detect prey assess it as worth attacking and strike when it is in exactly right place they have evolved a variety of adaptations that facilitate this assessment for example pit vipers prey on small birds choosing targets of right size for their mouth gape larger snakes choose larger prey they prefer to strike prey that is both warm and moving their pit organs between eye and nostril contain infrared heat receptors enabling them to find and perhaps judge size of their small warm blooded prey deep sea grallator uses tactile and mechanosensory cues to identify food in its low light environment fish faces into current waiting for prey to drift by several species of felidae cats and snakes have vertically elongated slit pupils advantageous for nocturnal ambush predators as it helps them to estimate distance to prey in dim light diurnal and pursuit predators in contrast have round pupils supplement list of species by pupil shape capturing prey ambush predators often have adaptations for seizing their prey rapidly and securely capturing movement has to be rapid to trap prey given that attack is not modifiable once launched zebra mantis shrimp capture agile prey such as fish primarily at night while hidden in burrows striking very hard and fast with a mean peak speed and mean duration of 24 98 ms thumb a chameleon s tongue striking ballistically at food chameleons family chamaeleonidae are highly adapted as ambush predators they can change colour to match their surroundings and often climb through trees with a swaying motion probably to mimic movement of leaves and branches they are surrounded by all chameleons are primarily insectivores and feed by ballistically projecting their tongues often twice length of their bodies to capture prey anderson christopher v 2009 spinosus feeding video chamaeleonidae com tongue is projected in as little as 0 07 seconds and is launched at an acceleration of over 41 g power with which tongue is launched over 3000 w kg 1 is more than muscle can produce indicating that energy is stored in an elastic tissue for sudden release all fishes face a basic problem when trying to swallow prey opening their mouth may pull food in but closing it will push food out again frogfishes capture their prey by suddenly opening their jaws with a mechanism which enlarges volume of mouth cavity up to 12 fold and pulls prey crustaceans molluscs and other whole fishes into mouth along with water jaws close without reducing volume of mouth cavity attack can be as fast as 6 milliseconds taxonomic range ambush predation is widely distributed across animal kingdom it is found in many vertebrates including fishes such as frogfishes of sea bottom and pikes of freshwater reptiles including crocodiles snapping turtles mulga dragon and many snakes such as black mamba mammals such as cats and birds such as anhinga darter strategy is found in several invertebrate phyla including arthropods such as mantises spiders and some crustaceans cephalopod molluscs such as colossal squid
