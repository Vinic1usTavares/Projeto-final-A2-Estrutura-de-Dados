his father s wishes by granting earldom of cornwall to his favourite piers gaveston mckisack 1959 p 3 according to chronicle vita edwardi secundi this act was a grave insult to king s younger brothers

important gloucester castle and further grants followed his creation as earl of kent on 28 july 1321 lawne 2010 p 31 edward ii s close relationship to gaveston had been a source of conflict at court and gaveston s execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought country to brink of civil war prestwich 2007 pp 188 9 as edmund came of age he became an important member of circle around his brother in 1318 treaty of leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile opposing parties and edmund as his first public act was among witnesses to sign this treaty lawne 2010 p 30 further official

civil war as political conflict escalated into full scale rebellion in 1321 22 edmund played an important role in its suppression opposition stemmed from resentment against king s new favourites hugh despenser younger and hugh despenser elder prestwich 2007 pp 197 8 when bartholomew badlesmere steward of royal household defected to opposition edward made his youngest brother lord warden of cinque ports in place of badlesmere on 16 june in parliament of july 1321 edmund briefly sided with opposition when he agreed to exile despensers but later claimed this had been done under duress and in november sat on council that annulled exile in october edmund was once more employed in a move against badlesmere when he took part in a siege on leeds castle in kent which was held by badlesmere after badlesmere was forced to surrender hostilities moved to welsh marches where roger mortimer and others were in open revolt prestwich 2007 p 198 once confronted with royal army mortimer

january 1323 a task which he fulfilled with great success for his loyalty edmund was rewarded with substantial holdings in wales primarily land forfeited by roger mortimer greater part of spoils of war however went to despensers who both benefited greatly from forfeiture of rebels by 1326 despensers father and son respectively enjoyed incomes of ps3 800 and ps7 000 while edmund s annual income was at only 2 355 marks ps1 570 lawne 2010 p 33 scotland and france with domestic opposition largely neutralised king turned his attention to scotland a major campaign was organised in august but effort ended in total failure when english were routed by scots led by robert bruce at battle of old byland on 14 october 1322 barrow 1965 p 317 edward ii himself had to flee battlefield to avoid capture and edmund was with him as royal army retreated to york lawne 2010 p 32 king s inability to handle scottish situation was becoming apparent andrew harclay who had defeated lancaster at boroughbridge and for this had been created earl of carlisle and appointed warden of marches to scotland signed a peace treaty with scots without royal sanction in january 1323 phillips 1972 p 229 when king found out he ordered harclay s arrest edmund was one of judges who passed judgement on harclay who was hanged drawn and quartered for treason with harclay gone edmund was given

phillips 1972 p 232 while some historians have criticised edmund for his failure to reach a diplomatic settlement mckisack 1959 p 109 others have pointed to difficult circumstances he faced and how others had fared little better when diplomacy failed edmund was appointed edward s lieutenant in aquitaine on 20 july 1324 though there was a desperate need for reinforcements from england these never arrived lawne 2010 p 34 in short war that followed english lands were quickly overrun by french and edmund was besieged at la reole here he held out until 22 september at which point he was forced to surrender and agree to a six month truce deposition of edward ii edward ii s refusal to pay homage to french king was based on concern for his royal sovereignty but also on fear of a potential resurgence of domestic resistance mckisack 1959 pp 108 9 for this reason he sent his wife isabella to negotiate with king charles who was her brother tuck 1985 p 88 queen departed for france on 9 march 1325 and in september she was joined by her son heir to throne prince edward lawne 2010 p 35 isabella s negotiations were successful and it was agreed that young prince edward would perform homage in king s place which he did on 24 september not long after this edmund joined queen and prince in paris a circle of opposition was emerging around queen including exiled roger mortimer edmund who had previously been steadfast in his support for his half brother now joined plot against king prestwich 2007 p 215 though he still distrusted mortimer his hatred for despensers seems to have been even greater at this point mckisack 1959 p 93 when edmund along with others ignored king s order to return to england his lands were confiscated in march 1326 thumb left queen isabella with captive hugh despenser elder and earl of arundel from a 15th century manuscript in september isabella and mortimer invaded england with mercenary soldiers and edmund took part in invasion mckisack 1959 pp 82 3 invasion won support of a great part of english nobility including edmund s brother thomas and henry earl of lancaster thomas of lancaster s brother tuck 1985 p 90 edmund took part in trials of two despensers and in council transferring power to prince edward who was crowned king edward iii for his participation in coup edmund received a reward of land belonging to despensers and earl of arundel who was also executed as a supporter of edward ii as northern situation was still difficult edmund was given joint command of scottish border with lancaster but two fell out and lancaster was soon after given sole command tuck 1985 p 97 it did not take long for edmund to grow disenchanted with new regime one source of contention was dominant position at court of mortimer who has been described as isabella s lover haines 2003 p 216 in autumn of 1328 edmund and his brother thomas joined henry of lancaster in a conspiracy against isabella and mortimer conspiracy was a product of shared interest however rather than strong personal ties once it became clear that it would fail two brothers abandoned venture tuck 1985 pp 99 100 death and aftermath after participating in planned rebellion edmund became less popular at court he was still allowed to accompany king s wife philippa to her coronation in february 1330 but his appearances at court became less frequent at this point he became involved in another plot against court when he was convinced by rumours that his brother was still alive mckisack 1959 p 100 it later emerged that roger mortimer himself was responsible for leading edmund into this belief in a form of entrapment prestwich 2007 p 223 plot was revealed and in parliament of march 1330 edmund was indicted and condemned to death as a traitor upon hearing that verdict was death condemned earl pleaded with edward iii for his life offering to walk from winchester to london with a rope around his neck as a sign of atonement edward iii however knew that leniency was not an option for aforementioned entrapment utilized by mortimer could extend to him and potentially be subversive to his own kingship if his father edward ii truly was alive thus edward iii sanctioned killing of his uncle it was almost impossible to find anyone willing to perform execution of a man of royal blood until a convicted murderer eventually beheaded edmund in exchange for a pardon edmund s body was initially buried in a franciscan church in winchester but it was removed to westminster abbey in 1331 lawne 2010 p 47 execution of a royal prince was a great provocation to seventeen year old edward iii who had not been informed about decision and it probably contributed to king s decision to rise up against his protector given wilson 1996 p 33 in october 1330 edward iii carried out a coup installing himself in personal control of government and mortimer was executed prestwich 2007 pp 223 4 among charges against mortimer was that of procuring edmund s death and charges against late earl of kent were annulled tuck 1985 p 103 in late 1325 edmund had married margaret wake sister of thomas wake baron wake of liddell and couple had several children his lands and titles descended on his oldest son by same name but this edmund himself died in october 1331 earldom then passed to younger son john powicke 1961 p 434 edmund was not particularly popular while he was alive nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death his unreliability in political issues and repeated shifts in allegiance might have contributed to this his household was also said to behave in a way that caused popular resentment taking provisions as they passed through countryside while offering little compensation at same time it has been pointed out that edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to edward ii in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother lawne 2010 pp 46 7 children date 2nd earl of 5 october to marry arnaud lord of but plans fell
