manchester progress 7 346 gross tons built in 1938 served line until its disposal in 1966 early history opening of manchester ship canal in 1894 made it possible for large ocean going ships to sail directly into heart of manchester however because of opposition from cartels of ship owners based at liverpool and other ports in united kingdom shipping lines were slow to introduce direct services to new port of manchester which found it difficult to compete against established ports new trading routes from manchester to west africa and mediterranean ports were countered by established shipping conferences sharply reducing their own charges and by inducing their customers to sign binding contracts in some cases after achieving their aims cartels re imposed their old charges to help counter these sharp practices sir christopher furness of furness withy company proposed in 1897 that a manchester based shipping line should be formed to encourage use of manchester ship canal and docks
