remain on stadtbahn s long distance tracks these trains mainly those heading toward hanover and cologne usually call at hauptbahnhof and ostbahnhof history planning in 1871 eight main line railways existed in berlin with terminal stations at city s edge or outside city limits this was very impractical for many passengers who were forced to use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another therefore a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other in 1872 deutsche german railway construction company deg filed planning application for a railway line through city connecting then schlesischer bahnhof today berlin ostbahnhof to charlottenburg and continuing to potsdam in december 1873 state of prussia as well as private rail enterprises berlin potsdamer eisenbahn magdeburg halberstadter eisenbahn and berlin hamburger bahn bought shares in deg and jointly founded berliner berlin city railway company however things did not go as expected and deg went into bankruptcy in 1878 which forced prussian state government to take over operations pay for construction of line with state money and to reimburse former private owners of deg state s interest in line was attributed to military which after 1870 1871 franco prussian war was of opinion that railway networks would hinder mobilisation when not properly interconnected on 15 july 1878 konigliche der berliner stadteisenbahn royal directorate of berlin city railways under management of ernst was commissioned to manage site directorate at first reported to prussian ministry of transport and later became a subsidiary of ministry of public operations thumb stadtbahn seen from park inn berlin near station hackescher markt planned railway had two tracks each for freight and passenger traffic having taken similar projects in london and new york city into consideration passenger traffic received priority over freight trains furthermore new railway line was not only to serve as a connection between mainline in berlin but would also offer connections to berlin ringbahn and suburban rail lines traffic routing was not only influenced by location of already existing stations line was supposed to connect but also by land availability in city centre one of original drafts which called for building line along leipziger strasse had to be scrapped because of overly high land prices moat of 17th century berlin fortress was filled up between hackescher markt and jannowitzbrucke stations and since it was public land was used for building railway line this explains some of curvy sections on stadtbahn especially between alexanderplatz and jannowitzbrucke stations thumb berliner stadteisenbahn station savignyplatz with a prussian t2 its elevated nature sets stadtbahn apart from previous berliner built in 1851 which was built at street level and was a hindrance to travel construction work on line started in 1875 and stadtbahn was opened on 7 february 1882 for local traffic it opened on 15 may same year for long distance trains costs of construction including purchase of land were estimated at about 5 million goldmark per kilometre line would later become core route of berlin s bahn stadtbahn was originally equipped with longitudinal iron sleepers on system for details in english see united states patent 201 667 of 1878 however these were replaced with wooden sleepers in early 20th century original stations from west to east were charlottenburg zoologischer garten bellevue lehrter stadtbahnhof today berlin hauptbahnhof friedrichstrasse borse marx engels

also connected to rummelsburg ostkreuz since 1933 in east and via westkreuz in west two stations were later added savignyplatz 1 august 1896 between charlottenburg and zoologischer garten and tiergarten 5 january 1885 between zoologischer garten and bellevue initial operation suburban trains suburban trains operated on local tracks so called city track at first these were either services to suburbs or connections to berlin ringbahn running as half ring trains using stadtbahn and either northern or southern ringbahn trains were pulled by locomotives which ran on coke to minimise smell doors on train compartments had to be opened by passengers themselves and stations were not called out on train these trains ran from 4 o clock in morning to 1 o clock at night typically at intervals between two and five minutes depending on time of day fares in early 20th century were 10 pfennig in 3rd class and 15 pfennig in 2nd class freight traffic freight traffic to central market at alexanderplatz was carried by seven special trains per day of which four ran at night two during day and one in evening apart from this stadtbahn carried no freight normal freight traffic instead used freight stations charlottenburg wedding weissensee frankfurter allee tempelhof and on ring line long distance trains in first years of stadtbahn many trains previously terminating at old terminuses lehrter bahnhof bahnhof or potsdamer bahnhof operated via stadtbahn to reduce load on terminus stations by end of 19th century however most of these train runs had to terminate at their old destination stations again due to increasing local traffic on stadtbahn remaining traffic on stadtbahn mostly consisted of express trains to hanover and cologne via lehrter bahn trains to dessau trains to konigsberg and danzig on preussische and trains to frankfurt oder and breslau suburban trains to spandau and strausberg also ran on stadtbahn s long distance tracks until 1928 trains heading west usually left from schlesischer bahnhof station those heading east from charlottenburg depots were situated in rummelsburg then called bw and grunewald thumb station jannowitzbrucke station expansions and viaducts in 1914 friedrichstrasse station was rebuilt long distance section of station was expanded to four tracks and current station hall was built between 1922 and 1932 stadtbahn viaduct was thoroughly modernised in order to handle ever increasing train weight also train sheds of alexanderplatz and schlesischer bahnhof were replaced suburban line s platforms were raised to a height of 96 centimetres a second long distance platform and a new hall were built at zoo station from 1934 to 1940 station hall was only glazed in 1950s however notable terraced vestibule dates from same time electric operation left thumb 150px s bahn logo on 11 june 1928 suburban line potsdam stadtbahn erkner was fully equipped with dc third rail gear five trains of new drg class et 165 type appropriately named stadtbahn went into service still sharing track with steam trains by november 1928 all lines leading toward stadtbahn namely lines from spandau and as well as berlin ringbahn were fully electrified therefore suburban services to spandau could be moved from long distance tracks to local tracks last steam trains disappeared in 1929 when ring became fully operated by electric trains half ring trains operated only as peak time services in december 1930 term s bahn and symbol of a white s on a green circle were introduced for city ring and suburban services post war situation after world war ii stadtbahn lay devastated by bombs but was rebuilt very quickly because joseph stalin wanted to travel by train to potsdam conference stadtbahn was converted to russian broad gauge in 1945 national importance had diminished with loss of eastern germany only a few trains ran towards western zones some trains from soviet zone terminated on stadtbahn during berlin blockade long distance traffic came to an almost complete halt stadtbahn was useful for re established s bahn however now with connections to places line konigs strausberg and from 18 may 1952 when all berlin terminal stations and all other long distance stations in west berlin were closed station zoologischer garten remained only long distance station for western part of city last domestic train of gdr east german railways ran on stadtbahn in 1953 thumb transit train at zoo station 1976 after berlin wall was built in 1961 zoologischer garten became west berlin and ostbahnhof east berlin de facto central station station friedrichstrasse now was terminal point of separated west and east berlin s bahn lines and departure point for interzonenzug inter zone train services between west berlin and west germany friedrichstrasse station was separated into eastern and western parts with steel walls and enabled west berliners to change to s bahn trains running on nord sud bahn and line of berlin u bahn without passing through gdr border controls station also featured a border crossing into east berlin through trains between zoo and ostbahnhof only existed in international traffic for example paris to warsaw trains later through coaches and shuttle trains connecting to night trains to scandinavia crossed intra german border on stadtbahn as well due to a quirk in legislation west berlin parts of stadtbahn belonged to deutsche reichsbahn which made it and therefore gdr government one of largest landowners in west berlin regular quarrels erupted between dr gdr government west berlin senate and allied occupation powers prices for west berlin s bahn were kept slightly below fares of west berlin in east berlin a flat fee of 0 20 mark was charged until 1991 west berlin politics and most of populace fully boycotted s bahn which was run by east german railways and introduced bus and u bahn lines running parallel to s bahn network and stadtbahn restoration during cold war despite problems deutsche reichsbahn made improvements to line and reconstructed at great expense westkreuz railway station which had been built on swamp land meanwhile number of s bahn lines running in west berlin was reduced to just three as a consequence of a strike carried out by deutsche reichsbahn s west berlin based employees in september 1980 on 9 january 1984 a treaty between gdr and west berlin senate came into force and turned over responsibility for operation of s bahn in west berlin to west berlin transport authority berliner soon thereafter talks with gdr commenced regarding improvements of stadtbahn in west berlin as well as modernisation of zoologischer garten station lehrter stadtbahnhof was also carefully restored to its original 1880s look and became a listed building in east berlin ostbahnhof was partially rebuilt and renamed to hauptbahnhof in time for 750th anniversary of berlin s founding in 1987 after reunification fall of berlin wall and german reunification made for a sudden spike of importance for stadtbahn first train ran to cologne in 1990 since 1991 intercity trains to karlsruhe cologne and hamburg used stadtbahn hamburg line was soon extended to dresden and prague and former interzonenzug trains from munich were converted to intercity trains and now ran on stadtbahn as well western part of stadtbahn was electrified on 4 july 1993 up to zoologischer garten station eastern part of line up to ostbahnhof had been electrified since 1987 as soon as electrification reached zoo station ice trains began to use station modernisation from 1994 in october 1994 a large scale modernisation programme was started on stadtbahn viaducts were checked and strengthened and tracks were bedded in concrete to improve durability and comfort almost all stations saw large financial investments and were thoroughly modernised long distance traffic between zoo and ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during construction period and s bahn trains temporarily used long distance line on 24 march 1998 stadtbahn was reopened now carrying up to three ice and ic lines as well as five lines part of stadtbahn was realigned as part of construction of new berlin hauptbahnhof with construction commencing in 2001 and completed in july 2002 realigned section consisted of two 450 m long bridges spanning station and adjacent port until
