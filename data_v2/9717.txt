justina szilagyi de before 1455 1497 was a hungarian noblewoman who became second wife of vlad impaler voivode of wallachia she was daughter of ladislaus or osvat szilagyi and thus a cousin of matthias corvinus king of hungary corvinus first gave her in marriage to wenceslas pongrac of szentmiklos pongrac had inherited estates in upper hungary present day slovakia but was forced to renounce them in exchange for landed property he and justina jointly received in transylvania following their marriage after pongrac died in 1474 widowed justina married vlad whom corvinus acknowledged as lawful voivode of wallachia in 1475 vlad seized wallachia in late 1476 but soon died in battle to strengthen her claim to her transylvanian estates she married paul suki who was related to former owners of those territories after death of suki in 1479 justina was married to john erdelyi of somkerek until her death in 1497 early life many details of justina s early life are uncertain in 1479 a royal charter referred to her as daughter of osvat szilagyi maternal uncle of matthias corvinus king of hungary seventeen years later another document stated that osvat s younger brother ladislaus was her father accepting credibility of earlier document historians andras and tamas fedeles say osvat szilagyi and his wife posa of were justina s parents on other hand historians pal engel and mihai florin hasan concluded that justina was daughter of ladislaus and his unknown wife in accordance with 1496 document justina was born in early 1450s thus she was still an infant when ladislaus szilagyi died in 1454 according to hasan hassan also proposes that osvat szilagyi was appointed her guardian which gave rise to his erroneous identification as justina s father marriages first marriage matthias corvinus gave justina into marriage to wenceslas also known as ladislaus pongrac of szentmiklos a member of an influential noble family which owned estates in upper hungary now slovakia corvinus forced pongrac to surrender fortress of now and town of present day zilina in exchange for transylvanian estates including gernyeszeg now in romania which had been confiscated from erdelyi of somkerek and suki families in 1467 pongrac had been sole owner of estates in upper hungary but new transylvanian estates were jointly owned by pongrac and justina pongrac died in 1474 royal charters almost always referred to justina as pongrac s widow during following years until her death second marriage thumb alt a long faced man with oval shaped eyes and long moustaches wearing a cap decorated by pearls and feather justina s second husband vlad impaler or dracula prince of wallachia matthias corvinus had vlad impaler voivode of wallachia imprisoned for allegedly conducting secret negotiations with ottoman empire in 1462 and only released him in early 1475 fyodor kuritsyn who was ambassador of ivan iii of russia to corvinus in early 1480s recorded that corvinus had given his sister in marriage to vlad and they had lived together for ten years hassan concluded that kuritsyn obviously combined data about vlad s two wives when writing his report vlad s first wife was most probably corvinus illegitimate sister according to modern scholarly research who died in either 1472 or 1473 vlad married justina as his second wife after his release radu florescu writes that a daughter of michael szilagyi ilona was vlad s second wife florescu mcnally 1989 p 166 corvinus recognised vlad in 1475 as lawful ruler of wallachia but he provided no support to vlad in asserting his claim against basarab laiota vlad acquired a house in pecs which soon became known as dracula s house it was mentioned in a deed issued by pecs chapter on 10 september 1489 which also referred to justina widow of late voivode vlad invaded wallachia with hungarian and moldavian support forcing basarab laiota to flee to ottoman empire in november 1476 shortly after he was installed as voivode he asked burghers of brasov to send carpenters to targoviste where he wanted to build his new home however basarab laiota returned and vlad was murdered in late 1476 or early 1477 kuritsyn mentioned that vlad had three sons hasan and matei cazacu proposed that justina gave birth to vlad s second son and namesake who was ancestor of hungarian noble family in contrast fedeles wrote that vlad and justina s marriage was childless third and fourth marriages in 1478 members of erdelyi of somkerek family laid claim to justina s castle at gernyeszeg and nearby villages to secure her position she married paul suki a nephew of a one time co owner of estate she was first mentioned as suki s wife on 26 january 1479 but he died in same year giving rise to disputes between justina and his relatives about two years later justina married john erdelyi of somkerek he survived justina who died sometime after 13 june 1497 ancestry notes references sources justina category royal consorts of wallachia
