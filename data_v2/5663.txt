seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into distance his hands are crossed episode was written by frank mula and directed by carlos baeza idea was conceived by then show runner david mirkin when he was hired to work on simpsons one of his goals was to study aspect of homer s character if he was really tempted away from marge mirkin wanted to find out what would happen in a situation where homer finds himself attracted to another woman simpsons creator matt groening had previously written an episode for show s third season called colonel homer where homer finds himself attracted to a country singer named lurleen lumpkin in that episode lurleen immediately had a crush on homer but homer was not aware of it until later on with this episode mirkin wanted homer to immediately know he was attracted to mindy mirkin thought it was a great exploration to see what happened to homer in this particular case episode did not get usual amount of laughs at animatic test screening which made staff worry it was not as funny as they expected mirkin said it had to do with fact that because there were very subtle performances in episode animation had to be exactly right for it to be funny baeza and david silverman another animation director on show worked hard on episode mirkin said from very beginning it was a huge group effort from both writing and animation staff many scenes in animatic portrayed mindy as flirty mirkin did not like this because secret of episode was homer and mindy are two good people who are thrown into situation and can t help that their are going crazy upon seeing each other he added that two characters have so much in common that it is not just a physical relationship but a mental connection as well and that mindy is not a seductress but rather a woman just as nervous as homer mirkin also pointed out that while homer is being tempted by a seemingly perfect woman at work his wife could not be more imperfect since she has got a cold and looks sick he s trying to connect with his family but with marge looking sick and bart looking like a nerd everything is just not working mirkin said thumb 170px left michelle pfeiffer guest starred in episode as voice of mindy simmons mirkin praised her performance as being great american actress michelle pfeiffer provided voice of mindy simmons in episode all writers showed up at recording studio in west los angeles to see her record her lines when pfeiffer entered room with her daughter pfeiffer was mobbed by energy of writers and directors who were excited to see her mirkin who directed pfeiffer in studio was nervous because he thought she was a beautiful woman who was on a completely different level than other actors and actresses he had directed on show pfeiffer was also nervous because she had never voiced an animated character mirkin told her you re gonna love this more than anything you have ever done because it s calm and pleasant and we have so much time to play and experiment this helped her calm down and by end of session she was really relaxed and they had a fantastic time silverman told pfeiffer to not sound too flirty and that she should just act herself in one scene in episode mindy as she eats doughnuts much like homer does to get right drool sound pfeiffer put broccoli and water in her mouth mirkin said he did not have to give much direction during recording of homer and mindy s final scene together in which mindy tells homer how she feels about him pfeiffer hit it really well and they did it several times to get it more and more real mirkin also thought that pfeiffer completely understood part and played it perfectly he described her as one of those actresses that you don t even have to see to know they re great instead you can hear from
