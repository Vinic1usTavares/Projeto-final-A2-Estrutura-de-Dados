francium is a chemical element with symbol fr and atomic number 87 prior to its discovery it was referred to as eka caesium it is extremely radioactive its most stable isotope francium 223 originally called actinium k after natural decay chain it appears in has a half life of only 22 minutes it is second most electropositive element behind only caesium and is second rarest naturally occurring element after astatine isotopes of francium decay quickly into astatine radium and radon electronic structure of a francium atom is rn 7s1 and so element is classed as an alkali metal bulk francium has never been viewed because of general appearance of other elements in its periodic table column it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid obtaining such a sample is highly improbable since extreme heat of decay caused by its short half life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of element francium was discovered by marguerite perey in france from which element takes its name in 1939 it was last element first discovered in nature rather than by synthesis outside laboratory francium is extremely rare with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores where isotope francium 223 continually forms and decays as little as 20 30 g one ounce exists at any given time throughout earth s crust other isotopes except for francium 221 are entirely synthetic largest amount produced in laboratory was a cluster of more than 300 000 atoms characteristics francium is one of most unstable of naturally occurring elements its longest lived isotope francium 223 has a half life of only 22 minutes only comparable element is astatine whose most stable natural isotope astatine 219 alpha daughter of francium 223 has a half life of 56 seconds although synthetic astatine 210 is much longer lived with a half life of 8 1 hours all isotopes of francium decay into astatine radium or radon francium 223 also has a shorter half life than longest lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105 dubnium francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium a heavy element with a single valence electron it has highest equivalent weight of any element liquid francium if created should have a surface tension of 0 n m at its melting point francium s melting point was estimated to be around 8 0 degc 46 4 degf 281 0 k melting point is uncertain because of element s extreme rarity and radioactivity a different extrapolation based on dmitri mendeleev s method gave 20 1 5 degc 68 2 7 degf 293 1 5 k estimated boiling point of 620 degc 1150 degf 890 k is also uncertain estimate 598 degc 1108 degf 871 k as well as extrapolation from mendeleev s method of 640 degc 1180 degf 910 k have also been suggested density of francium is expected to be around 2 48 g cm3 mendeleev s method extrapolates 2 4 g cm3 linus pauling estimated electronegativity of francium at 0 7 on pauling scale same as caesium value for caesium has since been refined to 0 79 but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of value for francium francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium 392 811 4 kj mol as opposed to 375 2 kj mol for caesium as would be expected from relativistic effects and this would imply that caesium is less electronegative of two francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and fr ion should be more polarizable than cs ion molecule is predicted to have francium at negative end of dipole unlike all known alkali metal molecules francium superoxide is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners this is attributed to 6p electrons in francium being more involved in francium oxygen bonding francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts such as caesium perchlorate which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate this coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium by adapting radiocaesium coprecipitation method of lawrence e and c m nelson it will additionally with many other caesium salts including iodate tartrate also rubidium tartrate chloroplatinate and it also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid and with perchloric acid without another alkali metal as a carrier which provides other methods of separation e n k hyde radiochemistry of francium subcommittee on radiochemistry national academy of sciences national research council available from office of technical services dept of commerce 1960 nearly all francium salts are water soluble isotopes there are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 199 to 232 francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers francium 223 and francium 221 are only isotopes that occur in nature though former is far more common francium 223 is most stable isotope with a half life of 21 8 minutes and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half life will ever be discovered or synthesized francium 223 is fifth product of actinium decay series as daughter isotope of actinium 227 francium 223 then decays into radium 223 by beta decay 1 149 mev decay energy with a minor 0 006 alpha decay path to astatine 219 5 4 mev decay energy francium 221 has a half life of 4 8 minutes it is ninth product of neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium 225 francium 221 then decays into astatine 217 by alpha decay 6 457 mev decay energy least stable ground state isotope is francium 215 with a half life of 0 12 ms it undergoes a 9 54 mev alpha decay to astatine 211 its metastable isomer francium is less stable still with a half life of only 3 5 ns applications due to its instability and rarity there are no commercial applications for francium it has been used for research purposes in fields of chemistry and of atomic structure its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored but this application has been deemed impractical francium s ability to be synthesized trapped and cooled along with its relatively simple atomic structure has made it subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments these experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on light emitted by laser trapped francium 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory history as early as 1870 chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium with an atomic number of 87 it was then referred to by provisional name eka caesium adloff jean pierre kaufman george b september 25 2005 francium atomic number 87 last discovered natural element chemical educator 10 5 retrieved on 2007 03 26 research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element and at least four false claims were made that element had been found before an authentic discovery was made erroneous and incomplete discoveries soviet chemist d k dobroserdov was first scientist to claim to have found eka caesium or francium in 1925 he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium another alkali metal and incorrectly concluded that eka caesium was contaminating sample radioactivity from sample was from naturally occurring potassium radioisotope potassium 40 he then published a thesis on his predictions of properties of eka caesium in which he named element after his home country shortly thereafter dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at polytechnic institute of odessa and he did not pursue element further following year english chemists gerald j f druce and frederick h loring analyzed x ray photographs of manganese ii sulfate they observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka caesium they announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed name as it would be heaviest alkali metal in 1930 fred allison of alabama polytechnic institute claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto optical machine allison requested that it be named after his home state of virginia along with symbols vi and vm in 1934 h g macpherson of uc berkeley disproved effectiveness of allison s device and validity of his discovery in 1936 romanian physicist horia hulubei and his french colleague yvette cauchois also analyzed pollucite this time using their high resolution x ray apparatus they observed several weak emission lines which they presumed to be those of element 87 hulubei and cauchois reported their discovery and proposed name moldavium along with symbol ml after moldavia romanian province where hulubei was born in 1937 hulubei s work was criticized by american physicist f h hirsh jr who rejected hulubei s research methods hirsh was certain that eka caesium would not be found in nature and that hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth x ray lines hulubei insisted that his x ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake because of this jean baptiste perrin nobel prize winner and hulubei s mentor endorsed moldavium as true eka caesium over marguerite perey s recently discovered francium perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of hulubei s work and finally she was credited as sole discoverer of element 87 all other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium s very limited half life perey s analysis eka caesium was discovered in on 7 january 1939 by marguerite perey of curie institute in paris when she purified a sample of actinium 227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 kev perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 kev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one which was separated during purification but emerged again out of pure actinium 227 various tests eliminated possibility of unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element 87 produced by alpha decay of actinium 227 perey then attempted to determine proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium 227 her first test put alpha branching at 0 6 a figure which she later revised to 1 perey named new isotope actinium k it is now referred to as francium 223 and in 1946 she proposed name cm for her newly discovered element as she believed it to be most electropositive cation of elements irene joliot curie one of perey s supervisors opposed name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation furthermore symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium perey then suggested francium after france this name was officially adopted by international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac in 1949 becoming second element after gallium to be named after france it was assigned symbol fa but this abbreviation was revised to current fr shortly thereafter francium was last element discovered in nature rather than synthesized following hafnium and rhenium further research into francium s structure was carried out by among others sylvain lieberman and his team at cern in 1970s and 1980s occurrence thumb this sample of uraninite contains about 100 000 atoms 3 3 g of francium 223 at any given time alt a shiny gray 5 centimeter piece of matter with a rough surface 223fr is result of alpha decay of 227ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 x 1018 uranium atoms it is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in earth s crust at any given time production thumb a magneto optical trap which can hold neutral francium atoms for short periods of time alt a complex experimental setup featuring a horizontal glass tube placed between two copper coils francium can be synthesized by a fusion reaction when a gold 197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen 18 atoms from a linear accelerator in a process originally developed at in physics department at state university of new york at stony brook

which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a magneto optical trap mot in a gaseous unconsolidated state although atoms only remain in trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms result is a steady state containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms while a later improved design could trap over 300 000 at a time sensitive measurements of light emitted and absorbed by trapped atoms provided first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory research project using this production method relocated to in 2012 where over 106 francium atoms have been held at a time including large amounts of 209fr in addition to and other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons and bombarding thorium with protons deuterons or helium ions 223fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent 227ac francium being milked via elution with nh4cl from an actinium containing cation exchanger and purified by passing solution through a silicon dioxide compound loaded with barium sulfate in 1996 stony brook group trapped 3000 atoms in their mot
