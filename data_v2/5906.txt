nix is a natural satellite of pluto with a diameter of across its longest dimension it was discovered along with pluto s outermost moon hydra in june 2005 by pluto companion search team it was named after nyx greek goddess of night nix is third moon of pluto by distance orbiting between moons styx and kerberos nix was imaged along with pluto and its other moons by new horizons spacecraft as it flew by pluto system in july 2015 images from new horizons spacecraft reveal a large reddish area on nix that is likely an impact crater discovery thumb left 220px discovery images of nix and hydra nix was discovered by researchers of pluto companion search team using hubble space telescope new horizons team had suspected that pluto and its moon charon might be accompanied with other moons hence they used hubble space telescope to search for faint moons around pluto in 2005 since nix s brightness is about 5 000 times fainter than pluto long exposure images were taken in order to find it discovery images were taken on 15 may 2005 and 18 may 2005 nix and hydra were independently discovered by max j mutchler on 15 june 2005 and by andrew j steffl on 15 august 2005 discoveries were announced on 31 october 2005 after confirmation by precovering archival hubble images of pluto from 2002 two newly announced moons of pluto were subsequently provisionally designated s 2005 p 1 for hydra and s 2005 p 2 for nix moons were informally referred to as p1 and p2 respectively by discovery team describing discovery naming thumb left 120px hubble image of pluto s moons annotated name nix was approved by international astronomical union iau and was announced on 21 june 2006 along with naming of hydra in iau circular 8723 iau circular no 8723 naming moons nix was named after nyx greek goddess of darkness and night and mother of charon ferryman of hades in greek mythology two newly named moons were intentionally named that order of their initials n and h honors new horizons mission to pluto similarly to how first two letters of pluto s name honors percival lowell original proposal for naming of nix was to use classical spelling nyx but to avoid confusion with asteroid nyx spelling was changed to nix egyptian spelling of name adjectival form of name is cf russian nikta nikta names of features on bodies in pluto system are related to mythology and literature and history of exploration in particular names of features on nix must be related to deities of night from literature mythology and history origin pluto s smaller moons including nix were thought to have formed from debris ejected from a massive collision between pluto and another kuiper belt object similarly to how moon is believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large collision of earth ejecta from collision would then coalesce into moons of pluto however collisional hypothesis cannot explain how nix maintained its highly reflective surface characteristics physical characteristics nix has an elongated shape with its longest axis measured at across and its shortest axis across this gives nix measured dimensions of early research appeared to show that surface of nix is reddish in color contrary to this other studies show that nix is spectrally neutral similar to small moons of pluto neutral spectrum of nix signifies that water ice is present on its surface nix also appeared to vary in brightness and albedo or reflectivity brightness fluctuations were thought to be caused by areas with different albedos on surface of nix images of nix from new horizons spacecraft show a large reddish area approximately across which could explain two conflicting measurements of nix s surface color reddish area is thought to be a large impact crater where reddish material was ejected from underneath nix s water ice layer and deposited on its surface in this case nix would likely have originating from impact another explanation suggests that reddish material may have originated from a collision with nix and another object with a different composition however there were no significant color variations on other impact craters on nix water ice present on surface of nix is responsible for its high reflectivity trace amounts of frozen methane may be also present on surface of nix and could be responsible for presence of reddish material likely tholins on its surface in this case tholins on surface of nix may have originated from reaction of methane with ultraviolet radiation from sun derived from crater counting data from new horizons age of nix s surface is estimated to be at least four billion years old rotation 250px thumb a simulation of nix modelled as an ellipsoid showing its chaotic rotation nix is not tidally locked and tumbles chaotically similarly to all smaller moons of pluto moon s axial tilt and rotation period vary greatly over short timescales due to chaotic rotation of nix it can occasionally flip its entire rotational axis varying gravitational influences of pluto and charon as they orbit their barycenter causes chaotic tumbling of pluto s small moons including nix chaotic tumbling of nix is also strengthened by its elongated shape which creates torques that act on object at time of new horizons flyby nix was rotating with a period of 43 9 hours retrograde to pluto s equator with an axial tilt of 132 degrees it was rotating backwards in relation to its orbit around pluto rotation rate of nix had increased by 10 percent since nix was discovered it was rotating faster since its discovery orbit nix orbits pluto charon barycenter at a distance of between orbits of styx and kerberos all of pluto s moons including nix have very circular orbits that are coplanar to charon s orbit moons of pluto have very low orbital inclinations to pluto s equator nearly circular and coplanar orbits of pluto s moons suggest that they may have gone through tidal evolutions since their formation at time of formation of pluto s smaller moons nix may have had a more eccentric orbit around pluto charon barycenter present circular orbit of nix may have been caused by charon s tidal damping of eccentricity of nix s orbit through tidal interactions mutual tidal interactions of charon on nix s orbit would cause nix to transfer its orbital eccentricity to charon thus causing orbit of nix to gradually become more circular over time nix has an orbital period of approximately 24 days and its orbit is resonant with other moons of pluto nix is in a 3 2 orbital resonance with hydra and a 9 11 resonance with styx ratios represent numbers of orbits completed per unit time period ratios are inverses as a result of this laplace like 3 body resonance it has conjunctions with styx and hydra in a 2 3 ratio nix s orbital period is close to a 1 4 orbital resonance with charon with a timing discrepancy of 2 8 there is no active resonance a hypothesis explaining such a near resonance is that resonances originated before outward migration of charon following formation of all five known moons and is maintained by periodic local fluctuation of 9 percent in pluto charon gravitational field strength exploration new horizons spacecraft visited pluto system and photographed pluto and its moons during its flyby on 14 july 2015 of pluto s smaller moons only nix and hydra were imaged at resolutions high enough for surface features to be visible prior to flyby of pluto system measurements of nix s size were performed by long range reconnaissance imager on board new horizons initially estimating nix to be about in diameter first detailed images of nix taken by new horizons from a distance of about were downlinked or received from spacecraft on 18 july 2015 and released to public on 21 july 2015 with an image resolution per pixel nix s shape was often referred to as a jelly bean shape enhanced color images from ralph mvic instrument of new horizons show a reddish region on its surface from those images another accurate measurement of nix s dimensions was made giving approximate dimensions of notes references external links background information regarding our two newly discovered satellites of pluto discoverers website nasa s
