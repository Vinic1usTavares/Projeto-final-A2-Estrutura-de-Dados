zenbook are a family of ultrabooks low bulk laptop computers produced by asus first zenbooks were released in october 2011 and original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012 models range from 12 inch laptops featuring power efficient components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors to 15 inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives most though not all zenbooks use intel core ultra low voltage processors and nvidia gpus when integrated graphics are not used asus introduced new models with touch screens to take advantage of windows 8 after its release in late 2012 most models drew comparisons to macbook air zenbook mainly competes against computers such as acer s aspire dell s and xps hp s pavilion and envy lenovo s samsung s sens and toshiba s satellite asus designed zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity rather than plastic usual laptop construction material a pattern of concentric circles on lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent zen philosophy that designers wanted to portray when creating laptops zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as high quality screens used in later models however touchpad software was found to be erratic particularly on early models and some of models received criticism for their high prices some models such as suffer from lockdown when lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold for example if device is left on and unattended result is that charger will fail to recharge battery even when plugged in leaving machine in a near complete unresponsive off state machine can often be revived by pressing power on key for 10 seconds whereupon it will start recharging design thumb concentric circles on lid of a zenbook are said to represent ripples in water in 2009 asus released a 15 inch laptop that was focused on energy efficiency and had a thin profile laptop was rated poorly by reviewers as it under performed and had mediocre battery life despite installed energy efficient hardware although not branded as one it bore same ux product code as many of later zenbooks and was an early foray into market zenbook name was proposed by asus chairman jonney shih to reflect zen philosophy applied to design chief designer loewy chen had wanted to incorporate design elements from luxury watches into his products for a long time zenbooks were first opportunity to put this into practice crossover being achieved he said by unfolding of laptop from side recalling elegance of minute and hour hand movements reference to watches is also reflected in marketing of zenbooks asus published design sketches overlaying an open zenbook on a watch face and video advertisements feature similar imagery concentric circles on lid of zenbooks were intended to look like ripples in water and to reflect philosophical ideas such as infinite nature of zen thinking and self improvement bodies of zenbooks are made of aluminium chosen for its light weight strength vibration dampening appearance and acoustic properties both bodies and lids are cnc milled and brushed for appearance reviewers have noted resulting superior rigidity and complimented appearance of zenbook range to preserve space some zenbooks use two pcbs connected by a communications ribbon so it can have ports on both sides of device with a and fan centred between them in 2018 asus screenpad with zenbook pro 15 screenpad replaces regular trackpad with a colour touchscreen display this technology was then in 2019 included in lower end zenbook 13 zenbook 14 and zenbook 15 and offered optionally on lower end lineup of s laptops in 2019 as a successor 2018 s zenbook pro zenbook duo and zenbook pro duo feature two screens one at regular position and other above keyboard this second display resulted into move of keyboard nearer to chin and trackpad to where a would be similarly to asus gaming rog zephyrus laptop controversy numerous zenbook models with resolution specifications of qhd 3200 x 1800 and 4k 3840 x 2160 utilize pentile rg bw

alt thumb ux31a keyboard is backlit and has greater key travel than first generation first official zenbooks zenbook and ux31e drew comparisons to macbook air and it was regarded as an excellent rival by cnet reviewer andrew hoyle other aspects of laptops that reviewers liked were bang and olufsen speakers fast boot times due to asus bios design and speed of general tasks within operating system resulting from ssd and sandy bridge processors however screens drew criticism for their poor contrast ratio colour accuracy and less than perfect viewing angle although they were praised for their brightness and sharpness of s screen reviewers also noted shallow key press of metal keyboard and lack of backlighting a feature that asus did not have time to implement before shipping new screens on zenbook prime were highly praised by reviewers when considering brightness contrast ratio viewing angle and colour accuracy improvements over previous models being put down to switch from tn to ips displays keyboard also garnered praise for increased backlighting and improved key travel while intel wi fi controller was found to perform better than qualcomm used in first generation of zenbooks zenbook primes still received some criticism latest version of trackpad was acknowledged as an improvement over original zenbooks but still irritating and sound quality was found to be worse than that with first generation despite these issues overall reaction was positive ux31a was called today s best ultrabook and best ultrabook out there at time of release zenbook ux32vd was well received for similar reasons to zenbook prime screen chassis and keyboard again garnered praise although inclusion of a discrete gpu was noted as a major selling point hybrid drive attracted criticism for its slow performance and same trackpad issues that zenbook prime had were still present slr lounge criticised slow hybrid drive and 4 gb of ram but suggested replacing them as option is available noting that it was an option not often offered on ultrabooks as a cheaper option zenbook was praised by chris martin of pc advisor for being a more affordable luxury retaining premium feel of zenbook range but at a lower price point aluminium chassis which is identical to ux32vd to keep costs down was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality by contrast sandy bridge chip a previous generation part at time of sale was outlined as a detraction as was lower battery life compared to ux31e although screen used was a tn panel and of a lower resolution than ux32vd or ux31a it was considered an acceptable compromise for price screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which notebook check s reviewer christian found quite suitable for outdoor use noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours zenbook and drew criticism for its high price and lack of touch screen but screen quality keyboard and system speed were praised battery life was considered acceptable taking into account form factor and discrete gpu despite it being significantly shorter than ux31a anandtech reviewer jason found touch screen to be so superior to trackpad that he stopped using trackpad altogether in his trial of a zenbook touch at asus launch event chris griffith of australian found that screen of ux31a responded well and that windows 8 gestures worked predictably his only criticism being high price zenbook is commonly reported to suffer from significant coil whine issues references external links category asus products category category consumer
