end of song aguilera speaks out loud word motherfucker critical reception circles garnered mainly positive reviews from music critics andrew hampp of billboard was very positive calling it biggest surprise on lotus and writing circles is aguilera at her most unapologetic and all more delightful for it 4music s chris younie wrote that aguilera is throwing tonnes of attitude and sass our way

maerz called it a sassy kiss off story gilmore of neon limelight was very positive commenting as much as we love xtina for her incredible voice we also love her for her feisty personality tune is a brilliant mix of genres with a rockstar worthy chorus popjustice writer same hine enjoyed track and said that he liked it when christina gets a bit wobbly and bubblegum melody sounds oddly good with lyrics although it wasn t her finest pop moment mike wass from idolator wrote that song sounds like nine inch nails song ever recorded also commenting it as a total trainwreck but there s something amusing about xtina putting her haters in their place joseph r atilano of inquirer entertainment praised circles as one of catchiest songs of album and compared track to songs by rihanna and nicki minaj kitty empire of observer commented that sing song verse is redolent of rihanna montreal gazette editor t cha dunlevy simply described it as a raunchy flip of bird to haters hitfix writer melinda newman called it a shape shifting and compared aguilera to gwen stefani as she adopts a patois annie of a v club was mixed naming it a bitter 90s alt rock crossed with m i a s antagonistic attitude it should be an angry kiss off instead cringe inducing lyrics sap its ire for michael gallucci of popcrush song dips back to bubblegum pop of aguilera s debut for verses but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during refrains circles doesn t seem to know what kind of song it wants it to be so it settles for two not very good ones credits and personnel recording recorded at westlake studios
