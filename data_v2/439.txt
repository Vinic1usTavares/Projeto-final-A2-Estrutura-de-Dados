gebelein predynastic mummies are six naturally mummified bodies dating to approximately 3400 bc from late predynastic period of ancient egypt they were first complete predynastic bodies to be discovered well preserved bodies were excavated at end of nineteenth century by wallis budge british museum keeper for egyptology from shallow sand graves near gebelein today naga el in egyptian desert budge excavated all bodies from same grave site two were identified as male and one as female with others being of undetermined gender bodies were given to british museum in 1900 some grave

ref ae 368 in 1895 and 1896 ruins at abydos hierakonpolis and gebelein were excavated in 1892 jacques de morgan director of antiquities in egypt proved that pottery found at abydos and pre dated dynastic period stimulating interest by many european archaeologists as each excavation was completed local egyptian residents would continue to search sites for remains in 1895 e a wallis budge on behalf of british museum procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from 12th dynasty tombs at al by working with egyptian service of antiquities budge started purchasing predynastic finds from locals including bowls spear and arrow heads carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining in 1896 budge was approached by a resident of gebelein who claimed to have found more mummies budge was taken to bodies and he immediately recognized them as from predynastic period and first complete pre dynastic bodies identified he began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at bahr bila ma waterless river located at eastern slopes of north most hill at gebelein only grave goods were a pot found with female adult body and partial remains of wicker fur and linen with other bodies in predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and sometimes loosely wrapped in such a burial when body is covered in warm sand environmental conditions mean that most of water in body is quickly evaporated or drained away meaning that corpse is naturally dried and preserved this method was widely used in pre dynastic egyptian period before artificial mummification was developed natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to original egyptian belief in an after death survival and started tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife all bodies were in similar flexed positions lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin in comparison most bodies excavated from egypt dating to predynastic period are in a similar position however at beni beni salama is a neolithic settlement 60 km north of cairo see and el
