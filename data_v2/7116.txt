showed that hammond climbed military ladder by being shrewd intelligent and by being possessed of a long vision despite being a spouted bottom line t don s davis described general hammond as initially hard nosed and straight ahead and later as seemingly stern and straight laced recognizing need to fulfill role as a general davis still tried to bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable welfare of men and women under hammond s command is paramount in general s mind besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions general hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger even if he always does so reluctantly and with regret as shown in chain reaction hammond would rather leave military quietly than risk careers and lives of his staff and his family which must go against all his blustery texas background davis appreciated hammond s closeness to sg 1 team and his willingness to compromise at beginning of series hammond does not accept alien warrior teal c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing teal c s devotion to stargate program despite his admiration for dr daniel jackson s enthusiasm in beginning hammond has a hard time understanding daniel s unorthodox and non military approach to problems until hammond comes to realize importance of a civilian viewpoint to sg 1 s mission when alien jonas quinn joins sg 1 in season 6 davis compared hammond s response to jonas to his reaction to teal c in season 1 although hammond does not blame jonas for daniel s death in meridian situation does make it difficult for hammond to totally take young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has rest of sg 1 davis named nid as hammond s only source of frustration since they regularly outflank hammond and sg 1 hammond s only option is to call president for support but most cases end with sg 1 or hammond breaking rules to assure survival of humanity so hammond will do whatever he must to get things done conceptual history don s davis was a stand in and stunt double for dana in macgyver a 1985 1992 television series that starred richard dean anderson who also portrayed stargate sg 1s lead character jack o neill at time davis had suffered burnout from teaching acting classes at university of british columbia for ten years and later considered work on macgyver a new lease on life when producers cast stargate sg 1 in 1996 they asked davis to read for role of george hammond and contracted him for multiple years davis considered general hammond in initial character breakdown as a two dimensional by book character and a mere foil for o neill and was dissatisfied with view of pilot episode s director mario who in particular wanted hammond to be a military stereotype davis who had served as an army captain in korea in 1960s felt that character breakdown did not mirror reality of military service and he was reluctant to portray such a role for several years producers eventually allowed davis to humanize character during run of show producers wrote season 4 s chain reaction as a bit of a hammond episode after they had not devoted an episode to hammond during first three seasons episode ended up very different from writer joseph mallozzi s original pitch which he had envisioned as a hammond story in which general faces a court martial after being implicated in death of an off world sg team leader when no more hammond episodes were written in following seasons davis cited stargate sg 1s focus on off world adventures of sg team military framework and general s knowledge for why hammond can be nothing more than peripheral to that action after playing general hammond for nearly 150 episodes in seven seasons don s davis decided to leave stargate sg 1 in late 2003 he had suffered from prolonged health problems and was grateful that stargate sg 1 producers had previously continued his employment and had scheduled episodes around his surgeries davis turned towards painting and sculpting but continued to work in film and television industry including stargate franchise continuing to appear in every season of stargate sg 1 davis died from a heart attack at age of 65 on june 29 2008 shortly before release of stargate continuum his last on screen appearance as general hammond stargate producers closed final stargate atlantis episode enemy at gate with a dedication card to don s davis episode also mentions off screen passing of general hammond with earth s newest ship being named in his honor reception jo storm commended don s davis in her book approaching possible for bring ing out his character s actions and motivations with confidence and thoughtfulness that only a professional of many years can in stargate sg 1 pilot hammond set s up things as advantageously as he can and proved to be a competent and believable commander talking about hammond in season 2 time travel episode 1969
