welshman and fourth goalkeeper to win award though everton had won a place in european cup english clubs were banned from european competitions following heysel stadium disaster southall remained bitter over this blaming uefa for tragedy and stating that ban was a convenient way to break up english dominance of european competitions limited to domestic competitions everton won fa charity shield with a 2 0 win over manchester united during celebrations southall wore a t shirt saying i love my wife as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair after getting sent off against chelsea at stamford bridge in october kendall criticised southall in press by saying he let lads down despite this set back he agreed to sign a six year contract in december which was then longest contract club had ever issued however he twisted his ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play in his absence his deputy bobby mimms took his place and everton

february and won man of match awards in wins over arsenal and chelsea as everton claimed another league title comparing two title wins 1985 and 1987 southall said that latter success was more rewarding and satisfying as it had proved to be more of a struggle compared to ease in which title was won in former campaign after kendall left merseyside to coach athletic bilbao his assistant colin harvey took charge at goodison southall responded well to change as he believed harvey understood my obsessive and relentless desire to be best everton finished fourth in 1987 88 conceding a club record low of 27 goals in 40 league games and reached semi finals of league cup southall had missed opening stages of season after undergoing knee surgery harvey had failed to adequately replace some of everton s departing star players and southall noted how mediocrity became habitual as club coasted to an eighth place finish in 1988 89 season he kept goal in final of full members cup a largely unsuccessful tournament inspired by ban on european football as everton were beaten 4 3 by nottingham forest more significantly he kept goal against liverpool in 1989 fa cup final after conceding only two goals in seven games en route to final in an emotional match in aftermath of hillsborough disaster in semi final encounter with nottingham forest liverpool won cup with a 3 2 extra time victory everton were leading division at start of 1989 90 season but their title challenge fell away after a televised 6 2 defeat to aston villa southall was later told he needed surgery that would keep him out of action for eight months but he instead sought out a back specialist who told him he simply had a bad back and found that problem corrected itself southall requested a transfer before start of 1990 91 season he famously sat down during a sulking session against a goalpost at half time of season opener whilst his teammates were still in changing rooms while three goals down to newly promoted leeds united a game eventually lost 3 2 southall was fined two weeks wages despite denying it was a protest and that he simply did it to clear his head he then received a phone call from manchester united manager alex ferguson but southall s hostile phone manner put ferguson off idea of signing him and ferguson instead bought danish goalkeeper peter schmeichel howard kendall returned as everton manager in november with colin harvey being demoted to his assistant and led club out of relegation trouble to secure a ninth place finish they also reached final of full members cup at wembley losing 4 1 to crystal palace though southall refused to collect his runners up medal as he did not value competition everton were a declining force and finished 12th in league in 1991 92 whilst exiting both fa cup and league cup at fourth round they then finished 13th in 1992 93 season in newly created premier league just four points above relegation zone kendall resigned mid way through 1993 94 campaign and was replaced by mike walker southall later described walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football walker oversaw a run of bad results and everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over wimbledon winning 3 2 after turning round a 2 0 deficit southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in match and so took ball himself before graham stuart plucked up courage to take ball from him and convert penalty everton picked up four points from their opening 12 league games of 1994 95 season and southall received death threats after being confronted by an everton fan during a match at goodison park walker was sacked and replaced by joe royle who led club to a 2 0 win over liverpool in his first match in charge this game also marked a record 35th merseyside derby appearance for southall it was also second match of seven consecutive games everton went without conceding a goal another club record southall then conceded just one goal a penalty in five games en route to 1995 fa cup final against manchester united everton won game 1 0 with southall making a double save from paul scholes victory left southall as most decorated everton player in club s history in summer of 1995 southall was given a testimonial match against celtic as well as an mbe during ceremony queen asked southall what will you do now that you re retired he went on to keep a clean sheet in 1995 fa charity shield as everton beat blackburn rovers 1 0 he remained an ever present in 1995 96 season though royle then tried to sign crystal palace goalkeeper nigel martyn he tried to sell southall to wolverhampton wanderers but cancelled deal after becoming concerned over pre season form of touted replacement paul gerrard and instead doubled southall s wages to ps6 000 a week with a new two year contract despite this royle dedicated an entire chapter of his 2005 autobiography to decrying southall as a potential weak link after a promising start to 1996 97 everton were beaten six times in a row after christmas and southall resorted to ringing up a phone in radio show to defend manager joe royle from unhappy supporters royle dropped southall from team despite show of support though he rejected a transfer offer from chelsea who were prepared to double southall s wages caretaker manager dave watson restored southall to starting line up after royle s resignation and steered club away from relegation howard kendall returned again to manage everton for 1997 98 season and played southall in everton goal for final time on 29 november in a 2 0 defeat at home to tottenham hotspur thomas myhre took his place in goal and southall rejected a coaching role at club in order to search for first team football elsewhere in december 1997 southall went to alvin martin s southend united of second division on loan he made 9 appearances in a brief stay at roots hall he joined chris kamara s first division stoke city in february 1998 kamara resigned two months later and caretaker manager alan durban pulled southall aside on his first day in charge to say i ll let you manage reserves so long as you keep your head down do whatever i tell you and i won t tell everybody you re a bad influence southall was shocked by durban s words and could not explain his attitude both southend and stoke would end season bottom of their respective divisions and everton only avoided relegation on last day of season he left britannia stadium in summer and later said one of worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close later years former teammate ian snodin invited him to join conference side doncaster rovers on a short term deal at start of 1997 98 season he signed with wes saunders s torquay united of third division in december 1998 he saved a penalty on his debut at in a 2 0 win over hull city and signed a contract lasting until end of 1998 99 campaign he was named as torquay s player of year at end of season however on 29 january 2000 he picked up a concussion in a 2 1 defeat to chester city at deva stadium and was substituted though he recovered from his injury after match he left club not long afterwards southall made a return to premier league by signing with bradford city as a player coach helping to coach aidan davison matt clarke and gary walsh all three goalkeepers picked up injuries leaving manager paul jewell no choice but to play southall at valley parade on 12 march 2000 against leeds united at age of 41 years and 178 days he became fourth oldest player in premier league history leeds won 2 1 and southall was criticised in media for being too overweight to play professionally he left bradford at end of 2000 01 season after falling out with new boss jim jefferies international career wales manager mike england preferred dai davies in goal as southall began to play first team football at everton and southall only got a run of games once davies retired his first cap came against northern ireland at racecourse ground wrexham on 27 may 1982 in 1982 british home championship wales won 3 0 wales came close to qualifying for 1986 fifa world cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to iceland and spain wales then beat iceland at ninian park before recording a surprise 1 0 win over scotland at hampden park with a single ian rush goal a 3 0 win over spain at racecourse ground meant that wales could secure qualification by beating scotland in their final qualification game at ninian park though a draw would not be enough game ended in a 1 1 draw after a late davie cooper penalty cancelled out mark hughes s opener southall got a hand to penalty but could not keep it out however result of game was put into perspective when scotland manager jock stein suffered a heart attack at end of game and died shortly afterwards wales came close to qualifying for uefa euro 1988 which would have been first uefa european football championship in nation s history going into final two games of qualifying wales led their group southall was injured and so missed match against denmark in copenhagen which ended in a 1 0 defeat with eddie in goal southall returned to play final game a 2 0 defeat to czechoslovakia in prague which left wales two points short of group winners denmark manager mike england was then replaced by terry yorath who also made southall a virtual ever present in wales goal in qualifying for 1990 fifa world cup wales faced netherlands west germany and finland they failed to win a game and finished bottom of group though southall did get chance to play against some of world s best players in ruud gullit marco van basten frank rijkaard rudi andreas moller andreas and jurgen klinsmann in qualifying for uefa euro 1992 wales were placed in same group as world champions germany and finished just one points behind germans after conceding just six goals in their six games wales beat germany 1 0 at cardiff arms park on 5 june 1991 and three months later beat brazil in a friendly by same scoreline game which settled qualifying group came in nuremberg on 16 october 1991 and wales lost 4 1 to germans ending southall s wales record run of 385 minutes without conceding an international goal wales were seen to have their best chance in reaching a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for 1994 fifa world cup however a gheorghe hagi inspired romania defeated wales 5 1 in bucharest to open wales campaign victories over faroe islands and belgium and two draws with representation of czechs and slovaks put wales back on track and a victory over romania in cardiff in last game of tournament would be enough to secure a place in world cup however southall allowed a 25 yard strike from hagi slip under his body and into net and was nutmegged by florin as wales were beaten 2 1 once again a death put welsh footballing hopes into perspective as southall attended funeral of retired postman john hill who was killed after being struck by a flare released at end of match manager terry yorath was replaced by john toshack who stuck with southall but resigned after just 48 days after falling out with football association of wales results went badly under new boss mike smith despite a 2 0 victory over albania in first game of qualifying for uefa euro 1996 an embarrassing 3 2 defeat to moldova was followed by a heavy 5 0 loss to georgia two defeats to bulgaria ended faint hopes of qualification and cost smith his job southall applied for vacant position but bobby gould was chosen instead who in turn named southall and ian rush as his assistants he tried danny coyne andy marriott and tony roberts in goal in friendly games but selected southall for world cup qualifying wins over san marino a month away from his 39th birthday he won his final cap against turkey on 20 august 1997 turks won 6 4 southall only played first half as gould blamed him for three goals he conceded his replacement paul jones went on to concede three himself in second half southall s 92 welsh caps were a national record until surpassed by chris gunter in november 2018 southall conceded 126 goals an average of 1 34 per match 1958 fifa world cup was only time until end of his career that wales qualified for a major tournament and british home championship was played for final time in 1984 therefore majority of southall s caps came in friendlies or qualifying games style of play southall was renowned for his shot stopping ability particularly in dealing with one on one situations quickly coming off his line to intimidate onrushing forward and relying on his instinctive reactions to save ball he would spend hours reading books about boxing and golf to improve his balance and spring and would focus on improving minor pieces of kit and behaviour saying that if i changed 100 things and got 1 better because of one of them then it was worth it coaching and management career southall was appointed caretaker manager of wales alongside mark hughes following resignation of bobby gould after a 4 0 defeat against italy on 5 june 1999 in his only game in charge wales lost 2 0 to denmark at anfield on 9 june 1999 and mark
