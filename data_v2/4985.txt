sharptooth houndshark or spotted gully shark triakis megalopterus is a species of houndshark in family triakidae found in shallow inshore waters from southern angola to south africa favoring sandy areas near rocky reefs and gullies it is an active swimming species that usually stays close to bottom this robust shark reaches in length and has characteristically large rounded fins pectoral fins in particular are broad and sickle shaped in adults it also has a short blunt snout and long furrows around its mouth this species is gray or bronze in color above with variable amounts of black spotting mainly active at night sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans bony fishes and cephalopods it has been observed gathering in groups in shallow water during summertime possibly for reproductive purposes this species is aplacental viviparous meaning that unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk females give birth to 6 12 pups between late may and august on a 2 or 3 year cycle sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers and some are also captured on commercial bottom longlines because of its small range and low growth and reproductive rates it is very vulnerable to overfishing international union for conservation of nature has therefore listed this species as near threatened taxonomy and phylogeny thumb left upright 1 2 illustration that accompanied smith s original species description scottish zoologist andrew smith originally described sharptooth houndshark as a species of mustelus in 1839 as part of his work illustrations of zoology of south africa his account was based on two specimens caught off cape of good hope south africa smith named shark megalopterus from greek mega large and pteron wing referring to its large fins another common name for this shark is sweet william later authors have reassigned sharptooth houndshark to genus triakis more specifically to subgenus cazon alongside houndshark t and spotted houndshark t maculata a 2006 phylogenetic study by j andres lopez and colleagues based on four protein coding gene sequences found that this species did not group with leopard shark t semifasciata instead houndshark and it formed a clade within mustelus lineage this result suggests that two subgenera of triakis cazon and triakis may not be closely related which would warrant a redefinition of genus description sharptooth houndshark is a stout bodied species with a short thick and blunt snout nostrils are widely spaced and preceded by lobe like flaps of skin that do not reach mouth horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes large mouth bears long deep furrows at corners with those on lower jaw almost meeting in middle teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement like surfaces each tooth has a rounded molar like base that rises to a sharp upright central cusp rarely a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present five pairs of gill slits are found fins are distinctively large and rounded at tips pectoral fins of adults are broad and falcate sickle shaped dorsal fins have nearly vertical trailing margins with first originating over pectoral fin rear tips second dorsal fin is about three quarters as high as first anal fin is much smaller than second dorsal fin and originates well behind it short thick caudal peduncle lacks notches at caudal fin origins caudal fin has a small but well defined lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near tip skin is often loose this species is dark gray to bronze above and white below young sharks are mostly unmarked while adults vary from plain to densely covered with irregular black spots it may reach in length and in weight females grow larger than males distribution and habitat thumb left sharptooth houndsharks gathering in a gully at garden route south africa range of sharptooth houndshark is limited to coastal waters of southern africa from southern angola to eastern cape or rarely kwazulu natal in south africa this locally common species inhabits sandy habitats such as bays it can be found from surf zone to a depth of but majority is found no deeper than it generally swims just barely above bottom favoring flat areas near rocky reefs or gullies and seldom rises into open water biology and ecology thumb crab plagusia chabrus is most important food source for sharptooth houndsharks off south africa sharptooth houndshark is a highly active species though it can sometimes be found resting inside rocky crevices it mainly hunts at night and has been known to pursue prey almost onto shore pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey while their broad bases allow it to crush hard shelled prey this shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans crabs slipper lobsters and spiny lobsters bony fishes including sea drums and porgies and cephalopods in particular octopus vulgaris sharks and rays including catsharks and and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals off south africa most important prey species is crab plagusia chabrus its dietary composition changes with age young sharks under long subsist almost completely on crabs while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods as well as a greater variety of prey overall this shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on squid loligo during their mass spawnings broadnose sevengill shark notorynchus cepedianus is known to prey on this species during summer sharptooth houndshark forms groups in shallow water these aggregations are particularly well documented in false bay and may be related to reproduction given presence of many pregnant females it is aplacental viviparous with developing embryos nourished mainly by yolk mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteri litters of 6 12 pups are birthed between late may and august following a gestation period of some 20 months larger females tend to produce larger litters length at birth has been variously estimated as and by different sources pups within a single litter may vary in size by up to 30 females apparently reproduce either every two or three years depending on whether she has ovarian eggs developing during pregnancy that would allow her to mate again within a few months of giving birth sharptooth houndshark is a slow growing species with both sexes following a similar growth pattern males mature sexually at long and 11 13 years of age while females mature sexually at long and 15 16 years of age maximum lifespan is at least 25 years human interactions harmless to humans sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and has been displayed in public aquariums it is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski boats it is edible but rarely eaten small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting school shark galeorhinus galeus in and false bay region meat from sharks caught in fishery is either made into or jerky and sold locally or exported fresh or frozen to italy and taiwan although in south africa sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species thus cannot be harvested commercially it is often mistaken for common smooth hound mustelus mustelus by fishers international union for conservation of nature has assessed sharptooth houndshark as near threatened this species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure due to its restricted range slow growth rate and low fecundity fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern see also list of sharks references external links triakis
