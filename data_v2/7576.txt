is a modern japanese martial art developed by morihei ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies philosophy and religious beliefs ueshiba s goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury aikido is often translated as way of unifying with life energy or as way of harmonious spirit thumb ueshiba at 55th all japan aikido demonstration held at nippon budokan may 2017 aikido s techniques include irimi entering and turning movements that redirect opponent s attack momentum various types of throws and joint locks aikido derives mainly from martial art of daito ryu aiki jujutsu but began to diverge from it in late 1920s partly due to ueshiba s involvement with omoto kyo religion ueshiba s early students documents bear term aiki jujutsu ueshiba s senior students have different approaches to aikido depending partly on when they studied with him today aikido is found all over world in a number of styles with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis however they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for well being of attacker etymology and basic philosophy thumb 80px aikido written with ki in its old character form word aikido is formed of three kanji ai joining unifying combining fitting ki spirit energy mood morale do way path term aiki does not readily appear in japanese language outside scope of budo this has led to many possible interpretations of word is mainly used in compounds to mean combine unite join together meet examples being combined united composition unite combine join together union alliance association combine unify and mutual agreement there is an idea of reciprocity to get to know one another talk discussion negotiation and meet by appointment is often used to describe a feeling as in i feel x as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning and feeling sensation it is used to mean energy or force as in electricity and magnetism it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things as in spirit trait temperament term is also found in martial arts such as judo and kendo and in various non martial arts such as japanese calligraphy flower arranging and tea ceremony therefore from a purely literal interpretation aikido is way of combining forces or way of unifying energy in which term aiki refers to martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker s movements for purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort one applies by understanding rhythm and intent of attacker to find optimal position and timing to apply a counter technique history thumb 100px alt a middle aged mustachioed man in a kimono ueshiba in tokyo in 1939 aikido was created by morihei ueshiba 14 december 1883 26 april 1969 referred to by some aikido practitioners as great teacher term aikido was coined in twentieth century draeger donn f 1974 modern bujutsu budo martial arts and ways of japan new york weatherhill page 137 ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as synthesis of his martial training but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation during ueshiba s lifetime and continuing today aikido has evolved from aiki that ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout world initial development thumb right takeda sokaku ueshiba developed aikido primarily during late 1920s through 1930s through synthesis of older martial arts that he had studied core martial art from which aikido derives is daito ryu aiki jujutsu which ueshiba studied directly with takeda sokaku reviver of that art additionally ueshiba is known to have studied tenjin shin yo ryu with tozawa in tokyo in 1901 yagyu shingan ryu under nakai masakatsu in sakai from 1903 to 1908 and judo with takagi 1894 1972 in tanabe in 1911 art of daito ryu is primary technical influence on aikido along with empty handed throwing and joint locking techniques ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons such as those for spear short staff and perhaps however aikido derives much of its technical structure from art of swordsmanship ueshiba moved to hokkaido in 1912 and began studying under takeda sokaku in 1915 his official association with daito ryu continued until 1937 however during latter part of that period ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and daito ryu at that time ueshiba was referring to his martial art as aiki budo it is unclear exactly when ueshiba began using name aikido but it became official name of art in 1942 when greater japan martial virtue society was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of japanese martial arts religious influences thumb right onisaburo deguchi after ueshiba left hokkaido in 1919 he met and was profoundly influenced by onisaburo deguchi spiritual leader of omoto kyo religion a neo shinto movement in one of primary features of omoto kyo is its emphasis on attainment of utopia during one s life this was a great influence on ueshiba s martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it in an ideal resolution not only is receiver unharmed but so is attacker in addition to effect on his spiritual growth connection with deguchi gave ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist as a result of this exposure he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students several of these students would found their own styles of aikido international dissemination aikido was first brought to rest of world in 1951 by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students he was followed by tadashi abe in 1952 who came as official aikikai hombu representative remaining in france for seven years kenji tomiki toured with a delegation of various martial arts through 15 continental states of united states in 1953 later that year koichi tohei was sent by aikikai hombu to hawaii for a full year where he set up several dojo this trip was followed by several further visits and is considered formal introduction of aikido to united states united kingdom followed in 1955 italy in 1964 by hiroshi tada and germany in 1965 by asai designated official delegate for europe and africa by morihei ueshiba noro arrived in france in september 1961 seiichi was appointed to introduce aikido to australia in 1965 today there are aikido dojo throughout world proliferation of independent organizations largest aikido organization is aikikai foundation which remains under control of ueshiba family however aikido has many styles mostly formed by morihei ueshiba s major students earliest independent styles to emerge were aikido begun by minoru mochizuki in 1931 yoshinkan aikido founded by gozo shioda in 1955 and shodokan aikido founded by kenji tomiki in 1967 emergence of these styles pre dated ueshiba s death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized shodokan aikido however was controversial since it introduced a unique rule based competition that some felt was contrary to spirit of aikido after ueshiba s death in 1969 two more major styles emerged significant controversy arose with departure of aikikai hombu dojo s chief instructor koichi tohei in 1974 tohei left as a result of a disagreement with son of founder ueshiba who at that time headed aikikai foundation disagreement was over proper role of ki development in regular aikido training after tohei left he formed his own style called shin shin aikido and organization that governs it ki society ki no a final major style evolved from ueshiba s retirement in iwama ibaraki and teaching methodology of long term student morihiro saito it is unofficially referred to as iwama style and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called iwama ryu although iwama style practitioners remained part of aikikai until saito s death in 2002 followers of saito subsequently split into two groups one remained with aikikai and other formed independent kai in 2004 around saito s son saito today major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization have their own in japan and have an international breadth ki right thumb 100px this was kanji for ki until 1946 when it was changed to study of ki is an important component of aikido and its study defies categorization as either physical or mental training as it encompasses both kanji for ki normally is written as it was written as until writing reforms after world war ii and this older form still is seen on occasion character for ki is used in everyday japanese terms such as or ki has many meanings including ambience mind mood and intention however in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to life energy gozo shioda s yoshinkan aikido considered one of hard styles largely follows ueshiba s teachings from before world war ii and surmises that secret to ki lies in timing and application of whole body s strength to a single point in later years ueshiba s application of ki in aikido took on a softer more gentle feel this was his aiki and many of his later students teach about ki from this perspective koichi tohei s ki society centers almost exclusively around study of empirical albeit subjective experience of ki with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ki development training in aikido as in virtually all japanese martial arts there are both physical and mental aspects of training physical training in aikido is diverse covering both general physical fitness and conditioning as well as specific techniques because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws beginners learn how to safely fall or roll specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs techniques for defense consist of throws and pins after basic techniques are learned students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents and techniques with weapons fitness thumb right 200px ukemi is very important for safe practice physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders flexibility and endurance with less emphasis on strength training in aikido pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for aikido practitioner in aikido specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone mass or power aikido related training emphasizes use of coordinated whole body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates for example many dojos begin each class with which may include stretching and ukemi break falls roles of uke and tori aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre arranged forms kata rather than freestyle practice basic pattern is for receiver of technique uke to initiate an attack against person who applies technique tori or shite depending on aikido style also referred to as nage when applying a throwing technique who this attack with an aikido technique both halves of technique that of uke and that of tori are considered essential to aikido training both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy while uke learns to become calm and flexible in disadvantageous off balance positions in which tori places them this receiving of technique is called ukemi uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities e g an exposed side while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off balance and vulnerable in more advanced training uke will sometimes apply to regain balance and pin or throw tori refers to act of receiving a technique good ukemi involves attention to technique partner and immediate environment it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido fall itself is part of aikido and is a way for practitioner to receive safely what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw initial attacks aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking based arts sincere attacks a strong strike or an immobilizing grab are needed to study correct and effective application of technique many of of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat other techniques which explicitly appear to be punches tsuki are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword kicks are generally reserved for upper level variations reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous and that kicks high kicks in particular were uncommon during types of combat prevalent in feudal japan some basic strikes include a vertical knifehand strike to head in training this is usually directed at forehead or crown for safety but more dangerous versions of this attack target bridge of nose and maxillary sinus a diagonal knifehand strike to side of head or neck a punch to torso specific targets include chest abdomen and solar plexus same as and a punch to face same as beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike attacker who is grabbing defender following are examples of some basic grabs one hand grabs one wrist both hands grab one wrist same as both hands grab both wrists same as a shoulder grab both shoulders grab is it is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as grabbing clothing of chest same as basic techniques right thumb diagram of ikkyo or first technique has a similar mechanism of action although upper hand grips forearm rather than elbow following are a sample of basic or widely practiced throws and pins many of these techniques derive from daito ryu aiki jujutsu but some others were invented by morihei ueshiba precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles so what follows are terms used by aikikai foundation note that despite names of first five techniques listed they are not universally taught in numeric order a control using one hand on elbow and one hand near wrist which leverages uke to ground this grip applies pressure into ulnar nerve at wrist a wristlock that torques arm and applies painful nerve pressure there is an wristlock or z lock in ura version a rotational wristlock that directs upward spiraling tension throughout arm elbow and shoulder a shoulder control similar to ikkyo but with both hands gripping forearm knuckles from palm side are applied to recipient s radial nerve against periosteum of forearm bone visually similar to ikkyo but with an inverted grip of wrist medial rotation of arm and shoulder and downward pressure on elbow common in knife and other weapon take aways hand is folded back past shoulder locking shoulder joint a wristlock throw that stretches extensor a loosely used term for various types of mechanically unrelated techniques although they generally do not use joint locks like other techniques throws in which tori moves through space occupied by uke classic form superficially resembles a clothesline technique beginning with dori moving forward tori sweeps one hand low earth and other high heaven which uke so that he or she easily topples over aikido s version of hip throw tori drops their hips lower than those of uke then flips uke over resultant fulcrum or a throw that locks arms against each other kanji for 10 is a cross shape shi tori sweeps arm back until it locks shoulder joint then uses forward pressure to throw implementations left thumb diagram showing two versions of ikkyo technique one moving forward omote version and one moving backward ura version see text for more details aikido makes use of body movement tai to blend with uke for example an entering irimi technique consists of movements inward towards uke while a technique uses a pivoting motion additionally an technique takes place in front of uke whereas an technique takes place to their side a technique is applied with motion to front of uke and a version is applied with motion towards rear of uke usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion finally most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture seiza techniques where both uke and tori are standing are called tachi waza techniques where both start off in seiza are called waza and techniques performed with uke standing and tori sitting are called thus from fewer than twenty basic techniques there are thousands of possible implementations for instance ikkyo can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect incoming force or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance perhaps an omote waza version specific aikido kata are typically referred to with formula attack technique modifier for instance katate dori ikkyo refers to any ikkyo technique executed when uke is holding one wrist this could be further specified as katate dori ikkyo omote referring to any forward moving ikkyo technique from that grab atemi are strikes or feints employed during an aikido technique some view atemi as attacks against vital points meant to cause damage in and of themselves for instance gozo shioda described using atemi in a brawl to quickly down a gang s leader others consider atemi especially to face to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques a strike whether or not it is blocked can startle target and break their concentration target may become unbalanced in attempting to avoid blow for example by jerking head back which may allow for an easier throw many sayings about atemi are attributed to morihei ueshiba who considered them an essential element of technique weapons right thumb disarming an attacker using a technique weapons training in aikido traditionally includes short staff jo although its techniques resemble closely use of bayonet or wooden sword bokken and knife tanto some schools incorporate firearm disarming techniques both weapon taking and weapon retention are taught some schools such as iwama style of morihiro saito usually spend substantial time practicing with both bokken and jo under names of aiki ken and aiki jo respectively founder developed many of empty handed techniques from traditional sword spear and bayonet movements consequently practice of weapons arts gives insight into origin of techniques and movements and reinforces concepts of distance timing foot movement presence and connectedness with one s training partner s multiple attackers and randori one feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers often called or freestyle practice with multiple attackers called randori is a key part of most curricula and is required for higher level ranks randori exercises a person s ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment strategic choice of techniques based on how they reposition student relative to other attackers is important in randori training for instance an ura technique might be used to neutralise current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind in shodokan aikido randori differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker but between two people where both participants attack defend and counter at will in this respect it resembles judo randori injuries in applying a technique during training it is responsibility of tori to prevent injury to uke by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner s proficiency in ukemi injuries especially those to joints when they do occur in aikido are often result of tori misjudging ability of uke to receive throw or pin aikido and injuries special report by fumiaki aiki news 1989 80 april partial english translation of article re printed in aikido journal a study of injuries in martial arts showed that type of injuries varied considerably from one art to other soft tissue injuries are one of most common types of injuries found within aikido as well as joint strain and fingers and toes several deaths from head and neck injuries caused by aggressive in a senpai kohai hazing context have been reported mental training aikido training is mental as well as physical emphasizing ability to relax mind and body even under stress of dangerous situations this is necessary to enable practitioner to perform bold enter and blend movements that underlie aikido techniques wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness morihei ueshiba once remarked that one must be willing to receive 99 of an opponent s attack and stare death in face in order to execute techniques without hesitation as a martial art concerned not only with fighting proficiency but with betterment of daily life this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners uniforms and ranking thumb 230px right hakama are folded after practice to preserve pleats aikido practitioners commonly called aikidoka outside japan generally progress by promotion through a series of grades kyu followed by a series of degrees dan pursuant to formal testing procedures some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners grades often simply white and black belts to distinguish kyu and dan grades though some use various belt colors testing requirements vary so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with rank of another some dojos do not allow students to take test to obtain a dan rank unless they are 16 or older rank belt color type kyu 65px white dan 65px black uniform worn for practicing aikido is similar to training uniform used in most other modern martial arts simple trousers and a wraparound jacket usually white both thick judo style and thin karate style cotton tops are used aikido specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below elbow most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers called a hakama used also in kendo and iaido in many schools its use is reserved for practitioners with dan ranks or for instructors while others allow all practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank criticisms most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training attacks initiated by uke and which tori must defend against have been criticized as being weak sloppy and little more than caricatures of an attack weak attacks from uke allow for a conditioned response from tori and result in underdevelopment of skills needed for safe and effective practice of both partners to counteract this some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but in keeping with core philosophies this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners shodokan aikido addresses issue by practising in a competitive format such adaptations are debated between styles with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either criticisms are unjustified or that they are not training for self defense or combat effectiveness but spiritual fitness or other reasons another criticism pertains to shift in training focus after end of ueshiba s seclusion in iwama from 1942 to mid 1950s as he increasingly emphasized spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido as a result strikes to vital points by tori entering irimi and initiation of techniques by tori distinction between omote front side and ura back side techniques and use of weapons were all de emphasized or eliminated from practice some aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness conversely some styles of aikido receive criticism for not placing enough importance on spiritual practices emphasized by ueshiba according to minoru shibata of aikido journal o sensei s aikido was not a continuation and extension of old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts that is that aikido practitioners who focus on aikido s roots in traditional jujutsu or kenjutsu are diverging from what ueshiba taught such critics urge practitioners to embrace assertion that ueshiba s transcendence to spiritual and universal reality were fundamentals of paradigm that he demonstrated references
