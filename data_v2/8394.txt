drexel 4257 also known by an inscription on its first page john gamble his booke amen 1659 is a music manuscript commonplace book jeffrey pulver a biographical dictionary of old english music with a new introduction and a bibliography of writings of jeffrey pulver by gilbert blount new york da capo press 1973 it is largest collection of english songs from first half to middle of 17th century and is an important source for studying vocal music in its transition from renaissance music to baroque music in england many songs also provide commentary on contemporary political events leading up to restoration belonging to new york public library it forms part of music division s drexel collection located at new york public library for performing arts following traditional library practice its name is derived from its call number resource description and access rule 6 2 2 7 option c access by subscription historical context before researchers took active interest in it field of 17th century british song had not been investigated music historian charles burney had a negative opinion towards british vocal music in this period that attitude was carried through beginning of 20th century where in first edition of oxford history of music hubert parry stated that english composers sense of musical line was deficient quoting parry oxford history of music vol 3 vincent duckles thought one reason for negative attitude might have been lack of published sources between 1627 publication date of john hilton s ayres or fa las and 1651 john playford s musical banquet there appeared only a single publication of british vocal music walter porter s and ayres of 1632 duckles incorrectly states date as 1639 scholarly work on drexel 4257 was one of major reasons for a change in attitude with over 320 songs 250 of which contain music it is largest single body of early 17th century english songs that we know composers all belonged to small world of court musicians that suffered disruption during english civil war and commonwealth of england some began their careers late in reign of james i most saw service in court of charles i and a few survived to return to their posts at invitation of charles ii for most part their active careers were over by 1660 or shortly thereafter compiler or compilers was not an antiquarian this collection of songs was intended for practical use and represents generation of english composers active between 1630 and 1660 as such drexel 4257 stands as record of english musical and literary taste as it developed over a period of some thirty years moving from late jacobean era to restoration periods though its musical contents may sometimes be variable its main interest is that as a document of its time it reflects contemporary taste offering comments on contemporary events and references to past by virtue of its repertoire and of period covered drexel 4257 is closely related to other 17th century english music manuscripts 2240 british

new jersey folios are not numbered but each song is numbered using different methods of enumeration scholars have disagreed on how many songs are contained in manuscript hughes wrote that collection contained 246 songs 146 of which are by unidentified composers but he was only counting songs with a musical setting sufficiently complete to make identification possible duckles claimed there were 325 different songs numbered 1 through 329 two songs occur twice keepe on yor vayle and hide yor eye nos 134 and 237 and if thou wilt loue me i le loue thee nos 174 and 215 additionally nos 275 stay

fourth series xi 1929 p 263 charles w hughes believed book was begun around turn of 17th century a hypothesis rejected by jorgens who notes that it contains works by henry lawes born in 1596 hughes believed terminal date was at least 1660 as some of songs refer to charles ii who assumed throne in 1660 duckles noted that earliest lyrics were from england s helicon 1600 and davison s poetical rhapsody 1602 duckles felt that 1659 is close to terminal date noting that no songs had been added after commonwealth period and no younger composers were included in collection provenance left thumb folio 1v containing a bawdy lyric and inscription john gamble his booke click for close up though writers disagree on details of handwriting see section on handwriting below they all agree that handwriting of latter portion of drexel 4257 is probably that of john gamble given that there is a concentration of his work in that part of manuscript this suggests that book was begun by someone else whom lynn hulse recognized as thomas jordan see below duckles surmised that gamble came into possession of book in 1642 43 when musicians of royal chapel were dispersed as a result of english civil war although gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666 this book appears to have survived he made out his will on 30 june 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson also named john gamble all his books of music philip h highfill jr kalman a burnim and edward a langhans a biographical dictionary of actors actresses musicians dancers managers other stage personnel in london 1660 1800 vol 5 carbondale southern illinois university press 1978 p 451 after gamble s death in 1687 nothing is known of manuscript for over 150 years first published reference to it comes in 1846 where it is mentioned in volume 19 of percy society s early english poetry ballads and popular literature of middle ages as being in possession of one of editors of series edward francis rimbault frederick w introduction to civic garland early english poetry ballads and popular literature of middle ages london printed for percy society by t richards 1846 p xi an organist and musicologist rimbault took a keen interest in english music and voraciously collected rare books scores and valuable manuscripts upon his death his extensive and valuable library was auctioned by sotheby s over course of five days rimbault auction catalog entry for gamble manuscript reads a collection of upwards of 300 songs by wilson lawes johnson gamble and other english composers containing also autograph inscription john gamble his book amen 1659 anno domini catalogue of valuable library of late edward francis rimbault comprising an extensive and rare collection of ancient music printed and in manuscript which will be sold by auction by messrs sotheby wilkinson hodge on tuesday 31st of july 1877 and five following days london sotheby wilkinson hodge 1877 p 92 hughes quotes a contemporaneous report of hammer price and comment thirteen guineas for america reference was to philadelphia born financier joseph w drexel who had already amassed a large music library and purchased about 300 lots from rimbault auction upon drexel s death he bequeathed his music library to lenox library when lenox library merged with astor library to become new york public library drexel collection became basis for one of its founding units music division today drexel 4257 is part of drexel collection in music division now located at new york public library for performing arts at lincoln center organization duckles noted that there are subsidiary groups organized by composer henry lawes nos 26 36 william webb nos 160 166 robert smith nos 237 238 thomas brewer nos 244 245 robert johnson nos 108 109 and john gamble nos 292 319 similarly is group of three songs set by john wilson for richard brome s play northern lass nos 45 46 and 47 first 47 songs are love lyrics by poets of jacobean court including ben jonson william shakespeare robert herrick thomas carew john suckling beaumont and fletcher after no 47 a new spirit is suggested by song no 48 you madcapps of england that merry will make a lusty drinking song that indicates a political shift after 1640 deliberate segregation is in evidence between songs nos 48 and 80 where there are a series of 32 ballads and popular songs in contrast to art lyrics of first few songs there is a brief return to elevated nature in songs nos 154 76 thereafter popular and sophisticated songs are mixed handwriting thumb folio 3 recto showing a portion of cattalogue with contributions from all three hands hughes and duckles both believed that manuscript was written by at least two individuals hughes characterized first hand as a neater older hand dating from either at end of 16th century or beginning of 17th century a date disputed by subsequent writers see above second hand copied newer songs including some by gamble and were written in a more careless hand hughes believed that this evidence suggested that manuscript was begun by an unidentified person and was continued by john gamble himself commencing with song no 177 following hughes s view duckles also believed manuscript was written in two hands in his view first hand wrote titles for songs nos 1 176 of cattalogue and second hand probably that of gamble himself wrote of nos 177 266 leaving space left to accommodate future additions as well as alphabetical index duckles described writing style of hand 1 as favoring round compact letter forms vertical alignment calligraphic flourishes on capitals and heavy down strokes when writing with a broad pen duckles admits that hand 1 has two forms when hand writes with a finer quill letter forms are more loosely connected flourishes a little more pronounced and there is a slight inclination to right hand no 2 has a pronounced slant to right letter forms are thin and elongated and pen is a fine one duckles observed that hand no 2 participated slightly in preparation of part 1 nos 1 176 with only six songs but all of text incipits likes hughes duckles also felt that hand 2 is probably that of gamble duckles hypothesized that first hand might have been that of ambrose beeland with whom gamble apprenticed and is believed to have been his teacher lynn hulse refutes this saying that handwriting does not match existing beeland manuscripts jorgens disagreed with both hughes and duckles and saw three different hands based on two tables of contents jorgens surmised that all three copyists had access to book at one time she characterized first hand as firm bold but well controlled secretary hand second hand as looser and somewhat lighter secretary hand beginning with song no 38 and a third hand rougher slanted inclined towards italian style that begins with song no 46 all three roughly equal by no 177 first two have dropped out hand three has entered all of gamble s songs and is probably his it also has entered text incipits since these incipits do not correspond with other known songs they are probably work of gamble hulse identified first hand of gamble manuscript is probably that of poet thomas jordan ca 1612 1685 same hand as manuscript in university of nottingham as well as other jordan manuscripts in harvard university and bodleian library hulse showed that jordan and gamble were involved in same london circle of theatre musicians and composers for many years culminating in jordan s preface for gamble s a defence for musick published in 1659 she identifies songs nos 4 16 32 45 47 99 154 155 169 170 175 176 and text incipit of 96 as being copied by jordan politics lyrics to a number of songs have references to contemporary politics and events since itt hath bin lately high treason no 313 carries a strong suggestion of reaction to contemporary british history one song beat on proud billows was known to have been written by roger l estrange while he was imprisoned in newgate prison during oliver cromwell s rule 1645 1648 some songs express regret for a better past listen iolly gentlemen listen be merry no 63 praises reign of charles i indirectly criticizing then current regime lyric of reioyce all england contrasts 13th century hero guy of warwick with current rulers one song alludes to marital difficulties between charles ii and his portuguese wife catherine of braganza another example of distrust of foreigners can be seen in lyric harke harke ile tell you news from cort all ye french now are all sent back to france charles ii also figures in god bless our noble king which comically describes king s progress from whitehall to st paul s cathedral you of england describes frivolous english soldiers at siege of la rochelle including characters named wentworth referring to thomas wentworth 1st earl of strafford and murrey referring to robert moray other names mentioned include wilmot weston george symon hugh and game possibly john gamble some songs reveal prejudice against puritans no 92 cock lorrell inuited ye diuell his gestt concerns cock known as a rogue and highway robber as friends with devil of citty no 70 is an exception praising a protestant service duckles took note of bold lyrics to song no 73 ye giddy poets that from sea and land greatest store to deck her fine what would you do with such a whore duckles clarified meaning outspoken vulgarity was not necessarily result of personal taste but a reflection of royalist protest against puritan morality intended to shock taste of parliamentarians topical or literary content hughes argued that unlike a textbook compilation of exemplars drexel 4257 shows a variety of good and mediocre poetry most songs deal with love and range from flowery rhetoric to frank accounts of love making a few however deal with topical matters there are two songs related to christmas beate upp a dromm depicts feasters in a mock battle with cold in which feasters win and christmas is my name have i gone was a popular ballad which appeared in a number of 17th century sources in this song personification of christmas comes from far away to discover that his friends and other residents have deserted country in favor of city song concludes with a lament that universal welcome is gone because protestants and puritans disassociate themselves from christmas similarly with fewer political overtones song ladies you loose yor time expresses preference for city life over that of country song oh yt mine eyes a graphic meditation on crucifixion of jesus is only song in collection to deal with a religious subject song nor loue nor fate dare i by john wilson bears inscription composed for comedy northern lass although this is only song that manuscript indicates is from a drama at least 26 songs have texts from dramas or masques attesting to gamble s association with theatre songs composed by gamble are best characterized as drolls drolls were collections of cavalier wit much of it trivial repetitious and derivative but at same time containing some work of genuine literary value their tone was seldom dignified often frankly sexual and characterized by a persistent undertone of anti puritan feeling similar examples can be found in work of ben jonson thomas carew and john suckling musical content and style hughes cursorily observed that drexel 4257 contains no naturals sharps are used to cancel flats and flats are used to cancel sharps he noted that technical blunders such as parallel fifths and octaves are to be found as well as other kinds of mistakes duckles s dissertation explores transition from lute song representing an older style of composition appropriate to waning of renaissance music to continuo song reflecting newer baroque music practice it s not always an easy form of composition to assess lutes were not always used for songs and sometimes were used even after ascendancy of continuo song general characteristics of lute song are smooth flowing and restrained lines while continuo song is more vigorous abrupt and discontinuous harmonies in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines while in continuo songs they define structure lute songs tend to be loose and melismatic with frequent repetitions of verse fragments while continuo songs are more closely tied to rhythm of text dissonance and chromaticism are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring generally english composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects hughes noted that restoration lyrics typified baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics use of these techniques in england indicate their adoption from italy where they were first used previously it had been thought that english composers either didn t know about them or weren t interested but a comparison of drexel 4257 with another of gamble s books in british library additional where some of songs appear in an embellished form indicate that british composers and singers did occasionally adopt a more florid style duckles examined song if loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue by thomas campion which appears as no 10 of drexel 4257 and was also published in campion s third book of ayres from about 1617 campion was generally a conservative composer in version present in drexel 4257 melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to declamatory text so that speed of verse accelerates naturally an alteration which duckles finds an improvement over original many songs are recitative like in some of these songs bar is enlarged as it approaches cadence suggesting a ballad singer who briefly pauses to catch his breath hemiola a consistent practice in english music of this time many songs are 6 4 meter while some suggest that they are adaptations from violin tunes yet barline does not always reflect verbal rhythm in comparing song ballowe my babe lye still and sleepe no 46 of drexel 4257 with version that appears in elizabeth rogers virginal book duckles notes that earlier virginal version is in duple meter with no trace of while version in gamble manuscript has them suggesting a modernization of an older song another example of continuo style is like hermitt poore in pensiue place obscure no 15 a lyric attributed to sir walter raleigh and dating from 1591 in comparing alfonso ferrabosco s setting from his ayres of 1609 to one by nicolas lanier in drexel 4257 duckles admits possibility that lanier s may have been inspired by that of ferrabosco but musical characteristics of lanier setting including simplicity of texture distinct phrases use of an and suggestion of a rhythmic motif through use of a recurring pattern of eighth notes point to contemporary text setting techniques song drowsie sun why dostt thou stay by thomas brewer no 253 shows expressive false relations and harmonic word painting foreshadowing later developments in british sacred music brewer s songs are among earliest examples of italian pathetic style in english music and represent mature style of continuo song devices such as an octave leap look away from lute song to continuo song not all songs with recitative like musical lines indicate modernism there are dance songs that contain elements of an ostinato bass antico and all characteristics of renaissance rather than baroque periods several tunes and texts are of 16th century origin had long been in repertoire among them greensleeves o mistress mine and back and sides go bare duckles does not indicate which works in drexel 4257 are adaptations of these known songs with these exceptions earliest songs date from jacobean period a comparison with anthologies published by john playford in 1652 1653 and 1659 indicates particular songs were popular that selections were copied into book attests to their popularity even after tastes had changed due to restoration similarly song i went from england into a satirical narrative refers to song john dory indicating that song s continued popularity it had appeared in thomas ravenscroft s of 1609 though probably dates earlier when ye chill charockoe blowes is a song containing both declamatory and tuneful styles it is a drinking song whose erratic harmony suggests frequent cadences and whose angular melody which moves with great vigor this is in to lute song that emphasized continuous flow and smooth melodic motion duckles identifies two styles of songs of collection declamatory air reflecting modern style and tuneful air reflecting older style a vestige of renaissance musical practice tuneful air could be composed based on a preexisting tune or a tune intended to be a dance form in examining lyric forms duckles identified ballad as one type of lute song ballads found in drexel 4257 are all of a sophisticated type in which satire and parody are important elements ballad as simple narrative or topical ballad are not represented warning that one must be wary of fluid nature of musical genres duckles categorized following songs from drexel 4257 as ballads 46 48 49 51 53 55 56 58 59 60 62 63 64 66 67 68 70 74 76 79 92 103 104 105 116 119 120 121 123 131 142 144 145 146 147 186 214 271 272 duckles identified these songs as being in declamatory style 4 12 15 20 22 26 30 31 33 83 89 108 132 160 161 162 164 168 172 182 188 198 206 238 239 240 243 247 249 253 256 260 261 262 269 274 277 280 284 285 292 299 306 311 315 316 317 323 326 duckles observes that by 1651 transition from lute song to continuo song was complete printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung since in order to keep engraving costs manageable they would economize on written vocal embellishments that s why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to baroque vocal styles duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings since words and music are inseparable significance in his dissertation duckles summed up gamble and his manuscript list of songs this table is based on table of contents listed in jorgens supplemented with composer lyricist attributions and other remarks from duckles 1953 no must yor fayre eie 2 see at
