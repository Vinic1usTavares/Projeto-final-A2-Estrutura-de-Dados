to protect it deeded to it ownership of itself and its surrounding land by various accounts this transaction took place between 1820 and 1832 date 1832 is given on a brass plaque affixed to tree s retaining wall according to newspaper article deed read it is unclear whether story of tree that owns itself began with weekly banner article or if it had been an element of local folklore prior to that time article s author writes that in 1890 there were few people still living who knew story left thumb plaque at site weathered by exposure stone faintly details a passage from william h jackson s deed to tree story of tree that owns itself is very widely known and is almost always presented as fact however only one person anonymous author of deeded to itself has ever claimed to have seen jackson s deed to tree most writers acknowledge that deed is lost or no longer exists if in fact it ever did such a deed even if it did exist would have no legal standing under common law person receiving property in question must have legal capacity to receive it and property must be delivered to and accepted by recipient william h jackson did in fact own property on opposite side of dearing street from tree that plot included present day 226 dearing street but in early 19th century it was simply designated lot 14 tree however is located on a portion of what had been lot 15 jackson and his wife mildred along with a j a cobb sold their property to a dr malthus ward in 1832 same year cited on a plaque as being date of tree s deed clarke county real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom jackson originally purchased property although much of land in that area is reported to have belonged to a major james meriwether clarke county georgia deed book p page 9 june 15 1832 and deed book s page 301 latter simply identifies mildred as william jackson s wife even though jackson may have lived near tree as an adult his childhood was actually spent in jefferson county not in athens making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath tree s branches recent deeds suggest that tree s square footage remains part of property at 125 dearing street these documents describe a parcel bounded on east by finley street and on north by dearing street an area that would seem to encompass tree clarke county georgia deed books 1558 166 1996 338 455 1970 et al however actual plat map for that property clearly does not include tree s oddly shaped corner its eastern line lies roughly to west of tree s location as far as tax assessor is concerned tree s area is not a part of that property clarke county georgia plat book 32 364 this does not confirm that tree owns itself but suggests rather that it is considered to be within right of

tree was permanently weakened original oak fell on evening of october 9 1942 following a long period of decline its poor condition had been known for years and within days of its collapse a move was under way to replace fallen tree with a son grown from one of its acorns one account suggests that tree had actually died several years before its collapse victim of root rot tree was over tall and was estimated to be between 150 and 400 years old when it fell it has been reported elsewhere that tree fell on december 1 1942 succumbing not to old age and disease but rather to a violent windstorm that ravaged much of north georgia that evening causing widespread damage and killing several people while it is possible that some portion of tree had remained standing for several weeks meeting a
