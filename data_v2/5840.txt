bp pedestrian bridge or simply bp bridge is a girder footbridge in loop community area of chicago illinois united states it spans columbus drive to connect maggie daley park formerly daley bicentennial plaza with millennium park both parts of larger grant park designed by pritzker prize winning architect frank gehry and structurally engineered by skidmore owings and merrill it opened along with rest of millennium park on july 16 2004 gehry had been courted by city to design bridge and neighboring jay pritzker pavilion and eventually agreed to do so after pritzker family funded pavilion named for energy firm bp which donated 5 million toward its construction it is first gehry designed bridge to have been completed bp bridge is described as snakelike because of its curving form designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight it has won awards for its use of sheet metal bridge is known for its aesthetics and gehry s style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction pedestrian bridge serves as a noise barrier for traffic sounds from columbus drive it is a connecting link between millennium park and destinations to east such as nearby lakefront other parts of grant park and a parking garage bp bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards it is designed without handrails using stainless steel parapets instead total length is with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it barrier free and accessible although bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics design preliminary plans since mid 19th century grant park has been chicago s front yard with lake michigan to east and loop to west columbus drive runs north south through grant park with daley bicentennial plaza in northeast corner of park west of columbus drive northwest corner of park had been illinois central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 when it became available for development by city as millennium park millennium park is also north of monroe street and art institute east of michigan avenue and south of randolph street for 2007 millennium park trailed only navy pier as a chicago tourist attraction thumb right upright gehry designed both bridge and jay pritzker pavilion with curving stainless steel plates in february 1999 city announced it was negotiating with frank gehry to design a proscenium arch and orchestra enclosure for a band shell in new park as well as a pedestrian bridge crossing columbus drive between millennium park and daley bicentennial plaza city also sought donors to cover cost of gehry s work which would eventually become jay pritzker pavilion and bp pedestrian bridge at time chicago tribune dubbed gehry hottest architect in universe in reference to acclaim for his guggenheim museum bilbao millennium park project manager edward said frank is just cutting edge of next century of architecture and noted that no other architect was being sought gehry was approached several times by skidmore owings merrill architect adrian smith on behalf of city in april 1999 city announced that pritzker family had donated 15 million to fund gehry s band shell and an additional nine donors committed a total of 10 million more to park that same day gehry agreed to design request in november 1999 when he unveiled his initial plans for bridge and band shell gehry admitted bridge s design was underdeveloped because funding for it was not yet committed even at this early point need for a sound barrier for columbus drive traffic noise was recognized although gehry indicated this might take form of a berm or raised barrier need to fund a bridge to span eight lane columbus drive was evident but some planning for park was delayed in anticipation of details on redesign of soldier field in january 2000 city announced plans to expand park to include features that became cloud gate crown fountain mcdonald s cycle center and bp pedestrian bridge later that month gehry unveiled his next design which depicted a winding bridge while neighboring jay pritzker pavilion changed relatively little from gehry s 1999 design when built bridge went through several proposed designs proposal made in early 2000 which was expected to be executed in 2002 included a bridge that was a mere long and wide that design was not approved and chicago mayor richard m daley s disapproval of gehry s subsequent design of an bridge caused gehry to come up with ten more designs first of these plans was for a z shaped bridge that would have run northwest southeast with western ramps in millennium park leading south and eastern ramps in empty north section of daley bicentennial plaza leading north it would have required elevators to conform to americans with disabilities act this plan was abandoned because it would have segregated handicapped sharoff p 95 gehry had only designed two bridges previously both in mid 1990s bridge in hanover germany and financial times millennium bridge in london united kingdom but neither was built gilfoyle pp 239 41 final plan thumb bridge is a noise barrier along eastern edge of millennium park with historic michigan boulevard district in background final design for bridge was revealed in an exhibit at chicago cultural center on june 10 2000 as designed and built bridge is long and wide with a columbus drive clearance clearance was designed to slightly exceed standard set by united states department of transportation federal highway administration for urban area interstate bridge clearances and to allow for additional future layers of pavement below this height is also greater than maximum vehicle height of set by illinois vehicle code note code states that vehicle height statewide measured from under side of tire to top of vehicle inclusive of load that shall not exceed according to chicago tribune width of area spanned is approximately while new york times reports bridge is over ten times longer than columbus drive is wide bp bridge begins in millennium park between trellis system over jay pritzker pavilion s great lawn and lurie garden design was changed so that west ramp coincided with boardwalk of lurie garden seam gilfoyle pp 303 308 bridge winds its way northward along eastern edge of millennium park before crossing columbus drive in a c shaped curve above underground parking garage entrances in daley bicentennial plaza bridge has an s shape then turns east bp bridge is designed so that its inclined surfaces have a continuous five percent slope rather than landings and switchback ramps which provides easy access for physically challenged gently sloped ramp eliminates need for lifts or any of other common types of ramps l shaped switchback u shaped straight and helped park earn 2005 barrier free america award for its exemplary barrier free design thumb left crossing columbus drive bridge is supported by a central concrete column from randolph street gehry had hoped to design bridge so that it could be constructed without a support column in center of columbus drive however chicago tribune architecture critic blair kamin notes that if he had done so bridge might not have been as sleek building bridge without column would have required load bearing cantilevers beams supported only on one side from structural positions on opposite sides of street this would have been expensive and labor intensive because it would have required excavating large portions of parking garages on both sides of street moreover on daley bicentennial plaza side optimal location for supporting cantilever would have been at location of monroe street garage thus preferred bridge design was altered to avoid problems related to underground parking garages gilfoyle p 200 bridge is both a connector and a viewing platform for park it was designed to link historic michigan boulevard district and entire loop to west with lake michigan lakefront to east it was also designed to be a berm noise barrier blocking noise on eight lane columbus drive from park s outdoor band shell jay pritzker pavilion by deflecting traffic sounds upward bridge which uses steel girders reinforced concrete abutments and deck slabs hardwood deck and a stainless steel veneer cost between 12 1 and 14 5 million it contains large sculptural plates of curvilinear stainless steel instead of more standard flat plates bridge s curvilinear design gives it a flowing natural look instead of linear rigid form of standard bridges although its steel girders rest on concrete pylons and most of bridge is solid concrete bridge uses a hollow box girder design to minimize weight as ground that supports bridge covers underground parking garages gilfoyle pp 196 201 concrete base and box girder are flanked by a hollow stainless steel skeleton despite its hollow structure and fact that it is designed as a concealed beam bridge footbridge is built to highway standards and can support a full capacity load of pedestrians bridge is designed without standard handrails and uses waist high parapets as guard rails instead construction thumb right upright bp bridge entry and redesigned landscape in daley bicentennial plaza bridge was built using 22 gauge stainless steel type 316 plates thick with an angel hair finish and a flat interlocking panel process stainless steel type 316 is known for its excellent welding characteristics as well as for its resistance to pitting according to chicago tribune bridge materials used in construction include 2 000 rot resistant brazilian hardwood boards for deck 115 000 stainless steel screws and 9 800 stainless steel shingle plates gilfoyle p 243 according to architecture metal expertise bridge has 10 400 stainless steel trapezoidal panels in 17 different shop fabricated configurations which involved 1 000 shop hours sheet metal work totaled 5 900 field hours over a six month period during construction about 200 shingles were installed per day sharoff p 105 bridge includes two types of structural steel steel that is thick and in diameter for approaches and box girders for span sharoff p 100 software was used to handle complex geometric layout sharoff p 103 to ensure accurate fitting and alignment to sloping curving sides of bridge 4 400 custom made convex concave and cladding panels were fabricated on site by sheet metal contractor custom metal fabricators cmf cmf used of stainless steel sheet to cover sides which have a combined perimeter length of cmf built special heated enclosures so that work could continue on site through winter they designed fabricated and installed custom type 4 brushed stainless steel parapets serving in place of handrails on bridge cmf earned 2005 tom memorial architectural sheet metal award by california chapter of sheet metal and air conditioning contractors national association for project in 2005 it received a merit award from national steel bridge alliance and an excellence in structural engineering award from structural engineers association of illinois on day that two halves of bridge were joined each side of columbus drive was closed for a 12 hour period and a crane was used to install girders before bringing crane to location screw jacks were used to shore up underground garage roof to hold crane s weight sharoff p 109 landscaping surrounding bridge was redesigned by landscape architect terry guen honey locusts ash and maple trees were removed and replaced with three varieties of magnolia and more than two dozen ornamental and canopy trees along eastern foot of bridge in daley bicentennial plaza other preliminary construction work included setting reinforcing rods for bridge in concrete roof deck of parking garage located under park use and controversies left thumb upright deck is covered with 2 000 brazilian hardwood floor boards before its official opening bridge had a may 22 2004 private ribbon cutting ceremony attended by gehry and mayor daley during weekend of ribbon cutting gehry was awarded an honorary degree from school of art institute of chicago bp pedestrian bridge officially opened along with rest of millennium park on july 16 2004 it remained unnamed at ribbon cutting but before july park opening energy firm bp had paid for bridge sponsorship and naming rights timothy gilfoyle author of millennium park creating a chicago landmark notes that a controversy surrounds tasteless corporate naming of several of park s features including bridge which was named after an oil company gilfoyle p 345 it is well documented that naming rights were sold for high fees and gilfoyle was not only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to highest bidder public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of chicago parks however many of donors have a long history of local philanthropy and funds were essential to providing necessary financing for several features of park after park opened some of bridge s foibles became apparent bridge has had to be closed during winter because freezing conditions make it unsafe since bridge is over an expressway like trench of columbus drive shoveling snow onto passing cars is not an option and brazilian hardwood would be damaged by rock salt city not only mandates that bridge be swept and washed daily but also that parapets be wiped free of fingerprints bridge has also had controversial closures in summer which were related to larger park concerns on september 8 2005 toyota motor sales usa paid 800 000 to rent bridge and all but four venues in park from 6 a m to 11 p m on august 7 2006 allstate paid 700 000 to rent bridge and most of park for a day four venues in millennium park that were not rented by toyota were wrigley square lurie garden mcdonald s cycle center and crown fountain allstate acquired visitation rights to pritzker pavilion bp bridge lurie garden and chase promenades and only had exclusive access to cloud gate after 4 p m exclusion of commuters who normally walk through park and tourists lured by its attractions was controversial though city said money raised paid for free public programs in millennium park aesthetics bridge is noted for its sculptural characteristics and kamin describes it as a delightful pleasure that was designed to emphasize its artistic elements while de emphasizing its concrete and steel support system new york times notes that artist anish kapoor s attempts to hide seams of cloud gate were an interesting contrast to gehry s architectural efforts gehry took pride in making bp pedestrian bridge flaunt its seams beginning with gehry s earliest bridge designs bridge was expected to complement neighboring pritzker pavilion some have suggested that bridge and pavilion are mere extensions of gehry s work in other cities for example according to gilfoyle both structures embody gehry s established asymmetrical style evoking fluid continuous motion and sculptural abstraction they also feature metallic facades and aesthetic curves but they are said to be more refined reduced and dynamic than much of his other work since 1960s gehry has made artistic use of scaled animals such as fish and snakes which first appeared in his architectural designs in 1980s many references to bridge describe it as snakelike for its winding path and some even refer to stainless steel plates as scales with discussion of reptilian forms kamin calls it a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake complete with a scaly skin while gehry said he thought bridge looked like a river but added he might be only one who thought that way bridge flows in a continuum of unexpected directions is a break from gehry s other work and other more traditional urban and architectural forms nearby gilfoyle pp 229 231 pulitzer prize winning architecture critic kamin gave bridge four stars out of a possible four in his review and admires how computers have given gehry unparalleled formal freedom to design complexity of its geometry and multidimensional curvatures bridge provides views of both historic michigan boulevard district and lake michigan in a way that kamin says makes it a belvedere gilfoyle p 272 kamin also recommends anyone having a bad day to stroll across bridge adding you won t get where you re going quickly but you ll feel a whole lot better once you re done credits thumb 200px instead of handrails bp bridge uses parapets with lights for illumination at night commissioned by city of chicago architect gehry partners
