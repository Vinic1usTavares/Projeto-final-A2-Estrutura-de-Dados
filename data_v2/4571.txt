scheme to publicly humiliate scott in front of his favorite band radiohead by getting scott s parents killed and then tricking scott into eating them show s writers debated during production of episode whether or not incident would be a step too far even for cartman parker felt that act could sufficiently be culmination of cartman s sociopathic behavior and would set a new bar by portraying cartman as being capable of performing anything short of murder fans reacted by ranking it as cartman s greatest moment in a 2005 poll on comedy central s website it is later revealed in season fourteen episode 201 that jack tenorman scott s father was a football player for denver broncos and cartman s father dr alphonse also admits that he lied about cartman s mother being a hermaphrodite

describes as directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or unhappiness of others cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor lack of a true father
