thumb banksia integrifolia mhnt banksia integrifolia commonly known as coast banksia is a species of tree that grows along east coast of australia one of most widely distributed banksia species it occurs between victoria and central queensland in a broad range of habitats from coastal dunes to mountains it is highly variable in form but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres 82 ft in height its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides a contrast that can be striking on windy days it is one of four original banksia species collected by sir joseph banks in 1770 and one of four species published in 1782 as part of carolus linnaeus younger s original description of genus it has had a complicated taxonomic history with numerous species and varieties ascribed to it only to be rejected or promoted to separate species taxonomy is now largely settled with three subspecies recognised b integrifolia subsp integrifolia b integrifolia subsp compar and b integrifolia subsp monticola a hardy and versatile garden plant b integrifolia is widely planted in australian gardens it is a popular choice for parks and streetscapes and has been used for bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in cut flower trade but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat names now widely known as coast banksia or coastal banksia b integrifolia was previously known by a range of common names checklist of australian trees lists four other common names honeysuckle white banksia white bottlebrush and white honeysuckle and some older sources refer to it as honeysuckle oak it was known to indigenous australians before its discovery and naming by europeans for example gunai people of gippsland called it because of its wide range it would have a name in a number of other indigenous languages but these are now lost in 2001 a search of historical archives for recorded indigenous names of victorian flora and fauna failed to find a single name for species description b integrifolia is a highly variable species it is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres 80 ft in height but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres 110 ft in more exposed areas it may grow as a small gnarled tree reaching to no more than about 5 metres 15 ft and in highly exposed positions such as on exposed coastal headlands it may even be reduced to a small shrub it usually has a single stout trunk which is often twisted and gnarled with rough grey bark characteristic of banksia leaves are dark green with a white underside and occur in whorls of three to five adult leaves have entire margins george specifies their dimensions as 4 to 20 centimetres 2 8 in long and 6 to 35 millimetres 0 2 1 4 in wide but banksia atlas warns that atlas contributors found great variability in these measurements with specimens often falling outside varietal limits specified by george 1981 or being intermediate between two varieties juvenile leaves have dentate margins with a few short teeth and are generally larger than adult leaves flowers occur in banksias characteristic flower spike an inflorescence made up of several hundred flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis this is roughly cylindrical 10 to 12 centimetres 4 5 in high and five centimetres 2 in wide flowers are usually pale yellow to yellow but may be greenish or pinkish in bud each individual flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals and one long wiry style characteristic of taxonomic section in which it is placed styles are straight rather than hooked style ends are initially trapped inside upper perianth parts but break free at anthesis this process starts with flowers at bottom of inflorescence sweeping up spike at an unusually high rate of between 96 and 390 flowers per 24 hours flower spikes are not as prominent as in some other banksia species as they arise from two to three year old nodes nested within foliage after flowering old flower parts wither and fall away over a period of several months revealing cone a woody axis embedded with many small follicles follicles are initially greenish and downy but gradually fade to dark grey each follicle contains one or sometimes two seeds separated by a thin wooden separator seed itself is black 6 to 10 millimetres 0 2 0 4 in long with a feathery black wing 10 to 20 millimetres 0 4 0 8 in long taxonomy thumb right b integrifolia by sydney parkinson from banks florilegium b integrifolia was first collected at botany bay on 29 april 1770 by sir joseph banks and dr daniel solander naturalists on endeavour during lieutenant later captain james cook s first voyage to pacific ocean however species was not published until april 1782 when carolus linnaeus younger described first four banksia species in his supplementum plantarum linnaeus distinguished species by their leaf shapes and named them accordingly thus species with entire leaf margins was given specific name integrifolia from latin integer meaning entire and folium meaning leaf full name for species is therefore banksia integrifolia l f then followed around 200 years of confusion over taxonomic limits of species caused by species great variability similarities with closely related species and early attempts to classify species based on dried specimen material alone a stable banksia taxonomy did not begin to emerge until 1981 with publication of alex george s landmark monograph genus banksia l f proteaceae over next 18 years george s arrangement was gradually refined in light of new research and discovery of new material and there were several changes to b infraspecific taxa these changes culminated in george s 1999 arrangement which had broad acceptance until 2005 when austin mast eric jones and shawn havery published a phylogeny that did not accord with george s arrangement a new taxonomic arrangement was not published at time but early in 2007 mast and thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring dryandra to banksia and publishing b subg spathulatae for species having spoon shaped cotyledons they foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once dna sampling of dryandra was complete in meantime if mast and thiele s nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement then b integrifolia is placed in b subg spathulatae indeed it is type species for subgenus placement within banksia current taxonomic arrangement of genus banksia is based on george s 1999 monograph for flora of australia book series in this arrangement b integrifolia is placed in banksia subg banksia because its inflorescences take form of banksia s characteristic flower spikes banksia sect banksia because of its straight styles and banksia ser salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical kevin thiele additionally placed it in a subseries integrifoliae but this was not supported by george thumb right infructescence and leaves of b integrifolia subsp integrifolia b integrifolia s placement within banksia may be summarised as follows genus banksiasubgenus banksiasection oncostylis section grandes series banksia series crocinae series prostratae series cyrtostylis series tetragonae series bauerinae series dentata b aquilonia b integrifolia b plagiocarpa b oblongifolia b robur b conferta b paludosa b marginata b canei b saxicola subspecies thumb inflorescence of b integrifolia subsp monticola in late bud although some of great variability of b integrifolia can be attributed to environmental factors much is genetic george writes that it gives impression that it is actively speciating to fill many ecological niches through its range three subspecies are currently recognised b integrifolia subsp integrifolia b integrifolia subsp compar and b integrifolia subsp monticola banksia integrifolia subsp integrifolia nominate subspecies occurs near coast over most of species range except far north it varies little except in northern new south wales and southern queensland where some populations appear to be intermediate with b integrifolia subsp compar banksia integrifolia subsp compar this subspecies grows in coastal queensland as far north as proserpine for most of its range it is only subspecies but near its southern limit it co occurs with b integrifolia subsp integrifolia two subspecies are distinguishable by their leaves which are larger and glossy with wavy margins on b integrifolia subsp compar banksia integrifolia subsp monticola commonly known as white mountain banksia it is only subspecies with a montane distribution it occurs in blue mountains of northern new south wales it is similar in form to b integrifolia subsp integrifolia but differs in having longer narrower leaves and follicles that are more deeply embedded in old flower spike hybrids presumed natural hybrids have been reported between b integrifolia and other members of banksia ser salicinae although no hybrid names have been formally published to date presumed hybrids are identified by their intermediate features for example those with b paludosa swamp banksia known from jervis bay and green cape on coast of southern new south wales have a smaller habit longer thinner flower spikes and persistent old flowers on old cones which are otherwise bare on pure b integrifolia presumed hybrids with b marginata silver banksia occur on wilsons promontory in victoria these are found in localities where both species co occur and have features intermediate between two another purported hybrid with b marginata thought to be from cape paterson on victoria s south coast was first described by alf salkin and is commercially available in small quantities it forms an attractive hardy low growing plant to 1 metre distribution and habitat b integrifolia is widely distributed in both geographical and ecological terms according to alex george it spans a wider geographical and climatic range than any other species thiele and ladiges make a similar claim that its distribution is a broader latitudinal altitudinal and ecological amplitude than any other species with possible exception of b spinulosa it occurs along almost entire eastern coast of australia from geelong victoria to proserpine queensland there was an isolated population on long island tasmania in 1999 and an 1876 record allegedly from king island although there has been speculation that that specimen was actually collected in furneaux group species no longer occurs at any of these tasmania locations and has been declared extinct in tasmania under that state s threatened species protection act 1995 range of latitude is thus about 20 to thumb left tree on headland manly nsw for most of its distribution b integrifolia occurs only within about 50 kilometres 30 mi of coast where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone it grows near coastal cliffs and headlands alongside river estuaries and even on stabilised sand dunes temperature range for this area is around 0 30 degc 30 85 degf with almost no frosts species can occur in pure stands but is usually associated with other species such as melaleuca quinquenervia broad leaved paperbark between sydney and brisbane b integrifolia is found up to 200 kilometres 125 mi inland with b integrifolia subsp monticola occurring in blue mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres 5000 ft there it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts and would experience up to 100 frosts per year in this montane habitat it occurs in association with eucalyptus species such as e viminalis manna gum and e pauciflora snow gum and also rainforest species such as nothofagus moorei antarctic beech and excelsa prickly ash no other species of tree occurs closer to coast at cape byron making b integrifolia most easterly tree on australian mainland ecology right thumb anthochaera chrysoptera little wattlebird on b integrifolia like most other proteaceae b integrifolia has proteoid roots roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in soil just below leaf litter these enhance solubilisation of nutrients thus allowing nutrient uptake in low nutrient soils such as phosphorus deficient native soils of australia studies on b integrifolia suggest that its proteoid root mat achieves this by chemically modifying its soil environment left thumb trichoglossus rainbow lorikeet on b integrifolia flowers have an unusually short life span for banksia species producing nectar for only about four to twelve days after anthesis most nectar is produced during night and early in morning with only small amounts produced during day flowers are produced all through year but there is a strong peak in autumn little else flowers within its range at this time so it is a seasonally important source of food for animals surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on species including a wide range of insects many species of bird including phylidonyris novaehollandiae new holland honeyeater anthochaera carunculata red wattlebird anthochaera chrysoptera little wattlebird acanthorhynchus tenuirostris eastern spinebill and trichoglossus haematodus rainbow lorikeet and mammals such as petaurus squirrel glider petaurus breviceps sugar glider acrobates pygmaeus feathertail glider and pteropus poliocephalus grey headed flying fox in some areas such as at national park in northern new south wales b integrifolia is only source of nectar and pollen in autumn march april and late winter july importance of non flying mammals to pollination of b integrifolia was demonstrated in 1989 with a study in wilsons promontory national park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them unlike most banksia species b integrifolia does not require bushfire to trigger release of its seed rather seed is released spontaneously on reaching maturity in late summer species non reliance on fire for seed dispersal suggests that exclusion of fire would not affect plant populations but a number of studies have found opposite to be true in areas where fire has been excluded for many years populations have declined substantially an investigation into defoliation and premature death of trees on isthmus in south victoria reached tentative conclusion that absence of fire had created unhealthy surface soil conditions on mornington peninsula surveys of an area that had not been burnt since 1890s found that b integrifolia densities fell by 77 between 1977 and 2000 a subsequent study found decline to have been caused by extremely high seedling mortality rates due to grazing by herbivores and intense competition for soil moisture during summer despite acknowledging that role of fire in these systems remains unclear it concluded that developing fire and or grazing management regimes will be necessary to conserve structural integrity of these coastal ecosystems these concerns aside b integrifolia does not appear to be under threat it has excellent resistance to phytophthora cinnamomi dieback which poses a major threat to many other banksia species and its wide distribution protects against threat of habitat loss due to land clearing as a result it does not appear on list of threatened flora of australia under environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 cultivation thumb right b roller coaster sylvan grove gardens picnic point new south wales hardy and versatile b integrifolia will grow in clay sand acid and even alkaline soils and it shows good resistance to wind and salt making it suitable for seaside planting it is therefore highly regarded as a low maintenance garden tree although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens its hardiness may however forewarn weed potential as some evidence of has been seen in western australia and new zealand when growing near bushland within its native habitat it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available most common form available in commercial nurseries is unimproved banksia integrifolia subsp integrifolia it prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts and tolerates fairly heavy pruning seeds do not require any treatment and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate flowering begins at around four to six years from seed other subspecies are less well known in cultivation but are obtainable cultivation is presumably similar to b integrifolia subsp integrifolia except that b integrifolia subsp monticola may be assumed frost tolerant dwarf forms of b integrifolia are sometimes sold and a registered prostrate cultivar banksia roller coaster is available latter is a vigorous ground hugging plant that can spread to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high because of its high resistance to p cinnamomi dieback feasibility of using b integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible banksia species in cut flower trade is under investigation presently success rate for grafting is only 30 40 and even with successful grafts there is a tendency for union to fail under stress more research is needed before technique will be ready for commercial use other uses thumb left b integrifolia subsp compar wood of b integrifolia is pink to red with inconspicuous rings and conspicuous rays it is spongy and porous with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre 33 lb ft3 it is considered highly decorative but it warps badly on drying has poor load bearing qualities and is susceptible to termite attack it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes it is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental turnery and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees it is a useful firewood b integrifolia produces a dark amber coloured honey of middling quality and therefore low commercial value despite this species is highly valued by beekeepers because it produces large amounts of pollen and nectar during autumn and winter thus helping support hives at a time when little else is flowering historically indigenous australians obtained nectar from b integrifolia by stroking flower spikes then licking their hands or by flower spikes in a coolamon overnight they also used flower spikes as early settlers used nectar as a syrup for sore throats and colds and bushmen would impregnate barren cones with fat to make a slow burning candle more recently b integrifolia has been used in art of bonsai its rangy habit and long are challenging to overcome but leaves do reduce with pruning and unlike gnarlier b serrata saw banksia its trunk can become textured with age it is used as a floral emblem by two local government areas of queensland city of redcliffe and city of logan in 2000 it was featured on an australian postage stamp references external links integrifolia category
