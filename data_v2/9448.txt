both versions received grammy hall of fame awards song has a bright expansive melody and has become famous for its surrealistic imagery influenced by artists as diverse as french poet arthur rimbaud and italian filmmaker federico fellini lyrics call on title character to play a song and narrator will follow interpretations of lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as lsd a call to singer s muse a reflection of audience s demands on singer and religious interpretations composition mr tambourine man was written and composed in early 1964 at same approximate time as chimes of freedom which dylan recorded later that spring for his album another side of bob dylan dylan began writing and composing mr tambourine man in february 1964 after attending mardi gras in new orleans during a cross country road trip with several friends and completed it sometime between middle of march and late april of that year after he had returned to new york nigel williamson has suggested in rough guide to bob dylan that influence of mardi gras can be heard in swirling and fanciful imagery of song s lyrics journalist al aronowitz has claimed that dylan completed song at his home but folk singer judy collins who later recorded song has stated that dylan completed song at her home dylan premiered song following month at a may 17 concert at london s royal festival hall recording during sessions for another side of bob dylan in june 1964 with tom wilson producing dylan recorded mr tambourine man with ramblin jack elliott singing harmony as elliott was slightly off key that recording wasn t used later that month he recorded a publisher demo of song at witmark music more than six months passed before dylan re recorded song again with wilson in producer s chair during final bringing it all back home session on january 15 1965 same day that gates of eden it s alright ma i m only bleeding and it s all over now baby blue were recorded it was long thought that four songs were each recorded in one long take however in biography bob dylan behind shades clinton heylin relates that song required six attempts possibly because of difficulties in working out playoffs between dylan s acoustic guitar and bruce langhorne s electric lead final take was selected for album which was released on march 22 1965 in his book keys to rain definitive bob dylan encyclopedia oliver trager describes mr tambourine man as having a bright expansive melody with langhorne s electric guitar accompaniment which provides a to vocals being only instrumentation besides dylan s acoustic guitar and harmonica author wilfred has written that although song is in key of d major it is harmonized as if it were in a lydian g major giving song a tonal ambiguity that enhances dreamy quality of melody unusually rather than beginning with first verse song begins with an iteration of chorus hey mr tambourine man play a song for me i m not sleepy and there is no place i m going to hey mr tambourine man play a song for me in jingle jangle morning i ll come following you interpretations william ruhlmann writing for allmusic web site has suggested following outline of song s lyrics time seems to be early morning following a night when narrator has not slept still unable to sleep though amazed by his weariness he is available and open to mr tambourine man s song and says he will follow him in course of four verses studded with internal rhymes he expounds on this situation his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery though desire to be freed by tambourine man s song remains clear while there has been speculation that song is about drugs particularly with lines such as take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship and smoke rings of my mind dylan has denied song is about drugs though he was smoking marijuana at time song was written dylan was not introduced to lsd until a few months later outside of drug speculation song has been interpreted as a call to singer s spirit or muse or as a search for transcendence in particular biographer john hinchey has suggested in his book like a complete unknown that singer is praying to his muse for inspiration hinchey notes that ironically song itself is evidence muse has already provided sought after inspiration figure of mr tambourine man has sometimes been interpreted as a symbol for jesus or pied piper of hamelin song may also reference gospel music themes with mr tambourine man being bringer of religious salvation dylan has cited influence of federico fellini s movie la strada on song while other commentators have found echoes of poetry of arthur rimbaud tamarin jean bringing it all back home in author howard sounes has identified lyrics in jingle jangle morning i ll come following you as having been taken from a lord buckley

thumb byrds performing mr tambourine man on ed sullivan show december 12 1965 mr tambourine man was debut single by american band byrds and was released on april 12 1965 by columbia records song was also title track of band s debut album mr tambourine man which was released on june 21 1965 byrds version is abridged and in a different key from dylan s original single s success initiated folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966 with a number of american and british acts imitating band s hybrid of a rock beat jangly guitar playing and poetic or socially conscious lyrics single was first folk rock smash hit and gave rise to term folk rock in u s music press to describe band s sound this hybrid had its antecedents in american folk revival of early 1960s animals s rock oriented recording of folk song house of rising sun folk influences present in songwriting of beatles and twelve string guitar jangle of searchers and beatles s george harrison however success of byrds debut created a template for folk rock that proved successful for many acts during mid 1960s conception most of members of byrds had a background in folk music since jim mcguinn gene clark and david crosby had all worked as folk singers during early 1960s they had all spent time independently of each other in various folk groups including new christy minstrels chad mitchell trio and les baxter s balladeers in early 1964 mcguinn clark and crosby formed jet set and started developing a fusion of folk based lyrics and melodies with arrangements in style of beatles in august 1964 band s manager jim dickson acquired an acetate disc of mr tambourine man from dylan s publisher featuring a performance by dylan and ramblin jack elliott although band members were initially unimpressed with song they eventually agreed to begin rehearsing and demoing it in an attempt to make it sound more like beatles band and dickson elected to give song a full electric rock band treatment effectively creating musical subgenre of folk rock to further bolster group s confidence in song dickson invited dylan to hear band s rendition dylan was impressed enthusiastically commenting wow you can dance to that his endorsement erased any lingering doubts band had about song during this period drummer michael clarke and bass player chris hillman joined and band changed their name to byrds over thanksgiving 1964 band biographer johnny rogan has remarked that two surviving demos of mr tambourine man dating from this period feature an incongruous marching band drum part from clarke but overall arrangement which utilized a 4 4 time signature instead of dylan s 2 4 configuration is very close to later single version production master take of mr tambourine man was recorded on january 20 1965 at columbia studios in hollywood prior to release of dylan s own version song s jangling melodic guitar playing performed by mcguinn on a 12 string rickenbacker guitar was immediately influential and has remained so to present day group s complex harmony work as featured on mr tambourine man became another major characteristic of their sound due to producer terry melcher s initial lack of confidence in byrds musicianship mcguinn was only byrd to play on both mr tambourine man and its b side i knew i d want you rather than using band members melcher hired wrecking crew a collection of top l a session musicians listed here who with mcguinn on guitar provided backing track over which mcguinn crosby and clark sang by time that sessions for their debut album began in march 1965 melcher was satisfied that band was competent enough to record its own musical backing much of track s arrangement and final mixdown was modeled after brian wilson s production work for beach boys don t worry baby byrds recording of song opens with a distinctive bach inspired guitar introduction played by mcguinn and then like dylan s version goes into song s chorus although dylan s version contains four verses byrds only perform song s second verse and two repeats of chorus followed by a variation on song s introduction which then fades out byrds arrangement of song had been shortened during band s rehearsals at suggestion of jim dickson in order to accommodate commercial radio stations which were reluctant to play songs that were over two and a half minutes long as a result while dylan s version is five and a half minutes long byrds version runs just short of two and a half minutes lead vocal on byrds recording of mr tambourine man was sung by mcguinn who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in popular music scene of day somewhere between vocal sound of john lennon and bob dylan song also took on a spiritual aspect for mcguinn during recording sessions as he told rogan in 1997 i was singing to god and i was saying that god was tambourine man and i was saying to him hey god take me for a trip and i ll follow you it was a prayer of submission reception single reached number 1 on billboard hot 100 and number 1 on uk singles chart making it first recording of a dylan song to reach number 1 on any pop music chart shumway david r bob dylan as a cultural icon in critic william ruhlmann has argued that in wake of mr tambourine man influence of byrds could be heard in recordings by a number of other los angeles based acts including turtles leaves barry mcguire and sonny cher in addition author and music historian richie unterberger sees influence of byrds in recordings by lovin spoonful mamas papas simon garfunkel and love while author john einarson has said that both grass roots and we five enjoyed commercial success by emulating byrds folk rock sound unterberger also feels that by late 1965 beatles were assimilating sound of byrds into their rubber soul album most notably on songs nowhere man and if i needed someone as 1960s came to a close folk rock changed and evolved away from jangly template pioneered by byrds but unterberger argues band s influence could still be heard in music of fairport convention since 1960s byrds jangly folk rock sound has continued to influence popular music with authors such as chris smith johnny rogan and mark deming noting band s influence on various acts including big star tom petty and heartbreakers r e m long ryders smiths bangles stone roses teenage fanclub and la s in addition to appearing on byrds debut album mr
