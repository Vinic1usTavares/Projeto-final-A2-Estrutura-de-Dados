for a walk enemies from super mario bros such as goombas and piranha plants also appear in underground side scrolling sections link may land on top of them much as with super mario bros or he can attack them in usual way two methods yield different bonuses director takashi tezuka said that game s freewheeling development made link s awakening seem like a parody of legend of zelda series certain characters in game break fourth wall for example little children inform player of game mechanics such as saving but admit that they do not understand advice they are giving plot after events of a link to past hero link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats a storm destroys his boat at sea and he washes ashore on koholint island where he is taken to house of tarin by his daughter marin she is fascinated by link and outside world and tells link that if she were a seagull she would leave and travel across sea after link recovers his sword a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake wind fish koholint s guardian in order to return home wind fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of mt tamaranch and can only be awakened by eight instruments of sirens link proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover eight instruments during his search for sixth instrument link goes to ancient ruins there he finds a mural that details reality of island that it is merely a dream world created by wind fish after this revelation owl tells link that this is only a rumor and only wind fish knows for certain whether it is true throughout koholint island nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct link s quest for instruments as they wish to rule wind fish s dreamworld after collecting all eight instruments from eight dungeons across koholint link climbs to top of mt tamaranch and plays ballad of wind fish this breaks open egg in which wind fish sleeps link enters and confronts last evil being a nightmare that takes form of ganon and other enemies from link s past its final transformation is dethi a dual tentacled shadow after link defeats dethi owl reveals itself to be wind fish s spirit and wind fish confirms that koholint is all his dream when link plays ballad of wind fish again he and wind fish awaken koholint island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear link finds himself lying on his ship s driftwood in middle of ocean with wind fish flying overhead if player did not lose any lives during game marin is shown flying after ending credits finish development link s awakening began as an unsanctioned side project programmer kazuaki morita created a zelda like game with one of first game boy development kits and used it to experiment with platform s capabilities other staff members of nintendo entertainment analysis development division joined him after hours and worked on game in what seemed to them like an afterschool club results of these experiments with game boy started to look promising following 1991 release of super nes video game legend of zelda a link to past director takashi tezuka asked for permission to develop a handheld zelda title he intended it to be a port of a link to past but it evolved into an original game majority of team that had created a link to past was reassembled to advance this new project altogether it took them one and a half years to develop link s awakening thumb upright designer yoshiaki koizumi was in charge of game s story and conceived major plot points such as dream world island setting alt a long haired man wearing a coat and a striped shirt tezuka recalled that early free form development of link s awakening resulted in game s unrestrained contents such as unauthorized cameo appearances of characters from mario and kirby series a link to past script writer kensuke tanabe joined team early on and came up with basis of story tezuka sought to make link s awakening a spin off and gave tanabe instructions to omit common series elements such as princess zelda triforce relic and setting hyrule as a consequence tanabe proposed his game world idea of an island with an egg on top of a mountain tezuka recalled that it felt as though they were making a parody of legend of zelda rather than an actual zelda game later on yoshiaki koizumi who had previously helped with plot of a link to past was brought into team koizumi was responsible for main story of link s awakening provided idea of island in a dream and conceived interactions with villagers link s awakening was described by series producer eiji aonuma as first zelda game with a proper plot which he attributed to koizumi s romanticism tezuka intended game s world to have a similar feeling to american television series twin peaks which like link s awakening features characters in a small town he suggested that characters of link s awakening be written as suspicious types akin to those in twin peaks a theme which carried over into later zelda titles tanabe created these odd characters he was placed in charge of of story and wrote almost all of character dialog with exception of owl s and wind fish s lines tanabe implemented a previous idea of world ending when a massive egg breaks on top of a mountain this idea was originally meant for a link to past tanabe really wanted to see this idea in a game and was able to implement it in link s awakening as basic concept masanao arimoto and shigefumi hino designed game s characters while yoichi served as illustrator save for opening and ending all pictures in game were drawn by arimoto yamamura designed dungeons which included conception of rooms and routes as well as placement of enemies shigeru miyamoto who served as producer of link s awakening did not provide creative input to staff members however he participated as game tester and his opinions greatly influenced latter half of development music for link s awakening was composed by minako hamano and kozue ishikawa for whom it was their first game project kazumi totaka was responsible for sound programming and all sound effects as with most zelda games link s awakening includes a variation of recurring overworld music staff credits theme yume o miru shima e was later arranged for orchestra by yuka tsujiyoko and performed at orchestral game music concert 3 in 1993 super smash bros brawl includes a remix of game s tal tal heights theme in an interview about evolution of zelda series aonuma called link s awakening quintessential isometric zelda game at another time he stated that had game not come after a link to past ocarina of time would have been very different tezuka stated that he prefers game over a link to past as he enjoyed challenge of making a similar game on lower hardware several elements from link s awakening were re used in later zelda titles for example programmer morita created a fishing minigame that reappeared in ocarina of time among others tanabe implemented a trading sequence tezuka compared it to japanese straw millionaire folktale in which someone trades up from a piece of straw to something of greater value this concept also appeared in most sequels release thumb upright game boy printer accessory
