consisted almost entirely of serbs partisans were led by general secretary of communist party of yugoslavia josip broz tito while chetniks were led by colonel draza mihailovic an officer in interwar royal yugoslav army two movements had widely diverging goals whereas partisans sought to turn yugoslavia into a communist state under tito s leadership chetniks sought a return to pre war status quo whereby yugoslav monarchy and by extension serb political hegemony would be restored joining chetniks following invasion popovac joined a serb rebel band subsequently swearing allegiance to chetniks according to historian h james popovac hoped to achieve independence for bosnia and herzegovina through his cooperation with chetniks he quickly became one of most prominent pro chetnik muslims alongside mustafa pasic and former sarajevo police chief fuad musakadic such affiliation was rare as chetniks increasingly considered muslims their enemies and began committing atrocities against muslim civilians in late spring of 1941 due to these actions and due to muslims especially those in eastern bosnia being branded by chetniks as turks and ustase cronies chetniks found few muslim recruits on 21 july 1942 popovac wrote a letter to mihailovic extolling merits of recruiting muslims into chetniks ranks muslims have never as a whole or via any kind of qualified forum recognized croatian state popovac wrote he proposed that muslim troops be gathered in either a joint or a specific chetnik detachment popovac suggested that mihailovic should adopt a prominent muslim who has a good voice and political roots among people and give him an appropriate rank as muslim representative and advisor on all questions that relate to areas in which muslims live this proposal was met with support from pro serb anti communist muslim leaders in several towns muslim people s military organization thumb right 220px in october 1942 popovac visited prozor to discourage further bloodshed following a chetnik massacre of muslim and croat civilians in late september or early october 1942 popovac met with chetnik leaders dobroslav jevdevic and petar bacovic three agreed to form a muslim chetnik militia in october popovac enlisted italian aid in fighting partisans popovac s muslim chetniks were soon legalized by italians and listed as part of their anti communist volunteer militia popovac and pasic became political leaders of muslim chetniks whose militia was formally called muslim people s military organization mnvo musakadic was appointed military leader of all muslim chetniks another muslim mustafa mulalic became vice chairman of chetnik s central national committee creation of mnvo complied with chetniks strategy of turning croats and muslims of eastern herzegovina against one another according to marko attila hoare a historian specializing in balkans mnvo was part of a greater muslim movement in september 1942 an assembly of herzegovinian muslim notables in mostar declared we and bosnians are nobody s property and we recognize right of nobody to persecute us so insofar as our brothers in zagreb do not wish to accede to our demands we shall seek protection of our interests from other big powers from ranks of our allies vladimir zecevic one of mihailovic s main agents in herzegovina believed that popovac s main goal was to protect muslims rather than to struggle for serb nation and serb affairs popovac s close connections with muslim chetnik leader one of authors of muslim memorandum to adolf hitler in december 1942 appear to support this assertion in october 1942 popovac issued an appeal to muslim partisans urging them to join chetniks and turn against ustase in a report to mihailovic dated 3 november popovac wrote i have to emphasize to you intimate cooperation between muslims and orthodox in stolac district from where through joint struggle of muslims and orthodox croat inhabitants who were largely ustasa inclined have been expelled in that way from to mostar entire left bank of neretva has been cleansed and number of refugees has been estimated at 12 000 people it was reported that popovac had won majority of muslims to his purpose in mostar konjic nevesinje and districts eventually he came to be seen as one of principal representatives of pro chetnik muslim current in bosnia in october 1942 during operation alfa a joint chetnik italian attack against partisans chetniks killed between 543 and 2 500 bosnian muslim and croat civilians in prozor several days later popovac arrived in town to console muslim population and advise chetniks there against committing further atrocities he also attempted to recruit new chetnik fighters from among local muslim population but was unsuccessful due to extent of chetnik atrocities against them on 31 december in face of widespread muslim opposition popovac and his mnvo drafted a resolution vowing allegiance to yugoslavia s exiled king peter and to mihailovic claiming bosnian muslims as an integral part of serbdom and mnvo as part of chetnik movement led by draza mihailovic minister of army navy and air forces in january 1943 popovac led mnvo in an attack which resulted in capture of a communist village predominantly inhabited by muslims that same month chetniks carried out a number of massacre against muslims especially in eastern bosnia in areas of bijeljina srebrenica visegrad foca gorazde and between january and march 1943 popovac s chetniks fought partisans as part of axis led military operation known as case white but did not distinguish themselves during operation itself chetniks committed further atrocities against muslims nonetheless popovac and pasic continued seeking muslim recruits they declared in their address to brethren muslims of and other nearby districts that main goal of chetniks was intelligent and honest protection of muslim interests chetniks they claimed would secure a safe future for our people with highest principles of islam freedom of religion holiness of family respect for private property social justice and democratic political freedom they denied that muslims were collectively responsible
