companion of tulsidas accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them together these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of tulsidas are based incarnation of valmiki he is believed by many to be a rebirth of valmiki in hindu scripture purana god shiva tells his wife

ramayana but valmiki turned down request saying that hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing epic after victory of rama over ravana hanuman went to himalayas to continue his worship of rama there he scripted a play version of ramayana called mahanataka or hanuman nataka engraved on himalayan rocks using his nails when valmiki saw play written by hanuman he anticipated that beauty of mahanataka would eclipse his own ramayana hanuman was saddened at valmiki s state of mind and being a true bhakta without any desire for glory hanuman cast all rocks into ocean some parts of which are believed to be available today as hanuman nataka after this valmiki was instructed by hanuman to take birth as tulsidas and compose ramayana in vernacular early life thumb birthplace tulsidas

seen to be higher than vishnu and not as an avatar of vishnu which is general portrayal of rama prasad 2008 p 875 quoting frank whaling theologically tulasidasa continues process begun in adhyatma ramayana whereby rama is seen to be higher than vishnu we see this in tulasi s stress upon name of rama we see it also in tulasi s assertions that rama is brahman whereas vishnu is not tulasi uses word rama in sense of god usual comparison has been between rama and christ but perhaps an apter comparison is between rama and christian god for in terms of rama is equivalent to god father son and holy spirit singh 2005 p 180 in episode of delusion of sati in ramcharitmanas sati sees many a shiva brahma and vishnu serving rama and bowing at his feet prasad 2008 p 45 ramcharitmanas 1 45 7 8 when

tempting them with a boon but manu and shatarupa do not stop their penance they are finally satisfied only by appearance of rama on whose left side is sita from a part of whom are born countless umas and in episode of marriage of sita and rama in balkand trio of brahma vishnu and shiva is present brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork while vishnu is enchanted with lakhmi on seeing rama prasad 2008 pp 210 212 ramcharitmanas 1 314 8 1 317 3 in sundarkand hanuman tells ravana that brahma vishnu and shiva can create preserve and destroy by might of rama prasad

15 ka as per tulsidas rama is not only an avatar but also source of avatars krishna is also an avatar of rama singh 2008 p 230 tulsiidaas kiyaa gyaa pr hai raam shiv aur krssnn raam avtaar nhiin hain ve bhii hain krssnn raam ke hii avtaar hain ath avtaar liilaa bhii se raam kii hii avtaar liilaa hai thus tulsidas clearly considers rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of vishnu in opinion of urvashi rama of tulsidas is an amalgamation of vishnu who takes avatars vishnu in abode of sagara brahman and para manifestation of pancharatra macfie concludes that tulsidas makes a double claim i e rama is an incarnation of both vishnu and brahman macfie 2004 p 93 poet s claim is that he is not only an incarnation of vishnu second member of triad but of brahm uncreated invisible all pervading brahm supreme spirit of universe who has taken on himself a visible form macfie 2004 chapter ix rama incarnation of vishnu and of brahm supreme god pp 93 160 in words of lutgendorf tulsidas rama is at

vedanta prasad 2008 p 533 rambhadracharya 2008 p 660 as per tulsidas rama is efficient and material cause and of world which is real since rama is real singh 2008 pp 272 273 in several verses of ramcharitmanas tulsidas says that animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of rama and universe is cosmic form of rama authors interpret these verses to mean that world is real according to tulsidas in keeping with vishishtadvaita philosophy of ramanuja shukla 2002 pp 50 51 prasad 2008 pp 510 588 589 rambhadracharya 2008 p 632 633 728 729 however at some places in ramcharitmanas and kavitavali tulsidas compares world to a night or a dream and says it is mithya false or unreal some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in tulsidas opinion world is unreal as per doctrine of adi shankara while some others interpret them to mean that world is transient yet real as per doctrine of ramananda prasad 2008 pp 82 307 500 rambhadracharya 2008 pp 101 377 378 621 uday bhanu singh concludes that in tulsidas view world is essentially form of rama and appears to be different from rama due to maya its visible form is transient which is what tulsidas means by mithya in vinayapatrika tulsidas says that world in itself is neither true satya nor false nor both true and false together one who casts aside all these three illusions knows oneself this has been interpreted to mean that as per tulsidas entire world is a lila of rama poddar 1997 pp 144 145 stanza 111 at beginning of ramcharitmanas tulsidas performs vandana obeisance to all beings in which he bows down to world also saying it is pervaded by or born out of sita and rama lutgendorf 1991 p xi prasad 2008 p 8 rambhadracharya 2008 p 12 as per some verses in ramcharitmanas and vinaypatrika when a jiva living being knows self maya and rama it sees world as being pervaded by rama in balkand episode of marriage of princes of ayodhya with princesses of mithila tulsidas presents a metaphor in which four brides are compared with four states of consciousness waking state sleep with dreams swapna dreamless sleep and fourth self conscious state turiya four grooms are compared with presiding divinity of four states vishva taijasa prajna and brahman tulsidas says as four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in mind of a jiva so four brides with their grooms are resplendent in same pavilion prasad 2008 p 221 rambhadracharya 2008 p 275 tulsidas identifies maya with sita inseparable energy of rama which takes avatar along with rama singh 2008 p 272 in his view maya is of two types vidya and avidya vidya maya is cause of creation and liberation of jiva avidya maya is cause of illusion and bondage of jiva entire world is under control of maya maya is essentially same but two divisions are made for cognitive purposes this view of tulsidas is in accordance with vaishnava teachers of vedanta views on other hindu deities as per tulsidas there is no incompatibility between devotion to rama and attachment to shiva prasad 2008 p 579 ramcharitmanas 6 2 those who are devoted to shankara and are hostile to me and those who are opposed to shiva but would fain be my servants shall have their abode in deepest hell for a full aeon lutgendorf 1991 p 48 i have noted that a major theme of tulsi s epic is compatibility of worship of ram vishnu with that of shiva tulsidas equates guru as an incarnation of shiva prasad 2008 p 1 and a considerable part of balkand of ramcharitmanas is devoted to narrative of shiva including abandonment of sati penance of parvati burning of kamadeva and marriage of parvati and shiva prasad 2008 pp 40 77 ramcharitmanas 1 48 1 104 in addition tulsidas venerates whole hindu pantheon ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of ganesh sarasvati parvati shiva guru valmiki and hanuman at beginning of vinayapatrika he bows to ganesh surya shiva devi ganga yamuna varanasi and chitrakoot asking them for devotion towards rama poddar 1997
