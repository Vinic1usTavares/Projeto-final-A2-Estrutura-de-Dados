2016 photograph of kotaro uchikoshi game was directed by takumi nakazawa while kotaro uchikoshi was in charge of scenario writing and hidari designed characters game was originally conceived by nakazawa in may 2002 at end of development of ever 17 out of infinity he planned plot together with uchikoshi in january 2003 first game in infinity series never 7 end of infinity had a focus on dating with light science fiction elements but as science fiction elements were positively received by reviewers series gradually moved away from dating aspects with remember 11 focus was entirely on science fiction with no dating elements at all like other entries in series game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations several characters in game were based on jungian archetypes cocoro and satoru represent anima and animus respectively mayuzumi represents persona yomogi represents wise old man utsumi represents great mother inubushi represents shadow and yuni represents trickster at first game was titled parasite and was meant to be unrelated to infinity series but when development began in may 2003 it was codenamed project infinity 3 in september of same year they added subtitle age of infinity development was troubled by creative differences between nakazawa and uchikoshi nakazawa was unhappy with uchikoshi s idea for game s ending and had a different ending in mind which they were having disagreements over they also did not have time to write everything that they had wanted so they ended up with an ending that uchikoshi described as only being half finished at time of game s release a sequel was planned which would have included a conclusion to game s story in 2013 uchikoshi looked back on game saying that while he would have liked to rewrite some portions of scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance story much he would not have changed or added anything in terms of content of game he felt that his ending was still in story and still felt happy with it game s soundtrack was composed by takeshi abo and features geometric music because of game s theoretical and science fiction elements prior to composing music he read through game s story to understand setting and each character s personality as much as possible he would write his impressions of plot with a focus on emotional flow and events that occur throughout story he valued his first impressions as very important for this according to abo this method takes longer time but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to game s world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of game because he enjoyed story music strongly reflects abo s own musical tastes opening and ending themes titled little prophet and darkness of chaos were composed by chiyomaru shikura opening was performed by kaori playstation portable version features new opening and ending themes performed by ui miyazaki they are titled no stencil and knife respectively release remember 11 was originally released for playstation 2 on march 18 2004 in both a standard and a limited edition latter included a booklet with material related

shortcuts and said that game has enough to pull player in until end neal chandran at rpgfan said that infinity series had become more and more interesting with each game he called character designs excellent and distinct from those in previous games in series he found it interesting that character designs in previous games which took place in watery settings had brighter and less earthy colors while remember 11 which takes place in mountains makes more use of earthy colors chandran also liked game s soundtrack calling it abo s best work to date he said that it is unmistakably work of abo but improved over his previous soundtracks and having enough layers of experimentation to showcase musical growth for it to not feel formulaic or like a rehash he felt that change in series setting was also reflected in music with music s rhythm section being more noticeable and making music feel more grounded and with more use of earthy sonic textures compared to previous infinity soundtracks
