in london we would probably have a drink together three of us or you know when we re in los angeles he will come to our gig originally song s chorus was set in stone but chemical brothers asked burgess to sing it and write some additional lyrics they also wanted him to sing vocals at end of track lyrics like i m a hustler i m a tiger in same vocal style he used earlier in his career which burgess himself described as weedy and soft duo said that resulting vocal sounds very different from one on their previous collaboration guardians alexis petridis described it as having a standard issue mid accent astralwerks released a statement describing song as a combination of duo s signature psychedelic pop sound and modern stabs its production was built on a ramshackle slightly off tempo

chapter one 2006 this remix received much praise from critics with billboards kerri mason singling it out as soundtrack to a 20 something hipster walking downtown streets ipod in pocket that also sounds like a paradise garage era peter brown record tim finney from pitchfork highly praised remix as synth laden balearic house number that shimmers with unabashed gorgeousness along with another lengthy song on album remix for hot chips just like we breakdown both were said in a review by zeth lundy of popmatters to unfold with a delicate subtext manufactured by slow building minimalism they re patient dedications to mutability of groove never boring and always fascinating to experience musicomhs tom woods said that a wealth of percussive techniques keeps things fresh and interesting but criticised its length which made song become a stretch he added that vocal use is less dominant here which gives murphy a chance to demonstrate a clear talent for sculpting dynamic synth led beats reception critical reception thumb upright burgess performance received mixed reactions from music critics in a review for popmatters music critic tim o neil called song an odd track that sounded like nothing he d heard before he continued i wouldn t be surprised if it was next single after galvanize because its sic not kind of track you forget john bush of allmusic listed track as one of his albums track picks while michaelangelo matos of spin called it one of album s best moments one that was less about successive climaxes than steady state flow jack smith of bbc music described song as cutting edge and hook laden also highlighted it as a welcome return for burgess however guardians review by alexis petridis was very negative she criticised burgess vocal styling as awful falsetto saying that not even a mass of special effects can stop burgess shortcomings shining through and calling track one of album s new ideas that flop ped similarly matt d cruz of drowned in sound also criticised burgess strained vocal calling it a poor fit for stuttering rave pianos and ponderous beats scott plagenhoef of pitchfork media remarked on unremarkable verses and nasally vocals although song along with galvanize reminded him of duo s early b boy techno days he felt both songs were missing ferocity and sub bass of their earlier cousins latter song was also said by plagenhoef to be far better another negative review came from slant magazine where journalist eric henderson called track one of album s unsuccessful interpolations of uk grime chart performance in united kingdom duo s home country song entered uk singles chart at its peak number 41 in week ending 23 july 2005 it was their first single not to chart in top 40 it dropped to number 65 in its second week and moved to

stay on spanish albums chart at number 17 in week of 31 july and at number 15 on billboards us hot dance singles sales chart in 30 july issue music video thumb left video was filmed in budapest hungary over several days london based director duo ne o jake knight and ryoko tanaka directed music video for boxer click about ne o on site they were on holiday in hong kong and were sent a track with drm which knight said made it frustrating to play through dial up connection tanaka eventually came up with idea of a ball that connected through things knight did not quite understand idea at first but through a process of miscommunication they wrote video s treatment about a crazy basketball which was quickest treatment they had ever written at time video was then filmed in budapest hungary over several days knight said reason for location stems from music in actual video ball needs to bounce synchronized with 16th or 8th beat in track to do that we needed a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around a roof low to floor but with uprights obviously parking lots are ideal but it was a technical reason that made us go with it ne o used an arri super 16mm film camera to shoot film then edited it in adobe premiere pro with 3d animation using autodesk softimage writing in his book reinventing music video next generation directors their inspiration and work british author director matt hanson claimed some might call video duo s first action sequence and stated it could be considered a high octane version of albert short film red balloon he wrote while short was a poetic 1956 study of a boy befriended by a balloon here action is reversed and revved up with basketball defiantly trying to bounce away from city street kid video opens with a boy with a basketball in his bag walking out of a car park basketball then begins to bounce out of bag jumps out of city streets and gets into a lada taxi after that it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office its owner struggles to chase ball but then manages to catch it for a second unfortunately ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by chemical brothers basketball re inflates after accident jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near street swells to an enormous size and explodes later in 2011 chemical brothers and director adam smith credited as flat nose george donated visual of an alternate version of song entitled 50 50 mix in support of 50 50 make or break campaign 50 50 make or break was a fundraising project aimed at raising
