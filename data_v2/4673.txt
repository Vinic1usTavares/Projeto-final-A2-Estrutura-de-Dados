north american aviation xb 70 valkyrie was prototype version of planned b 70 nuclear armed deep penetration strategic bomber for united states air force strategic air command designed in late 1950s by north american aviation naa six engined valkyrie was capable of cruising for thousands of miles at mach 3 while flying at at these speeds it was expected that b 70 would be practically immune to interceptor aircraft only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at time bomber would spend only a brief time over a particular radar station flying out of its range before controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception high speed also made aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high altitude and high speed capacity could not be matched by any contemporary soviet interceptor or fighter aircraft introduction of first soviet surface to air missiles in late 1950s put near invulnerability of b 70 in doubt in response united states air force usaf began flying its missions at low level where missile radar s line of sight was limited by terrain in this low level penetration role b 70 offered little additional performance over b 52 it was meant to replace while being far more expensive with shorter range other alternate missions were proposed but these were of limited scope with advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms during late 1950s manned bombers were increasingly seen as obsolete usaf eventually gave up fighting for its production and b 70 program was canceled in 1961 development was then turned over to a research program to study effects of long duration high speed flight as such two prototype aircraft designated xb 70a were built these aircraft were used for supersonic test flights during 1964 69 in 1966 one prototype crashed after colliding with a smaller aircraft while flying in close formation remaining valkyrie bomber is in national museum of united states air force near dayton ohio development background in an offshoot of boeing s mx 2145 manned boost glide bomber project boeing partnered with rand corporation in january 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft would be needed to deliver various contemporary nuclear weapons under development at time nuclear weapons weighed several tons and need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from continental united states to soviet union demanded large bombers they also concluded that after release of bombs aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape critical blast radius york 1978 p 70 aviation industry had been studying this problem for some time from mid 1940s there was interest in using nuclear powered aircraft in bomber role von karman theodore where we stand first report to general of army h h arnold on

by a reactor whose consumables last for months instead of hours most designs also carried a small amount of jet fuel for use during high power portions of flight such as takeoffs and high speed dashes

that original proposals were being studied advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight replacing earlier designs like swept wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like lockheed f 104 starfighter and earlier ws 110 concepts engines able to cope with higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under development allowing for sustained supersonic speeds this work led to an interesting discovery when an engine was optimized specifically for high speed it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds however aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast thus its most economical cruise speed in terms of fuel per mile was its maximum speed this was entirely unexpected and implied that there was no point in dash concept if aircraft was able to reach mach 3 it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible but by march 1957 engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest that it was ws 110 was redesigned to fly at mach 3 for entire mission zip fuel was retained for engine s afterburner to increase range jenkins and landis 2002 pp 14 15 conway 2005 p 33 both north american and boeing returned new designs with

podded engines located individually on pylons below wing like hustler thumb upright 1 25 naa s final ws 110a proposal built as xb 70 north american scoured available literature to find any additional advantage this led them to an obscure report by two naca wind tunnel experts who wrote a report in 1956 titled aircraft configurations developing high lift drag ratios at high supersonic speeds rees 1960 p 126 known today as compression lift idea was to use shock wave generated off nose or other sharp points on aircraft as a source of high pressure air pace 1988 p 16 by carefully positioning wing in relation to shock shock s high pressure could be captured on bottom of wing and generate additional lift to take maximum advantage of this effect they redesigned underside of aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of engines better positioning shock in relation to wing formerly individually podded engines were repositioned in a single large duct under fuselage winchester 2005 p 187 north american improved on basic concept by adding a set of drooping wing tip panels that were lowered at high speed this helped trap shock wave under wing between downturned wing tips it also added more vertical surface to aircraft to maintain directional stability at high speeds naa s solution had an additional advantage as it decreased surface area of rear of wing when panels were moved into their high speed position this helped offset natural rearward shift of center of pressure or average lift point with increasing speeds under normal conditions this caused an increasing nose down trim which had to be offset by moving control surfaces increasing drag when wing tips were drooped surface area at rear of wings was lessened moving lift forward and reducing trim drag talay

huge planes popular mechanics april 1960 p 86 missile problem b 70 was planned to use a high speed high altitude bombing approach that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher since start of manned bomber use spick 1986 pp 4 5 through that same period only two weapons proved effective against bombers fighter aircraft and anti aircraft artillery aaa flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both higher speeds allowed bomber to fly out of range of weapons more quickly while higher altitudes increased time needed for fighters to climb to bombers and greatly increased size of aaa weapons needed to reach those altitudes as early as 1942 german flak commanders had already concluded that aaa would be essentially useless against jet aircraft and began development of guided missiles to fill this role most forces reached same conclusion soon after with both us and uk starting missile development programs before war ended uk s green mace was one of last attempts to develop a useful high altitude aaa weapon but its development ended in 1957 interceptor aircraft with ever improving performance remained only effective anti bomber weapons by early 1950s and even these were having problems keeping up with latest designs soviet interceptors during late 1950s could not intercept high altitude u 2 reconnaissance aircraft ben rich and leo janos skunk works boston little brown company 1994 despite its relatively low speeds it was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as blip to scan ratio and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with operation and guidance of fighters pedlow and welzenbach 1992 p 9 introduction of first effective anti aircraft missiles by late 1950s changed this picture dramatically jenkins 1999 p 21 missiles could stand ready for immediate launch eliminating operational delays like time needed to get pilot into cockpit of a fighter guidance did not require wide area tracking or calculation of an intercept course a simple comparison of time needed to fly to altitude of target returned required deflection missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low cost development path us was aware of soviet work in field and had reduced expected operational lifetime of u 2 knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved in 1960 a u 2 flown by gary powers was shot down pedlow and welzenbach 1992 p 2 faced with this problem military doctrine had already started shifting away from high altitude supersonic bombing toward low altitude penetration radar is line of sight so aircraft could dramatically shorten detection distances by flying close to earth and hiding behind terrain spick 1986 pp 6 7 missile sites spaced to overlap in range when attacking bombers at high altitudes would leave large gaps between their coverage for bombers flying at lower levels with an appropriate map of missile sites bombers could fly between and around defences additionally early missiles generally flew unguided for a period of time before radar systems were able to track missile and start sending it guidance signals with sa 2 guideline missile this minimum altitude was roughly hannah 2002 p 68 flying below this would make bomber effectively invulnerable to missiles even if they happened to fly into range flying at low level provided protection against fighters as well radars of era did not have ability to look down see look down shoot down if a higher altitude aircraft s radar was aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude reflection of ground would overwhelm signal returned from a target an interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it interceptor could descend to lower altitudes to increase amount of visible sky but doing so would limit its radar range in same way as missile sites as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time soviet union would not introduce an interceptor with look down capability until 1972 with high lark radar in mig 23m and even this model had very limited capability koenig and scofield 1983 p 132 strategic air command found itself in an uncomfortable position bombers had been tuned for efficiency at high speeds and altitudes performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms before b 70 was to replace b 52 in long range role sac had introduced b 58 hustler to replace boeing b 47 stratojet in medium range role hustler was expensive to develop and purchase and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance in comparison to b 47 it was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as much larger and longer ranged b 52 miller 1985 p 69 b 70 designed for even higher speeds altitudes and range than b 58 suffered even more in relative terms at high altitudes b 70 was as much as four times as fast as b 52 but at low altitudes it was limited to only mach 0 95 only modestly faster than b 52 at same altitudes it also had a smaller bombload and shorter range its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover especially on long journey from us to ussr value was limited usaf s doctrine stressed that primary reason for maintaining bomber force in an era of icbms was that bombers could remain in air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack barry john bye bye bomber newsweek 11 december 2009 in this case higher speed would be used for only a short period of time between staging areas and soviet coastline adding to problems zip fuel program was canceled in 1959 after burning fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components although b 70 was intended to use zip only in afterburners and thus avoid this problem enormous cost of zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation this by itself was not a fatal problem however as newly developed high energy fuels like jp 6 were available to make up some of difference most of range lost in change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of two bomb bays with a fuel tank jenkins and landis 2002 pp 25 26 however another problem arose when f 108 program
