fred kraft criticized proposal in july 1953 because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in long term especially around junction with us 80 in grossmont approval for route 94 freeway extended to junction with u s route 80 us 80 by october with grossmont part of route signed as route 67 route 67 freeway was completed in march 1957 from campo road and route 94 to us 80 project was completed for 1 625 000 about in dollars planning and poway extension planning for what would become sr 125 north of i 8 began in 1954 route 282 was defined as a route from brown field through la mesa extending to route 277 in 1959 and in 1961 latter terminus was changed to route 278 california highway commission selected a route for highway in mid 1963 in 1964 state highway renumbering sr 125 was designated as highway from sr 75 near brown field to sr 56 route 198 was renumbered as state route 67 portion south of i 8 was renumbered as sr 125 in early 1964 la mesa city council expressed their preference for route 282 which had been nicknamed ramona freeway to run on routing of fletcher parkway contrary to local businesses that wanted highway to be routed west of parkway a few months later state engineer jacob dekema indicated that there were four routes under consideration for portion from brown field to sweetwater lake and project would not be completed until well after 1972 state had selected a route for that part of highway by june and for routing west of fletcher parkway extending to mission gorge road by july next year california highway commission approved a routing north of mission gorge road into poway and ending at sr 56 in 1970s planning continued for construction of route as well as modifications to existing roadway city of la mesa began discussions regarding adding sr 125 from sr 94 to i 8 into scenic highway system in 1968 county planning commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970 sr 125 was lengthened by legislature to extend to mexican border in 1972 in 1973 then governor ronald reagan vetoed a bill to delete part of sr 125 from state plans over concerns that not enough transportation studies had been done on matter an improved interchange with sr 94 was being planned next year soon after caltrans raised concerns about remainder of sr 125 not being constructed due to objections from community relating to freeway construction in general construction began on sr 94 interchange in october and continued into late 1975 at a cost of 11 million about in dollars parts of interchange with sr 94 were open by july 20 city of chula vista considered sr 125 as possibly having scenic value when constructed and considered asking state to add it to state highway system this influenced a rule that construction projects near possible scenic routes in city had to take natural aesthetics into account la mesa city council asked state to modify interchange with i 8 in july original interchange did not allow for access to sr 125 from i 8 east or to i 8 west from sr 125 in january of following year state assemblyman deddeh proposed legislation to remove southern portion of sr 125 from state highway plans again soon afterward comprehensive planning organization cpo moved to support retaining sr 125 from poway to santee in county transportation plan despite opposition from a county supervisor and mayor of escondido deddeh s bill passed state assembly transportation committee a month later in meeting deddeh noted construction of i 805 to handle traffic demands of region as well as a lack of funding that would result in construction being delayed for at least 20 years despite a petition from mayor of escondido cpo again declined to remove sr 125 from county transportation plan in march new interchange with sr 94 was completed in july 1976 in august california highway commission chc announced that sr 75 south of sr 54 had been removed from state highway plan next year county supervisor a san diego city councilman and mayors of la mesa and national city wrote a letter to then governor jerry brown to ask that this portion of sr 125 and other freeways be constructed there were concerns about types of congestion seen in los angeles coming to san diego due to incomplete freeway system san diego city councilman tom gade wrote a telegram to caltrans director adriana gianturco about possible deletions in response gianturco clarified that plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed and a chc member criticized tone of original telegram calling it intemperate however city of chula vista was opposed to construction at time which was a factor in removal of sr 125 from highway plans in march 1980 cpo approved funding for redesign of interchange with i 8 by early 1980 sr 125 was denoted with signs saying to 94 at grossmont summit plans were to provide access north to fletcher parkway in revamp of interchange on december 30 1980 city of poway included sr 56 in city plan extending east through city to a northern extension of sr 125 by 1981 an environmental impact report had been completed on proposed changes to i 8 intersection and 50 million about in dollars project to add ramps and widen i 8 was awaiting clearance from federal highway administration that year poway removed sr 125 from their city plan leading to a lawsuit from city of san diego in 1983 both cities of san diego and poway supported extension of sr 56 to sr 67 although city of poway wanted route moved and had reservations about freeway ending there next year san diego association of governments sandag suggested routing sr 125 through city of poway rather than terminating route further to south as poway had requested jacob dekema was asked to advise city of poway in dispute following his departure from caltrans district director position construction from sr 52 to sr 54 in 1986 project revamping i 8 interchange was under way at a cost of 80 million about in dollars it would allow for sr 125 to be extended north past i 8 to fletcher parkway that year sr 125 was truncated to begin at sr 905 by legislature as latter was formed as a route from i 5 to border in 1988 work was under way to add lanes to sr 125 from south of lemon avenue to northern terminus at a cost of 17 2 million next year some bonita residents raised objections about proposed extension south of la mesa as they were concerned about additional congestion and urbanization from freeway going through bonita california transportation commission decided to reallocate funding for part of sr 125 from sr 94 to sr 54 they shifted it towards finishing 40th street portion of i 15 a year later city of santee expressed concerns about expanding sr 125 and sr 52 to santee before both those roadways were connected to sr 67 due to increased traffic that would result however caltrans said this was unavoidable due to a lack of funds to make connections right away la mesa residents also expressed concerns about destruction of homes under some of proposals for amaya drive interchange design which city council also endorsed however council approved construction and design of fletcher parkway interchange in january 1991 over those objections further interchange related concerns were raised from lemon grove homeowners next year in august 1993 caltrans agreed to design new freeway to keep it west of sweetwater reservoir which satisfied spring valley while raising concerns from those living in bonita who would be closer to this new routing northern portion of sr 125 would be built in stages at same time as portion south of sr 94 reconstruction of interchange with i 8 was completed in april 1993 construction process began in april 1996 at a cost of 177 million in sales tax revenue first phase of construction of eastern portion of sr 54 freeway corresponded with construction of sr 125 north of jamacha boulevard to sr 94 construction began in 1996 at a cost of

in 1987 in 1990 caltrans proposed building southern portion as a toll road operated by private firms california transportation ventures ctv and both applied for role in september state officials approved this proposal which was expected to cost 400 million in 1991 agreement caltrans agreed not to build more than one high occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on i 805 to reduce competition from sr 125 ctv soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for road including some that caltrans had declined next year while company hoped to start environmental impact study objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from road as well as part of franchise agreement that would allow for company to collect a settlement if sr 905 was constructed with more than six lanes since it would compete with proposed toll road california transportation commission agreed to ensure that southern connection from sr 125 to new toll road would be funded in may 1996 much of routing for sr 125 south of sr 54 was determined in march 1997 and federal highway administration determined san miguel connector routing that would connect new freeway with sr 54 in august selection of route due to concerns over destruction of habitat of least bell s vireo led to objections from county officials due to proximity to homes and passing through bonita golf course and a little league field ctv spent 14 million on improving parks and building little league fields and trails to offset effects of construction of road however construction of both sr 125 and olympic parkway were considered by chula vista officials to be essential for further development for eastern part of that city thumb right quino checkerspot butterfly one of endangered species that was subject of environmental concerns related to tollway construction concerns about destruction of quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by community group preserve south bay that group sued developer as well as caltrans and sandag in august 1999 following latter s approval for project early next year an environmental impact report suggested that bonita might face negative effects from freeway such as noise and having roadway divide community federal highway administration fhwa allowed project that year even though environmental protection agency objected to it a contractor for project was soon retained by california transportation ventures another group citizens for 125 obtained 7 000 signatures in support of road however san diego regional water quality control board withheld its permit approval in december 2000 over concerns that sweetwater reservoir could be polluted in process such an approval was necessary under clean water act in order to get necessary approval from u s army corps of engineers usace suit by preserve south bay was dismissed in march 2001 on grounds that legislature did not need to review annexation of state parkland for highway because it was done under eminent domain in april san diego regional water quality control board approved project on several conditions including monitoring water quality to ensure that sweetwater reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents an appeal to state water resources control board to overturn approval was unsuccessful in july usace approved wetlands permit for southern portion of sr 125 sierra club and san diego national audubon society as well as some other groups sued fhwa usace and u s fish and wildlife service to block construction of toll road over alleged breaches of endangered

construction of sr 125 toll road started in september 2003 it was projected to open in 2006 over next few years 1 5 million cubic meters of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for interchange with sr 54 to be built in 2005 road was given south bay expressway name south bay expressway extended sr 125 southward from sr 54 to otay mesa this toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects including 91 express toll lanes that were approved in 1990 it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources although 91 express lanes other road soon became entirely publicly owned a partnership known as south bay expressway operated road while an australian company group ltd handled financial and construction matters by 2006 contractor had encountered delays due to material and worker shortages initial toll rates were announced in early 2007 with lowest toll set at 75 cents toll road opened on

million of public funding bankruptcy in 2008 30 000 vehicles a day traveled on expressway which fulfilled state expectations however complaints were made about toll machines due to their low height and needing exact amount of toll in late 2009 south bay expressway partnership that operated road questioned value of toll road for property tax purposes saying that it was worth 330 million less than it was originally valued due to low volumes of traffic using road on march 22 2010 toll road s operator filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to economic downturn some drivers chose not to use toll road due to a recent increase in tolls an editorial in san diego union tribune also blamed delay in opening toll road

llc even though a study suggested that agency might have to spend millions of dollars to maintain and repair parts of highway objections raised to purchase during negotiation phase included needing a loan from federal government of 1 5 million to complete purchase and a possible increase in traffic through lemon grove sale of franchise rights until year 2042 was finalized on december 16 2011 at a price of 341 4 million and 10 2 million in additional fees with 254 million from transnet sales tax revenue some of it to be repaid with toll revenue sandag claimed at time that they would reduce tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on i 805 which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route despite this operator decided to increase tolls instead even with low demand for using road san diego union tribune criticized decision in mid 2011 it cost 4 to drive entire toll portion of road due to toll reductions in 2012 that were 25 to 40 percent less than when road was privately owned number of vehicles using toll portion of expressway increased by 19 percent that year as compared to previous year it was estimated that road would be fully paid off in 2042 and there were reports of decreased traffic on chula vista streets and an increase in retail business tolls toll plazas are located along south bay expressway at all northbound
