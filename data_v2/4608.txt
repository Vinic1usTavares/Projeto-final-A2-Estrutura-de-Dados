could be downloaded along with song bu thiam def jam vice president of a r was with west and jay z throughout recording process and saw how duo came up with several of watch throne tracks he recalled story of song otis kanye was late for his flight we were in studio working all day and he was late for his flight as we were leaving he was like yo hold on for a second so he drops his bags and goes to mpc beat machine and his assistant is rushing him and he s just f ing with beat what s so crazy is whole time he s doing that jay is writing his verses in his head but jay is watching nba playoffs i think it was championship miami heat dallas mavericks so jay is watching playoffs i m not even thinking jay is paying attention to what ye is doing and by time he is finished it s like i invented swag and i m like what f just happened http www songfacts com detail php id composition otis is two minutes and fifty eight seconds long and is a mid tempo hip hop song song which was produced by west is built upon a sample of try a little tenderness by otis redding jay z and west promptly rap over sample in style reminiscent to past kanye productions pitchfork s tom breihan summarized composition writing here s jay z on otis intro it sounds so soulful don t you agree well yeah if you re willing to plunk down enough money to sample try a little tenderness that ll happen but even if sample works as a sort of audio money flaunt it s also a tough and hard chop from kanye otis redding s magnificent voice mostly limited to a couple of hellfire grunts song itself held to a sharp guitar stab alexis petridis of guardian stated single otis boldly samples otis redding s try a little tenderness an idea that veers wildly from inspired at one point ballad is manipulated into a propulsive sweaty grunt a thon to a mess song ends with sampled screaming some people believe song also includes a part from datsik s swagga which is a dubstep track part is included when jay z says guess i got my swagga back this is a common misconception jay z is making a reference to one of his earlier songs all i need from blueprint which datsik samples line from to celebrate fifth anniversary of song roc nation executive lenny santiago took to instagram to share how kanye created beat within 20 minutes lenny recalls five years ago today song otis was released it s one of my favorite songs tracks and lyrics from classic album watch throne by jay z kanye west this record stands out to me cause i vividly remember day of its inception we were in mercer hotel nyc where a lot of album was made day or rather session for that day was coming to an end kanye had to catch a flight if i m not mistaken we were almost towards end of album and he was telling everyone in room that as soon as he returns he wanted to fuck with this otis redding sample idea he had as he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight he sort of brushed that off and was like fuck it let me just play y all a piece of song so you could see how dope it is he then approached mpc and keyboard and plays it everyone in room does ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see sickest slam dunk at a contest lol he then begins to chop sample lil by lil but fast and actually starts creating track ye being one of my favorite producers i m literally hype as fuck and in awe i begin to snap canon cam like an uzi lol this is 1 of pictures captured here of course 15 or later before he runs off to catch his flight he creates phenomenal track known to us as otis critical reception song received highly positive reviews from critics and style has been compared to that of west s college dropout album pitchfork media s tom breiham praised song saying jay and kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus each one building on whatever last one said an old school rap style you almost never hear anymore and since these guys are working loose and casual it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance simon vozick levinson of rolling stone gave song a four stars rating out of five wrote that west twists a few seconds of otis redding s try a little tenderness into a blueprint style barrage setting stage for some slick collar popping from jay z photo shoot fresh looking like wealth i m about to call paparazzi on myself jay s performance in turn inspires ye to step up his wordplay luxury rap hermes of verses sophisticated ignorance write my curses in cursive younger star sounds like he pulled an all nighter trying to outdo his mentor s rhymes frank berg of nme gave song a mostly positive review stating that what we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond grave for that reason it s unquestionably an event though feeling in all honesty if this winds up being highlight of watch throne we ll all be a bit disappointed thumb right production style of otis has been compared to west s college dropout seattle weekly s joe williams enjoyed song writing even with slow bubbling beat and energetic keyboards topped with top notch delivery by jay and kay it s redding in background that gives single its true life and flair josiah hughes of exclaim magazine commented that if over top aggression of h a m had you worried that this would be a waka flocka ripoff fear not as otis makes most of its otis redding sample with some soulful feel good boom bap sam gould independent remarked having seen oddball rap collective odd future become talking point of blogosphere eminem and old partner in crime royce da 5 9 start work on their own bruising collaborative effort and hazy vibe rappers wiz khalifa and y take steps in same direction jay and ye have recognised throne is far from unchallenged and have come together in most remarkable dual alliance since andre 3000 and big boi became outkast new york observer writer foster kamer mused remember early kanye these guys finally do otis is perfect anti single for this album because it s a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there not only do they not need hooks neither of them need to remind us that they don t there was that first line of my beautiful dark twisted fantasy i fantasized bout this back in chicago and then relief after it where you didn t have to worry about rest of that album and billboard claimed otis gets better with each play however chicago tribune writer greg kot was less enthusiastic about track musing that references to luxury cars and private jets quickly lose their escapist luster grossly out of step with a summer in which joblessness and foreclosure are becoming all too common for many americans and that just as disappointing is that redding sample a thrilling burst of agitated vocals classic memphis horns organ and drums never goes anywhere in an interview with redding s widow zelma redding us weekly reported that mrs redding approved song saying we are proud that otis legacy continues to inspire some of today s popular artists we like otis and thank kanye and jay z for honoring our otis through their music pitchfork media named song 42nd best song of 2011 xxl
