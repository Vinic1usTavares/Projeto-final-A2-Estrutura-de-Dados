with hogan fell through sam mendes david fincher and darren aronofsky all became interested in taking over director s position fincher and myers were fast tracking production for confessions in april

interest russell crowe kevin spacey and edward norton had also been attached to film in early development stages in december 2000 ben stiller was in discussions to star as chuck barris with bryan

sam rockwell in lead role director cast johnny depp to replace stiller and commenced pre production in january 2001 on a planned 35 million budget renaissance pictures was holding international distribution rights but filmmakers still needed more financing as well as a studio to cover distribution duties in united states grosvenor park was interested in co financing with renaissance but next month february 2001 confessions was once again stalled in development miramax films had been negotiating for domestic rights but difficulties arose when miramax also wanted to cover international rights renaissance was also unable to close financing in time to accommodate both production insurance deadline and 65 day shooting schedule which was set to primarily take place in montreal and british columbia canada artisan entertainment then became interested in covering north american distribution rights but dropped out after bid went over 8 million johnny depp eventually went to work on other films director with singer busy preparing x2 confessions was rejuvenated with clooney taking over as director miramax films agreed to cover distribution duties and co finance film in end funding for confessions came from miramax clooney s own section eight productions village roadshow pictures producer andrew lazar s mad chance allied filmmakers and kushner locke company clooney explained i thought if i came on board as a director for scale and was able to bring everybody else on inexpensively if i could get film back down to 30 million then i was going to be able to get film made that was a big part of my pitch to harvey weinstein at miramax i was upset by fact that clooney took movie from me and then cut me out after that i m unhappy with end result and i m unhappy with george clooney i had a movie that i wrote and that isn t it i ve always been involved in process with spike jonze and michel gondry if there s any rewriting to do i do it but with clooney it was different even end of movie is different i mean clooney went on forever about how my confessions screenplay was one of greatest scripts he d read but if someone truthfully felt that way they d want person who wrote it to be on board offering their thoughts and criticisms but clooney didn t and i think it s a silly way to be a director writer charlie kaufman because confessions was his directing debut clooney took inspiration from friends steven soderbergh and coen brothers for his filmmaking style writer charlie kaufman said he was dissatisfied with way clooney treated screenplay i spent a lot of time working on script he explained but i don t think he was interested in things i was interested in i ve moved on and i don t have any animosity towards clooney but it s a movie i don t really relate to clooney acknowledged that kaufman s original script contained really funky scenes that would never reach green light of being a studio film a drug addiction subplot was removed based on barris s request for historical authenticity clooney was adamant that barris become heavily involved during production in an attempt to portray film from his point of view barris was so enthusiastic with clooney s work on film that he began writing bad grass never dies sequel to confessions miramax also owns film rights to bad grass barris filmed cameo appearances of himself during shoot in canada and taped a voice over in clooney s house when asked about barris s claim of being a cia assassin clooney commented i don t know how much i believed it i didn t want to officially ask him because i didn t want him to say i made it up i wanted to tell story and i thought how interesting if it was all made up why someone as wealthy and as successful as chuck barris would have to do that i thought that was an interesting person to explore and that s what we wanted to do with film barris had already admitted he had made story up in a 1984 interview promoting book he wrote story in large part because he had been exiled from television over controversy surrounding one of his shows 3 s a crowd in same interview barris noted that he had applied for work with cia in early 1960s but never actually entered agency confessions of a dangerous mind was product of barris imagining how he could have done both at same time rip chuck barris in a 1984 interview on nbc s today show he once put rumors to rest no i was never a cia hit man i never did those things i once applied for cia and while i was going through process i got a job and went on television but i had always wondered what would have happened if i had done both clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father nick clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting 1960 70s game shows my father had a game show when i was growing up called money maze i know what those sets look like i showed guy how to do cue cards i grew up on them director reflected and knew what it looked like and smelled like and i know something about some of trappings of fame so i thought i had a unique take on it casting casting lead role of barris was a long difficult process after two months of screen tests and everything i still wasn t able to get sam rockwell clooney reflected rockwell had always been clooney s first choice ever since they worked together on welcome to collinwood 2002 both clooney and barris also believed rockwell shared an uncanny resemblance to barris i didn t want someone too famous to play role director reasoned in my opinion you cannot have famous people playing famous people it doesn t work sam was guy for part ready to break and hadn t yet prior to his audition rockwell immersed himself in role by watching episodes of gong show in an attempt to impress filmmakers i went to la and did an old fashioned screen test like a real scarlett o hara type screen test which you know they don t really do anymore actor remembered for research rockwell spent two and a half months with barris we went to coffee shops and dinner and movies took walks went to zoo i even filmed him rockwell explained i had him tape my lines in a tape recorder and i listened to that to get his voice down clooney cast julia roberts as mysterious cia agent patricia watson due to their positive working relationship in ocean s eleven 2001 her role was originally set for nicole kidman who dropped out over scheduling conflicts with hours after rockwell s casting confessions was once again briefly postponed miramax did not greenlight film until roberts signed on clooney commented julia really helped me her doing part made it possible for me to cast sam rockwell he can t drive a 28 million film but julia certainly can renee zellweger and gwyneth paltrow were considered for penny pacino role which eventually went to drew barrymore miramax was unsure of clooney s decision to cast rockwell over other famous actors such as robert downey jr and ben stiller clooney convinced studio into giving him right of final cut privilege and casting rockwell in exchange for first look deals on full frontal 2002 and other low budget films from clooney s section eight productions clooney also agreed to cameo in miramax s spy kids 2 island of lost dreams 2002 so rockwell could be cast to accommodate 30 million budget clooney convinced roberts and barrymore to lower their asking prices filming under clooney s direction filming was initially set to begin in september 2001 but principal photography did not start until january 14 2002 from january to march 2002 production for confessions of a dangerous mind took place primarily in california and montreal playboy mansion scene was shot in early april at los angeles california remaining two weeks of production took place around mexico united states border filming for confessions ended in late april 2002 clooney and cinematographer newton thomas sigel used various techniques when portraying different decades of barris s life we thought in order to go back in time most people remember things through film clooney reasoned i don t remember 1950s i wasn t around for them i know 50s through technicolor not technicolor as it was shot but technicolor as it has faded now filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on color palette racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in 1960s similar to spaghetti westerns of that era hand held cameras were used for scenes set in 1970s an homage to films of sidney lumet mike nichols and alan j pakula primarily klute 1971 carnal knowledge 1971 and parallax view 1974 bob fosse s all that jazz also influenced clooney s direction clooney commented that post production for confessions was stressful because he was simultaneously acting in solaris 2002 reception release to tie in with release of film miramax books republished barris s 1984 book film premiered out of competition at may 2002 cannes film festival before miramax films gave it a limited release in united states on december 31 2002 wide release came on january 23 2003 film only barely recouped its production costs grossing only 33 01 million of which 16 million was domestic revenue and 17 01 million came from foreign markets it also suffered poor sales in its september 2003 region 1 dvd release dvd includes over 20 minutes of deleted scenes rockwell s three screen tests a short documentary titled real chuck barris clooney s audio commentary and a making of featurette critical response film received positive responses from critics on rotten tomatoes film holds an approval

has a weighted average score of 67 100 based on 33 reviews indicating generally favorable reviews confessions of a dangerous mind was shown at berlin international film festival on february 10 2003 sam rockwell won silver bear for best actor and george clooney was nominated golden bear but lost to michael winterbottom of in this world roger ebert gave confessions a positive review george clooney s directorial debut is not only intriguing as a story but great to look at ebert said a marriage of bright pop images from 1960s and 1970s and dark cold that seem to have wandered in from john le carre peter travers of rolling stone magazine wrote that film carried a perfect balance of dark humor and psychological drama clooney tackles a far reaching absurdist fantasy with barris as a paradigm of paranoia travers reviewed he wisely hooks up with talent he worked with as an actor cinematographer newton thomas sigel from three kings 1999 and editor stephen from ocean s eleven 2001 mick lasalle from san francisco chronicle wrote that there may be more entertaining and less problematic movies but confessions of a dangerous mind has something about it that hangs in there working on mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg movie makes a case for itself through sheer and perversity i m not sure confessions is a good movie but i am sure i like it owen gleiberman writing in entertainment weekly observed that sam rockwell is handsome in a rumpled slightly goofy rabbit toothed way but he doesn t really have look or aura of a movie star stated he s more like a weirdly sincere space cadet babbling to himself with befuddlement breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he s been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8 all of which makes him an inspired choice to play chuck barris kenneth turan of los angeles times gave a negative review he disliked characterization of chuck barris and commented that with its multiplicity of over stylized looks and slick gimmicks dangerous mind was doubtless more stimulating to direct than it will be for audiences to experience internet reviewer james berardinelli wrote a mixed critique george clooney is eager to show how much he has learned at hands of a list filmmakers he has toiled under so we get a style that is about 50 steven soderbergh and 50 coen brothers sometimes it works but mostly it comes across as too artsy with all sorts of bizarre angles and unusual shots references further reading external links confessions of a dangerous mind at internet movie script database category 2002 films
