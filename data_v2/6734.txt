and momentary pauses of thought lines 44 47 narrator believes that his child will experience a better life than his own for i was reared in great city pent mid cloisters dim and saw nought lovely but

crags lines 51 58 poem concluded with a message of hope for narrator s child ashton 1997 p 136 therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee whether summer clothe general earth with greenness or

frost shall hang them up in silent icicles quietly shining to quiet moon lines 65 74 original ending of 1798 version of poem described narrator s child and wife during winter holmes 1989 p 184 or whether secret ministry of cold shall hang them up in silent icicles quietly shining to quiet moon like those my babe which ere tomorrow s warmth have capp d their sharp keen points with pendulous drops will catch thine eye and with their novelty suspend thy little soul then make thee shout and stretch and flutter from thy mother s arms as thou wouldst fly for very eagerness lines 72 78 themes narrator comes to an understanding of nature after being isolated and left to his thoughts nature becomes a comforter but narrator remembers his loneliness during childhood radley 1966 p 54 55 during his final year at christ s hospital coleridge completed a poem he titled on quitting school for college for a school exercise in poem he describes his time at school as a pleasant experience however frost at midnight redefines experience as one that deprived him of countryside ashton 1997 pp 30 31 there is another quality to coleridge s retelling of his childhood experience he adds supernatural descriptions to common scenes of his youth in particular church bells are able to make a promise of a better life holmes 1989 p 8 gothic elements of poem connect it to many of his other works including ancient mariner ballad of dark ladie fears in solitude france an ode nightingale three graves and wanderings of cain ashton 1997 p 124 within poem narrator expresses his hope that his child hartley coleridge will experience a life connected to nature as represented by features typical of lake district which coleridge in common with other lake poets revered this is similar to what coleridge s friend william wordsworth does with narrator of abbey a poem composed later that year many of feelings of narrator for his child are connected to coleridge s sonnet to a friend who asked how i felt when nurse presented my infant to me holmes 1989 p 124 ideas about nature in this lime tree bower are transformed into basis for an education and hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way coleridge s nature has a christian presence and nature is a physical presence of god s word coleridge s understanding of god is neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience divine knowledge holmes 1989 pp 183 184 like many of conversation poems frost at midnight touches on coleridge s idea of one life which connects mankind to nature and to god touching on themes that come up in eolian harp religious musings and other poems poem produces image of a life that narrator s child will experience in countryside boy would become a child of nature and raised free of constraints found in philosophical systems produced by those like william godwin sisman 2006 pp 218 219 sources coleridge draws upon many poems including ideas from william cowper s task ashton 1997 p 134 there is also a possible connection to john thelwall s poem to infant hampden written during a sleepless night derby oct 1797 along with his other poems on leaving bottoms of and maria a fragment other sources are william collins ode on popular superstitions of highlands of scotland mays 2001 pp 452 454 in terms of philosophy coleridge brings together ideas in george berkeley s an essay towards a new theory of vision and david hartley s observations on man jasper 1985 p 81 critical response christopher moody in monthly review of may 1799 declared that original six lines of ending were flat a view that coleridge probably agreed with mays 2001 p 456 during 20th century virginia radley argues although no conversation poem can rightly be said to stand equally with poems of high imagination certainly frost at midnight and this lime tree bower both have within them that quality of heart so essential to these latter poems because of this quality and because of striking effectiveness of their imagery these poems can be said to be true harbingers of coleridge s greatest poems radley 1966 p 56 richard holmes declares that poem is one of most intricately structured of all conversation poems performing a characteristic outward and return movement through time and space this curve of memory and prophesy gives poem a rich emotional resonance sadness poignancy hope joy held in exquisite tension holmes 1989 p 183 rosemary ashton believes that poem is one of coleridge s most delightful conversation poems adam sisman believes that frost at midnight is perhaps most beautiful of
