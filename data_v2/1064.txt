history thumb upright alt a black and white image of a bald man in a dark outfit with a bushy white beard and moustache friedrich august kekule von stradonitz need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by german scientist friedrich august kekule von stradonitz this committee was first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into official iupac nomenclature of organic chemistry iupac stands as a legacy of this meeting making it one of most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies since this time iupac has been official organization held with responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature iupac as such was established in 1919 international union of pure and applied chemistry about iupac retrieved on 2013 07 29 one notable country excluded from this early iupac is germany germany s exclusion was a result of prejudice towards germans by allied powers after world war i germany was finally admitted into iupac during 1929 however nazi germany was removed from iupac during world war ii during world war ii iupac was affiliated with allied powers but had little involvement during war effort itself after war east and west germany were eventually readmitted to iupac since world war ii iupac has been focused on standardizing nomenclature and methods in science without interruption in 2016 iupac denounced use of chlorine as a chemical weapon organization pointed out their concerns in a letter to ahmet director of organisation for prohibition of chemical weapons in regards to practice of utilizing chlorine for weapon usage in syria among other locations letter stated our organizations deplore use of chlorine in this manner indiscriminate attacks possibly carried out by a member state of chemical weapons convention cwc is of concern to chemical scientists

nomenclature iupac committee has a long history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds iupac nomenclature is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names first publication on iupac nomenclature of organic compounds was a guide to iupac nomenclature of organic compounds in 1900 which contained information from international congress of applied chemistry iupac publications list retrieved 15 april 2010 organic nomenclature iupac organic nomenclature has three basic parts substituents carbon chain length and chemical ending substituents are any functional groups attached to main carbon chain main carbon chain is longest possible continuous chain chemical ending denotes what type of molecule it is for example ending ane denotes a single bonded carbon chain as in hexane another example of iupac organic nomenclature is cyclohexanol thumb 150px center cyclohexanol substituent name for a ring compound is cyclo indication substituent name for a six carbon chain is hex chemical ending for a single bonded carbon chain is ane chemical ending for an alcohol is ol two chemical endings are combined for an ending of indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it inorganic nomenclature basic iupac inorganic nomenclature has two main parts cation and anion cation is name for positively charged ion and anion is name for negatively charged ion an example of iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is potassium chlorate thumb 150px center potassium chlorate potassium is cation name chlorate is anion name amino acid and nucleotide base codes iupac also has a system for giving codes to identify amino acids and nucleotide bases iupac needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids this would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find amino acid codes retrieved 15 april 2010 these codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code these codes make it easier and shorter to write down amino acid sequences that make up proteins nucleotide bases are made up of purines adenine and guanine and pyrimidines
