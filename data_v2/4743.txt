o brien class of destroyers was a class of six ships designed by and built for united states navy shortly before united states entered world war i o brien class was third of five classes of destroyers that were known as thousand tonners because they were first u s destroyers over displacement design of what became o brien class was result of discussions between general board of united states navy and u s navy s bureau of ordnance what resulted was a design that was an incremental development of which itself was similar to first of thousand tonners which displaced about a third more than preceding key difference in o brien class was increase in torpedo size going up to from preceding classes torpedoes ships had a median displacement of were just over in length and had a beam of about all of ships had two direct drive steam turbines and a combination of other engines for cruising at speeds less than all of ships were designed for a maximum speed of as built they were armed with four guns and had four twin 21 inch 533 mm torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes but all were later equipped with depth charges ships were built by four private american shipyards bath iron works fore river shipbuilding company new york shipbuilding corporation and william cramp sons and were laid down between september and november 1913 launched between april 1914 and february 1915 and commissioned into u s navy between june 1914 and august 1915 all six ships operated in atlantic or caribbean until u s entrance into world war i in april 1917 when all six were sent overseas to queenstown ireland for convoy escort duties several of ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by u boats and several had encounters with u boats themselves helped sink in november 1917 first u boat sunk by u s navy all six members of class had returned to united states in january 1919 and were decommissioned by june 1922 in 1924 two of six and were commissioned into united states coast guard to help enforce prohibition as a part of rum patrol they were returned to u s navy custody in 1932 and 1933 respectively all six ships had been sold for scrapping by june 1936 background for 1913 fiscal year general board of united states navy determined that six destroyers would be authorized design for destroyers no 51 through no 56 what became o brien class was to closely follow design of and es from fiscal year 1912 chief of u s navy s bureau of ordnance buord suggested that new destroyers be equipped with ten torpedo tubes and urged that new torpedo be adopted general board agreed in principle adopting 21 inch torpedo tubes but eliminated buord s proposed centerline torpedo tubes and keeping number of tubes at eight friedman p 29 same as cassin and aylwin classes bauer and roberts p 170 additional weight of larger torpedoes of top weight was offset by reducing planned two aft facing guns to a single one this gave class four guns which again matched battery of cassin and aylwin classes design for o brien class was approved on 20 august 1912 and authorized by congress on 4 march 1913 design as built o brien class ships were in length overall were abeam and had a standard draft of hull shape featured distinctive high forecastle typical of u s destroyer classes since 1908 09 first destroyers designed to be truly ocean going vessels gardiner p 121 ships displaced between with a median of ships were equipped with two propeller shafts and two direct drive zoelly steam turbines fed by four white forster boilers power plant of ships generated which drive ships to design speed of gardiner p 123 because of inherent inefficiency of turbines at low speeds friedman pp 25 27 while turbines were most efficient at high speeds propellers were most efficient at low speeds turbines directly connected to propeller shafts as was case with main turbines of all o brien ships were particularly inefficient at low speeds see friedman pp 25 27 all of ships were equipped with supplemental cruising engines for travel at speeds under all except were equipped with supplemental triple expansion reciprocating engines and each had a pair of reciprocating engines for cruising and were outfitted with only one instead of reciprocating engines cushing was equipped with a pair of geared steam turbines for cruising main battery of o brien class consisted of four 50 mark 9 guns 50 denotes length of gun barrels in this case gun is 50 calibers meaning that gun is 50 times as long as it is in diameter in this case mark number is version of gun in this case ninth u s navy design of 4 inch 50 gun with each gun weighing in excess of guns fired armor piercing projectiles at at an elevation of 20deg guns had a range of o brien ships were also equipped with four twin torpedo tubes for a total load of eight mark 8 torpedoes although general board had called for two anti aircraft guns for o brien class they were not originally outfitted with weapons later was first american destroyer class so armed likewise there is no record of any of o brien ships being outfitted with mine laying apparatus during world war i most american destroyers were used in anti submarine warfare roles and were equipped with depth charges and delivery systems such as y guns and depth charge racks o brien class ships were equipped with depth charges during war but no specific mentions of types of depth charges used or delivery system are recorded in secondary sources comparisons with other thousand tonners thousand tonners were 26 united states navy destroyers of five classes cassin o brien and sampson so named because they were first u s navy destroyers to have displacements greater than 1 000 long tons is considered a part of by conway s all world s fighting ships 1906 1921 p 122 but is classed separately by united states navy see for example cassin class first of thousand tonners displaced about a third more than preceding introduction of thousand tonners led to and other older smaller displacement destroyers of previous classes to be dismissively called a nickname also commonly applied to ford model t cashman p 278 according to cashman p 278 a flivver a portmanteau of for liver was any small inexpensive automobile that shook liver while in motion thumb left o brien class member between closely related ships left and is moored by destroyer tender at queenstown ireland in 1917 o brien class was third of five classes of thousand tonners earlier cassin dd 43 to dd 46 and aylwin class dd 47 to dd 50 ships were about same length as o brien ships and all had median displacements in range of later tucker dd 57 to dd 62 and sampson class dd 63 to dd 68 ships were about longer and had median displacements of all five classes were armed with four guns but torpedo size and complement varied all were equipped with four twin torpedo tubes loaded with eight torpedoes except for sampsons which had four triple tubes carrying twelve torpedoes but cassin and aylwin classes were armed with torpedoes o brien ships were first armed with new mark 8 torpedoes tucker and sampson ships also used 21 inch torpedoes sampsons were only group originally equipped with anti aircraft guns a pair of guns with a caliber of construction construction of six o brien class ships was allocated to four u s shipbuilders william cramp constructed a trio of o brien destroyers while fore river shipbuilding company bath iron works and new york shipbuilding corporation built one ship each keels for all six ships were laid down between july and november 1913 with

after her launch rest were commissioned between april and august 1915 with final ship to enter service cost of each ship for hull and machinery was 790 000 friedman p 31 hull and machinery cost does not include costs of any weapons ships in class all six members of class served in atlantic or caribbean throughout their u s navy careers naval history heritage command cushing ericsson mcdougal
