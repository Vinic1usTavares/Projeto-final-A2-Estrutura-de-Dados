several battles in new guinea and solomon islands campaigns jun yo was torpedoed in november 1943 and spent three months under repair she was damaged by several bombs during battle of philippine sea in mid 1944 but quickly returned to service lacking aircraft she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in december jun yo was under repair until march 1945 when work was cancelled as uneconomical she was then effectively hulked for rest of war after surrender of japan in september americans also decided that she was not worth cost to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship and she was broken up in 1946 1947 design and description ship was ordered in late 1938 as fast luxury passenger liner kashiwara maru by nippon yusen kaisha japan mail steamship

bombers this was revised to substitute a dozen mitsubishi a6m zero fighters together with 3 more in storage for a5ms by time ship commissioned in 1942 as a result of lessons learned from battle of midway in june ship s fighter complement was strengthened to 21 zeros and other aircraft reduced to 12 d3as and 9 b5ns by end of year 6 more zeros replaced an equal number of d3as although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into hangars 8 or 9 were usually stored on flight deck to reduce cramping below decks lengerer rehm takahara p 111 armor armament and sensors as a conversion from an

six b5ns and six d3as escorted by half a dozen zeros all of these aircraft attacked carrier which had been badly damaged by attacks earlier in day american damage control measures had been partially successful but one torpedo hit by a b5n from shokaku increased her list from 7 5deg to 14 5deg and near misses by dive bombers started enough seams in her plating that her list increased to 18deg
