peppered maskray or speckled maskray neotrygon picta is a species of stingray in family dasyatidae found in shallow waters off northeastern australia this small thin bodied ray attains a maximum width of it has a diamond shaped pectoral fin disc with a row of tiny thorns along midline and a relatively short whip like tail with both upper and lower fin folds its upper surface has a speckled color pattern consisting of black spots and brownish reticulations on a light yellow to brown background favoring soft bottomed habitats peppered maskray is a bottom dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans particularly caridean shrimp and polychaete worms it is viviparous with litter sizes of one to three females supply their developing young with histotroph uterine milk during gestation although peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters as a result international union for conservation of nature iucn has assessed it as least concern taxonomy and phylogeny once thought to be a color morph of painted maskray n peppered maskray was recognized as a distinct species based on molecular data collected for barcode of life project it was described by peter last and william white in a 2008 commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro publication their account was based on 13 specimens of these a female across caught off rockhampton queensland was designated as holotype specific epithet picta is derived from latin pictus painted or colored phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear dna has found that peppered and painted are sister species two are estimated to have diverged c 10 ma during miocene description peppered maskray has a thin diamond shaped pectoral fin disc roughly 1 2 times wider than long with slightly concave leading margins and narrowly rounded outer corners snout forms an obtuse angle and has a pointed tip small closely spaced eyes are followed by crescent shaped spiracles nostrils are elongated and have a skirt shaped curtain of skin between them posterior margin of curtain is fringed and forms two lobes small mouth is surrounded by papillae and bears prominent furrows at corners there are two papillae on floor of mouth teeth number 33 38 rows in upper jaw and 31 40 rows in lower teeth are small and vary from pointed to blunt five pairs of gill slits are s shaped pelvic fins are medium sized and triangular with angular corners whip like tail measures 1 0 1 3 times as long as disc and bears slender stinging spines on upper surface smaller rays usually have one sting larger rays two tail is moderately broad and flattened at base becoming very thin behind sting both upper and lower fin folds are present past sting with upper fold shorter than lower there are up to 22 small closely spaced thorns along midline of back behind spiracles otherwise skin is mostly smooth this species is light yellow to brown above with a darker reticulated pattern that may vary from faint to obvious all overlaid by numerous black spots like other neotrygon species there is a dark marking across eyes that resembles a mask tail has a pattern of saddles or bands behind sting tip is white and ventral fin fold darkens to almost black posteriorly underside is plain white this species reaches across distribution and habitat range of peppered maskray extends along coast of northeastern australia from at least wessel islands off northern territory to hervey bay in queensland western boundary of its range is uncertain it may also be found off new guinea though this is unconfirmed this species is extremely common in some areas such as gulf of carpentaria a benthic fish it is usually found on inner continental shelf in water less than deep but may occur down to it favors habitats with sandy or other fine substrate biology and ecology peppered maskray prefers to pick prey from surface of substrate as opposed to digging for them caridean shrimp are by far most important food source it also consumes polychaete worms and amphipods and rarely penaeid prawns molluscs and small bony fishes compared to smaller rays larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms reproduction in peppered maskray is viviparous like other stingrays developing embryos are initially nourished by yolk and later by histotroph uterine milk provided by mother mature females have a single functional ovary and uterus on left side females give birth to litters of one to three pups probably once per year newborns are across males and females reach sexual maturity at around across respectively maximum lifespan is at least 11 years for males and 18 years for females human interactions peppered maskray lacks economic value and is discarded by fisheries it is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls and due to its small size does not benefit from turtle exclusion devices in particular this species accounts for approximately 4 5 of total catch of northern prawn fishery npf in gulf of carpentaria over half of rays caught by npf including almost all males are fatally crushed within trawl despite this mortality npf is not believed to have negatively affected local population because its operational area does not include waters where this species is most abundant peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by queensland east coast trawl fishery elsewhere in its range fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices international union for conservation of nature iucn has listed this species under least concern because it remains common and its range includes several marine protected areas references category neotrygon category fish of australia category fish described in 2008
