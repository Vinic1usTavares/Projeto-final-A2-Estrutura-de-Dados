balch creek is a tributary of willamette river in u s state of oregon beginning at crest of tualatin mountains west hills creek flows generally east down a canyon along northwest cornell road in unincorporated multnomah county and through macleay park section of forest park a large municipal park in portland at lower end of park stream enters a pipe and remains underground until reaching river danford balch after whom creek is named settled a land claim along creek in mid 19th century after murdering his son in law he became first person legally hanged in oregon basalt mostly covered by silt in uplands and sediment in lowlands underlies balch creek watershed upper part of watershed includes private residential land audubon society of portland nature sanctuary and part of forest park mixed conifer forest of coast douglas fir western redcedar and western hemlock with a well developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is natural vegetation sixty two species of mammals and more than 112 species of birds use forest park a small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in stream which in 2005 was only major water body in portland that met state standards for bacteria temperature and dissolved oxygen although nature reserves cover much of upper and middle parts of watershed industrial sites dominate lower part historic guild s lake occupied part of lower watershed through 19th century and in 1905 city officials held lewis and clark centennial exposition there on an artificial island after exposition developers converted lake and its surrounds to industrial use and in 2001 portland city council declared site to be an industrial sanctuary course balch creek begins in forest park neighborhood in unincorporated multnomah county near intersection of northwest skyline boulevard and northwest thompson road at crest of west hills it flows generally east about to its confluence with willamette river a major tributary of columbia river creek drops from above sea level at its source to at its mouth a total of most of this occurs in first in hills stream gradient slope generally ranges from 15 to 30 percent interspersed with sections of less than 15 percent along middle reaches from its source creek runs east on private property near forest park a large municipal park in portland before turning briefly south about from mouth soon thereafter stream receives an unnamed tributary on right bank and turns southeast on private property along northwest cornell road it enters city and audubon society of portland simultaneously about from mouth receives two more unnamed tributaries on right and flows northeast entering part of forest park known as macleay park for about creek parallels wildwood trail main hiking trail in forest park until reaching a former public restroom known as stone house from here balch creek runs beside lower macleay trail another hiking trail for about near northwest thurman street roughly from mouth creek flows

of portland monitored flow of balch creek from june 1996 through september 2002 at a site node where stream leaves surface and enters a storm sewer in macleay park bes reported an average summer flow of a maximum of and a minimum of 0 average flow in winter was with a maximum of and a minimum of 0 measurements taken during an individual spring from mid may to mid july 2002 showed flow starting at about and dwindling to 0 by early june flow through june depended partly on weather highest flow occurred after a rain measurements taken during an individual autumn late august to late december 2001 were close to zero until november largest flows during that season occurred after many days of rain geology solidified lava from grande ronde members of columbia river basalt group underlies balch creek watershed about 16 million years ago during middle miocene columbia river ran through a lowland south of its modern channel eruptions from linear vents in eastern oregon and washington flowed down this channel through what later became willamette valley these flows some of which reached pacific ocean occurred between 16 5 and 15 6 million years ago and covered almost geologists have identified several basalt flows in west hills where they underlie steepest slopes of forest park and form columned rocks visible in parts of balch creek canyon wind deposited silts unstable when wet later covered most of lava stream bank instability and siltation are common and threat of landslides has discouraged urban development in hills between 19 000 and 15 000 years ago cataclysmic ice age events known as missoula floods or bretz floods originating in clark fork region of northern idaho inundated columbia river basin many times these floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment and created new floodplains in willamette valley from then until 19th century lower balch creek watershed consisted of swampy marshlands and shallow semi permanent lakes such as historic guild s lake final or so of historic balch creek flowed across this floodplain history names multnomah county is named for native americans who lived in area before settlement by non indigenous people in 19th century members of multnomah tribe of chinookan people lived on sauvie island in willamette river and on mainland across from island downstream from mouth of balch creek much of area near lower creek was swampy and was not favored by multnomah by 1830s diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced native population by up to 90 percent in lower columbia basin historic guild s lake in lower balch creek watershed near willamette river was named for peter guild pronounced guile one of first european american settlers in area in 1847 he acquired nearly of watershed through a donation land claim although variations in spelling of guild s lake occur in historic newspapers maps and other documents guild s lake has been preferred form since beginning of 20th century creek is named for danford balch who settled a donation land claim upstream of guild property in 1850 after a man from a neighboring family eloped with a balch daughter balch killed him with a shotgun on october 17 1859 at a public gallows he became first person to be hanged by state of oregon macleay park takes its name from donald macleay a portland merchant and real estate developer who acquired what had been balch property in 1897 he donated land for a park on condition that city provide transport to park for hospital patients and build paths wide enough for wheelchairs early water supply balch creek was one of portland s sources of drinking water in mid 19th century stephen coffin and caruthers two early portland entrepreneurs established first public water supply for city in 1857 by piping water from caruthers creek in southwest portland through round fir logs with holes bored in them in 1860s portland water company which had acquired existing business added water from balch creek to system it was piped to a wooden reservoir at alder and pacific streets water shortages and pollution led to a shift in water supply from sources within city to bull run river in cascade range it began supplying most of portland s drinking water in 1895 industry right thumb alt two trains head in opposite directions along tracks in a switching yard surrounded by warehouses two trains pass one another in rail yard in lower balch creek watershed yard near river terminals and freight terminals is part of guild s lake industrial sanctuary one of first industries in guild s lake area was a sawmill built in 1880s although large parts of land remained undeveloped until early 20th century lumber mills grain storage structures railroads and docks appeared along waterfront guild s lake rail yard built by northern pacific railway in 1880s became an important switching yard for trains in 1905 lewis and clark centennial exposition held on an artificial island in guild s lake helped spur growth in area after exposition ended developers filled lake and its surrounds with soil sluiced from parts of balch creek watershed in west hills above floodplain or dredged from willamette river civic leaders promoted guild s lake area as a good place for industry and by mid 1920s lake was gone usgs places historic guild s lake at coordinates at an elevation of above sea level between what later became northwest saint helens road and northwest yeon street slightly west of northwest 35th avenue in northwest industrial district of portland modern location derived by using google earth and gnis coordinates between 1890s and 1930s channel deepening in willamette river improved city s status as a deep water seaport as did completion in 1914 of a port terminal guild s lake close to highways as well as marine and rail terminals became most important industrial area in portland after world war ii chemical and petroleum processing and storage metals manufacturing and other large industries expanded in area in 2001 portland city council adopted guild s lake industrial sanctuary plan aimed at protecting area s long term economic viability as an industrial district watershed

consists of equal to about 27 percent is zoned for parks and other open space and about 20 percent is zoned for heavy industry near willamette river multnomah county has jurisdiction over about a quarter of watershed lands zoned for residential farms and forests occupy about 13 percent of total mostly along watershed s western edge a mixture of residential commercial and other designations make up smaller segments about 1 600 people lived in balch creek watershed in 2000 and about 6 700 people worked there nearby watersheds include those of other small streams flowing directly into willamette along east flank of west hills city refers to these as johnson nicolai subwatershed to southeast and kittredge and salzman to northwest rainfall in watershed from 1977 to 2002 averaged about per year about of total fell from november through april and about fell from may through october minor flooding has occurred near trash rack where creek enters a pipe and has caused occasional basement flooding along nearby streets city officials are studying rack design with a view to alterations by 2017 flora thumb right alt small vanilla colored flowers form shape of a cone around stem

environmental protection agency epa reverse side here historic lower balch creek watershed through 1880s was a mixture of open water wetlands grassland and forest while above flood plain watershed consisted of closed canopy forest people who settled here in 19th century logged much of this forest and filled wetlands in 2002 aerial photographs showed that buildings parking lots shoreline structures and other cleared areas covered most of lower floodplain on other hand hill forests protected from major disturbance covered about 65 percent of watershed above floodplain much of habitat in watershed consists of mixed conifer forest trees and shrubs including stands of red alder and cottonwood trees cover about 88 percent of middle reaches near headwaters forests consist mainly of mixed conifers and hardwoods with a few older douglas firs common species include big leaf maple willow western hemlock red alder western red cedar and douglas fir most of this forest is relatively young in forest park old growth forest undisturbed for 250 years or more exists mainly in isolated patches largest tree in park heritage tree 134 is a douglas fir near stone house it is high and trunk is in circumference forest park and other areas of watershed have an understory of well developed shrubs including ferns oregon grape vine maple salal red huckleberry fendler s indian plum and stinging nettle among prominent wildflowers are wild ginger hooker s fairy bells vanilla leaf evergreen violet and trillium rare or uncommon species include old conifers western wahoo shrubs and

bird has black and white plumage a long sharp beak and a spot of red plumage toward back of its head hairy woodpecker is one of many species of birds living in forest park historic creek likely supported diverse fish species including salmon after people filled wetlands and diverted lower stretch of creek into a pipe fish could no longer migrate to and from willamette river industrial parts of watershed have no remaining aquatic habitat but above pipe aquatic habitat remains relatively high and balch creek and its tributaries support a resident population of coastal cutthroat trout of up to about in 2005 balch creek was only major water body in portland that met state water quality standards for bacteria temperature and dissolved oxygen nearby tracts of habitat strongly affect wildlife in balch creek watershed this is especially true of forest park which extends into other watersheds to northwest birds and animals from these watersheds and from tualatin river valley coast range willamette river sauvie island columbia river and vancouver washington lowlands move in and out of park with relative ease sixty two mammal species including northern flying squirrel black tailed deer creeping vole bobcat coyote mazama pocket gopher little brown bat roosevelt elk and pacific jumping mouse use forest park blue grouse great horned owl hairy woodpecker bewick s wren orange crowned warbler osprey and hermit thrush are among 112 species of birds that frequent area amphibian species seen at audubon society pond include rough skinned newts pacific tree frogs and salamanders pressure from habitat loss pollution hunting and urban development has reduced or eliminated large predators such as wolves bears and wild cats and has led to increased numbers of small predators such as weasels and raccoons roads through watershed severely hamper movement of large animals invasive plant species such as english ivy have made habitat simpler and less supportive of native insects and salamanders and other amphibians that feed on them citizen groups such as no ivy league and friends of forest park have engaged in projects to remove ivy to plant native species and to widen and
